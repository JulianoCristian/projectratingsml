        IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the expected
results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20–25 percent of the Bank’s lending operations
through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or
complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank
management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the Government and other in-country stakeholders,
and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower for
review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been
sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their
project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is
available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s objectives are
consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,
Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is
consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved, or are
expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project
achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost
compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the Government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: Government performance and
implementing agency (ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the Poverty Reduction
Support Credits 3, 4, and 5 in Mozambique implemented between 2007 and 2009. These
operations were aimed at achieving better macroeconomic management and improved
governance and at removing constraints to development by enhancing the business
environment, improving infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

The first credit for US$70 million was approved on January 25, 2007. The second credit for
$60 million was approved on January 29, 2008, and the final credit for US$90 million was
approved on November 4, 2008. Each credit was disbursed as a single tranche at the time of
approval. The Government made no financial contribution to these operations.

This report was prepared by Lauren Kelly, Senior Evaluation Officer, IEG and Jack W. van
Holst Pellekaan (consultant). The findings are based on a desk review of documentation,

Summary
Background and Context. Soon after Mozambique’s independence from Portugal in 1975 a
civil war started that lasted 15 years, caused considerable damage to infrastructure in rural
areas, and decimated the national economy. A peace agreement in 1992 was followed in
1994 by the election of a representative Government, which turned its attention to
maintaining peace and stability and to promoting private sector development through the
removal of Government controls over economic activity. Following the formation of a stable
democratic Government, Mozambique’s economy, particularly the agricultural sector, started
to grow rapidly. These policies and their results attracted many donors, including the World
Bank, to support Mozambique’s development during the 1990s.

In 2001 the Government’s Poverty Assessment, Programa de Acção para a Redução da
Pobreza Absoluta (Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty) 2001–05—referred to
by its Portuguese acronym of PARPA—was released and endorsed by the Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. The PARPA provided a formal basis for the harmonization of
assistance programs among development partners and led three years later to the Bank’s first
two budget support credits in Mozambique. PARPA was followed by PARPA II for 2006-
2009, and Plano de Accao para Reducao da Probeza or PARP (Poverty Reduction Action
Plan) for 2011-2014.

Poverty Reduction Support Credits. The World Bank financed Poverty Reduction Support
Credits 1 and 2 in 2004 and 2005 (totaling $180 million) supported some of the objectives of
PARPA through assistance for enhanced public sector capacity and accountability and
measures to improve Mozambique’s investment climate. The outcomes for both operations
were rated satisfactory by IEG. Building on these achievements the Bank agreed to a request
from the Government to support a second series of three such credits in 2007. They were
Poverty Reduction Support Credits 3, 4, and 5 (PRSCs-3, 4, and 5), which provided
Mozambique with credits of $70 million in 2007, and of $60 million and $90 million early in
2008. All three operations provided general budget support and were disbursed in single
tranches. They are the focus of this Project Performance Assessment Report. Six more PRSC
operations with similar objectives were subsequently approved between 2009 and 2015,
totaling US$522 million. This assessment was conducted six years after project close. It was
carried out within the context of the entirety of the series, based on the long-term
commitment between the Bank and the Government that reforms in one period should be
sustained over time.

The objectives for PRSCs-3–5 were the same. They had a threefold focus: (a) on
macroeconomic management, by consolidating and deepening the institutional reforms for
better macroeconomic management; (b) on reforms in governance, by supporting
decentralization/ deconcentration to enhance public investments and service delivery at the
provincial and district levels, and by supporting public sector reform; and (c) on economic
development, by enhancing the business environment, reducing infrastructure constraints,
and promoting agricultural growth.

Relevance of Objectives. The program’s objectives were well aligned with the Bank’s
assistance and partnership strategies and were highly relevant to the challenges facing
Mozambique’s economy. They were complementary to the concurrent policy support
provided by the International Monetary Fund. They were also closely aligned with the
objectives of the PARPA II for 2006–09. The objectives, however, made no attempt to be
precise about poverty reduction. Rather, it was intended that poverty would be reduced
through economic growth and improved services at the provincial and district levels. The
objectives for PRSCs-3–5 were also relevant to and aligned with the priorities of
development partners who were also providing general budget support to the Government.

Relevance of Design. The design of the PRSCs-3–5 series was substantially relevant.
However there was an over-reliance on public financial management reforms to achieve the
broader macroeconomic objective, to the exclusion of indicators of macroeconomic stability.
Other activities, in relation to governance and economic were well aligned with the
associated objectives. However, the program’s design could have paid more attention at the
design stage to the urban/rural distribution of pro-poor expenditure from the national budget
as well as the quality of these expenditures

Efficacy. The efficacy of the first objective (macroeconomic management through
institutional reforms for better economic management) is rated modest. Macroeconomic
performance improved during the PRSCs-3-5 implementation period: for example there was
strong GDP growth of between 6 and 7 percent per annum, total public debt as a percent of
GDP was between 23 and 38 percent, and the current account balance of payments deficit
declined from around 20 percent of GDP to 12 percent. After PRSC-5 closed in 2009 GDP
growth was regularly about 7 percent, but other macroeconomic indicators deteriorated: for
example public debt increased to about 40 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2013, and then
to 57 and 74 per cent of GDP in 2014 and 2015. The current account balance of payments
deficit increased to around 40 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2013 but remained high at
30 and 33 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015. In addition, although the allocation of budget
resources to priority sectors was held close to the target of 65 percent during the PRSCs 3-5
period and thereafter, there was no information on the distribution of these funds to the
provinces or districts where the poor are located. In 2015 the Central Office for Combatting
Corruption questioned the security of the country’s electronic financial management system
(e-SISTAFE) and auditing continued to be weak. Moreover, the Government acknowledged
in April 2016 that it had guaranteed undisclosed borrowings of about $1 billion by state
enterprises which contravened the program of macroeconomic management agreed with the
IMF. The guarantee represented a serious contingent liability for the economy. The IMF
suspended disbursements from its support program to Mozambique.

Efficacy of the second objective (reforms in governance through supporting decentralization/
deconcentration to enhance public investments and service delivery at the provincial and
district levels, and by supporting public sector reform) is also rated modest. During the
implementation of PRSCs 3-5 the preparation of a National Program for Decentralized
Planning and Finance was not achieved, nor was an actuarial study for the investment
strategy for the National Institute for Social Security completed. Both of these activities
were prior actions for PRSC-5. There were consequently also weakness in aspects of
governance reform such as the modalities for deciding on budget allocations to provinces and
                                               xi


districts. Whereas this objective was aimed at enhancing public investments and service
delivery at provincial and district levels there was no information available at the end of the
series or since to assess the extent to which public investments and service delivery to
provinces and districts had been enhanced.

The third objective (economic development through improving the business environment,
removing constraints to growth, and promoting agricultural growth) is rated substantial. By
the end of the implementation of PRSCs-3–5 it had become easier to start a business
although the most recent PRSC series renewed efforts to improve the business environment,
and in subsequent years national infrastructure, which was a constraint to growth, had
improved. Growth in GDP from agriculture was between 5 and 6 percent per annum during
the three-year implementation period, although it dropped to about 3.5 percent per annum
between 2009 and 2014—still a sound and sustained performance given the sector’s
structural problems and the incidence of natural disasters.

Outcome. The program was highly relevant to Government and Bank development
objectives and its design was substantially relevant, although there was an over-reliance on
public financial management reforms to achieve the broader macroeconomic objective, to the
exclusion of indicators of macroeconomic stability. The efficacy of two out of three
objectives was modest. The outcome of this series of PRSCs is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.

While not rated, this assessment also considers the contribution of the PRSC 3-5 series to
poverty reduction. Overall, poverty is estimated to have declined from 56 percent in
2002/2003 to 52 percent in 2008/2009. There is also a high degree of regional differentiation,
with poverty decreasing in urban areas but increasing in the central rural regions, where the
poverty headcount is estimated to be 71.2 percent. Moreover, the total number of poor in
Mozambique is estimated to have increased by about 400,000 persons since 2002/2003.

Risk to Development Outcomes. Mozambique’s economy is fragile because its major real
sector (agriculture) continues to face structural, policy, and environmental constraints; and its
growing mineral exports are subject to unpredictable fluctuations in world prices. The impact
of a stagnant value of total exports of goods and services, along with a surge in the value of
imports and lower foreign exchange inflows since 2009, undermined the current account
balance of payments. At the same time total public debt increased rapidly to 74 percent of
GDP in 2015. An IMF Standby Credit Facility was approved in December 2015 to assist the
Government to address the balance of payments gap. However, as already noted,
disbursements from this facility were suspended in April 2016 following the discovery of
external borrowings guaranteed by the Government contrary to the agreement with the Fund.
Given the weakening macroeconomic indicators and governance as well as the
macroeconomic management issues that have emerged recently, the risk to the program’s
development outcomes is rated as significant.

Safeguards and Fiduciary Risks. PRSCs-3-5 did not trigger any action on environmental
risks. The only prior actions in the series that could possibly have had an impact on
Mozambique’s environment were the rehabilitation and construction of roads as well as the
rehabilitation and construction of 2,500 hectares of irrigation projects. This PPAR found that
                                               xii


adequate safeguard provisions were made to avoid any detrimental impacts on the
environment. The PRSCs were intended to reduce money metric poverty but evidence
indicates that only modest proportional reductions were achieved. Nevertheless, social
indicators improved at the national level during PRSCs-3–5. Despite an urban bias in some
social service expenditures, such as urban water supplies, rural social services could have
improved rural indicators to some extent. However, the translation of higher rural social
indicators into lower money metric rural poverty, and therefore a lower incidence of poverty,
will be slow.

Monitoring and Evaluation. The quality of monitoring and evaluation, in collaboration with
the Government and budget support donors, was consistent with the requirements for
development policy operations and implemented in a satisfactory manner. Monitoring and
evaluation is therefore rated as substantial.

Bank performance. The three PRSCs were based on extensive analytical work, and on
relevant objectives and prior actions that were aligned with Government and Bank strategic
objectives as well as those of development partners. However, two important prior actions
proved to be over ambitious. PRSC program documents identified risks to macroeconomic
management because of elections and other political pressures, macroeconomic shocks such
as natural disasters, deterioration of governance, institutional capacity issues, and rising
external debt because of non-concessional borrowing. However, the Bank misjudged the risk
that Government would not sustain sound macroeconomic management and good
governance. The Bank’s assessment of the external shocks likely to face Mozambique
during the implementation of PRSCs-3–5 focused mainly on the impact of the global
financial crisis and the earlier world price increases for food and fuel, while the risk of terms
of trade shocks was considered low. The program documents had inadequate provision for
training in macroeconomic management. Hence, overall, the program’s quality at entry was
rated moderately satisfactory. During the program’s implementation the Bank and the IMF
worked closely with the Government to reduce the financial risks to the economy of the large
mining projects and the terms of trade risks. The Bank also consulted regularly with the
general budget support donors as it monitored the progress of the program’s implementation.
On balance the Bank’s performance during supervision is rated satisfactory. On balance the
Bank’s performance was moderately satisfactory.

Borrower performance. The Government claimed ownership of the program because it
arguably took charge of meeting the prior conditions. But, as mentioned already,
decentralization policy was not established, serious questions emerged with respect to
implementation of a national financial management system (e-SISTAFE) because of
concerns about its security, budget allocations to provinces and districts were poorly
managed because of a lack of allocation criteria, and procurement standards and internal
auditing arrangements were weak. Also, because the Government had not diversified the
economy it placed too much reliance on the mining industry for its export income. The IMF
provided short-term support at the end of 2015 when the country’s external sector came
under pressure but, as already noted, shortly thereafter it was discovered that Mozambique
had seriously breached the IMF’s macroeconomic management conditions. This PPAR
concluded that after the PRSC-3–5 series closed, the Government did not sustain
                                             xiii


macroeconomic stability and governance deteriorated. Overall the Government’s
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons
   Carefully chosen objectives and prior actions for policy development operations
      can provide the basis for the necessary conditions for better macroeconomic
      policy, good governance, and sound economic development. In the short term a
      number of reforms can be achieved either because of or in the wake of prior actions.
      For example the Central Revenue Authority was established in 2007 (a prior action
      for PRSC-4). Since then it received support from the Government of Switzerland (a
      member of the donor group providing general budget support) and performed well,
      raising tax collection from 15.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 27.3 percent in 2014.

      Policy development operations can reduce poverty by increasing growth and
       improving institutions that have responsibilities for poverty reduction, but that
       focus was not sufficient for significant poverty reduction in Mozambique. For
       example, GDP growth was sustained at between 6 and 7 percent per annum, prior
       actions requiring the Government to allocate at least 65 percent of its annual budget
       to priority sectors maintained the capacity of ministries that had a responsibility for
       delivering social services to the poor, and a number of social indicators was well
       maintained. However, the incidence of money metric poverty was reduced by only 4
       percentage points over six years from a high poverty incidence of 56 percent in
       2002/2003 to 52 percent in 2008/2009.

      Development policy operations that use general budget support as the
       instrument for providing assistance can also be appropriate vehicles for the
       harmonization of donor strategic assistance. The Performance Assessment
       Framework agreed between the Government and general budget support development
       partners, if well crafted, can be the basis for fruitful cooperation among these
       partners. The downside risk is the possible constraint on the Bank’s flexibility with
       respect to prior actions outside the Performance Assessment Framework. For
       example, the Bank needed to negotiate with general budget support donors to obtain
       their agreement to include additional actions on food security in PRSC-5 that were
       outside the Performance Assessment Framework.

      The political economy context can have critical impacts on the achievement of
       policy reform. Understanding the political economy context for reforms in policy is
       critical to assessing the likelihood that reforms will take place. For example, a
       National Program for Decentralized Planning and Finance was to have been achieved
       as a prior action for PRSC-5. However, the political barriers to achieving internal
       agreement on a national plan for decentralized planning and finance were seriously
       underestimated and a plan was not approved by the Government during the PRSC 3-5
       series.

1. Background and Context
1.1    This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the outcome and
sustainability of a World Bank-financed series of three Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs-3, 4, and 5) in Mozambique that had the same objectives and were implemented
between 2007 and 2010. These PRSCs provided general budget support to the Government
of Mozambique in support of a number of policy actions it had already adopted. The funds
provided for the three PRSCs— $70 million, $60 million, and $90 million for a total of $220
million—were disbursed as scheduled.

1.2    The outcomes of a series of development policy operations cannot validly be assessed
immediately after closure because they were intended to promote institutional reforms that
would be sustained over time, to achieve better macroeconomic management, improve
governance, and remove key obstacles to economic development that would, in turn, lead to
sustained growth and poverty reduction. The six PRSCs that followed PRSCs 3, 4 and 5 had
the same or similar objectives. This assessment was conducted six years after project close. It
was carried out within the context of the entirety of the series, based on the long-term
commitment between the Bank and the Government that reforms in one period should be
sustained over time.

Geography and Politics

1.3     Considerable resources provide a basis for growth. Mozambique has an area of about
800,000 square kilometers, which is close to the size of Pakistan, and yet, it has only 12
percent of Pakistan’s population (23 million compared with 192 million). Pakistan has
substantial mountainous areas in an earthquake zone with significant climatic variations, few
mineral resources, a vast agricultural base, but a limited coast line. In contrast, Mozambique
(which also experiences many natural disasters) has more than 2,500 kilometers of coastline
with three deep water seaports and is endowed with considerable arable land, water, energy,
natural gas, and mineral resources. Similar to Pakistan, Mozambique is strategically located,
bordering six countries, four of which are landlocked and hence dependent on Mozambique
as a conduit to global markets. With relatively rapid population growth— last measured at
2.8 percent per annum in 2008—the Government faces the challenge of creating employment
opportunities for a fast growing and young labor force. Economic growth has been and
continues to be a core objective for the Government to address this challenge.

1.4 Postwar democratic Government established. Following its independence from
Portugal in June 1975, Mozambique endured a protracted 15-year armed conflict, fueled
largely by regional powers and Cold War politics, leaving the country and its economy in
ruins. Mozambique began a slow but successful transition to peace, political stability, and a
democratic Government with an election two years after the formal peace agreement in
October 1992. In this first election, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo)
edged out its civil war rival, the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo). Frelimo has
remained in power winning the fourth presidential and parliamentary elections in 2009 by
70 percent of the popular vote (an increase from the 60 percent achieved in the 2004
elections). As a result of elections in 2014 Frelimo has a two-thirds majority in the national
                                                              2


    parliament, 80 percent of the seats in the provincial assemblies, and majorities in all elected
    municipal assemblies.

    Macroeconomic Context

    1.5 The civil war resulted in extreme destruction to Mozambique’s economy. The civil
    war created considerable havoc in rural areas where some of the fiercest fighting took place.
    In addition, national infrastructure such as roads and railways deteriorated because
    maintenance programs were not implemented. Following the peace agreement in 1992, and
    subsequent formation of a stable Government in 1994, Mozambique’s economy as a whole
    started to grow and develop rapidly. The changes in the broad structure of the country’s
    economy from about the time the civil war ended to 2014 are summarized in Table 1.1 and
    presented in more detail in figure 1.1. The table shows that since 2000–04 the relative
    importance of agriculture in the economy has remained about the same, while the relative
    importance of manufacturing declined in contrast to a substantial increase in industries that
    was due to the rapid growth in mineral processing and mining.

a. Some totals do not add up to 100 percent because of rounding. b. Includes extractive industries.

    1.6 Between 1994 and 2004, Mozambique’s total gross domestic product (GDP) grew by
    8 percent annually, albeit from a very low base. During this period the official national
    poverty headcount index declined from 69 percent in 1996/97 to 54 percent in 2002/03. The
    conditions for substantial income growth and the poverty reduction were created by the
    introduction of more progressive Government economic policies, as well as the
    Government’s success in maintaining national peace and stability. However, despite an
    average national growth rate of GDP of 8 percent between 2003 and 2009, the incidence of
    poverty fell, according to the Government, to only 54.7 percent in 2009 (Republic of
    Mozambique 2011, Table 1, page 6).1

1.7     Growth in many sectors, but subsistence farming still dominant The sectors that
contributed most to economic growth between 1996/97 and 2002/03 were agriculture,
transport, communications, infrastructure (notably roads), mineral processing, and mining. In
the agricultural sector, where about 70 percent of the nation’s labor force is employed, the
Government’s policy reforms led to a departure from the collectivization of agricultural


1
 Subsequent analysis of the same data by the World Bank led to an estimate of 52 percent. This
analysis will be discussed later in this report.
                                                                                                  3


production, and the post conflict resettlement of refugees in the rural areas to a market-based
economy. The resulting expansion in the availability of land and labor resulted in a rapid
increase in areas harvested, which caused agricultural production to grow by an average 6.8
percent per year from 1992 to 1997, and an average of 4.6 percent per year between 1997 and
2003. These developments led to poverty reduction in rural areas such as Zambezia province
during those years.2 However, marketing of surpluses is extremely difficult because the lack
of all-weather rural roads increases transport costs and product prices that are not
remunerative. Consequently the relative importance of the agricultural sector remains about
the same as a decade ago and most farming households remain trapped in subsistence
agriculture.

1.8     Growth in extractive and other industries started in 2000. An increasingly important
driving force for Mozambique’s economy since the start of the new millennium was capital-
intensive mineral processing and mining of coal and natural gas. The first major investment

  According to the Government’s analysis the incidence of poverty in Zambezia declined from 68.1 percent
to 44. 6 percent between 1996/97 and 2002/03. An analysis of the same data by the World Bank concluded that
the incidence of poverty in the very similar Sofala and Zambezia rural areas was 64.28 percent in 2002/03 (see
Appendix B, Table B6).
                                               4


was the MOZAL aluminum smelter project commissioned in 2000, which increased its
capacity between 2002 and 2004. These and other developments in mining provided strong
confidence within the Government and the donor community that Mozambique’s balance of
payments problems were only temporary. There was also considerable development and
modernization in other nonagricultural sectors. For example, urban water supply
infrastructure was improved with Bank assistance in cities and towns along the coast. The
telecommunications sector was liberalized with technical support from the Bank, as was the
commercial air transport industry. In general, capital-intensive mineral processing and
mining development and the growth of water, telecommunications, and air transport service
industries in the urbanized coastal cities and towns left the remote agricultural areas behind.

1.9 First and Second Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC-1 and PRSC-2).
Following the successful transition from civil war to democratic Government, significant
economic growth and poverty reduction, the Government, with Bank support, implemented
two single tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs-1 and 2) in 2004 and 2005
for, respectively, $60 million and $120 million. The program objectives for both credits
were (a) building public sector capacity and accountability, (b) improving the investment
climate, and (c) expanding service delivery in the education sector. This PRSC series was
designed to be in line with the Government’s first poverty assessment (PARPA), which had
poverty reduction as its core objective. The Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS) in
2004 was also closely aligned with the PARPA, and consistent with the assistance strategies
of most major donors operating in the country. Moreover, the PRSC series benefited from
very close cooperation with the IMF, including in the area of tracking public expenditures in
the context of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.

1.10 Referring to PRSCs-1 and 2, the program document for PRSC-3 stated that “Over the
five years of its implementation there was consistent economic growth, averaging 8 percent
per annum and a major reduction in poverty, by 15.3 percentage points between 1996 and
2003. The number of children in primary school almost doubled from approximately 2
million to 4 million in the PARPA period. Maternal mortality was reduced from an
estimated 1,000 per 100,000 live births in the early 1990s to 408 per 100,000 live births in
2003. Under-5 mortality rates decreased from 219 to 178 per 1,000 live births. Infant
mortality decreased from 147 to 124 per 1,000 live births. The capacity of the health system
was expanded to start providing free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV infection.” The
PPAR for these two credits concluded that overall progress on reforms during the PRSC-1
and 2 series was satisfactory, and that the Government demonstrated a commitment to
continuing the reform agenda after the programs closed (IEG 2009).

1.11 Challenges facing economic and social development remained. Despite the
achievements listed above, Mozambique’s economic and social indicators were generally
lower than averages for Sub-Saharan Africa. In the course of reviewing the achievements of
PRSCs-1 and 2 the program document for PRSC-3 stated that, “While significant progress
was made justifying an overall positive assessment, it has to be kept in mind that many
challenges remain, that capacity is still weak, and that some reforms were implemented more
slowly than originally envisaged. Reforms in strengthening public financial management
made impressive progress and key pieces of legislation were adopted improving the
                                                    5


investment climate; but public sector and judiciary reforms were slower than expected with
the exception of decentralization” (World Bank 2006, paragraph 44).

1.12 In 2005 Mozambique was still poor by many measures. Average annual per capita
income was $130, the average number of years of formal schooling for persons aged 15 and
above was 1.2 years (1.7 for men and 0.8 for women), the average adult literacy rate was 47
percent (57 percent for men and 29 percent for women), and the average life expectancy at
birth of 42 years. Malaria accounted for 35 percent of deaths for children younger than five
years of age, and there was a very serious HIV/AIDs problem.

1.13 The next three PRSCs built on the reforms already achieved and on the Bank’s
analytical work between FY04 and FY07. They addressed three objectives: better
macroeconomic management, reform in governance, and economic development.

2. Objectives, Design, and Relevance
2.1     Program Objectives. The program document for PRSC-3 stated that the aim of the
series of PRSCs-3–5 was to support the implementation of PARPA II, which had the
reduction of absolute poverty as its main objective. This objective was to be achieved by
actions under three priorities or pillars: governance, human capital development, and
economic development (World Bank 2006, paragraph 64). The Bank’s focus was on a subset
of these same pillars in the Government’s Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
agreed with its development partners, which was also a subset of PARPA II’s strategic
matrix. Key reforms in public financial management were addressed in the text of PARPA II
partly under the pillar of governance, and partly under the pillar of economic development.
The program documents for each of PRSCs-3–5 stated that the series was designed to support
the following (World Bank 2006, paragraph 64):

(1)     Macroeconomic management- by consolidating and deepening the institutional
reforms in this area.
(2)     Reforms in governance - by supporting decentralization/deconcentration to enhance
public investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and by supporting
public sector reform.
(3)     Economic development - by improving the business environment, removing
constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

2.2    The program document for PRSC-3 did not define program objectives; rather it
defined areas to support. However, when the program documents for PRSCs-4 and 5 were
prepared, the “support” areas were redefined as objectives. For the purpose of this
assessment, therefore, these three support areas represent the program objectives for the
PRSC-3–5 series.3 The objectives were not revised during implementation of the program.



3
 The objectives for PRSCs 6–8 series were (i) macroeconomic management; and (ii) economic
development but not governance. The objectives for PRSCs 9–11 series were: (i) improve the
business climate and to increase transparency in extractive industries; (ii) strengthen social protection;
                                                  6


The meanings of “better” macroeconomic management, “improved” governance, and
“economic development” were not defined other than by the listing of sub-objectives shown
in paragraph 2.1.

Relevance of Program Objectives

2.3      Despite the harmonization of the PRSCs-3–5 program’s objectives with PARPA II’s
objective “to reduce the incidence of poverty from 54 percent in 2003 to 45 percent in 2009,”
(Republic of Mozambique 2006, paragraph 1) there was no explicit mention of the aim to
reduce poverty in the objectives for PRSCs-3–5. While this appears to be a shortcoming in
the statement of objectives of the three-year macroeconomic, governance, and economic
development program, the national and provincial levels represented a collection of proposed
achievements that were expected to reduce money metric and non-money metric poverty,
including increased access to social services. Support for poverty reduction was therefore the
critical underlying motivation for this PRSC series but no specifics regarding the extent of
poverty reduction were stated in the objectives.

2.4     The program’s objectives were highly relevant to the Government’s First Five Year
Programme (2005–09) and to the Bank’s country assistance strategy (CAS) for FYs04–07.
The Government’s development program was aimed at the reduction of absolute poverty. It
was closely aligned with PARPA II (adopted in 2006) which focused on human development
(education, health and access to potable water), governance, economic development and
cross cutting issues such as HIV/AIDS and gender. With respect to the Bank’s CAS (World
Bank 2003), pillar 1 was aimed at assisting the Government with its macroeconomic
management and economic development to achieve sustained GDP growth and to reduce
income poverty through improving the investment climate and facilitating public-private
partnerships in infrastructure. Pillar 2 addressed expanding service delivery. It focused on the
need to improve human development (Millennium Development Goals - MDGs), which were
key to improving quality of life, as well as enhancing labor productivity and therefore
income growth and poverty reduction. Pillar 3 addressed capacity building and
accountability—governance. The Bank intended to assist the Government to improve its
governance by upgrading public expenditure management and containing corruption through
strengthening the rule of law, including systems supporting contract enforcement, and to
enhance the Government’s monitoring and evaluation capacity.

2.5     The program objectives were highly relevant to the Bank’s country partnership
strategy (CPS) for FYs08-11. The Bank’s CPS when the project closed emphasized that the
strategy’s objectives and outcomes took into account PARPA II, the PAF, the Millennium
Development Goals, Paris Declaration indicators, IDA-14 requirements, the World Bank
Group’s Africa Action Plan, and the programs and priorities of other development partners
that provided general budget support (World Bank 2007a, pages 78-92). Pillar 1 of the CPS
focused on increased accountability and public voice, which mainly covered the
strengthening of public financial management systems. Pillar 2 provided for improved


and (iii) strengthen public financial management by enhancing effectiveness of internal audit,
developing a public investment management process, and improving public debt management.
                                              7


Government effectiveness in the provision of services and the achievement of five service
delivery outcomes— treatment for HIV/AIDS, health service delivery focused on child and
maternal health care, improved access to and quality of higher education, expanding access
to urban water supplies, and establishing institutions for improved water supplies in rural
areas—and finally, sustainable solar energy systems for schools, clinics, and administrative
posts in rural areas. Pillar 3 focused on enabling international and local investments and
strengthening economic growth potential. The CPS was intended to “support second
generation reforms and the removal of binding constraints to growth by financing
investments in infrastructure, rural development, business climate, and regional integration”
(World Bank 2007a, paragraph 86). Such investments would help lay the foundation for
sustainable and broad-based growth; deepening and broadening the private sector would
create jobs and generate significant resources for national development. In summary the
objectives for PRSCs-3–5 remained relevant to the strategic priorities of the Bank’s CPS for
FYs08–11.

2.6     Relevance to country economic conditions and the IMF program. The program
document for PRSC-3 noted that GDP growth was projected to be 7.9 percent in 2006, and
was expected to remain around 7 percent in the subsequent three years. It also stated that the
leading sector in the economy would be agriculture, followed by construction, and wholesale
and retail trade. Inflation through to November 2006 was 7.2 percent. Inflation was expected
to remain in the single digit throughout the program period ending in 2009 assuming an
average increase in revenue of 0.5 percent of GDP per year. Apart from improved revenue
mobilization, some of the factors contributing to a positive macroeconomic outlook included
the adoption of conservative fiscal policies, no external borrowing on commercial terms,
minimal subsidies to the productive sectors, and targeting about two-thirds of public
expenditures to priority sectors for poverty reduction (World Bank 2006, paragraph 16). The
program was also relevant to the ongoing IMF support program when the PRSCs closed in
October 2009.

2.7     Rural development was an important part of the PRSC 3-5 program and relevant to
poverty reduction. The Bank and the Government understood that rural development was a
necessary and important complement to Mozambique’s large extractive mining and
processing exporting industries because they were not labor-intensive investments once
completed. PRSCs-3–5 aimed to generate jobs and poverty reduction by focusing on
enhanced rural development through decentralization, improved conditions for road traffic,
as well as enhanced irrigation infrastructure and support services (extension) for increased
productivity in agriculture.

2.8     Overall, important macroeconomic, governance, and economic development issues
needed to be addressed in Mozambique. At the same time, there was a return to peace, a
democratic Government, and a newly elected Government that was supportive of all aspects
of the reform program. Government policy was explicitly focused on improving the
efficiency of the agricultural sector and providing an enabling environment for the
development of mineral processing and mining industries. Given the optimism regarding
considerable export income anticipated from future exports of extractive resources, the
political and financial risks of the PRSC program were considered to be low. In summary the
relevance of the PRSC program objectives was high.

Relevance of Program Design

2.9     This section addresses three design issues: (a) were the three annual programs
providing general budget support relevant instruments to address the challenges facing the
Mozambique economy; (b) was the program’s policy matrix and results framework clear in
terms of representing the results chain to the program’s outcomes; and (c) were the prior
actions, and triggers that in most cases led to prior actions, embodied in the framework for
each of the PRSC operations appropriate.

2.10 General budget support was a relevant instrument. General budget support under
PRSCs-3–5 was a way of reducing the administrative burden of large volumes of external
project financing by transferring ownership of investment decisions to the Government
authorities in Mozambique and away from multi- and bilateral donors. At the same time the
context for the general budget instrument support is an agreement between the program aid
partners and the Government on the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) which
provided a tool to monitor the Government’s implementation of general budget support by
development partners including the Bank.

2.11 A European Commission evaluation of general budget support provided by a range of
other donors in Mozambique between 2005 and 2012 concluded that: “our assessment of the
Government Poverty Assessment Framework (PAF) is that it fulfils its intended purpose
reasonably effectively and compares well with the PAFs used in other budget support
recipient countries. In stating this, we acknowledge that all indicator-based assessments of
public sector performance have at least two inherent limitations. Firstly, they must focus on
what is measureable, which is not always the same as what is important, and, secondly, the
adoption of indicators as policy targets almost inevitably creates perverse incentives in the
collection and reporting of data and/or in the process of policy implementation. Indicator-
based assessments—such as PAFs—should therefore be used as an overall guide to progress
and should not be the sole method of assessment” (European Commission 2014a, paragraph
95).4

2.12 The same evaluation also concluded that “the framework of mutual accountability
incorporated within the PAF has been highlighted as one of the most important gains in the
relationship with development partners. Government officials were unanimous in stressing
the importance of this mutual commitment to enhance ownership and to create a balanced
relationship in the budget support dialogue. Moreover, Mozambique has become an
international reference point for this mutual accountability framework” (European
Commission 2014a, paragraph 81).

2.13 The program was based on a logical policy matrix and results framework. The
program documents for PRSCs-3– 5 presented successive results frameworks based on the



4
 This assessment was based on five propositions; briefly they were that the PAF is closely aligned to
poverty reduction, choice of indicators is strategic, the number of PAF indicators was reduced from
54 to 35, indicators are for the most part measurable, and the level of ambition for the indicators looks
broadly right (see paragraph 94).
                                                   9


Government’s commitments to prior policy actions before each of the three programs could
be approved by the Bank’s Board. The causal relations between the prior actions and the
medium-term project objectives were apparent in the results framework, although it was not
always clear which institutions were responsible for the achievement of various medium-
term objectives. Nevertheless, the frameworks provided logical results chains from one
PRSC to the next in that there was a clear relationship between prior actions in successive
PRSCs even though for some chains of actions there were delays compared with the policy
matrix as originally framed for the three-year program in PRSC-3. The intermediate indicators
were kept roughly unchanged over the three operations in the series.

2.14 The Government and the Bank agreed to some adjustments in the content and
sequence of the triggers defined in PRSC-3 when deciding on the prior actions in the
Financing Agreements for PRSCs-4 and 5. The flexibility in the approach to the triggers and
their conversion to prior actions for the release of funds from these PRSCs facilitated the
dialogue between the Government and the Bank. However this flexibility should not have
included adjustment of prior actions in the light of the evolving circumstances and the
understanding of technical and policy issues. Despite the adjustments made, to a very large
extent, the reform program that had originally been agreed to in the context of PRSC-3 was
pursued as prior actions in the successive PRSCs.

2.15 The prior actions for PRSCs-3–5 were substantially relevant to the three program
objectives, with the exception of the actions associated with the macroeconomic management
objective. For these there was an over-reliance on public financial management reforms to
achieve the broader macroeconomic objective, to the exclusion of indicators of
macroeconomic stability. Appendix table B.2 presents the final agreed prior actions in the
three Financing Agreements for PRSCs-3–5.5 The prior actions were a subset of actions in
the much more comprehensive PAF framework agreed between the Government and general
budget support donors.

2.16 This PPAR assesses the relevance of the prior actions required for the program’s
three objectives in the following paragraphs. It concludes that overall the prior actions in the
Financing Agreements were substantially relevant to the objectives of better macroeconomic
management, improved governance, and economic development. Where the prior actions are
repeated in successive PRSCs (with some adjustments on coverage such as for different
ministries) they are considered as one prior action in the following assessment of their
relevance to the program objectives.

(a)     Relevance of Prior Actions to Better Macroeconomic Management

2.17 As designed, was an over-reliance on public financial management reforms to achieve
the broader macroeconomic objective, to the exclusion of indicators of macroeconomic

  Note that the project document for PRSC-3 included the prior actions for that credit and also listed
the anticipated prior actions (called “triggers”) for PRSCs 4 and 5 (see Appendix Table B.1). Later
the triggers, amended or replaced, became the prior actions in the Financing Agreements that the
Government had met to become eligible for each of those two subsequent credits.
                                                 10


stability. Acknowledging this shortcoming, the following prior actions embody substantial
contributions to the program objective:

   (i)        The share of the central Government budget’s actual expenditures for 2005
              and budgeted expenditures for 2007 and 2008 on PARPA priority sectors
              accounted for 65 percent of the total.

             Priority sectors included education, health, infrastructure, agriculture and rural
              development, social action, governance, and labor and employment. Increases in
              priority sectors were intended to make resources available for the improvement of
              the welfare of the poor and hence this prior action, which was required for all
              PRSCs in the series, was an important and substantially relevant contribution to
              better macroeconomic management.

   (ii)       Rollout of basic functionality of the integrated electronic financial
              management system (e-SISTAFE) to all ministries

             e-SISTAFE was potentially a major and substantially relevant contribution toward
              establishing an efficient financial management system within the central
              Government and for the transfer funds from the central Government to provinces
              and districts to effectively fund decentralized priority services and thereby
              contribute to better macroeconomic management.

   (iii)      Creation of the Central Revenue Authority

             The Government undertook to reform the collection of tax revenues by
              establishing the Central Revenue Authority in 2007. This was an important and
              substantially relevant step toward increasing tax collections, reducing the annual
              budget deficit, and enhancing macroeconomic management.

   (iv)       Increased budget coverage with enlarged Government revenues included in
              the 2007 budget, particularly the own revenues of seven major ministries

             The purpose of this action was to bring the revenues of central Government
              ministries into the consolidated revenue account and thereby take control over the
              allocation and management of all revenues in one budget. This was substantially
              relevant to better macroeconomic and sectoral management.

   (v)        Continuing the staffing and implementation of a new procurement system at
              the national and local levels; in PRSC-3 and as introduced in PRSC-4

             This was an important measure for improving the efficiency of the Government’s
              procurement system, which, according to the Bank’s Public Expenditure and
              Financial Accountability (PEFA) reports, had been below international standards;
              thereby making the most efficient use of financial resources was substantially
              relevant to better macroeconomic management.
                                                  11


   (vi)       Improving internal and external accountability controls in the central
              Government and in through audits in at least 20 percent of districts and
              municipalities

             According to the Bank’s PEFA reports, audits had been either delayed or not
              performed by Government entities. The purpose of the improved accountability
              controls was to increase the coverage and quality of audits at the local level because a
              sound decentralized auditing system was necessary for the effective management
              of the Government’s resources and hence substantially relevant to better
              macroeconomic management.

   (vii)      Issue of relevant opinion on at least 70 financial audits by the Court of
              Accounts.

             The Court had a very low effectiveness and hence the object of this prior action was
              to improve Mozambique’s external audit institution (Court of Accounts) and to
              enhance its capacity to issue timely opinions on a larger number of financial audit
              reports each year and thereby achieve better macroeconomic management.

   (viii)     Ministry of Finance ensured that at least 25 percent of central and provincial
              level Government bodies have operational internal audit units

             This was a necessary, if inadequate, requirement for the improvement of audit
              coverage throughout Mozambique’s Government. It was nevertheless substantially
              relevant to improving accountability for public expenditures.

 (b)      Relevance of Prior Actions to Improved Governance

2.18 PARPA II laid out a broad and ambitious agenda for governance reform. It focused
on decentralization, public administration, the judiciary, and anticorruption measures. These
actions were to be complemented by increasing popular participation at the local level, with
the district as the key unit for service delivery. The focus of the prior actions in the PRSCs
was on these issues:

   (i)        Definition of criteria for the allocation of investment budgets for districts in
              the 2007 budget

             The Government’s PARPA II included a plan to accelerate decentralization to
              improve the quality of service delivery and empower communities to decide more
              about the investment programs in their districts. For this to have been successful
              the National Program for Decentralized Planning and Finance (NPDPF) at the
              district level was to have been established to provide equitable budget allocations
              to the provinces and the provinces. This action was agreed on the basis that the
              National Decentralization Strategy (already foreshadowed in 2006) would be
              available and that criteria would be established for the allocation of budgets to
              districts. This prior action, while substantially relevant to the objective of
              improved governance, was found not to be relevant to the political context in
              Mozambique at the time.
                                                    12



      (ii)       The Ministry of Civil Service has completed the census of Government civil
                 servants and the Ministry of Finance has developed an e-SISTAFE-
                 compatible payroll database for civil servants

                As the program document for PRSC-4 stated, the census allowed the creation of
                 the register of civil servants (a prior action for PRSC-5). This register was an
                 integrated database that allowed the development and implementation of strategic
                 management of human resources, including the payroll. The e-SISTAFE-
                 compatible payroll module and database had already been developed in mid-2007,
                 so that the Ministry of Finance could pay salaries through e-SISTAFE. Salary
                 payments using the new integrated payroll management system were expected to
                 start in early 2008. This reform, which would have also assisted the Government
                 to eliminate “ghost workers,” was substantially relevant to improved governance
                 (World Bank 2007b, paragraph 70).

      (iii)      The Ministry of Planning and Development has approved the National
                 Program for Decentralized Planning and Finance (NPDPF)

                PARPA II and this PRSC series focused on decentralization because of its
                 importance for effective governance of public investments and service delivery at
                 the provincial and district levels. This prior action had been proposed for PRSC-4
                 but the NPDPF was delayed. Hence it became a prior action for PRSC-5, which
                 was substantially relevant to improved governance.

      (iv)       The Ministry of Civil Service has created a single registry of state officials
                 and civil servants

                There was no integrated database on personnel that would allow the development
                 and implementation of a human resources management strategy. This prior action
                 was therefore important for achieving sound human resource management and an
                 enhanced institutional capacity to deliver public services. Hence this prior action
                 was substantially relevant to improved governance.

      (v)        The National Institute for Social Security has completed an actuarial study
                 for the elaboration of its investment strategy

                The actuarial study was aimed at assessing the financial sustainability of the
                 national pension system and any quasi fiscal liabilities, and to identify any
                 required adjustment to the level of contributions required to cover the services
                 provided by the system. The actuarial study was also critical for the design of a
                 new investment strategy in 2008 and to ensure the adoption of best practices in
                 the management of its funds. A sound investment strategy would contribute to
                 strengthening the long-term financial stability of the social security system and
                 was therefore substantially relevant to improved governance.

(c)          Relevance of Prior Actions to Economic Development
                                                  13



2.19 In the area of economic development, the program document for PRSC-4 stated that
“Accelerating shared growth requires improvements in the climate for private sector
development, adequate infrastructure, improved smallholder productivity, and tackling key
challenges such as the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the need to improve
significantly the management of natural resources” (World Bank 2007b, paragraph 73).
PRSCs-3–5 addressed only some of these issues as prior actions:

   (i)        Simplification of business procedures to open a business through publication
              of company registration, including on the Government’s official website

             A private sector–led growth strategy calls for a strengthening of the business
              environment. Improving the business environment (reducing the number of days to
              open a business) had always been a priority for the Government to attract foreign
              investment and generate economic development and growth. This prior action to
              simplify procedures to open a business was therefore substantially relevant to
              stimulating economic development.

   (ii)       The National Roads Administration has rehabilitated and maintained
              Mozambique’s national classified roads network to ensure that at least 71
              percent of the roads network is in good or fair condition

             The Government correctly perceived that shortcomings in the nation’s
              infrastructure were constraints to growth. To address this problem PRSC-4
              focused on road improvements including rural roads. Despite the fact that this
              prior action was vague in its definition of the quality of roads, its basic thrust was
              substantially relevant to stimulating economic development.

   (iii)      The Ministry of Agriculture has constructed and rehabilitated at least 2,500
              hectares of irrigated areas in Mozambique

             The emphasis here was to extend the country’s irrigated areas focusing on an
              appropriate policy framework to increase water storage and distribution, and to
              strengthen beneficiary organizations. This prior action was substantially relevant to
              stimulating economic development.

   (iv)       The Ministry of Agriculture has increased access to technologies and
              extension information to at least 21 percent of farmers in Mozambique

             This action replaced a prior action for PRSC-4 that required reporting on the
              access of farmers to new technologies, but abandoned because it could not be
              measured annually. This alternative prior action introduced in PRSC-5 was
              measurable each year and relevant to the Government’s objective of increasing
              productivity in the agricultural sector to combat food insecurity and generate
              growth in the agricultural sector, thereby stimulating economic development.
                                               14


3. Implementation
3.1     The series of three operations was implemented over three years. Disbursements were
made in the first quarter of the budget year being supported, except for PRSC-5, which was
disbursed at the end of the preceding budget year in response to the Government‘s request to
accelerate the disbursement to assist it to cope with the impact of the global food and fuel
prices crisis. There were no changes to the closing dates for any of the PRSCs in the series.

3.2     This disbursement performance was achieved despite a suspension of budget support
disbursements in late 2009 by bilateral donors. The suspension reflected the donors’ concerns
about the Government’s inaction on accusations of fraud during the recent elections. The
donors requested the Government to take action on electoral reform, corruption, and conflicts
of interest, as well as on the growing role and influence of the governing Frelimo party on
private sector development. The Bank did not align itself with these donors and it maintained
its disbursement schedule for PRSC-5. The bilateral donors concerned eventually resumed
their general budget support programs but the suspension had a lasting negative impact on
their interest in general budget support and the size of their contribution.

3.3    Implementation of the PRSC series followed compliance with the prior actions before
Board approval for PRSC-3. Subsequent tranches for the program series were based on
compliance with additional prior actions (typically foreshadowed as “triggers” in the
program document for PRSC-3) in two separate Financing Agreements for PRSCs-4 and 5.

3.4      Despite some delays in Government actions on governance, investment climate, and
decentralization, there was compliance with the prior actions before World Bank Board approval
of the three credits and the reform program continued to be on track with a clear focus on the
three areas in the program’s objectives: macroeconomic management, governance reforms, and a
better investment climate.6 When delays occurred the Government took corrective actions. Joint
monitoring with the Group of 19 general budget support donors (G-19) made the implementation
of the program and the policy dialogue more effective.7 However, in the event prior actions on
decentralization and an actuarial study for the National Institute for Social Security were not
implemented.

3.5     Appendix table B.3 presents a summary of the prior actions for each of the three PRSC
operations as well as how they were implemented— namely whether they were implemented on
time with or without modification, delayed with or without modification, or dropped.




6
  These delays were mentioned in the Joint Annual and Mid-Term Reviews of April and September
2007/2008/2009 and the IMF’s Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) review of June 2007, and
the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI) reviews of June 2008 and December 2009.
7
  The G-19 is the donor group that provides general budget support to the Government through a
common framework agreement. During PRSCs-3–5 they were African Development Bank, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and World Bank. The United
Nations and United States are associate members.

4. Achievement of Objectives
4.1     The program documents for PRSCs-3–5 defined three “support areas” for the
programs which, as noted above, are interpreted as the program’s objectives. These
objectives were the same for each PRSC and were not changed during implementation.
Therefore, the assessment of program achievements will be made for all three PRSCs
together. This assessment was conducted six years after project close. It was carried out
within the context of the entirety of the series, based on the long-term commitment between
the Bank and the Government that reforms in one period should be sustained over time.
While not rated, this assessment also reviews the extent to which the series has contributed to
reductions in absolute poverty—the core PARPA II objective.

Objective 1: Macroeconomic Management
4.2     This objective would be achieved by “consolidating and deepening the institutional
reforms for better macroeconomic management.” As mentioned above, there was an over-
reliance on deepening public financial management reforms in relation to the macroeconomic
objective, to the exclusion of indicators of macroeconomic stability. However, to assess the
objective, this review will measure the extent to which the Government pursued better
macroeconomic management (in the context of its adherence to a completed reform program
with the IMF), balance of payments, public debt, enhanced revenue generation capacity,
improved focus of budget allocations to priority sectors for poverty reduction, improved
public financial management, the quality of procurement practices, and the coverage and
efficiency of audits.

4.3     Macroeconomic management. The broad objectives of macroeconomic management
were to establish the enabling environment for sustained growth while maintaining
macroeconomic stability measured by the extent to which it can manage debt, withstand
external balance of payments shocks, control fiscal imbalances, and manage fluctuations in
interest rates and exchange rates. When the PRSC-3–5 series started in 2007, Mozambique
was receiving no financial support from the IMF.8

4.4     Between December 2005 and December 2015, Mozambique engaged with the Fund
through a Policy Support Instrument, which it describes as a flexible tool that secures Fund
advice and support without a borrowing arrangement. Between 2007 and 2010, average
annual inflation rates fluctuated between 3.3 and 12.7 percent (see Table 4.1) but the high
inflation rates in 2008 and 2010 were due to the effects of drought, the food and fuel crises,
and the global financial crisis.9 During the same period, growth rates of GDP in constant

  Mozambique eventually received $176 million from the IMF in July 2009 under the Fund’s
Exogenous Shocks Facility to address its deteriorating balance of payments position resulting from
the global financial crisis.
9
  Among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar and Mozambique experienced by far the
greatest average annual damage due to droughts, earthquakes, floods, and storms (IMF 2015a).
                                              16


prices were regularly between 6 and 7 percent per annum and average per capita GDP in
constant prices grew at an average rate of about 5 percent per annum (see Figure 1.1).

4.5     Enhanced revenue generation capacity. Government efforts achieved strengthened
management of the Central Revenue Authority that resulted in significant increases in total
collected revenues, without raising taxation rates. The Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) reports (Republic of Mozambique 2008 and European Commission
2015a) show good improvement in the transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities
(PEFA indicators PI-13) some improvement in the effectiveness of measures for taxpayer
registration and tax assessment (PEFA indicators PI-14).

4.6     The total revenue to GDP ratio has consistently increased over the last decade.
Between 2004 and 2006, for example, the total revenue to GDP ratio rose from 13.1 percent
to 15.6 percent. During the PRSC 3-5 period (2007-2009), the total revenue to GDP ratio
rose from 15.9 percent to 17.4 percent, despite temporary diesel and kerosene taxes between
June and December 2008 and the global financial crisis. After the PRSC 3-5 period, the total
revenue to GDP ratio continued to grow, reaching 25 percent in 2015, the latest date at which
estimates were available (see Table 4.1). This represented an impressive and sustained
increase in revenue collection performance since the PRSC 3-5 period began.

4.7     The fiscal deficit (before grants) was relatively stable between 12 and 15 percent of
GDP between 2007 and 2011. It then declined in 2012 to 8.9 percent as a result of a rise in
capital gains tax receipts and dropped again in 2013 to 7.9 percent following an increase in
total revenue to 26.3 percent of GDP. However, while the revenue performance remained
high, the fiscal deficit increased sharply to 14.8 percent of GDP in 2014 following increased
expenditures on goods and services, but dropped back to an estimated 10 percent of GDP in
2015. The changes in the consumer price index had been generally high until 2011 but
subsequently declined to around 2 percent per annum through 2015 (see Table 4.1) although
there were considerable fluctuations.

4.8     While most economic indicators up to 2015 were encouraging, there were signs that
serious problem were emerging. The current account balance of payments deficit, which had
declined from about 20 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2008 to about 12 percent of GDP in
2009 and 2010, started to increase rapidly in 2011 until it reached 44.7 percent of GDP in
2012. This was mainly due to imports for large mining projects, nuclear reactors, electrical
machinery and vehicles as the value of exports stagnated. As figure 4.1 shows, the current
account deficit remained high in 2014 and 2015 at 34.1 and 30 percent of GDP, respectively.
In the meantime total nominal public debt increased to a high level of 57 percent of GDP in
2014 and is estimated to have increased to 74 percent in 2015). As a consequence of these
developments, the IMF Board considered a request for emergency assistance from the
Government on December 18, 2015 and approved a Standby Credit Facility effective until
June 2017, with an initial disbursement of $120 million.

4.9    Deterioration of macroeconomic management. The continuing substantial balance of
payments deficit and the rapidly rising public debt was put under the spotlight when the IMF
announced in April 2016 that an amount in excess of $1 billion of external debt guaranteed
by the Government had not been previously disclosed to the Fund. It is understood that these
undisclosed guaranteed debts were contracted in 2013 and 2014. This was only four to five
                                               18


years after PRSC-5 closed. Such guarantees were counter to the Government’s commitment
to the World Bank when requesting assistance for the PRSC 3-5 and throughout the
subsequent series that it “remains committed to maintain macroeconomic stability, improve
public financial management and enhance governance.”10 Disbursements from the Standby
Credit Facility provided by the IMF have been suspended. The Fund has stated it would
continue to work with Mozambique “to evaluate the macroeconomic implications of this
disclosure and identify steps to consolidate financial stability, debt sustainability, and
enhance Government oversight of public enterprises” (IMF 2016b).
4.10 Improved focus of budget allocations to priority sectors for poverty reduction. Prior
actions for all three PRSCs in this series were conditional on a Government commitment to
allocate and maintain 65 percent of the Government’s annual budget to the six PARPA
priority sectors: education, health, agriculture, rural water supply, infrastructure, and
governance. The IMF report on its Article IV consultations in 2009 recorded that the
proportion of national budget expenditures to PARPA priority sectors was 62.3, 73.0, and
70.9 percent respectively in 2007, 2008, and 2009 (IMF 2009, table 9). The overall
achievement of the 65 percent allocation to priority sectors was also confirmed by an EU
evaluation of PRSC operations in Sub-Saharan Africa, which concluded that Mozambique
was regularly close to meeting the commitment during the program implementation period
(European Commission 2014b). However, there was no information in the project
documents, nor in the Implementation Completion and Results Report, regarding the
distribution of these allocations by provinces, districts, and sectors (part of the program
objective) and would have provided a better picture of the geographical coverage of funding
and the likely impact of the broad commitments on allocations to priority sectors on the
welfare of the poor. Such details (relevant to the program objectives) were also not
considered in either the PRSCs-3–5 program documents or the PAF monitoring framework.
Other issues concerning the impacts of services provided by the allocation of funds to
priority sectors will be discussed below when addressing the achievements in improving
governance.

4.11 Improved public financial management. The implementation of the integrated
electronic financial management system (e-SISTAFE) progressed well following its initiation
under PRSC-3. The system was rolled out to all ministries at the central and provincial levels
by the end of 2007, and to the 31 districts that had the prerequisite infrastructure as prior
actions for the approval of PRSC-4 and PRSC-5. Additional extensions of the system at the
end of December 2008 led to the coverage of the electronic accounting system to a total of 50
districts out of 128 and to 25 autonomous institutions at the central Government level. The
rollout of e-SISTAFE was accompanied by an extensive training program involving 1,850
users (about six users per budget execution unit). Users acquired operational skills such that

MZ, December 19, 2006, World Bank, Washington, DC; Annex 4, Letter of Development Policy for
the Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit and the others in this series. The same commitment was
made for the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit and the others in the series. Similar
commitments were made in the final PRSC series (PRSCs 9-11).
                                               19


at the end of PRSC-5 they were able to formulate requests for additional functions for the
system.

4.12 The Government and the Bank have emphasized that the e-SISTAFE system has
permitted control and up-to-date information on expenditures and revenues. For example, by
the end of 2007, budget execution units in the Government started to make their payments
directly by bank transfer from the Single Treasury Account, such that as of end-2009, more
than 95 percent of goods and services and investment transactions of budget execution units
were carried out live through e-SISTAFE. This led to significant benefits in terms of
improved information on public spending and build-up of arrears, predictability in the
availability of funds for expenditures and commitments by budget holders, and in internal
control and transparency.

4.13 Effective institutions for efficient resource allocation and accountability are important
in a country such as Mozambique with remote provinces and districts, large public
expenditures relative to total revenues, and governance issues. E-SISTAFE has been widely
praised by the Bank11 and the IMF12 during the PRSCs-3–5 period and credited with
supporting the successful decentralization of financial management by central Government
ministries to provincial and district Governments. While e-SISTAFE in principle provides a
good platform for efficient resource allocation and accountability, it relies on behavior that is
fully consistent with the spirit and the letter of the e-SISTAFE Law that guides its overall
implementation. As reported by a recent evaluation conducted by the IMF – that focused on
fiscal transparency –“the e-SISTAFE Law establishes a mixed accounting system comprising
accrual-basis accounting for expenditure and cash-basis accounting for revenue. These
principles, however, are not fully applied as most expenditures and revenues are recorded on
a cash-basis, and the commitments were not reported in the last published year-end financial
statements (General Account of the State 2012; IMF 2015a, paragraph 33).”

4.14 In addition, in December 2015, the Director of Mozambique’s Central Office
Combatting Corruption (GCCC) called for an urgent review of the state’s electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE) on the grounds that in the hands of dishonest officials it
permits the theft of large sums of money from the public treasury.13 It is apparent that there
are serious concerns about the efficacy of the manner by which this otherwise sound
technical platform for public financial management (e-SISTAFE) is being used.

4.15 Enhanced procurement practices. In light of improvements in procurement practices
supported by PRSCs-1 and 2 and the associated technical assistance, development partners
relied increasingly on Mozambique’s systems for national competitive bidding, with fewer
exceptions to the national regulations. As a result, donors moved more to the use of
organically integrated project implementation units. Nevertheless, at the close of PRSC-5 a
system was not yet in place to ensure that all district-level Units for the Execution and

Management of Acquisition systematically reported procurement information to Central
Procurement Supervision Units, highlighting the need for a more robust M&E system (one of
the major recommendations of the Mozambique Country Procurement Assessment Report—
CPAR). This CPAR also highlighted the need for an effective complaint mechanism to
disclose abuse of the systems and allow for effective remedies while maintaining the
efficiency of the process. The latest PEFA report using, a more comprehensive methodology
(though consistent with the previous methodology) rated “transparency, competition and
complaint mechanisms in procurement” was rated D+ (European Commission 2015b). The
advances in procurement practice achieved under PRSCs-1 and 2—such as a new
procurement code and the use of standard bidding documents, which started the transparency
of the procurement process (see IEG 2009) —were not sustained.

4.16 Increased coverage and efficiency of Government audits. Mozambique’s Supreme
Audit Institution (Tribunal Administrativo—TA) continued the progress achieved under the
two previous PRSCs by doubling the number of audits carried out in 2007 to 361. From these
the auditors completed 281 reports, substantially surpassing the target of 90 financial audit
reports (prior action for PRSC-5). The TA audited each of the 128 districts at least once.
While the increase in the number of verification audits by the TA was impressive, the scope
of these audits remained limited; it was estimated that in 2007 they covered only about 26
percent of total expenditures. In line with the findings of the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, the Tribunal shifted its focus from the number
of verification audits to expanding the share of the state budget covered by the verification
audits. The TA increased verification audits of the accounts of various public institutions at
the central and decentralized levels from 361 in 2007, to 600 in 2010. The result was that the
coverage of audits of the state budget increased from 30 percent in FY08 to 37 percent and
40 percent in FY10 and FY11, respectively (World Bank 2013, paragraph 50). However, the
percentage of recommendations from audits implemented by the entities audited/inspected by
the internal control unit and the General Inspectorate of Finance was only 15 percent in 2015.
It was proposed that during the implementation of PRSC-11 (approved in December 2015)
this percentage be raised to 40 percent (World Bank 2015b, page 1).

4.17 Response to the audit findings remain limited. The Mozambique law empowers the
Tribunal to impose fines or to recommend corrective actions as a result of its audits, but in
practice during the implementation of PRSCs-3–5 the follow up has been largely limited to
future audits by the Tribunal and to follow up on corrective actions in them such as verifying
the implementation of recommendations. On the other hand, an IMF evaluation of fiscal
transparency in Mozambique concluded in 2015 that the Tribunal’s external audits are
generally “good.” For example, the IMF evaluation noted that “The General Account of the
State (CGE) is audited by the Tribunal. Currently its opinion focuses mainly on the legality
of budget execution, but also includes comments on the reliability of information, the budget
performance and provides detailed conclusions and recommendations. The Tribunal does not
express an opinion on whether the financial statements present a true and fair view. This
audit report is transmitted to the Parliament and is published in the website of the Tribunal
after the deliberations by the Parliament.” However the IMF evaluation also pointed out that,
while the Administrative Tribunal noted some progress in the quality of financial
information, it had identified, in its most recent audit report, several concerns about the
completeness and reliability of the financial information provided in the 2011 CGE. A PEFA
                                              21


report in 2015 also stated that “there is no systematic process to ensure follow up by the
Executive or the audited entity in all cases” (European Commission 2015b, Annex One).
Overall, while there have been advances in the coverage and quality of audits in public
institutions, there are some significant shortcomings in terms of their response to audit
findings.

4.18 This assessment concludes that during the implementation of PRSCs-3–5, the growth
of the economy was high and inflation was relatively low in years when there were no
disruptive exogenous events such as droughts and floods. In addition, revenue collections
showed significant improvements and the budget deficit had declined substantially during the
implementation period for PRSCs-3–5. The current account balance of payment and total
public debt increased significantly. In addition, recently reported experience indicates that
there has been no deepening of macroeconomic reforms; indeed in some areas
macroeconomic performance has deteriorated. Also, recent analysis mentioned above
indicates significant weaknesses in the achievements of institutions such as the e-SISTAFE
financial management system, as well as public procurement and auditing, which could have
implications for the accuracy of assertions about budget allocations in 2007, 2008, and 2009
to the priority PARPA sectors.

4.19 Summary. While macroeconomic management was strengthened under PRSC 3-5,
development outcomes over time associated with the first project development objective
exhibit significant shortcomings. As measured over time, in line with the program
performance assessment methodology, efficacy of macroeconomic management is therefore
rated modest.

Objective 2: Governance Reform
4.20 The second objective of the PRSC series was geared towards governance reform that
was to be achieved by supporting the decentralization/deconcentration agenda with the aim
of enhancing public investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and
by supporting public sector reform. This section will therefore assess the extent to which the
Government pursued the (1) improvement of institutional capacity of local Governments, (2)
improved service delivery at the provincial and district levels, and (3) improved human
resource management in the public sector.

4.21 Strengthened institutional capacity of local Governments. The achievement of the
governance reforms included as objectives in PRSC 3-5 was predicated on the approval of
the National Program for Decentralized Planning and Finance. However, during the PRSC 3-
5 period, there were delays in putting in place the program and institutional arrangements
associated with the planned decentralization reforms. Thus, it is unclear why, the program
document for PRSC-5 noted that “The decentralization efforts of the Government are notable
and much progress was made in 2006 with the introduction of the investment budget for
districts.” At the same time, with regard to the decentralization process, the same document
points to “concerns about the implementation of the investment budget and the lack of
appropriate guidelines. Corruption and conflict-of-interest remain central issues” (World
Bank 2008a, page 32).
                                               22


4.22 In the absence of a decentralization program, there is evidence that some
deconcentration took place. In 2006, grants were allocated to districts but on a very
rudimentary basis. In total, these grants were about 5 percent of GDP in 2008. Since the
PRSC 3-5 period, when the decentralization program was planned but not prepared, the
action has been dropped by subsequent PRSCs (6-11). However, the Government’s current
Five Year Plan for 2015–19 includes decentralization as one of its pillars.

4.23 Improved service delivery at the provincial and district levels Compliance with the
expenditure of 65 percent of the central Government budget on priority sectors was achieved
and there are indications that performance in some social sectors has improved. This agreed
allocation to priority sectors has been maintained after the conclusion of the series:
allocations to priority sectors averaged 65.6 percent between 2012 and 2014, with significant
growth in the budget envelope. Between 2005 and 2010 - broadly the implementation period
for PRSCs-3–5 - enrollments at primary and secondary school levels, water sources, and
sanitation all improved ( See Table 4.2) At the same time, the incidence of HIV infections
(among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa) has not changed significantly. In terms of human
and social development, such as access to primary and secondary education, as well as access
to health services, positive results were reported in the latest household survey. The PARP
(third poverty reduction strategy) report noted that the proportion of the population with
access to schooling rose from 30.8 percent in 2002–03 to 37.3 percent in 2008–09. The
percentage of illiterate women fell significantly from 54 percent to 40.8 percent between
2004 and 2008. As table 4.2 shows, there was also progress in reducing the gender gap in
basic education enrollment; health indicators improved although life expectancy is still
relatively low.

4.24 While the sustained maintenance of these allocations is noteworthy, there is a lack of
outcome level evidence to validate the objective of enhanced service delivery at the
provincial and district level as anticipated according to the program’s objective. The budget
indicator utilized, although in line with the minimum criteria set by the HIPC, falls short of
allowing for a validation of the statement of objective. Neither the quality nor the impacts of
the expenditures on the priority sectors was measured at the provincial and district level. This
was a concern among a number of bilateral and multilateral donors. There are very limited
data available on education outcomes or the impact of improved water supplies (for example,
higher graduation rates and reduced incidence of water-borne diseases) in rural areas.

4.25 Improve human resources management in the public sector. PRSCs-1 and 2 had
supported a census of civil servants that allowed the establishment of a single registry of state
officials and public servants in 2007 (Cadastro Unico dos Funcionarios Publicos— CAF).
This was a prior action for PRSC-3. The CAF is an integrated database that allows the
development and implementation of features that support the strategic management of human
resources, including the payroll. The coexistence of the CAF and a payroll module within e-
SISTAFE enabled an improved control of salary payments, and in particular the potential
elimination of salary payments to ghost workers, as well as the direct payment of salaries
through e-SISTAFE. This was a significant achievement allowing control and updated
information on the payroll. In addition, a new medium-term salary policy was approved

by the Council of Ministers in September 2008 (prior action for PRSC-6) and after a
successful pilot an electronic salary payment system was completed in 2010 and launched in
2011 (World Bank 2013, Data Sheet, Indicator 9). However, the PRSC-3–5 program did not
develop explicit indicators to monitor progress of the public service in terms of its size and
its wage bill.

4.26 Summary. Overall the sustained achievement of improved governance during PRSCs-
3–5 was modest.

Objective 3: Economic Development
4.27 The program document indicated that this objective would be achieved by improving
the business environment, removing constraints to growth such as poor infrastructure (in
particular roads and irrigation), and promoting agricultural growth.

4.28 Improving the business environment. The results of Doing Business 2010, the first
opportunity to make valid intercountry comparisons, showed that Mozambique ranked 135
out of 183 countries surveyed. Though this was an increase of five rankings over Doing
Business 2009, Mozambique remained well below the Southern Africa Development
Community’s (SADC) top performers—Mauritius and South Africa (ranked 17 and 34,
respectively)—and fell to rank just 12 out of 15 SADC countries. Yet in terms of the
objective of an improved business environment, Mozambique was making progress at a time
when the impact of reform policies pursued during PRSCs-3–5 may have been felt by the
business community. Figure 4.2 shows that “overall ease of doing business” and “ease of
starting a business” were comparable to Tanzania and Malawi, and behind South Africa.
However, in ease of access to credit, Mozambique ranked well below all other comparator
countries.

4.29 Improved infrastructure— roads. The road density in Mozambique is the lowest in all
of Africa: road density has been estimated at 0.05 kilometer per square kilometer. The
majority of the road network is not classified. The length of the classified road network is
estimated to equal 30,000 kilometers, of which less than 20 percent is paved, of which only
two-third of this area is in good or fair condition. At present, the World Bank estimates that
the road network provides access to 32 percent of the population, measured by those living
within 2 kilometers of an all-season road. PRSCs-3–5 supported an improvement in the
proportion of roads that were in good or fair condition— from 64 to 71 percent (against a
target of 73 percent). But from a poverty-reducing perspective—as discussed between the
IEG PPAR mission that overlapped with a Bank transport mission that had managed a multi
phased adjustable program loan for the road sector— these achievements did not make much
progress. However, in those discussions the Bank team underlined the increased connectivity
of coastal populations, resulting from the rehabilitation of the primary road network in
Mozambique.

4.30 The Bank’s adjustable program credit helped to increase road transport connectivity
from a baseline of 11 percent in 2007 to an outcome of 32 percent in 2015, as measured by
the percent of the population living within 2 kilometers of an all-season road. While this
progress is notable, much of this increased connectivity was achieved after the PRSC period.
From the perspective of poverty reduction, more attention should have been paid to the lack
                                                 25


of road redundancy14 and the condition of secondary and feeder roads, which are critical for
linking rural producers to markets and enabling the rural poor to gain timely access to
services. Regarding redundancy, interviews with the Bank transport team revealed that when
floods hit, many poor rural areas are cut off completely from the economy as well as health
and welfare-related services.

4.31 Improved infrastructure— railways and ports. A recent Bank report noted that there
has been a significant increase in the use of public-private partnership arrangements (PPPs)
for large infrastructure projects since 2011, with many supporting the development of
infrastructure for coal mining. It mentioned that projects are underway to develop ports in
key areas (such as Pemba and Palma) to facilitate the transportation of natural resources, and
that projects designed to increase energy generation and export are ongoing. The
Mozambique Ports and Railways Company is involved in a number of PPPs, including a
large-scale initiative to construct the railway link between the Minas Moatize coal mine in
Tete province and Nacala, and to expand the Nacala port. This project, estimated to cost $5
billion, started in 2013 and is planned for completion in 2017. The report emphasized the
importance of such projects but also noted their substantial fiscal implications (World Bank
2016, page 22).

4.32 Promote agricultural growth. With regard to agriculture, in Mozambique, Cunguara
and Kelly (2009) examined the impact of the Government’s policy of stimulating production
in the agricultural sector and concluded that “PARPA II failed to increase agricultural
production and productivity and thus reduce poverty. The variation in maize production is
mostly explained by variation in rainfall patterns across agricultural seasons, and not by
technological progress or adoption of better cropping practices. Poverty reduction strategy
plans should promote agro-processing and diversification of both off-farm activities and
crops. In order to increase agricultural productivity, access to improved agricultural
technologies should be increased and more investments should be made in irrigation and
water conservation technologies.” These two issues were addressed in PRSCs-3–5 to
promote growth in the agricultural sector and are discussed below.

4.33 PRSCs-3–5 intended to provide an improved environment for agricultural sector
growth. The PRSCs also provided resources for the development of irrigation systems.
According to official data, agricultural GDP had a long-term growth rate of 5.7 percent per
annum between 1990 and 2014 (see figure 1.1) although it dropped to about 3.5 percent per
annum between 2009 and 2014—still a sound and sustained performance given the sector’s
structural problems and susceptibility to drought. GDP per agricultural worker grew at only
3.3 percent per annum—below typical inflation levels in rural Mozambique and 33 percent
lower than for all workers, and this gap has been widening (see figure 4.3). However, as
shown in figure 4.4, the demand by high-income urban consumers for wheat and rice has
resulted in high imports of these grains (growing at a rate of 13.5 and 7.8 percent per annum
for rice and wheat since 1990) even though, with appropriate technology, rice and wheat

alternatives are installed within network infrastructure. It is a method for ensuring network
availability in case of failure or unavailability of part of the network

could be produced in Mozambique. The rapid growth in imports of basic foods suggests
inefficiency and weak competitiveness of Mozambique’s agricultural sector.

4.34 PRSCs-3 and 4 provided support for increased access of small-scale farmers to
improved agricultural technologies through extension services. While the expected outcome
was that 411,000 farmers would benefit from extension services in 2009 as compared to
193,500 in 2006, the number of farmers benefiting reached 365,000. The Government's
policy response to the higher food prices in 2008 focused on promoting economic growth and
agricultural production. In this context, in June 2008, the Government approved an Action
Plan to Increase Food Production, which articulated an aggressive push to increase
agricultural production over the three-year period, 2008–11. The expansion of extension
services along with the construction or rehabilitation of irrigation were the major instruments
deployed to implement the Government policy of increasing agricultural production.

4.35      Promote construction and rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure to increase
food production. PRSCs-4 and 5 included support for the construction or rehabilitation of
3,200 and 4,000 hectares of irrigation schemes, respectively. The PRSC-4 target was set at
3,200 hectares, but this was reduced to 2,500 hectares. Similarly, some 3,500 hectares were
rehabilitated against a PRSC-5 target of 4,000 hectares. These shortfalls reflected higher than
anticipated unit costs. Moreover, investments in irrigated production take many years to yield
results and these investments would have had no positive impact on either domestic food
supplies and hence food prices in the short term in Mozambique.

4.36 Responses to higher food prices. In response to the global food crisis, a policy action
was introduced into the PRSC series in 2008 that led to the specification of (a) a prior action
for PRSC-5 calling for an increase in the annual budget for the agriculture sector and (b)
targets for 2008/09 and 2009/10 agricultural seasons pertaining to increases in (i) the
production of maize and rice seeds and (ii) the area under cultivation for the same crops
supported in part by the proposed increase in irrigated area. The ICR provided no evidence
whether the targets for 2008 and 2009 were achieved. To finance the measures, the
Government realized expenditure savings from non-release of 10 percent of the budget for
recurrent expenditures in selected programs and domestically financed investment
expenditures, while protecting expenditures in PARPA priority sectors and programs (World
Bank 2010, paragraph 122).

4.37 Poverty reduction. The Government’s overarching objective in its three poverty
reduction strategies is variously defined as “reduce the incidence of poverty from 54 percent
in 2003 to 45 percent in 2009” (PARPA II) to “combating poverty and promoting a culture of
work, with a view to achieving inclusive economic growth and reducing poverty and
vulnerability in the country” (PARPA). Using official Government estimates of poverty, the
data show that, although the national incidence of poverty declined between 1996/97 and
2002/03 from 68 to 69 percent to 54 to 56 percent—it remained between 52 to 55 percent in
2008/09. However, because the population of Mozambique grew faster than the rate of
poverty reduction, there were 400,000 more people living in poverty in Mozambique in 2009
than there were in 1997. Evidence from the World Bank working paper “Poverty in
Mozambique: New Evidence from Recent Household Surveys (2012) confirms an average
national incidence of poverty of 2008/09 of 52 percent. At the same time, the paper points to
a high degree of regional differentiation with regard to poverty reduction, with poverty
decreasing dramatically in urban areas but increasing in the central rural regions, where the
poverty headcount is estimated to be 71.2 percent. This is reflected in the Gini coefficients (a
                                                28


measure of dispersion in the data that is a measure of inequality) for urban and rural poverty
which were higher in 2008/2009 than in 2002/03. Appendix table B.5 summarizes the
available data on the incidence of poverty in money metric terms derived from household
surveys in Mozambique for 1996/97, 2003/04 and 2008/09.

4.38      Overall there were positive outcomes for the ease of doing business, but access to
credit for businesses fell short of the level achieved in neighboring countries. Importantly,
aggregate growth of GDP per capita in real terms was maintained at about 5 percent per
annum and, although per capita growth in GDP per worker was lower at about 3.5 percent
per annum in the agricultural sector, this was still a creditable performance. Although
progress was made on upgrading the main trunk roads in Mozambique, the increased access
was mainly enjoyed by urban and peri urban populations. There were, however, considerable
investments in major railway and port infrastructure improvements that will reduce the
constraints on mineral exports. Achievement in irrigation development fell short of program
targets but the totals were small and the shortfall made little difference to the total area under
irrigation in Mozambique and could not have had any significant impact on total food
supplies. However, agricultural growth remained robust at 3.5 percent per annum between
the end of the PRSC series (2009) and 2014. The balance of trade for goods and services was
heavily dependent on mineral exports and, while the value of imports and exports both
increased during the program implementation period, the value of imports always exceeded
the value of exports. There was a substantial deterioration in the current account balance
payments deficit after the end of the PRSC-3–5 series due to the worldwide decline in prices
for aluminum and coal but also because of large increases in a range of imports. Figure 4.1
shows that the value of imports rose rapidly from 2011 onward while the value of exports
remained virtually stagnant. It was ascertained that much of the increase in the value of
imports was due to development projects such a railway equipment, machinery related to
mining activity, and food. These were all essential imports for long-term growth and stability
but they generated a rapid increase in the current account balance of payments.

4.39 Summary. This assessment concludes that the economic development objective
(improved business environment, reduced infrastructure constraints, and the promotion of
agricultural growth) were achieved during the implementation of PRSCs-3–5 and
subsequently sustained. The achievement of this objective is rated substantial.

5. Outcome
5.1     The relevance of the objectives of the program is rated high and that of their design
substantial, however there was an over-reliance on public financial management reforms to
achieve the broader macroeconomic objective, to the exclusion of indicators of
macroeconomic stability. Within the context of the entire PRSC series, the achievement of
PRSC 3-5 in consolidating, deepening and sustaining macroeconomic reforms is rated
modest because of considerable deterioration of macroeconomic indicators. Reforms in
governance through decentralization, enhanced public investments and service delivery at
provincial and district levels, and supporting public sector reform is also rated modest. With
respect to the third program development objective on economic development, the objective
is rated substantial. The PRSCs 3-5 helped to enhance the business environment, reduce
                                              29


infrastructure constraints through improvements such as in roads, railways, and ports; and to
stimulate agricultural growth. Based on the above ratings, outcome is assessed as moderately
unsatisfactory.

5.2     While not rated, this assessment also considers the contribution of the PRSC 3-5
series to poverty reduction. While, overall, poverty is estimated by the World Bank to have
declined from between 56 percent in 2002/2003 to 52 percent in 2008/2009, there is a high
degree of regional differentiation with regard to poverty reduction, with poverty decreasing
in urban areas but increasing in the central rural regions, where the poverty headcount is
estimated to be 71.2 percent. This result is reflected by the Gini coefficients which were
higher in 2008/2009 than in 2002/03 (see Alfani et al, 2012).

6. Risk to Development Outcomes
6.1     In Mozambique, political commitment to the program’s three objectives has not
always been reliable because of civil conflict and internal political turmoil, although the
Government retained majority political support during the program period. Moreover, there
are significant risks to the sustainability of the programs pursued in PRSCs-3–5.

6.2    Affirmation of a sustained commitment by the Government to sound macroeconomic
management, good governance, and economic development can be found in the consultations
the IMF conducted on the Mozambican economy where the conclusions on Government
macroeconomic management were regularly positive. With respect to the Bank’s
involvement, there have now been 11 PRSCs in this series and the Government made
commitments to sound macroeconomic management, improved governance, and sound
economic development for all of them.

6.3     Growth in the Real Sectors. However, staying the course on the core
macroeconomic management issues is difficult for an economy that is so dependent on one
main group of exports: raw and processed minerals. In addition, the main real sector in the
economy (agriculture) is also highly vulnerable to floods and droughts. Mozambique’s
economy is therefore fragile. The program document for PRSC-11 noted in November 2015
that “Despite its positive overall economic outlook, the Mozambican economy faces
significant downside risks, such as a sharp drop in commodity prices” (World Bank 2015,
paragraph 26).

6.4     Balance of Payments and Debt Situation. Also, the current balance of payments
deficit and public debt both increased to high levels after 2012. In 2015, the former widened
considerably as export revenues shrunk drastically, while the value of imports decreased by
only 1.2 percent (IMF 2015b, table 1). In the light of these developments the IMF and the
Government reached agreement on assistance from a Standby Credit Facility in December
2015 to provide Mozambique with the financial resources to address the balance of payments
problem caused by the reduction in the value of merchandise exports in 2014 and to cope
with the potential exchange rate fluctuations and macroeconomic instability. The revelation
in April 2016, mentioned previously about large undeclared Government guaranteed
borrowing by state owned enterprises which neither the Bank nor the IMF were aware of,
resulted in the suspension of disbursements from the Fund’s Standby Credit Facility. It also
                                              30


raised questions about the quality of the country’s macroeconomic management and the
sustainability of the reforms supported by the PRSC series.

6.5     Waning Donor Support. Since 2009, several bilateral donors in Europe started to
reduce their contributions to general budget support. An evaluation commissioned by the EU
on general budget support programs in Mozambique stated the following in the course of
reviewing the changing context of the budget support from 2005 to 2012: “The relative shift
in European opinion at public and official levels regarding the desirability of budget support
has also represented an important change in the context for budget support. This is evidenced
in the international withdrawal from budget support by the Netherlands, and in the changes in
budget support policies introduced by the European Commission, Sida, SECO, and DFID.
These changes have promoted more rigorous assessments of fiduciary risks and attempts to
develop more explicit links between disbursement modalities and the results of budget
support” (European Commission 2014a, page 77). Because of the serious deterioration in
macroeconomic management and continuing governance issues the risk to development
outcome of the PRSC series assessed in this PPAR is rated significant.

7. Safeguards and Fiduciary Risks
Environmental Risks

7.1      This series of PRSCs did not trigger any action on environmental risks. The only
prior action in the PRSC-3–5 series that could possibly have had an impact on Mozambique’s
environment, forests, and other natural resources was the rehabilitation and construction of
roads and of 6,000 hectares of irrigation projects. The program document for PRSC-3 stated
that “Potential environmental impacts of such interventions will be analyzed and monitored
by the responsible authority.” For the rehabilitation and construction of the road network, the
National Roads Authority had received institutional strengthening for environmental
management under the Bank-supported Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance
Program. Similar assistance had been provided to the Ministry of Agriculture (including from
the Bank) to build up its capacity to carry out environmental impact assessments. The
institutional framework for the water sector in Mozambique is largely consistent with
international good practice (World Bank 2006, paragraphs 25, 66, 79, 93).

Social Risk

7.2     The program document for PRSC-3 stated that better macroeconomic management
would keep inflation low. An earlier Country Economic Memorandum had estimated that if
growth could be maintained at the expected levels of 7 percent per annum in the coming
years, and inequality remains stable, the poverty rate can be reduced significantly increasing
the likelihood that Mozambique will reach the Millennium Development Goal for poverty
reduction by 2015 by reducing its poverty headcount from 54 percent in 2002/03 to 31
percent in 2015 (World Bank 2006, paragraph 96). This rate of poverty reduction did not
occur (see para 4.37). Poverty reduction, especially in rural areas, is stymied by the lack of
structural change in the smallholder agriculture sector, an absence of improved agricultural
technologies leading to improved yields, weak markets for production surpluses, as well as
droughts and floods. With about 70 percent of poor households living in rural areas, any
                                                 31


sustained change in the average poverty level will depend on a substantial reduction in
poverty in rural areas, irrespective of the high rate of GDP growth nationally fueled by the
expansion of the service and extractive industries.

7.3     Social indicators improved during the implementation of the PRSC series (see Table
4.2), however some services such as improved domestic water supplies were mainly
delivered to urban areas. However, the translation of higher rural social indicators into lower
money metric rural poverty, and therefore a lower incidence of national poverty, will be
slow. Consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries were not put in place for the PRSCs.
Policy actions were drawn from the PAF, itself part of the strategic matrix of PARPA II,
which was prepared by the Government through broad-based participatory consultations with
major stakeholders and civil society. However, this could have been complemented by
specific consultations, as needed, with stakeholders affected by the PRSCs-3–5 reforms.
Monitoring of implementation was open to participation of the public and representatives of
civil society organizations, through the work of the development observatories, and through
their participation in the two annual G-19 reviews.

Fiduciary Risks

7.4     One of the objectives of this PRSC series was to improve public financial
management, public procurement, and auditing of public entities. The performance on
fiduciary issues in the context of this series of programs has been discussed elsewhere in this
PPAR. The issues here are the fiduciary risks associated with the implementation of the
project. The Financing Agreements for the three programs required that all project
disbursements should be deposited into a unique Government account and an equivalent
amount was to be transferred into the Government’s budget management system. The Bank
was advised that this procedure was followed and certified audits were provided.

8. Monitoring and Evaluation
Design

8.1     The program documents for PRSCs-3–5 stated that “The Bank’s supervision of the
PRSCs is aligned with the supervision of the joint general budget support program of the G-
19” (World Bank 2007b, page 34). The Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed
upon by the Government and the general budget support donors originally included 49
indicators. There were also processes and institutional arrangements to monitor and revise
the PAF.15 The indicators and actions for PRSCs-3–5 were aligned with a subset of the



15
  The PAF had a joint steering committee that was made up of representatives from the World Bank
and the European Commission as permanent members and the previous, current, and future chairs of
the general budget support group on a rotational basis. During PRSCs-3–5, 29 other PAF groups also
convened, including sector working groups and a budget working group. Working groups prepared
progress reports, proposed targets for each year, and served as the locus for sector-specific policy
dialogue at a technical level. While the PRSCs were limited to a key number of focal areas, the Bank
                                                32


PARPA strategic matrix selected jointly by the Government and the G-19 and set out in the
PAF for 2007–09. Overall, the PRSCs made good use of the monitoring and evaluation
framework for the PARPA.

8.2     The Government, with technical assistance from IDA and other development
partners, had worked since the beginning of 2006 to strengthen the monitoring system of the
strategic matrix in PARPA-II to develop an integrated national monitoring and evaluation
system. Sector working groups, including representatives from relevant sector ministries, the
Ministry of Planning and Development, and donors worked together to select the key
PARPA II objectives in each sector and corresponding results indicators, actions, and output
indicators. A quality control group led by the Ministry of Planning and Development and by
the chair of the G-19 was set up to oversee finalization of the strategic matrix and
identification of key indicators.

8.3     An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant was approved to assist the
Government in strengthening the overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. It
financed a study of the M&E system commissioned by the then Ministry of Planning and
National Development (MPD), which concluded that there was (a) fragmentation of the
M&E system in a multitude of different systems and instruments at national, sectoral,
provincial, and district levels without standardization or integrated methodology; (b)
insufficient support by MPD for institutionalization of structures, clarity of methodology, and
processes; and (c) absence of a strong statistical system and integrated mechanism of data
production and dissemination to support the preparation of the annual Progress Report of the
Economic and Social Plan.

Implementation

8.4      Implementation of sector-specific matrices was carried out by line ministries and
sector agencies, while the overall poverty monitoring was the responsibility of the National
Statistics Institute (INE). A work plan to define decentralized levels of responsibility in
monitoring indicators involving provincial levels of Government was established. However,
limited direct information was provided about the implementation of the M&E system in the
documentation for PRSCs-3–5. In addition, while PAF working groups met frequently to
discuss the progress in achieving the PAF indicators, little information is available from the
G-19 Joint Reviews regarding progress on (a) improvement of the PARPA M&E framework
or (b) its implementation.

Utilization

8.5     There was evidence that data were collected in a timely manner permitting its use in
the context of the PRSCs, and that it was used to assist the Government in decision making.
Administrative data on the progress toward PARPA (and PAF and PRSC) indicators was
collected annually and published in the Progress Report of the Economic and Social Plan



was engaged in a broader general budget support dialogue through its participation in most working
groups.
                                              33


(BdPES). In addition, specific reports on individual reform areas were produced on a regular
basis (for example, annual e-SISTAFE reports and an annual report by the Supreme Audit
Tribunal).

8.6     In summary, the quality of monitoring and evaluation was consistent with the
requirements for development policy operations and implemented in satisfactory manner; it
is therefore rated as substantial.

9. Bank Performance
Quality at Entry
9.1     The program’s objectives were in line with the conclusions of the Bank’s economic
and sector analysis. The Country Economic Memorandum in September 2005 suggested
policies for the optimal use of Mozambique’s natural resources and for integrating their
management into the overall growth strategy. Analytical work on rural development
advocated a dual agricultural development strategy of enhancing smallholder productivity
and strengthening the market bargaining power of smallholders. Many of these findings were
incorporated into PARPA II and were also used to define the prior actions for PRSC-3 and
the triggers for continued support from PRSCs-4 and 5. Preliminary information from a
comprehensive analysis of factors that influenced household incomes and livelihood patterns
using data from a non-representative survey for a World Bank report concluded that, “for
most households overall welfare still depends on agriculture,” which provided the rationale
for continuing the emphasis of the series’ objectives to achieve agricultural growth and the
development of rural areas in general (World Bank 2008b, paragraph 2.40). Other Bank
reports that were relevant to the choice of the PRSC series’ program objectives were a
Country Procurement Assessment Review and a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Review. The second reference, known by its acronym of PEFA, noted
significant improvements in the quality of public financial management systems and
processes between 2004 and 2006.

9.2     The program’s objectives were informed by conclusions from the Bank’s public
expenditure reviews before Project appraisal. Public Expenditure Reviews for Mozambique
were prepared in FY02 and in FY04 with the participation of central and sectoral
Government institutions, local and international academic and research institutes, the private
sector, and a variety of donors. Their recommendations focused on improving budget
formulation, execution, and reporting to enable better tracking and informed decision making
concerning poverty-related expenditures through reforms supported by the first PRSC series.
These recommendations from PRSCs 1 and 2 were highly relevant to the budget
management challenges faced by the Government but were only partly addressed among the
program’s objectives.

9.3     The program was not adequately designed to address PARPA II poverty reduction
objectives. The program’s design should have paid more attention to pro-poor in priority
                                               34


sectors expenditure from the national budget as well as the quality of those expenditures.16
The ICR stated this was difficult because of the lack of related indicators in the PAF for pro-
poor expenditure and the lack of a corresponding budget classification. Bank staff indicated
that attention was drawn to these challenges in the policy dialogue with Government and
arrangements were in place to regularly discuss these issues among stakeholders (see World
Bank 2008a, paragraph 33). However, there was no indication in the program documents that
progress on increasing the focus on pro-poor expenditures from the budget was expected.
The only requirement (based on an old HIPC condition) was that 65 percent of the budget
should be allocated to priority sectors. This was much weaker than the recommendations in
the ICR for PRSCs 1 and 2 mentioned in paragraph

9.4     In addition, the inability of the program to achieve the National Program for
Decentralized Planning and Finance (a prior action for PRSC-5) undermined the extent to
which the governance objective was achieved. As the ICR pointed out, the risk of serious
delay on the decentralization issues could have been better identified and mitigated during
preparation of PRSC-3 and subsequent programs in the series. There was another governance
shortfall with respect to the actuarial study of the investment strategy of the National institute
for Social Security (also a prior action for PRSC-5) which was not completed before the
series closed and was to be addressed as part of PRSC-6. However, at the conclusion of
PRSC-8 pension reform which was part of the macroeconomic management objective for the
PRSC 6-8 series, had still not been achieved.

9.5     The introduction of a new activity to address the impact of the global food crisis that
had inflated domestic food prices considerably was relevant to the program’s objectives and
timely. The Bank had worked with the Government and designed a new activity for PRSC-5
to specifically address this issue (World Bank 2008a, paragraphs 18–22). Overall quality at
entry was moderately satisfactory.

Quality at Supervision
9.6     Arrangements for supervision of the PRSCs were part of the overall G-19 procedures
for monitoring general budget support operations. The G-19 review process was continuous
with two main reviews per year, in April and September. The April reviews looked at
performance in the preceding year, while those in September reviewed performance during
the current year and prepared the program for the following year. There were 29 joint donor-
Government working groups, most of which also met monthly. To ensure full and regular
participation in these reviews, the PRSC task team leader and other core Bank specialists
were based in Maputo. The Bank also participated regularly in IMF program review and
technical assistance missions. However, in retrospect the Bank misjudged the Government’s
long-term commitment to sound macroeconomic management and good governance. On
balance, the Bank’s supervision performance is rated as satisfactory.




16
  The importance of the quality of public expenditures was eventually underlined in the Bank’s
recent “Mozambique Public Expenditure Review” published in September 2014 (World Bank 2014).
                                             35


9.7     In summary the overall Bank performance, in line with the guidelines when one
aspect of Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory and the other is rated
satisfactory the overall rating is rated as moderately satisfactory.

10. Borrower Performance
10.1 Government ownership and commitment to achieving development objectives.
According to Bank staff associated with this PRSC series, the Government took ownership of
the reform program and, in particular, macroeconomic management and public financial
management (PFM) reform. The overall progress made, especially with respect to the PFM
reforms during the implementation of PRSCs-3–5, was substantial according to Bank and
IMF assessments. This assessment also found that progress was made through the PRSC 3-5
on the real sectors, with achievements made in the area of infrastructure and urban water
supply.

10.2 Good macroeconomic management, which characterized the implementation of the
program between 2007 and 2009, was not sustained however. Technical achievements, such
as the public financial management system put in place, (e-SISTAFE) have been undermined
by the manner in which the system has more recently been used, as emphasized by
Mozambique’s Central Office for Combatting Corruption (GCCC). Also some ill-advised
borrowing strategies involving Government guarantees resulting in high contingent liabilities
for the Government have placed the economy in a highly risky situation. Public debt also
reached high levels as a percentage of GDP. There was limited progress on decentralization
reforms needed to deepen efforts to reduce poverty, especially in rural areas. Although
overall poverty has declined on average between 2003-2009 by an estimated four percentage
points, the actual number of poor has increased over the same period of time, with some
400,000 people added to the total poor.

10.3   The Government’s overall performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

11. Lessons
The following lessons have been drawn from this PPAR:

      Carefully chosen objectives and prior actions for policy development operations
       can provide the basis for the necessary conditions for better macroeconomic
       policy, good governance, and sound economic development. In the short term a
       number of reforms can be achieved either because of or in the wake of prior actions.
       For example the Central Revenue Authority was established in 2007 (a prior action
       for PRSC-4). Since then it received support from the Government of Switzerland (a
       member of the donor group providing general budget support) and performed well,
       raising tax collection from 15.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 27.3 percent in 2014.

      Policy development operations can reduce poverty by increasing growth and
       improving institutions that have responsibilities for poverty reduction, but that
       focus was not sufficient for significant poverty reduction in Mozambique. For
                                           36


    example, GDP growth was sustained at between 6 and 7 percent per annum, prior
    actions requiring the Government to allocate at least 65 percent of its annual budget
    to priority sectors maintained the capacity of ministries that had a responsibility for
    delivering social services to the poor, and a number of social indicators was well
    maintained. However, the incidence of money metric poverty was reduced by only 4
    percentage points over six years from a high poverty incidence of 56 percent in
    2002/2003 to 52 percent in 2008/2009.

   Development policy operations that use general budget support as the
    instrument for providing assistance can also be appropriate vehicles for the
    harmonization of donor strategic assistance. The Performance Assessment
    Framework agreed between the Government and general budget support development
    partners, if well crafted, can be the basis for fruitful cooperation among these
    partners. The downside risk is the possible constraint on the Bank’s flexibility with
    respect to prior actions outside the Performance Assessment Framework. For
    example, the Bank needed to negotiate with general budget support donors to obtain
    their agreement to include additional actions on food security in PRSC-5 that were
    outside the Performance Assessment Framework.

   The political economy context can have critical impacts on the achievement of
    policy reform. Understanding the political economy context for reforms in policy is
    critical to assessing the likelihood that reforms will take place. For example, a
    National Program for Decentralized Planning and Finance was to have been achieved
    as a prior action for PRSC-5. However, the political barriers to achieving internal
    agreement on a national plan for decentralized planning and finance were seriously
    underestimated and a plan was not approved by the Government during the PRSC 3-5
    series.
