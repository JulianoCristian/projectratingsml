Development         The proposed FourthPoverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-4) i s the second in a PRSC
3bjectives and      series designed to assist the Government o f Mozambique (GoM) to implement key policy
Description         actions outlined in its Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (known as
                    PARPA I1 by its Portuguese acronym) and in the Performance Assessment Framework
                    agreed by the Government and the 19 external partners that provide general budget support
                    (GBS) to GoM. PARPA I1 i s mainly focused on shared growth and on the need for
                    decentralization. Within this context, PRSC-4 is expected to help the G o M in: (a) the
                    consolidation and deepening o f the institutional reforms in the area o f macroeconomic
                    management; (b) reforms in governance by supporting decentralization to enhance public
                    investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and by supporting
                    public sector reform; and (c) economic development by removing constraints to growth,
                    such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

Benefits            The operation will help the Government to maintain macroeconomic stability while it
                    continues to pursue a reform agenda that cannot be fully financed from domestic sources.
                    The reforms,would enable Mozambique to make further progress in reducing absolute
                    poverty, improving the delivery o f services and achieving the MDGs. The alignment with
                    the general budget support programs o f 18 other donors and a joint focus on the priorities
                    set out by the Government in its comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and on a
                    common set o f indicators to measure progress, should help improve the resource flow and
                    improve aid effectiveness, thereby enhancing the chances of progress towards the MDGs.

Risks               A first set o f risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic instability, which
                    may arise as a result o f terms of trade shocks, deteriorating finances, or unpredictability o f
                    donor disbursements. While terms o f trade shocks and regional instability are exogenous,
                    better public finance management, and the adoption o f MoU's with development partners
                    has made aid flows more predictable. A second set o f risks, relates to the macroeconomic
                    impacts o f new mega-projects in terms o f government exposure including quasi-fiscal
                    activities, ensuring an optimal fiscal/BOP impact and a healthy investment climate, and
                    ensuring the sustainability o f investments. T o minimize these risks, the Bank and the Fund
                    are working closely with the government to strengthen process related to the selection and
                    monitoring o f new mega-projects. A third set o f risks concerns weak administrative
                    capacity to implement reforms. To mitigate this risk, the Government and donors have
                    agreed to develop an integrated strategy for capacity development in public finance
                    management, including at the decentralized level, and to strengthen the coordination and
                    management o f reforms. A fourth set o f risks concerns a deterioration in governance that
                    could compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. T o mitigate this risk,
                    the Bank has intensified its policy dialogue on governance issues inharmonization with the
                    G19 and has restructured its public sector reform project to support the second phase o f
                    public sector reforms; a new component in support o f capacity building in the judiciary
                    sector has also been included. A final set o f risks concerns the potential impact of
                    HIV/AIDS in reducing human and institutional capacity to deliver public services; it also
                    may pose a contingent liability regarding the future costs o f treating this disease. Should

                      donor support wane at some point, there would be big pressures for the health budget to
                      pay for it. The Bank is taking the HIV/AIDS pandemic very seriously and is dealing with it
                      as an essential cross-cutting issue in all o f its projects in addition to having two dedicated
                      HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.

1.       This Program Document proposes a Fourth Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC-4) to the Republic of Mozambique for SDR37.8 million (USD60
million equivalent), on standardIDA terms and outlines the triggers for moving to
PRSCd. The proposedoperation is an integralpart of the Bank's strategy to support the
implementation o f Mozambique's "Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute
Poverty"' (known as PARPA I1by its Portuguese acronym), aided by the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the Government and the nineteen external
partners (the G19)2 providing general budget support (GBS). While the PRSC operations
will provide financial support for implementing the whole PARPA, they are to be
disbursed against the upfront completion o f a number o f specific reform measures
identified in the PAF. The proposed operation i s the second in a PRSC series o f three
annual single-tranche operations to be delivered over FY07-09. A detailed description of
the PRSC series was provided in the PRSC-3 Program Document, which was the first
operation o f this PRSC series (Republic o f Mozambique, Third Poverty Reduction
Support Credit, Report No. 37970-MZ, approved January 25, 2007). Consistent with the
programmatic approach o f the PRSC series, this document will cross-reference the earlier
program document, but will present a detailed update on the implementation o f the
program.     The document `will also provide an update on the macroeconomic
developments and overall risks.


                                   11. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. COUNTRYOVERVIEW

2.        Mozambique has been a very strong performer in Africa, with rapid
growth and poverty reduction, as it recovers steadily from the damage of the civil
war.     Following political stabilization and market-oriented reforms, and steady
improvements in infrastructure, the economy has registered an average annual growth
rate o f 8 percent between 1996 and 2006, and incomes have risen considerably. The
poverty headcount index has fallen from 69 percent in 1996/97 to 54 percent in 2002103.
Economic expansion has been made possible by overall macroeconomic stability, policy
reforms and continuing strong donor support, permitting broad-based expansion across

1Segundo Plano de Acq2io para Redu@o da Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA-11).
  The 19 donors are: African Development Bank, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, EU, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the
World Bank.

most sectors o f the economy, and a series o f significant foreign investment projects
("megaproj ects"). As a result, Mozambique's exports increased dramatically in the late
1990s and early 2 0 0 0 ~with average growth rates o f 10.6 percent and 25.4 percent in
                           ~
1995-1999 and 2000-2006, respectively. Most o f this growth, however, was driven by
exports from megaprojects; excluding megaprojects, exports grew by 13.5 percent on
average during 2000-2006 (and largely due to good performance in 2006). The sectors
that  contributed the most to         economic   growth were      agriculture,  transport,
communications and infrastructure, notably roads.

3.        Visible progress occurred in social conditions as evidence of the decline in
poverty measured by the latest householdsurvey. In addition to the major reduction
in poverty, by 15.3 percentage points between 1996 and 2003, other social indicators
have also shown significant improvements:

    0  The number o f children in primary school was almost doubled from
        approximately 2 million to 4 million during 1996 and 2003.
    0  Maternal mortality was reduced from an estimated 1,000 per 100,000 live births
        inthe early 1990sto 408 per 100,000 livebirths in2003.
    0   Under 5 mortality rates decreased from 219 to 178 per 1,000 live births.
    0   Infant mortality decreased from 147 to 124 per 1,000 live births.
        The capacity o f the health system was expanded to start providing free ARV
        treatment for HIV infection.

4.        Despite the promising progress, significant challengesremain. The country
remains poor ($347 per capita income in 2006), infrastructure i s inadequate, and social
indicators are low. Adult literacy rates are low (approximately 47 percent), chronic
malnutrition amongst children does not appear to be improving, and life expectancy at
birth (42 years) is one of the lowest inAfrica. The country also relies heavily on foreign
aid, which makes up about half o f its overall budget. Additionally, the impact o f
HN/AIDS and malaria on the population has serious consequences. Malaria alone
accounts for 35 percent o f deaths among children below five years o f age, 60 percent o f
admissions in pediatric wards, and 40 percent o f overall outpatient consultations. It has
been found that in Sub-Saharan Africa, malaria reduces GDP growth by an estimated
average o f 1.3 percent per year. As for HIV/AIDS, current projections indicate that in
2010 the Mozambican economy will be 14-20 percent smaller than it would otherwise be
due to the impact o fHIV/AIDS.

5.        Mozambique is likely to achieve the poverty Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Assuming that the current trend continues, Mozambique is expected to
halve the population living in absolute poverty by 2015.        As mentioned, however,
reducing hunger and child malnutrition remains a challenge. The MDG for sustainable
coverage for water supply i s also likely to be met, with rapid improvements in the
provision o f urban water supply, although significant progress i s needed to increase
access to water in rural areas. There has also been substantial progress toward other
MDGtargets, specifically on improving universal primary education, gender equality and
women's empowerment, reducing child mortality, and improving maternal health.
Nevertheless, more progress will be required to meet these MDGs, while combating
HIV/AIDS,malaria and other diseasesremains a serious challenge. A detailed discussion
o fprogress towards each MDGwas include inthe PRSC-3 Program Document.

6.       Constraintsto private sector development and trade remain substantial, but
progress is being made to improve the business environment. Mozambique was
among the top five reforming countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in the 2008 Ease o f Doing
Business rank, as reflected by an improvement in its ranking by 6 places to 134thout o f
175 co~ntries.~Mozambique i s 129th (out o f 203) on the 2007 Governance Survey
Overall Index, surpassing the SSA and low income group averages on all four aspects o f
the index (government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule o f law, and control o f
corruption). The country's secondary school (7.1 percent, in 2005) and tertiary (1.2
percent, in 2004) enrollment rates are only a fraction o f the comparators' countries.
Mozambique i s ranked 110th out o f 150 countries on the 2007 Trade Logistics
Performance Index. Its weakest indicators are quality o f transport and IT infrastructures.
The Government's development andpoverty reduction strategy focuses on tackling many
o f these concerns. The PRSC series has also supported private sector development, by
amongst other things, introducing legislation to allow the registration o f corporations
through the official website o f said Government, which helped reduce the start-up time
for new firms by almost three months (from an average 113 to 29 days).

7.       Progress in public sector governancehas been limited.Despite some progress,
implementation o f public sector reforms program, including decentralization, remains
slow. Improvements in the efficiency and transparency o f the justice system remain
elusive, and corruption and conflict-of-interest remain central issues. Government's
response has mainly focused on improving transparency and accountability based on a
comprehensive public financial management reform program.


B. RECENT      ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS               INMOZAMBIQUE

8.         Mozambique'seconomic growthcontinues to be strong.Mozambique's GDP
growth was 8 percent in2006, and the economy grew 8.3 percent year-on-year duringthe
first quarter, and 7.1 percent in the second quarter o f 2007. Agriculture, which employs
about 78 percent o f the economically active population, contributed most to GDP during
the second quarter of 2007 (31.5 percent). Itwas followed by the manufacturing industry
(11.6 percent), transport and communications (9.3 percent), and trade (8.9 percent). The
contribution o f the remaining sectors was between5.0 percent (financial services) and 0.8
percent (extractive industries). Looking back at the past decade, the growth record has
been remarkable, averaging 8 percent from 1966 to 2006. This performance has been
driven by mega-project construction, buoyant donor support, healthy agriculture growth,
andforeign direct investmentinservices ~ector.~

9.         Public and private investments continue to grow.                             Public investment
increased from 8.6 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 12.3 percent in 2006. Domestic private


  Mozambique was the second fastest reformer overall inthe category "Protecting Investors", where its
rank jumped 63 places from 96 to 33. Legislation dating from 1888 was replaced with a new commercial
code that introduces stricter corporate governance rules and strengthens the rights o f minority shareholders.
Significant progress was achieved too inthe category "Starting a Business" (+32 ranks), where the start-up
time for new firms fell by almost three months from an average 113 to 29 days.
4 A detailed analysis on the sources o f growth in Mozambique can be found in the Country Economic
Memorandum o f 2005, Report No32615-MZ.


                                                    - 3 -

investmentdecreased from 10.1 percent of GDP in2005 to 7.1 percent in2006. Foreign
investments, however, remain strong. During the first semester o f 2007, Mozambique
registered a record USD1.8 billion in approved private investments (which compares to
the USD847 million in the whole o f 2006), almost entirely inflows o f Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI). About US$1.5 billion relates to the Government approval inmid-2007
o f the concession agreement for the exploration o f the Moatize coal mine. An additional
USD300 million derives from the approval o f 84 investment projects, mostly in industry
(29 projects, for a total o f USD178 million), transport and communications (8 projects,
for a total o f USD60 million), and tourism (20 projects, for a total of USD27 million).
While 2007 i s likely to be above average, the level o f investments i s expected to remain
high, as several new mega-projects are inthe pipelinefor the next few years.

10.       Inflation remains in single digits, although it is expected to increase
somewhat by the end of the year. Annual inflation declined from 11.2 percent in
December 2005 to 9.4 in December 2006, but has since increased slightly to 9.9 percent
in August 2007. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) was contained in the 5-6
percent range. Annual average inflation i s expected to increase further by the end o f the
year due to the continuing high oil prices and the cyclical price increases in December.
Monetary policy continues to be prudent, and aims to keep core inflation insingle digits.

11.       Creditto the economy has continuedto grow. Followingthe increase o f22.5
percent in 2005, the 12-month rate o f growth o f credit to the economy grew at 14.3
percent in 2006, and i s projected to expand at around 11 percent in 2007. An IMF
assessment indicates that the recorded increase in credit to the economy reflects both
structural factors (associated with banks resuming consumer credit following the
completion o f their restructuring plans, resulting in healthier balance sheets), as well as
borrowing by domestic petroleum distributors related to the syndication o f larger oil
import transactions. Lending to the agriculture and rural sector, however, remains
minimal. While capital adequacy ratios are still above the minimum, they have continued
to decline as a result o f increased lending, and therefore the authorities are closely
monitoring the current credit boom.

 12.      The soundness, depth andprofitabilityof the Mozambiquefinancialsystem
continues to improve. The financial system has deepened since the banking systemwas
restructured. Sound financial policies and cleaned-up balance sheets, have restored
confidence in the banking sector. Nonperforming loans (NPL) have fallen to less than 5
percent o f all loans in 2006 according to Mozambican accounting standards. Banks have
also become more efficient, as reflected by the continuous decline in non-interest
expenses to gross income since 2004. Greater confidence in the banking system has also
ledto a significant decrease inliabilitydollarization andthus less financial vulnerability.

 13.      Fiscal performanceremains good. Maintainingthe positive trend of the past
few years, revenue collections in 2006 were nearly 1.5 percent o f GDP higher than in
2005, mainly led by buoyant corporate tax collections. Early indications are that revenue
collections will increase in2007 by a further 0.5 percent o f GDP. Domestic expenditures
also increased in 2006, broadly in line with the budget, and fully financed by the higher
revenues and grants. Overall budget execution in the first semester o f 2007 was lagging
below 50 percent, but i s expected to pick up. The composition o f spending has also
continued to improve, with the share o f priority expenditures exceeding the 65 percent


                                            - 4 -

PARPA target in 2006, and expected to stay at the same level in 2007. In line with these
trends, the domestic current primary balance was 1.6 percent of GDP in2006 (nearly 0.5
percent o f GDP better than programmed under the IMF-supported PRGF), and i s
projected to remain positive at 0.7 percent in2007.

14.       Real interest rates continueto decrease. Reacting to a downward adjustment
in Treasury bill yields and softening inflation, the Bank o f Mozambique (BM) in June
2007 reduced its standing lending facility (FPC) by 200 basis points to 15.5 percent and
the standing deposit facility (FPD) by 250 basis points to 10.5 percent. Since then, the
RBMhaskept its monetarypolicyunchanged, andinterest rates have remainedflat. This,
together with the recent increase in the 12-month inflation rate has reduced the real
interest rate for Treasury bills from 10.8 at the end o f April down to 5.9 percent at the end
of August 2007.

15.        The trade balance improved substantially in 2006, and was stable in the
first half of 2007. The trade deficit has improved, despite the oil price shocks, from 11
percent o f GDP in 2005 to around 7.7 percent o f GDP in 2006, led by an acceleration in
exports (both mega-projects and other export^).^ The trade deficit i s expected to remain at
around the same level in 2007. With prices for commodities booming, and the rebound
from the 2005 drought, exports have surged by an estimated 37 percent in 2006.
Preliminary data suggest that'exports continued to increase in the first semester o f 2007,
and were 3.5 percent above the corresponding value for 2006, mostly due to the
contribution o f mega-projects. On the other hand, imports grew by less than 17 percent
in2006, driven mainlybymega-project imports. Imports were 3.4 percent above the first
semester in2006, mainly drivenby imports o f mega-projects.

16.        The foreign exchange market remains stable, and reserves are at a
comfortable level. As a result of strong exports, sustained aid inflows, and a tighter
monetary policy stance, the exchange rate has remained stable during 2006, while
international reserves have remained at a very comfortable level. The Central Bank
auction rate on August 29, 2007 was 26.10 MZNper USD against 26.15 at the beginning
o f the year. As a result the Bank o f Mozambique (BM) gradually widened the exchange
rate bands in both the foreign exchange auctions and interbank market (which it had
temporarily introduced in November 2005, in response to mounting exchange rate
volatility), and fully restored exchange rate flexibility. Markets have since remained calm
with the spread between M C I rates and those quoted by banks narrowing to about 1
percent, while the real effective exchange rate appreciated, reflecting a depreciating U.S.
dollar and increasing foreign inflows. International reserves have remained at a very
comfortable level. Strong exports, along with sustained aid inflows kept international
reserves at comfortable level at around USD 1.4 billion as o f end-September 2007. This
corresponds to 4.7 month of import cover, or 6 months excluding mega-projects.

17.        There is a stable relationship with the IMF, with recent collaboration
anchored on a PRGF, which has now evolved into a Policy Support Instrument


  With such developments as the MOZAL aluminum smelter, Mozambique's share ofminingand fuel
products in merchandize exports has increased from about 10 percent inthe late 1990s to 73.2 percent in
2005. Of the 84 various products exported by Mozambique in2005, aluminum accounted for 72 percent,
followed by seafood (6 percent), tobacco (4 percent), sawlogs (2 percent), and raw sugar (2 percent).

(PSI) approved by the IMF's Board in June 2007. The sixth and final review of the
PRGF was successfully completed in June 2006, and confirmed that the government's
successful reform effort have produced solid growth andprice stability. The review found
that performance under the PRGF program has been good. All quantitative and structural
performance criteria from March 2005 through March 2007 were met except one: base
money was above target at end-year 2006 due to a temporary rise in currency demand
related to the currency reform.6 This good performance has helped the authorities
maintain monetary and inflation control and complete outstanding first-generation
reforms. In light o f the sustained macroeconomic stability, supported by the PRGF
program, the Board approved the authorities' request for a three-year Policy Support
Instrument(PSI) basedon the reform agenda articulatedinthe PARPAI1for 2006-09.


C. DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

18.        Mozambique faces a low risk of debt distress, as confirmed by a Debt
SustainabilityAnalysis carriedout by the Bank and the Fundin 2007, but a prudent
new borrowingpolicyremains important.As a result of the MDRI, the NPV o f public
external debt i s estimated to be approximately halved, from about 25 percent to about 12
percent o f GDP in2006.7 Mozambique's external debt levels are expected to remain well
below their indicative thresholds for debt distress both under the baseline and under
various stress tests. Mozambique's public debt i s expected to decline over the medium-
to-long term under the baseline, while the stress tests indicate that public sector debt
ratios are most vulnerable to a permanently lower GDP growth. Where possible, the
authorities should continue to rely on concessional borrowing and grants to minimize
future debt service, and any non-concessional financing o f new projects ought to be
considered case by case based on economic return, impact on debt sustainability, and
potential effects on the financing decisions o f donors and concessional lenders. Also, the
authorities would still need to closely monitor any substantial scaling-up o f concessional
external borrowing and the issuance o f domestic debt to sterilize the additional liquidity
injected from increased government spending.


D. MACROECONOMICOUTLOOK

 19.       The short-term macroeconomic outlook is favorable. The macroeconomic
framework i s adequate for the purpose o f the proposed operation. The sixth review o f
performance under the PRGF program concluded in June 2007 that the prospects for
2007-2008 remained favorable, including for strong growth, single digit inflation, and the


 The review also found that public financial management reforms had made good progress with the
implementation o f a new version o f the e-SISTAFE and that there had been progress inreforming revenue
administration and widening the tax base. Furthermore, the review noted that progress on structural reforms
in2006 accelerated, particularlyinthe areas o fpublic sector, labor market, andtrade-related reform. Areas
where slower progress was noted included reforms to improve access to finance through an improved
lending environment, i.e. legal andjudicial reform, as well as the deepening o f domestic debt markets.
  More recently, the Second Commercial Debt Buy-Back Operation for Mozambique was completed in
October 2007, entailing the cancellation o f USD153 million o f long-term commercial debt (all o f it
originated inthe 1970's and 80's).


                                                   - 6 -

maintenance o f a sustainable external and fiscal situation, as the Government i s
committed to take the necessary fiscal measures and pursue a monetary program
consistent with a further reduction o f inflation.8 The first review mission o f the IMF
Policy Support Instrument (PSI) concluded inNovember 2007 that implementation o f the
2007 program has been satisfactory through September 2007.' The Government remains
committed to take measures to continue to strengthenthe banking system, foster private
sector development and move forward the public sector reform. After recording an 8
percent growth in2006, real GDP growth i s expected to continue to be strong at 7 percent
in2007, and at around the same level inthe next few years (Table 1). The leading sector
would be agriculture, followed by wholesale and retail trade, and also transport and
communications, and construction.

20.      Mozambiqueneeds to implement growth-enhancingreforms and challenging
institutional reforms to avoid a slow down in growth in the medium-term.
Mozambique appears to be well placed to experience a long period o f sustained per capita
growth. It would be hazardous, however, to assume a "business as usual" rate o f 7
percent, because such "growth spurts" rarely extend more than a few years, Mozambique
faces meteorological and other risk, the agricultural catch-up i s now exhausted and the
sector i s growing at a lesser rate than it did before. Most o f the "easy" growth-enhancing
reforms have been done, and aid i s projected to fall as a share o f GDP. The likely growth
scenarios for the future - and the corresponding poverty scenarios - will heavily depend
on the Government's role inwarding off threats to continued growth, as well as its role in
seizing new opportunities for.growth. Only rapid progress in certain key reforms, can
keepthe growth rate as highas 7 or 8 percent inthe medium term, and continue the rapid
rate poverty reduction o f the past decade. For instance, the 2005 CEM estimates that
Mozambique could enhance its growth performance by improving its business climate to
East Asian levels. Gains o f up to 1 percentage point per annum could be made by
avoiding banking crises, or by improving governance, or by reducing government
nonproductive spending. Bigger gains o f up to 3 percentage points per annum could be
secured by - in time - improving infrastructure, or by raising access to secondary
education."

21.         It is critical therefore that the Government pursues a reform program to
resolve the key challenges to growth and poverty reduction. The 2005 C E M
identifies key constraints to accelerating shared growth are the weak public financial
management, the need for key institutional reforms, a poor climate for private sector
development, the lack o f adequate infrastructure, the low smallholder agricultural

*  A preliminary assessment o fperformance duringthe first semester 2007 was done by the most recent
IMFmission inAugust 2007 (the mission was mainly focusing onthe budget framework), found that the
program i s on track and that revenues appear to be above projections. The next mission to examine
performance in first semester 2007 i s planned for early November - while no significant deviations from
the program are anticipated, and an updated macro assessment i s expected by the time o f the ROC review.
  All but one o fthe quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2007 and all structural assessment criteria
through end-September 2007 were observed. The end-June A C for base money was missed by a narrow
margin because o f an unanticipated increase inmoney demand. Because o f the permanent nature o f this
increase, the government requests the modification o f the related A C for end-December 2007.
I OAs part o fthe 2005 CEM (inChapter 6), simulations were carried out using `growth regressions'

significantly the management o f natural resources. Most o f these challenges have been
articulated in the PARPA-11, and are part o f the government program, which i s supported
by this PRSC series.

                    111. THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM:PARPAI1

22.              In September 2006, the Governmentformally adopted the Second Poverty
ReductionStrategy(PARPA 11).PARPA I1is the operationalplanfor the governments'
Five-Year Program (2005-2009), and sets out a broad and ambitious agenda o f reforms.
PARPA I1builds on the experience o f PARPA I,and was prepared through broad-based
consultations with major stakeholders and civil society. The PARPA I1 structure and


                                                                - 8 -

priorities were discussed inthe Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) presented to the Board
on December 19, 2006, and also included in the PRSC-3 program document, and
reference i s made to that document for details.

23.       The PARPA I1 for the first time includes a strategic matrix of key
indicators,a joint effort by the government,donors and civil society. These indicators
are integrated into and monitored through the annual instruments o f the Economic and
Social Plan (PES in Portuguese) and the BdPES (Ex-post Assessment o f Implementation
o f the PES), which i s submittedannually to Parliament.

24.         The monitoringof the PARPA I1is open to participationfrom the public
and representativesof Civil Society Organizations,throughthe work of the Poverty
Observatories. As described in the JSAN, the PARPA I1 was prepared by the
Government through broad-based consultations with major stakeholders andcivil society,
in a more participatory approach than PARPA I,involving four national and ten
provincial Poverty Observatories. The work o f the Poverty Observatories i s ongoing and
their meetings provide a forum for broad public consultation to strengthen domestic
accountability in PARPA 11 implementation and monitoring. These institutional
mechanisms, however, are still in their infancy and have very limited capacity, thereby
limitingthe effectiveness ofpublic involvement.

25.        While maintaining`itscommitment to improve quality and access to social
services, PARPA I1 recognizes that "rapid, sustainable and broad-based growth"
warrants more emphasis on the growth of the productiveand private sectors. The
strategy envisages small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the engine o f employment
generation. Rural development has a central place in the strategy. An essential role i s
attributed to districts as the focus o f development. There i s also a clear recognition o f the
challenges related to HIVIAIDS, with a credible strategy for accelerating the national
response to the AIDS pandenlic. Overall, the priority areas for public policy to sustain
growth and poverty reduction, and improve service delivery are arranged under three
pillars:l1 governance; (ii)
           (i)                    humancapital; and (iii)      economic development.

A. LINKSTOTHE COUNTRYPARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY

26.      The PRSC series is a key component of the Country Partnership Strategy
approved by the Board in May 2007, and closely aligned to the Government
program. Bank support to the PARPA I1is through the Mozambique FY08-11 Country
Partnership Strategy (discussed May 30, 2007).12 As government policies and budget are
the key instruments for implementingthe PARPA, the Bank is committed to supporting
and aligning with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario o f the CPS
envisages programmatic support through four consecutive PRSCs, with a focus on
supporting Mozambique's efforts in increasing accountability and public voice and

''Key  reforms inpublic financial management were treated inthe text o f PARPA I1partly under the pillar
o f Governance, and partly under the pillar o f Economic Development. The strategic matrix and the PAF
highlightedthe importance ofthese reforms by creating a fourth domain: Macroeconomic Management.

fostering sustainable and broad-based growth. In line with the government program, and
as reflected in the CPS, the program supported by the PRSC series recognizes the
centrality o f the new growth agenda and the importance o f accelerating shared growth
through infrastructure, rural and private sector development, and enhanced governance
reforms.     The PRSC series is also well aligned with the Bank's principles on
conditionality, namely (i)reinforce ownership; (ii)strengthen harmonization; (iii)
customize program to country circumstances; (iv) select only critical actions; and (v)
ensure transparency and predictability o fprocess (Box 1).

27.     Strengtheninggovernance is a key objective of the interventions supported
by the PRSC series.           The PRSC series is contributing to this overarching objective
through several channels, including (i)strengthening the capacity, transparency, and
accountability o f state institutions, both at the central level by strengthening PFM
systems and at the local level through decentralization; (ii) the demand for better
                                                                          raising
governance by supporting participation and oversight by civil society, as for example
through the activities associated with the Poverty Observatories; (iii)fostering a
competitive and responsible private sector through interventions aimed at improving the
business environment and the investment climate; and (iv) contributing to strengthen
accountability overall through the process o f joint reviews that monitor progress in
implementationo f the PARPA.II.I3

28.     Development policy lending will be complemented by investment support
and technicalassistance.PRSC support will continue to coexist with investmentsupport
to well-articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to develop government
systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on them. IDA'Sinvestment
portfolio, with 17 projects, i s diverse and supports the three pillars o f the CPS. As o f June
2007, total IDA commitments were $783 million. Details o f the investment programs are
inAnnex 4. The share o f policy-based lending inoverall IDA disbursements [inFY04-
06 was below 40 percent], and i s projected to stay at around 40 percent during the CPS
FY08-11. The PRSC series supports PFM and public sector reforms, embraces the new
growth agenda, and supports the Government's focus on development at the district level.
These objectives are also supported by several IDA projects, thereby creating strong
synergies.




l3Overall, the PRSC series is well aligned with the Bank's strategy to enhance governance and anti-
corruption in client countries, as laid out in the paper entitled "Strengthening Bank Group Engagement on
Governance and Anticorruption", released in September 2006.

Box 1: Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's strategy to support the implementation o f Mozambique's
Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA I1by its Portuguese acronym), and the
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the Government and the nineteen external partners (the G19).
PARPA I1i s structured around three pillars (Governance, Human Capital, and Economic Development) and is the
operational plan o f the Government's Five-Year Program. The first PRSC series was successfully deployed in 2001
and overall progress o f the reforms has been satisfactory as the government continues to pursue a far-reaching reform
agenda with the new government elected in December 2004 deepening reforms to reduce poverty. The PRSC series
has also been informed by significant amount o f analytical work completed over the past few years, including two
PERs (FYO1 and FY03), two CEMs (FYO1 and FY06), a CFAA (FY02), a CPAR (FY03), a Public Financial
Management and Fiduciary Risk Assessment with other donors (FY04), a PEFA (FY06) among others, that have
been discussed with the government and fed significant input into the policy making process.

Principle2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinatedaccountability
framework
Progress on the reforms is monitored with the aid o f the PAF. Improved service delivery in PARPA priority sectors,
i.e. agriculture, health, education, rural water supply, infrastructure, justice and related governance sectors, i s
monitored through Joint Sector Working Groups. Progress in achieving all the indicators contained in the PAF i s
assessed twice a year through the Joint Review inApril and the Mid-Year Review in September. The sector working
groups have become a good mechanism for policy dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement
between the Government and all the donors involved in a specific sector. Furthermore, a joint Budget Working
Group meets on a quarterly basis with the Government to monitor budget execution, particularly in the priority
sectors.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The PRSC series is designed to focus first on key constraints in cross-cutting areas such as public financial
management and the business environment, which are the areas that provided the rationale for the prior actions o f
PRSC-3. The series then evolves to support decentralization and shared growth through the incorporation o f triggers
for PRSC-4 and PRSC-5. In order to reduce the transaction costs for the Government, the Bank carries out all
supervision jointly with the other donors. A Joint Review takes place each year in April (year n). It assesses the
performance o f the government in the previous budget year, which corresponds to the calendar year (year n-1).The
review focuses on evaluating progress with regard to the indicators defined in the Performance Assessment
Framework and makes an overall assessment o f progress. The second event i s the Mid-Year Review in September.
This review is mainly forward-looking and formalizes the agreement on the performance indicators and targets for
the following year (year n+l). Programmatic lending will be complemented by investment support. PRSC support
will coexist with investment support to well-articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to develop
government systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on them.

Principle4: Chooseonly actionscriticalfor achievingresults as conditionsfor disbursement
All the prior actions and triggers o f the PRSC series are indicators contained in the Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) and were selected because o f their criticality for achieving objectives which are consistent with
the government's own monitoring framework and to be inline with donor harmonization for general budget support.
The results framework for PRSC-4 has 10 prior actions and 12 triggers for PRSC-5. There are no benchmarks.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progressreviews conduciveto predictable and performance-based financial
support
The Bank's supervision o f the PRSC series i s aligned with the supervision o f the joint General Budget Support
program o f the G19. Both the Joint and the Mid-Year Review are a multi-sector exercises, and Bank staff participate
in all relevant sectors. Disbursements will be contingent on satisfactory progress towards a subset o f the PARPA's
medium-term objectives as set out in the PAF matrix. In addition, the review process i s explicitly designed to allow
announcing budget financing amount early in the year in the budget preparation cycle and to disburse early in the
budget year, a principle to which the Bank adheres.

                                                             ON
AND COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMF

29.     A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between the
Government and 19 donors (G19) providinggeneral budget support, including the
World Bank. This M o U is a breakthrough indonor harmonization inMozambique. It is
based on a set o f `fundamental principles': (i)
                                              predictability and alignment with domestic
systems; (ii)monitoring has to be done jointly and that all "conditionality" has to be
based on the common PAF; (iii)no separate reporting to the donors i s required; (iv)
mutual accountability. Reference i s made to the PRSC-3 document for details (and also
the Mozambique Program Aid Partnership website: www.pap.ora.mz ).

30.     Implementationof the Paris Declaration is monitored by the G19, the UN
agencies and other development partners. The big challenges are to align project aid
with the national budget system, integrate it as much as possible with the government's
treasury and reporting system, and reduce the number o f Project ImplementationUnits.
There has been substantial progress in 2006 and 2007 to bringproject aid on-budget, and
the percentage o f development aid now on-budget i s estimated at above 90 percent as o f
2007. As a result, the budget i s increasingly becoming a meaningful instrument for
decision-making on resource allocation, and linkingresources to results. The 2007 budget
submitted to Parliament made further progress. External resources increased by around
40 percent, most o f which due to recording more o f the project finance in the budget;
before these projects were off-budget. Interms o f next steps, after some initial delays, the
Government has finalized in September 2007 the multi-currency module to the Single
Treasury Account (Conta Unica do Tesouro, CUT) and i s actively encouraging donors to
put all their projects on-CUT (which will also ensure that the projects are on-budget). In
addition, the public financial management reforms and procurement reforms supported
by the G19 (and also supported by this PRSC series) are expected to facilitate increased
use o f country systems by IDA and other development partners.

31.       The Bank and the IMF cooperate very closely within their respective
mandates in assisting the Government to implement the PARPA. In order to
coordinate their work programs for the next two to three years, the IMF and the World
Bank teams inMozambique organized a one day retreat inMaputo during the first review
o f the Policy Support Instrument(PSI) on November 5, 2007. The IMF leads the policy
dialogue on macroeconomic policy (including fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate
policies), the integrated financial management information system (SISTAFE) and tax
and customs reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on public expenditure
management, sector structural reforms, reforms o f the civil service, and poverty and
social impact analysis. Areas o f close collaboration include banking supervision,
financial sector issues, trade issues, the PARPA, and external debt sustainability. The
practice o f holding joint IMF-IDA missions has both had synergistic benefits, and has
reduced the burden on Government o f multiple missions. Development partners are also
involved in specific policy discussions, since all stakeholders agree that many
macroeconomic policy outcomes have structural foundations that development partners
can usefully support. Even though the IMF i s not a member o f the G19 General Budget
Support donors group, the timing o f its missions i s such as to be synchronized with the
Joint and Mid-Year Review process o f the G19.

 V. THE PROPOSEDPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

A. OVERALLDESCRIPTION

32.       The proposed fourth poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-4) is the
second operation in a series          of three annual operations supporting the
implementationof the PARPA 11. The design and objectives of the PRSC series were
elaborated in the Program Document for the PRSC-3, and only a brief summary o f key
aspects i s provided inthis document.
33.       The PRSC series is fully harmonized within the joint donor (G19)
mechanism for the provision of general budget support. All the prior actions and
triggers o f the PRSC series are indicators contained in the PAF (see Annexes 2 and 3).
IDA'Sfocus will be geared at specific areas, which are a subset o f the PAF (which itself
i s a subset o f the strategic matrix o f PARPA 11). This i s an important feature o f the
proposed operations as, by relying on the PAF, the PRSC series will remain consistent
with the government's own monitoring framework and will also be in line with donor
harmonization for general budget support.
34.     The PRSCseries supportsa strategicsubset of objectivesfrom the PARPAI1
resultsmatrix. As intermediateoutcomes the PRSC series supports improvements in:
    (1) Macroeconomic management: Consolidate and deepen institutional reforms to
        strengthen public financial management system.
    (2) Reforms in governance: Support public sector reform, and also accelerate
        decentralizatioddeconcentration to enhance service delivery at the provincial and
        district level, and empower communities.
    (3) Economic development: Improve the business environment, by removing
        constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

35.     The PRSC-4 supports specific ongoing reforms which are part of the above
program. The PRSC-4 supports reforms to improve macroeconomic management by
maintaining at least 65 percent of the budget on priority sectors, continuing the rollout o f
e-SISTAFE,strengthening the Central Revenue Authority, continuing the implementation
o f the new State procurement system, and increasing the coverage and efficiency o f
internal and external audit bodies. The reforms to improve governance focus on the
implementation o f a census of civil servants, as a basis to create an integrated payroll
management system. Finally, in terms o f economic development, the PRSC-4 supports
the government's efforts to increase the amount of road maintenance and rehabilitation,
expanding the irrigated area, and expanding the number of farmers who benefit from
extension services, inorder to increase the adoption o f new technology.

36.     The policy matrix and results framework for PRSC series in Annex 1
presents the specific areas supported by the PRSC series. As indicated above, the
PRSC policy matrix and results framework i s a sub-set o f the PAF matrix used by the




                                            - 1 3 -

G19.14 It i s worth noting that some o f the entries appear as outcomes (kilometers o f
roads in good conditions; areas irrigated). IDA will continue to monitor also the
implementationo f the policy actions that make such outcomes possible.

37.     The criteria for selecting prior actions and triggers are based on their
criticality for contributingto achieve the PARPA-I1 objectives. In summary, these
criteria reflect the followingbroad principles:
         1. The expected policy or institutional reform is critical to remove a key constraint
        to poverty reduction and growth (based on the findings o f existing analytical
        work), or i s an implementation activity o f a reform initiated earlier.
        2. They are part o f the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and the
        assessment can be done easily, e.g. verifying whether a law or some regulation
        has been approved. (All assessments requiringperformance data and analysis are
        done duringthe Joint Review.)

38.        The program supported by the PRSC series has been informed by a
significantamountof analyticalwork completedover the past few years. A summary
o f the main analytical studies which have informed the design o f the PRSC series was
discussed in the PRSC-3 document."             The policies and reforms supported by the PRSC
focus on the challenges to sustained growth and poverty reduction inMozambique which
have been identified inthe stu'dies.


B. LEVEL FUNDING PRSC-4
             OF              FOR

39.        The amount of the operationis less than originally anticipated. The amount
of each o f the three annual operations in this PRSC series was anticipated at USD70
million, provided performance would remain satisfactory and pending the availability of
IDA resources. As discussed inthis document, progress with the implementation of the
program continues to be satisfactory, as i s also reflected in the conclusions of the G19
Joint Review in April 2007. However, as a result o f front loading o f IDA commitments
in FY06 and FY07, and the reduction in the Country Performance Rating for
Mozambique in FY08, however, the available IDA Resources for Mozambique in FY08
(the final year o f IDA-14, hence further front loading is not possible) are less than
anticipated; given that funds have already been committed to other operations this fiscal
year, the amount available for PRSC-4 i s USD6O million. This amount i s less than the

                          ~~




14While the 2007-09 PAF indicators will serve as the monitoringframework during the implementationo f
the PRSC series, the indicatorsfor 2006 are takenfromthe 2006 PAF (that was basedon PARPA-I).The

commitment o f USD70 million made to government and development partners after the
April 2007 Joint Review (but which was before FY08 IDA availability and
Mozambique's Country Performance Rating were known).                      In order to honor IDA'S
commitment on the level o f budget support in 2008 (ie., USD70 million during calendar
year 2008), the IDA team plans to accelerate the preparation o f PRSC-5 so that at least
USDlOmillion of it is disbursedin2008 (and the balance in2009), thereby bringingthe
PRSC disbursements in 2008 to the originally agreed level o f USD70 million. The actual
amount o f IDA available to Mozambique from 2008 onwards would depend, inter alia,
on the amount o f IDA resources in IDA-15 and Mozambique's Country Performance
Rating.

c.  PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTINGTHE REFORM PROGRAMSUPPORTEDBY THE PRSC

40.        The reform program continues to be broadly on track as confirmed by the
Joint Review in April and the Mid-Year Review in September 2007, as well as the
sixth review of the IMF'sPRGF in June 2007. As highlighted above, and detailed in
the PRSC-3 program document, the progress on the PRSC and the overall reforms
program i s monitored with the aid o f the PAF, in the context o f the joint donor (G19)
mechanism for the provision o f general budget support.l6Despite satisfactory progress in
implementing the agreed reform agenda, improving access to social and infrastructure
services, and strong macroeconomic performance, some weak areas were identified
where progress was slower than expected (but there were no reversals): the governance
area including        civil service      reform, judiciary       reforms,    and decentralization;
improvements in the business environment where there were excellent improvements in
some areas (registering a business) but not in others (licensing; new labor law;
reimbursement o f VAT refunds).

41.        The Joint Review in April 2007 considered the implementation of PARPA
I1in 2006 to be broadly satisfactory. The review of achievements against the agreed
PAF indicators in April 2007 found that there was good progress in terms o f public
financial management, and the expansion o f service delivery inhealth and education, but
that reforms in the area o f governance and business environment showed a mixed
performance. However, agricultural services revealed a poor performance. This issue was
raised at the highest political level, and performance in agriculture inthe first semester o f
2007 improved significantly. As noted during the Mid-Year Review o f September 2007,
the PAF indicators/targets for agriculture are likely to be met for 2007. The review also
noted the need to intensify efforts for rural development.

42.        The Mid-Year Review of September 2007 noted that overall progress
continued to be good, including an acceleration o f progress in agriculture, but that


l6The monitoringofprogresson the reforms i s done through the Joint Sector Working Groups, which also
includeGovernmentrepresentatives.The assessment is done onthe basis ofthe indicators containedinthe
PAF, andthrough an annual Joint Review conductedinApril. Another review inSeptember sets goals for
the subsequent year. The sector working groups havebecome a good mechanismfor policy dialogue, donor
harmonization, and for reachingagreement betweenthe Government and all the donors involved ina
specific sector. Furthermore, ajoint Budget Working Group meets on a quarterly basis with the
Governmentto monitor budget execution, particularly inthe priority sectors.


                                                 - 1 5 -

additional efforts were necessary inthe fight against corruption, improving the efficiency
o f the justice system, strengtheningthe management o f natural resources, and improving
the environment for private sector growth.

43.        Drawing on information from the Aide-Memoires o f the G19 joint reviews in
2007, this section highlights the recent progress and remaining challenges in the areas
supported by the PRSC, with a focus on the prior actions completed under PRSC-4.

Macroeconomic Management
44.      Mozambique's good macroeconomic performance has been a key element o f the
excellent growth record inthe past decade. Moving ahead there i s a need to continuously
improve the use o f public expenditures, consolidate macroeconomic stability, and
strengthen public finance management. Without improvements in these areas, the
country's highgrowth rate will be put at risk.

Improve the allocation and use of public expenditures
The objective of these reforms is to strengthen the allocation of public expenditures
through the budgetpreparation and executionprocess. Thefocus of PRSC-3 and PRSC-4
is on guaranteeing a minimum level of actual expenditures for priority sectors, while
PRSC-5 will support alignment of the actual expenditures with the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework.

45.      There i s need to improve the level of budget execution, and to ensure
adequate funding for priority sectors. A key constraint in the 1990s and early 2000s,
was the low level o f budget execution, which jointly with the relatively high share o f
expenditures channeled to non-priority activities, resulted in low levels o f expenditure in
priority sectors (as defined in the PAFWA 11, namely education, health, roads, water and
agriculture). In line with government efforts, in recent years there has been an
improvement in the level o f budget execution in recent years, and an increasing share o f
the budget has been allocated to priority sectors, as defined in the PARPA 11. Actual
expenditures in 2005 where at least 65 percent to priority sector (PRSC-3 prior action).
Similarly, actual execution of expenditure in thepriority sectors in 2006 was broadly in
line with the budgeted total, and total expenditures in priority sectors in 2006 reached
65percent (PRSC-I prior action). Moreover, in general there has been an improvement
in the level of budget execution, which on average reached 94.4 percent, in all sectors
(compared to 83.4 percent in 2005), with even better performance in the priority sectors
(97.4 percent). Compared with previous years, the sectors did not complain about late
availability o f funds, indicatingthat budget executionwas fairly smooth.

46.      The improvement in budget execution rate was due to several factors.
Notably, there were no delays i s the approval o f the annual budget, the implementation o f
e-SISTAFE(see below) facilitated a redistribution of the funds (especially inthe internal
investment component, resulting in a 100 percent execution), there was improved
communication and collaboration between the line ministries and the Ministry o f Finance
(MoF), and contributions by the development partners were roughly in line with the
treasury plans.

47.      Several challenges remain in the area of budget preparation and execution,
however, which will constitute the focus o f government efforts over the next few years:


                                           - 16-

          First, there is still limited information at functional and programming level,
          which limits the usefulness o f the Budget Execution Report at the level o f the
          sector and on cross-cutting issues. As part o f the implementation o f e-
          SISTAFE, the government i s working to adopt functional classifiers which
          will substantially improve the monitoring of the budget execution. Such
          information will also strengthen the monitoring of sectoral public
          expenditures which i s carried out by G19 development partners as part o f the
          annual Joint Review process.

          Secondly, while in 2006 the information on the external component improved
          significantly, there i s still room for improvement. An important step was the
          transfer in2006 o f the ODAMoz database to the G o M (www.odamoz.niz.org).
          It is envisaged that from 2007 onwards ODAMoz may serve as the prime
          information source on commitment and disbursement in the external
          component o f the budget and it also contains relevant information for the
          common funds (commitment and disbursement). A challenge i s the integration
          o f all donors in the ODAMoz, so that it can offer transparent, accessible and
          complete information. The updating o f the information in the ODAMoz will
          take place on four fixed deadlines, so as to feed the government's budget
          cycle (MTEF and OE). To this end the link between the MPD, the MF and
          other related organizations should be improved so as to ensure that
          information inthe ODAMoz i s reflected inthe MTEF and the OE.

          Third, progress with the Single Treasury Account (CUT) proceeded in 2006
          with the inclusion of the main common funds, but the direct execution o f
          expenditure i s still on a very low level and almost none o f the projects entered
          in the CUT. The multi-currency account should become operational by end-
          2007. The GoM remains committed to improve the amount o f percentage o f
           external funds on-CUT, and has committed to a target of 60 percent by 2009.
          It is necessary to elaborate an on-CUT guide,             with information on
           classification and reports, so that in 2008 a beginning can be made with the
          process to include more external funds inthe CUT.

           Fourth, there i s a need to strengthenthe MTEF and use it as the basis for the
           sectoral budget allocations, to support programmatic implementation o f
           PARPA I1(a proposed trigger for PRSC-5).

Strewthenmacroeconomicstabilitv bv improving:revenuecollection
The objective of     these reforms     is to raise more domestic revenue to support
Mozambique's poverty reduction programs and ultimately reduce aid dependency.
PRSC-3 supported the creation of the new Central Revenue Authority (Autoridade
Tributaria de Moqambique, ATM), PRSC-4 supported the operationalization of the A T M
through the adoption of its Information         Technology Plan, and PRSC-5 seeks to
consolidate the reform process resulting in an increase in total revenues.

48.    Macroeconomic stability and predictability is the crucial foundation for
growth andpovertyreduction. As highlightedinthe 2005 CEM, the main challenge in
terms of macroeconomic stability i s on the fiscal side, and namely that revenue
performance needs to improve because the Government's spending requirements in


                                            - 17-

education, health and infrastructure will likely continue to rise, at least pari passu with
population. In addition, aid as a percentage o f GDP i s likely to fall from its current very
high level o f 15 percent. Hence it is imperative that Mozambique raise more domestic
revenueto support its poverty reduction programs and ultimately reduce aid dependency.
The plan o f the PARPA-I1 is to raise revenue by 0.5 percent o f GDP annually. A critical
aspect o f this program, which i s supported by the PRSC series, i s to improve the
organization and capacity o f revenue institutions.

49.     The government tax reform program aims to develop a simpler,
comprehensive, fair and balanced taxation regime. Ingeneral the performance o f the
tax reform process was good, and characterized by continuous efforts to improve the
efficiency o f the tax administration, the consolidation o f the taxes and the modernization
o f customs proceedings for trade facilitation. As a critical part o f the reforms, the
government successfully established the Central Revenue Authority (ATM), which
integrates the general administration o f taxes and customs in one single entity, and
became operational and started to function formally when its president took office in
November 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action). As part o f the reforms, the Information
Technology Plan (PDTI) for 2007-2010 of the new Central Revenue Authority was
elaborated by end 2006 and approved in June 2007 (PRSC-4 prior action).                  The
finalization and approval o f the Information Technology Plan (PDTI) i s important for the
consolidation o f the reform and i s designed to ensure the development o f an adequate
system to manage and control information that supports all taxes, in particular in the
context o f the integration o f services and the management o f domestic taxes and customs
duties. During the 2007, the ATM faces an important challenge in the volume o f work
concerning legislation and o f the integration o f human resources and systems, to achieve
a harmonious integration o f the former General Directorates o f Customs and o f Taxes.

50.     Government efforts in consolidating the tax reforms and strengthening the
management of ATM, are resulting in increased total collected revenues. Total
revenues continued to grow in 2006 reaching 14.5 percent o f GDP, which i s below the
government target, but still represents and increase o f 0.4 percent o f GDP as compared to
2005. This i s in line with the authorities overall program to increase revenues by 0.5
percent o f GDP on an annual basis over the next few years, including reaching 14.9
percent o f GDP in 2007 (a proposed trigger for PRSC-5). The highest growth was in
income tax, which however still constitutes a relatively small percentage o f total revenue.
Taxes on goods and services continue to represent the most important part o f total
revenue, with a weight o f 53 percent, o f which taxes on international trade still are the
most important.

51.     More progress is still required to recover tax arrears. The amount collected in
2006 was below 60 percent o f the target and i s below the amount collected in 2005. The
division for arrears control was created inATM during 2006, with the task to follow and
control debts by means o f coercive collection. This led to an increase, relative to 2005, in
the number o f cases beingprocessed, but inlower amounts, incases which were close to
expiring. Priority for 2007 i s to concentrate on larger arrears and the improvement of the
control instruments using information technology.

52.     Given the process of regional integration in the SADC, and the inherent loss
of revenue from external trade, it will be critical to further enhance the revenue


                                             - 1 8 -

collectionefforts, The government is planning to strengthen further the efficiency of tax
administration and auditing, and to analyze and review the fiscal benefits code and its
implementation. Notably, as part o f the latter, inDecember 2006 the parliament approved
new legislation regarding the fiscal regimes for the mining and oil sectors, and the new
laws have become effective in mid-2007. The government i s also evaluating measures to
ensure the transparent management o f the revenues from the exploitation o f natural
resources.

53.     With respect to the facilitation of trade, good progresswas made in aligning
nationallegislation with internationalconventionsto simplify customs procedures,
with the approval o f several regulations. Special attention was also given to inspections
and to the strengthening o f the capacity to carry out post-clearance audits. In the course
o f 2006 the electronic memorandum was also implemented, which allows for information
availability in a timely fashion between the border posts and the clearance terminals,
leading to a reduction o f the waiting time for the start o f the customs clearance process.
The advanced clearance was also implemented, leading to a reduction of the storage time
o f merchandise in the terminals, given that they arrived after the start o f the clearance
process. The revision o f the risk profiles contributed to rapid decision-making concerning
riskymerchandise or imports, thus accelerating the customs clearance process. On a less
positive note, however, the installation o f scanners for merchandise inthe Port o f Maputo
has been associated with complaints about the level o f charges, and raised concerns about
the possible implications for Maputo's port competitiveness inthe region.

Improvethe efficiency and effectiveness of publicfinancialmanagement
The objective of this set of reforms is to institute an integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE).            PRSC-3 launched the software on a pilot basis,
PRSC-4 rolled out to most ministries at the central level, and PRSC-5 completes the roll
out to all Ministries at central andprovincial level.

54.     Mozambique's fiduciary accountability has improved significantly in recent
years, but challenges remain. The 2005 PEFA highlights that the weakest areas are
accounting, auditing and procurement. This i s a matter o f concern in its own right. As
articulated inthe 2005 CEM, it will also be critical for growth inthe next decade, because
(i)improvedspendingefficiencyisneededto achievebetter servicedelivery, whichin
turn is neededto spur growth, particularly in infrastructure, education and health;17 (ii)
total expenditure can no longer expand at the rate it used to, and are likely to remain at
24-25 percent o f GDP, making it essential to secure efficiency improvements in the
 future; (iii)without steady improvement inpublic finance management some o f the high
 levels o f donor funding may be put at risk.

 55.     The Government has embarked on a sequenced program of reform, and
 Public financial management (PFM) systems have shown major improvements in
 recent years. The reforms started with the approval of a new financial management law
 in 2001 and accompanying regulations in 2002, which set the basis both for modern
 accounting procedures and for procurement reform. Based on the PEFA assessment in
 2005, the authorities prepared and have been implementing the medium-term `Public

 17The PER2003 found that public works are substantially(20-30 percent)more expensiveinMozambique
 thaninthe region.


                                               - 19-

Financial Management Action Plan and Budget' (PFM-APB) for 2006-09, which has
been agreed with the donors and is financed through a multi-donor common fund. The
APB i s well-structured and the proposed phasing o f implementation is ambitious but
feasible.

56.     The cornerstoneof the authorities'actionplanto strengthenPublicFinancial
Management is         the implementation of the integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE). Following the initial pilot in three ministries inby
early 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action), in 2006 the basic functionality of e-SISTAFE was
rolled out to most spending ministries (22 Ministries) (PRSC-4 prior action).'8
Following the initial roll out, the full version o f the Direct Budget Execution Module was
finalized and rolled out largely according to plan to (almost) all remaining ministries at
the central and provincial levels in 2007. The roll-out was accompanied by an extensive
training program, involving 1249 users (more or less 6 users per cost center). Users have
acquired good operational skills and are now at a level o f beingable to formulate requests
for additional functionality.

57.     In addition to rollingout of e-SISTAFE, the government has started critical
complementaryreformsfocused towards achievingthe benefitsthat the e-SISTAFE
can deliver. Within the e-SISTAFE reform, one o f the results with the highest impact in
terms o f improvement in Public Finance Management i s direct budget execution
(according to the sequence o f commitment, verification, and payment), as this would
increase transparency, improve information on public spending and reduce the risk o f
diversion o f funds. The roll out and implementation o f e-SISTAFE in all Ministries at
central and provincial level by 2007 (a proposed trigger for PRSC-5), allows the
transition from the previous system o f advance payments towards a modern system o f
direct budget execution. Until recently the old system o f advance payments was still
being applied, limiting the impact o f the e-SISTAFE reform. Budget units are now
starting to make their payments directly by bank transfer from the Single Treasury
Account, which i s essential for the e-SISTAFEto lead to a reduction inbank accounts or
cash in the system and achieve its full potential regarding internal control and
transparency. Hence, the Ministry o f Finance i s now working to increase the level o f
effective direct budget execution for goods and services through e-SISTAFE. Inaddition,
the government is also developing a multicurrency module for the single treasury account
(CUT) by January 2008, to facilitate inclusion o f all donor-financed projects on-CUT.
Further, the government is working on the improvement o f the classifiers (program,
functional, regional), so as to provide detail sufficient to permit analysis o f poverty
impacts o f government spending.

Makethe Stateprocurementsystem for goods and services transparentand efficient
The objective of these reforms is to introduce and implement a new procurement system
that meets international standards of efJiciency and accountability. PRSC-3 supported
the creation of      the new central procurement institution. PRSC-4 supports the

18The ministries to which the system was rolled-out are now satisfactorily executing their budgets for
goods and services and capital expenditure. Payments o f salaries continue to be executed centrally by the
accounting department of the Ministry o f Finance.


                                                  - 20 -

operationalization of the unit. PRSC-5 supports the establishment of a monitoring system
to increase transparency and measure the effectiveness of the reforms.

58.       Substantial progress was achieved in 2006 in the implementation of the
procurement reforms. Revised regulations governing procurement were approved in
December 2005 so as to promote competition and transparency. A new central
procurement institution, the Functional Unit o f Supervision o f Acquisition (UFSA), was
established and staffed, and became operational in 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action). A
director, staff and consultants have been appointed, and a website i s also operational
(http:/lwww.ufsa.nov.mz).           In addition, following the identification of 776 Units for
Execution and Management o f Acquisition (UGEAs) at central and provincial level, a
first set o f 265 UGEAs had been established (as o f March 2007). Hence, most of the
activities envisaged as part of second phase of implementation of the procurement
reforms have been carried out (PRSC-Iprior action). These reforms were accompanied
by a comprehensive process of capacity building in the application o f the new
procurement regulations, aimed at increasing the number of specialized procurement
technicians. Specifically around 1600 technicians have beentrained at central, provincial,
district and local municipality levels, which will facilitate the adoption o f the new
procurement system at the decentralized level.

59.       Several challenges remain. Firstly, there are several areas where more progress
i s needed. For instance, while most UFSA staff and consultants have been appointed, not
all key positions have yet been adequately filled. Also, the link with the key ministries
through the sector specialists, as foreseen in the UFSA regulations, has only taken place
for the Ministry o f Public Works and Housing (MoPWH). Further, there have been
delays in completing the action plan for procurement reforms, the provision o f support to
the operation of UGEAs, the elaboration of the plan for the strengthening internal                        '
controls, and the elaboration o f a model to share information on procurement between
provinces/districts.       Second, an adequate monitoring system that would allow
measurement o f the performance o f the reform remains to be developed (a proposed
trigger for PRSC-5). Inthis context, the donors and government have agreed to adopt the
OECD/DAC methodology to evaluate national procurement systems.l9Third, there
remain various areas o f overlap with the other norms and regulations which need to be
clarified (examples: form o f inspections by the IGF and the TA, and the integration with
the e-SISTAFE).

Increasecoverape andefficiencvof internalaudit bodies
The objective of          these reforms is to increase efJiciency and accountability by
strengthening the internal audit institution (IGF). In order to achieve this PRSC-4 and
PRSC-5 support increased capacity of the IGF to conduct audits.


19 About five years have elapsed since the last Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), and the
government, development partners and the Bank are planning to carry out a systematic update on the
situation o f the procurement system inMozambique. Inthis regard, inearly 2008 the World Bank, in
collaboration with the Government's relevant agencies, principally UFSA, and the development partners,
will start work to: (i) stock o f what has been achieved inthe implementation o f the procurement
                       take
reforms; (ii)  determine what are the challenges that remain; and, (iii)
                                                                      suggest how they could be overcome.
The assessment will be carried out by using the OECD methodology for the assessment o f national
procurement systems.

60.      The internal audit institution (IGF) has been substantially strengthened in
recent years; audit coverage is expanding, and follow up of audit recommendations
i s beingmonitored. Most recently, in 2006 the government recruited 54 new technicians,
thus improving the inspection capacity for the coming years. Also, IGF finalized the
basic internal auditing manual. In parallel, there has been substantial progress in recent
years in expanding the coverage o f auditing at all levels o f government. The number of
audits completed by the IGF almost doubled in relation to 2005 and IGF carried out
almost all planned audit activities. From the total target universe (districts and
municipalities) 32percent was audited (PRSC-Iprior action). With the exception o f the
3 municipalities from the northern region, all audits foreseen for the districts and the
municipalities have been carried out, and the reports almost complete by the end o f 2006.
As many as 21 districts, all provinces except ZambCzia, and 30 municipalities were
visited, corresponding to 16 percent o f the districts and 91 percent o f the municipalities.
The government has also carried out an evaluation o f the compliance on the part o f the
audited entities with the recommendations formulated by the IGF. As part o f the
evaluation, the government has reviewed follow up on some 200 o f the most relevant
recommendations included in previous audit reports, and it found that approximately 70
percent o f these recommendations had been adopted.

61.       Areas of weakness remainin the functioning of the internalcontrolsystems.
There i s a need to continue to strengthen the coverage o f internal audit at central and
decentralized levels (a proposedtrigger for PRSC-5). Inaddition, there several aspects o f
internal control which require improvement. First, there are delays in the full
implementation o f the Subsystem for                        Internal     Control (SCI),           including the
institutionalization o f the Internal Control Organs (OCI) in some State bodies. It has not
been possible to realize most training activities o f the Subsystem for Internal Control
(SCI), owing to the non-availability o f financial resources.2oIn general, the performance
o f the Subsystem for Internal Control during 2006 can be considered poor, and moving
forward the elaboration and implementation o f the SCI plans should be a priority. An
effort by the SCI would pave the way for the OCIs to progressively assume the present
role of the IGF, thus allowing the IGF to concentrate on more complex audits and
coordination and counsel issues. Second, the internal monitoring and evaluation system i s
still weak and the sharing o f information between the different OCIs and the IGF i s not
well defined yet. It i s necessary to develop a model for coordination, supervision and
reporting o f the activities developed by the OCIs. Third, there remains a need to improve
the links with the UTRAFE, in particular with respect to training and access to e-
 SISTAFEby the auditors.

Increasecoverape and efficiency of externalaudit bodies
 The objective of        these reforms is to increase eficiency                     and accountability by
strengthening the external audit institution (Tribunal Administrativo, TA). I n order to

*' Activities foreseen within the context o f the SCI, but not realized, include training and integration o f
their recently recruited staff inthe various OCIs, the realization o f courses in auditing norms for inspector
generals and inspectors at sectoral level, training o f trainers for the SCI, the realization o f a course in
financial management for district administrations, and the elaboration o f manuals for specific
inspectiodauditprocedures concerning the management o f property, salaries, consigned revenue and
procurement.

achieve this PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 support increased capacity of the TA to conduct audits
and expand audit coverage.

62.      Substantial progress has been made in 2006 in improving the capacity and
performance of external auditing. The number o f audits realized by the Supreme Audit
Institution (Tribunal Administrativo, TA) has increased substantially over the past few
years, inparallel with its capacity:

Year                     2003       2004         2005     2006
Number of audits           5         29           69      167
Numberof inspections                              72       17

63.      The number o f audits carried out in 2006 was 167, o f which some reports were
only finalized in 2007. I n 2006, the auditors completed 115 audit reports, thereby
surpassing the target of 70financial audit reports (PRSC-4prior action). O f these, 55
audits were carried out in the districts, for the first time. In addition, 45 audit reports
werejudged inthe course o f 2006, which compares with 11 in 2005 and 4 in 2004. This
i s a significant improvement, as the judgment i s the final stage o f the audit (and results in
either the acquitting or the attribution o f financial responsibility). The good performance
in auditing was also markedby the submission of the Report and Opinion on the State
Accounts o f 2005 to the Parliament within the term stipulated by law. The reports have
now also been made available on the web page o f the TA (http://www.sislog.conlltd),-
together with the reports and opinions for the years 1998, 2003 and 2004. During2006
the TA also prepared its Corporate Plan2007-2010.

64.      Several challenges remain to increase the operational capacity of the TA.
Going forward, it i s important to continue to expand the coverage o f external audit
(PRSC-5 proposedtrigger). Inaddition, it will be important that action i s taken to reduce
the relative delays in evaluation and judging of the audit processes, and to achieve an
acceptable pace in the completion o f audit processes. Holding people accountable and
responsible i s an essential element for the creation o f credibility in the systems. It i s
important for the TA to use the mechanisms at its disposal to impose sanctions and, when
necessary, to forward to the prosecuting authority those processes that contain indications
o f crimes committed.

Governance
65.      Public Sector Governance continues to be an area with mixed performance and
remains a serious challenge. Despite some progress, implementation o f planned cross-
cutting public sector reforms i s slow. Government has created a Ministry for Public
Service (Ministirio da Funpjo Publica in Portuguese language) to coordinate public
sector governance reforms and to improve impact o f the reform process.                     The
decentralization efforts o f the Government are notable and much progress was made in
2006 with the introduction o f the investment budget for districts. However, concerns
remain about the implementation o f the investment budget and the lack o f appropriate
guidelines. Corruption and conflict-of-interest remain central issues.

                                               - 23 -

The objective of these reforms was to enhance the decentralization process by clarifying
the criteria for the allocation of district grants in the national budget (PRSC-3),
supporting the preparation of a (i) clear decentralization strategy (PRSC-4), and a (ii)
strategy for capacity building in planning andfinance at local government level (PRSC-
4). Thepreparation of the decentralization strategy has now been postponed beyond the
timeframe of this PRSC series (and is therefore no longer a trigger in this PRSC series).
 The national program for capacity building in planning andfinance at the district level is
expected to be completed with delay (now PRSC-5). As a result, the objectives will not be
fully met in light of bottlenecks in implementation.

66.      There was substantial progress towards greater decentralization in 2006. In
line with the effort to transform the district governments into budget units, in accordance
with the Law on Local State Bodies 08/2003 (LOLE), the government for the first time
allocated Investment Budgets for Local Initiatives (OIIL). As part o f the 2006 national
budget, the government allocated to each district an amount o f MT 7 million (considering
 all districts the total amounted to 3.4 percent o f the national budget). The OIIL
represents a significant step in the process o f fiscal decentralization, yet execution was
hampered by the late instructions to guide the use o f the funds. The participatory
 approach introduced in the allocation o f the district budgets at the local level, has created
 substantial impetus in the expansion o f the local councils in all districts. In the 2007
national budget, in addition to increasing the size of the transfers to the districts to a total
 o f 3.8 percent of the national budget, the government adjusted the allocation o f the funds
to each district based on three criteria: population, surface area o f the district andpoverty
 index (PRSC-3 prior action). However, there continues to be lack o f clarity about the
 guidelines for use o f the OIIL, and the Government has recently signaled that they want
 to reorient the OIIL funds towards activities that directly contribute to "local economic
 development". The increase infundinghas been going inparallel with increased capacity
building activities to strengthen planning and financial management capacity of local
 administrations. Inaddition, as mentioned above, in2006 there was a significant increase
 o f audits and inspections at district and municipal level.

 67.      Despite these positive developments, there have been delays in the
 preparation of the National Decentralization Strategy. Options for the formulation o f
 the National Decentralization Policy and Strategy were elaborated in 2006. As
 highlighted by G19 development partners, there i s a need for clarity on the
 responsibilities o f various levels o f the State, the fiscal intergovernmental architecture,
 the relation between the planning/execution on the part o f the sectors and the Local
 Administration. In addition, there i s a need to clarify issues related to the co-existence o f
 participatory and consultative democracy and representative democracy. The government
 has committed to address these shortcomings as part o f a National Decentralization
 Strategy to be prepared in 2008, which will also benefit from a process o f public
 consultations (originally a PRSC-4 trigger, but postponed to the next PRSC series in
 light ofthe new agreedtimeline).

 68.      Delays have also been experienced in the preparation and design of the
 National Program of Decentralized Planning and Finance (PDPF). A National PDPF
 document identifying the main pillars o f the National Program, its objectives, key
 activities and indicators, has beendrafted in 2007, and i s expected to be approved by the



                                             - 24 -

Minister of Planning and Development in early 2008 (originally a PRSC-4 trigger, but
postponed to PRSC-5 trigger). The program i s expected to include a focus on developing
capacity inplanning and PFM at the local level. The program will provide the basis for a
national PDPF project, allowing for a better harmonized support to the provinces and the
districts, to be financed by a common fund and through the State budget.

ImDrovehumanresources manapementinthe publicsector
The objective of these reforms is to improve the payroll management. PRSC-4 supports
carrying out a census of the civil service and integratingpayroll management within e-
SISTAFE, and PRSC-5 supports the creation of a single registry of State officials and
civil servants (Cadastro dos Funcionbrios Publicos, CAF). These measures also provide
a sound basisfor a comprehensive reform of civil service wages future PRSC series).
69.     There hasbeen importantprogressin the area of publicsector reforms. The
government created the National Authority for Public Service (ANFP) in2006, which has
become the Ministry o f Civil Service (MCS) in October 2007, and i s responsible for the
policies related to the management o f the human resources in the public sector, control
and inspection o f the public service, organization o f the public administration, as well as
the program o f reforms o f the public sector. In addition, notable achievements inpublic
sector reforms since the creation o f the ANFP/MCS are: (i) approval o f Phase I1of
                                                                 the
the Public Sector Reform Program, which ensures the continued implementation of the
Global Public Sector Reform Strategy; (ii)carrying out a detailed census of civil
servants in 2007 and creating an integrated payroll management database (PRSC-4
prior action) and the creating a single registry o f State officials and civil servants
(Cadastro dos Funcionbrios Publicos, CAF); (iii) campaign to issue identity cards, in
                                                      the
coordination with the Ministry o f the Interior, aimed at improving the quality o f the
services provided to the citizens; (iv) the establishment o f the national Anti-Corruption
Forum and the Technical Committee within the context o f the anti-corruption strategy.

70.      The government is also in the process of strengthening the civil service
payrollmanagement, using e-SISTAFE. The realization o f the census has allowed the
creation o f the CAF (a proposed trigger for PRSC-5). The CAF i s an integrated database
that allows the development and implementation o f features that support the strategic
management o f human resources, including the payroll. The CAF will feed into the e-
SISTAFE-compatible payroll module and database already developed in mid-2007, so
that the Ministry o f Finance can pay salaries via e-SISTAFE. Salary payments via e-
SISTAFE using the new integrated payroll management system is expected to start in
early 2008. This reform will also assist the government to eliminate `ghost workers'.21

71.      The governmentplansto reformthe publicsector wages in 2008. Inaddition,
the data from the census o f all civil servants will provide a sound basis for the preparation
o f the new salary policy, which i s planned in 2008. Given the intrinsic link between the
salary policy and the databases on personnel, it was decided that the approval and the
implementation o f the salary policy should be based on solid information about the
human resources o f the State.

EconomicDevelopment
72.        Accelerating shared growth requires improvements in the climate for private
sector development, adequate infrastructure, improved smallholder productivity, and
tackling key challenges such as the impact o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the need to
improve significantly the management o f natural resources. This PRSC series seeks to
address some but not all o f these challenges.

Improve the insurance and social protection sector
The objective of these reforms is to ensure the financial sustainability of the social
security system, and to ensure the adoption of best practice and transparency in the
management of the Social Security funds. Thepreparation of an actuarial study and the
elaboration of an investment strategy are supported in PRSC-5 (originally PRSC-4) and
will be implemented aspart of the next PRSC series (originally PRSC-5).

73.     The government has undertaken a broad program to strengthen the social
security system in Mozambique. In order to improve the system's management and
reorganize the Social Security System (INSS), the government has revised the legal
framework for social protection, which resulted in parliamentary approval o f the new
Law on Social Protection in 2007. It has also started an actuarial study on the Social
Security System, which i s expected to be completed in early 2008 (originally a PRSC-4
trigger, but postponed to PRSC-5 trigger). The actuarial study aims to assess the financial
sustainability o f the social security system, any quasi-fiscal liabilities, and to identify any
required adjustment to the level o f contributions which i s required to cover the services
provided by the system. The actuarial study i s also critical to allow the design o f a new
investmentstrategy in2008, to ensure the adoption o f best practice inthe management o f
the funds. A sound investment strategy will substantially contribute to strengthen the
financial system. As part o f the reforms, the government i s also preparing a reform to
regulate the private pension funds, following the approval o f the Law on Social
Protection, and to complement the reform o f the Social Security System. A consultancy
firm has been contracted to elaborate the Regulatory Decree on the PensionFunds, and a
report i s expected in2008.

Improve conditions for road traffic
 The objective of these reforms is to improve the quality of road infrastructure. PRSC-4
and PRSC-5 support increases in the extent of rehabilitation and maintenance of the road
network.

74.      Infrastructure, notably roads, has been identified as one of the top
constraints to increased private sector activity in Mozambique. In the context of
Mozambique, where about 70 percent o f the population still lives in rural areas, shared
growth i s necessarily linked to rural development. This will be complementary to the
various mega-projects in the extractive industries sectors, where Mozambique has been
very successful. These projects attracted large foreign direct investments and created
 growth spurts during the construction phase; but they are not labor intensive once
completed. Therefore, labor intensive rural and agricultural development i s essential to
reduce poverty.




                                            - 26 -

75.     Good progresswas made in 2006 in the road sector. An important milestone
in 2006 was the preparation of the new Road Sector Strategy (RSS 2007-2011) and the
finalization o f the Integrated Program o f the Road Sector (PRISE 2007-2009), which i s
derived from the RSS. The PRISE has a budget of approximately USD 1 billion over
three years, which will require some effort by the Government in terms o f provision the
counterpart funds and the provision o f VAT refunds (since some o f the donors do not
accept for their project funds to pay for VAT). The PRISE foresees a common approach
to the planning and reporting of all activities inthe roads sector, and it will require donors
to focus their funding on projects that are part o f the sector program. In addition good
progress was made in expanding the maintenance o f the network. The overall conditions
of the road network improved in comparison to theprevious years, with thepercentage
of roads in good condition increasingfrom 69 percent in 2005 to 73 percent in 2006
(PRSC-4prior action). The rehabilitation of primary and tertiary roads progressed in a
satisfactory manner, but performance in the rehabilitation o f secondary roads, and in
periodic and routine maintenance was below target. On the other hand the percentage o f
roads inpoor condition decreased from 28 percent to 24 percent. Around 3 percent o f the
roads network remains `impassable'.

76.     Challenges remain in implementing the institutional reforms of the road
sector, however. In terms of next steps, the Government needs to rapidly finalize the
restructuring o f the Roads Authority (started in 2006), including the recruitment o f staff
in accordance with the new organic structure of the Roads Authority. There is also a
need to strengthen the planning capacity to ensure timely sourcing o f the necessary
financial and human resources, and to improve the information sharing between the
various bodies that participate in road management and also with the development
partners, under the coordination o f the Road Fund.

Promote the construction and rehabilitation of awicultural infrastructure, and
increaseaccess to awiculturaltechnolodesand extensioninformation
The objective of these reforms is to increase agricultural production by supporting an
expansion in the irrigated area (PRSC-4 and PRSC-5), and an increase in the reach of
extension sewices (PRSC-4and PRSC-5).

77.     The most importantdriver of the reductionin poverty in Mozambiqueover
the last decade was agricultural growth, as highlighted in the 2005 CEM. But it is
expected that growth in agriculture will start to plateau out after the post-conflict
"bounce-back". In order to maintain the pace o f agricultural growth it will be necessary
to move to productivity enhancing methods. These will include improved farmer-relevant
research, broader dissemination of drought-resistant varieties, the expansion o f irrigation,
the encouragement        o f outgrower arrangements,      the encouragement o f farmer
associations, and the exploration of new models for access to financial markets by
smallholders.

78.     Agriculture grew by 8.6 percent in 2006, which is above the average GDP
growth rate of 8 percent, but expansion in irrigatedarea and extensionservices was
below target. The good performance was largely a result o f good climatic conditions
during the 2005/2006 agriculture season. In fact, the overall performance in the




                                             - 27 -

implementation o f reforms and improving service delivery has been somewhat slower
than programmed.

       In order to promote the use of irrigation techniques, the government has
       undertaken substantial investments in construction and/or rehabilitation of
       irrigation systems with public funds. I n 2006 the program resulted in around
       2,546 hectares benefitingfrom newly constructed and/or rehabilitated irrigation
       systems, paid by public funds (PRSC-4prior action). While this i s a substantial
       achievement, it only amounts to around 80 percent o f the government target in
       increasing irrigated area in 2006. Several constraints have been identified to the
       rapid rehabilitation and construction o f irrigation infrastructure: (i)the
       administrative delays in processing these projects, partly due to their complexity;
       (ii) lackofqualitycontrolservicesfortheconstructionofirrigationworks;(ii)
           the
       the high unit costs for the construction and rehabilitation of irrigation
       infrastructure. The government has taken action to address these constraints and
       as a result during the first semester o f 2007 it has expanded irrigated areas by an
       additional 3,240 hectares, corresponding to around 81 percent o f the total target
       for 2007 (also a proposedtrigger inPRSC-5).

       To increased reach o f the extension services the government improved the
       working conditions of the extension agents in 2005/2006 agricultural season, by
       improving access to means o f transportation and increasing the number o f
       farmer's field schools, from 84 to 157. I n line with Government's efforts to
       extend the scope of the agricultural extension services, the percentage of
       farmers that adopted at least one new technology in 2006 was about 21 percent
       (PRSC-4prior action). While this represents an improvement (by 13 percent) in
       comparison to 2005, it i s only about 2/3 o f the target o f 30 percent o f farmers.
       The improvement is largely due to an increase in the number o f small-scale
       farmers assisted by public extension, including outsourcing (191,629 small-scale
       farmers, 77,009 o f whom are women).          The improvements in the reach of
       extension services has continued to accelerate, and inthe first semester o f 2007 as
       many as 210,000 small scale farmers have already benefited from extension
       services, which corresponds to 94 percent o f the total target for 2007 (also a
       proposed trigger for PRSC-5). In addition, in 2007 the government has prepared
       and approved a new extension services strategy aimed at further strengthening the
       effectiveness and efficiency o fpublic extension services.

79.    Other reforms have also been pursued, including in facilitating the use of
land. In 2006, the government also made progress to simplify the processing for the
granting o f "user rights" land titles (DUAT), and the percentage o f DUAT requests
processed within the period o f 90 days (foreseen in the Land Law) increased to 74
percent. The main causes for the still significant delays are: the delay in the issuing o f
opinions by the entities involved in the process, and devolution o f processes with badly
formulated projects inorder to be corrected.

80.    The critical importance of the agricultural sector for growth and poverty
reductionis fully recognized,and the delays in achievingresultson the ground have
raisedconcerns at the highestlevel of government. As a result, inaddition to the steps


                                          - 28 -

mentioned above to accelerate irrigation provision and increase the reach o f extension
services, several additional institutional measures have been taken to ensure that
performance inthe agricultural sector accelerates in2007 and 2008. First, a new Minister
o f Agriculture was appointedby the President inMarch 2007, and was given the mandate
to obtain results on the ground (by taking measures to accelerate agricultural productivity
growth). Second, during 2006 the Ministry o f Agriculture (MINAG) drafted,a document
highlighting its priorities, which served as the basis for the preparation o f the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2008-2010.               The MTEF i s expected to
facilitate medium-term planning and increase the focus o f government action and
investments towards improving the impact in the field. Notably, the MTEF envisages
that expenditures on institutional development will decrease substantially, in favor o f
investmentsto support production at the local level. Third, inorder to improve the quality
o f statistics and the management o f the sector, the Department o f Management
Information System was created and became operational in 2006, albeit some technical
staff positions remain to be filled. Fourth, the PROAGRI-I1 started in 2006 and i s
characterized by the development and application o f new instruments to plan, manage
and control the activities o f the Ministryo f Agriculture (MINAG).


D. PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTINGTHEAGREEDPRIORACTIONSFORPRSC-4

81.      The implementation of the overall program supported by PRSC series is
satisfactory. The progress in implementingthe program supported by the PRSC-4 has
beendiscussed above, and a detailed list o f the prior actions for the proposed PRSC-4 is
summarized below (see also Table 2, for a comparison with earlier indicative triggers).
Overall significant progress has beenachieved inpublic financial management, including
procurement and auditing, strengthening the management o f human resources in the
public sector, and improving the conditions for road traffic. However, some PRSC
supported reforms in decentralization, in the social security system, and in agriculture
have progressedslower than anticipated.

E. AGREEDTRIGGERS PRSC-5 FOR

83.    The next operation (PRSC-5) would support the consolidation of the
government's achievements in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public
financial management, by continuing to roll out the e-SISTAFE, raising domestic
revenues, implementing the new procurement systems at all levels o f government, and
strengthening the internal and external audit bodies. It would also promote economic
development by strengthening critical infrastructure in roads and irrigation, improving
farmers' access to extension services, and strengtheningthe social security system.

84.    The successful conclusion of the Joint Review remains as a key underlying
condition. The successful conclusion of the Joint Review, where the performance in all
sectors i s thoroughly assessed according to the PAF, continues to be the fundamental
condition for going forward with PRSC-5, and for determining the amounts.
85.    The PAF triggers that will informthe decision as to whether to proceedwith
the preparation of the PRSC-5 fall under the three areas supported by the PRSC
series. All the twelve triggers for PRSC-5 are drawn from the 2007-2009 PAF, and only
include indicators that will be assessedby the Joint Review o f April 2008.
86.    The triggers underpinning government reforms to strengthen macroeconomic
management,cover the areas of resource allocation for poverty reduction, institutional
reforms to enhance domestic revenue mobilization, budget management, procurement
systems, and auditing:

       The Ministry o f Finance ensures that the total allocation to priority sectors in the
       2008 budget i s inline with the MTEF.

    0  The Ministry o f Finance rolls out the basic functionality o f e-SISTAFE to 25
       ministries,organs, and at least 291 UGEsby end2007.

    0  The Ministryo f Finance increases total revenues in2007 by at least 0.5 percent of
       GDP.

    0  The Ministry o f Finance continues the implementation of new procurement
       system up to the district level by ensuring that the monitoring system is
       operational, and allows performance measurements establishing baselines for a
       monitoring system which allows performance measurements (as indicated by: (i)
       availability o f information on public purchases available from UFSA that show
       that at least 50% o f contracts o f the public sector were subject to public tender in
       accordance with the current Mozambican procurement legislation; (ii)     information
       on other modalities o f contract with the due justification in at least 90% at the
       central level and 50% at the district and provincial level communicated to UFSA;
       (iii) processofcomplaints,asdefinedinthecurrentMozambicanprocurement
             the
       legislation, i s operational and UFSA has data on the process and decisions
       available).

    0  The Ministry o f Finance ensures that at least 30 percent o f central and provincial
       level bodies have operational internal audit units (also referred to as `internal
       control units') in2007.



                                          - 33 -

    0   Mozambique's Court o f Accounts (Tribunal Administrativo, TA) concludes its
        opinion o f at least 90 financial audits o f Ministries and State agencies in2007.

87.     In the area of governance, the triggers continue to support decentralization and
the reforms o f the civil service:

      0    The Ministry o f Planning and Development approves the National Program for
           DecentralizedPlanning and Finance.

      0    The Ministry of Civil Service creates the single registry o f State officials and
           civil servants (Cadastro dos Funcionarios Publicos, CAF).
88.     Inthe area o f economic development,the triggers support government efforts to
foster economic development by adopting reforms to improve the investment climate,
and by supporting the provision o f essential infrastructure, such as the road network and
irrigation; andbetter agricultural extension services:

           The Social Security Institute (Instituto Nacional de Seguranqa Social, INSS)
           completes the actuarial study and the elaboration of its investment strategy.

           The Roads Authority (Administraqio Nacional de Estradas, ANE) rehabilitates
           and maintains the Mozambique's national classified road network to ensure that
           76 percent o f the classified network will be in good or fair conditions by end-
           2007.22

           The Ministry o f Agriculture constructs and rehabilitates at least 4,000 hectares
           o f irrigated area in2007.

      0    The Ministry of Agriculture increases access to technologies and extension by
           ensuring that at least 222,300 small scale farmers are assisted by public
           extension services in2007, including sub-contracting.


                        VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

89.      Implementation procedures for the PRSC-4 (in terms of monitoring and
evaluation, fiduciary aspects, and auditing; as well as environmental, poverty and
social aspects) are the same as those proposedin the programdocumentfor PRSC-
3. Reference is made to that document for all implementation arrangements. Only risks
(and mitigating measures) to the reform program are detailed below.


A. MONITORINGSUPERVISION
                      AND

90.      The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs is aligned with the supervision of the
joint General Budget Support program of the G19. As discussed above, the Bank's


22This is the original target from PARPA 11, andthe PAF. However, ANE has recently completed a new
road classification survey andthe revised figures from the survey will be incorporated inthe PAF inearly
2008. The new figures, as reported inthe IntegratedProgramofthe Road Sector (PRISE 2007-2009), are as
follows: baseline 64% in2006; and the targets are: 67% for 2007; 70% for 2008; 73% for 2009; 75% for
2010 and 77% for 2011.


                                                   - 34 -

supervision o f the PRSCs i s aligned with the supervision o f the joint General Budget
Support program o f the G19. Inorder to reduce the transaction costs for the Government,
the Bank carries out all supervisionjointly with the other donors. Inaddition to the two
annual joint reviews, the supervision o f the PRSC i s done on a continuous basis in
harmonization with the other general budget support donors, through the monthly joint
government-donor steering committee meetings. Progress in each sector i s monitored by
joint government-donor sector working groups. Bank staff actively participates in these
meetings through its staff in the field offices and Washington (through missions or by
videoconference). Furthermore, the Bank participates in joint IMF-Bank missions to
monitor progress inthe macroeconomic framework. The Bank and the Fundalso monitor
jointly progress inimplementing the PARPA-11.

91.     The Government,with technicalassistancefrom IDA and other development
partners, is workingto strengthenthe monitoringsystem of the Strategic Matrix of
PARPA-11,in the context o f the development of an integrated national Monitoring and
Evaluation system. Monitoring o f the P A W A I1 i s carried out on the basis o f the
 `Strategic Matrix' prepared inearly 2006 and included inthe P A W A I1document. Sector
working groups, including representatives o f each relevant Ministry, Ministryo f Planning
and Development, donors and technical assistance, worked to select the key PARPA I1
objectives in each sector and corresponding results indicators, actions, and output
indicators. A Quality Control Group led by the Ministryo f Planning and Development
and by the chair o f the G19 was set up to oversee finalization o f the Strategic Matrix and
identification o f key indicators. Implementationo f sector specific matrices i s expected to
be carried out by line Ministries and sector agencies, while the overall poverty
monitoring i s the responsibility o f the National Statistic Institute (INE). The Bank
 supports the Government's effort to ensure the timely collection and analysis o f the
 Strategic Matrix indicators to be usedby the relevant agencies implementing the Strategic
Matrix: Ministry o f Planning and Development, line ministries and agencies at central,
provincial and district levels. In addition, following finalization o f the Strategic Matrix
with technical support from the Bank, inJuly 2007 the MonitoringTeam within Ministry
 o f Planning and Development began preparation o f Technical Notes for each indicator.
A national workshop involving M&E units in ministries i s planned for early 2008. The
 team will then prepare a working plan to define decentralized level o f responsibility in
 monitoring indicators involving provincial level o f government. Once the monitoring
 system is inplace, Government will focus on refining the indicators for the 2009 review
 andupdate o f the Strategic Matrix.

 92.    Various other activities are underway to strengthen the monitoring and
 evaluation capacity of Government. Notably, the Government with support from
 DANIDA has also started a training program of government officials at central and
 decentralized level in the preparation o f Log-Frame matrices and the carrying out cost-
benefit analysis o f projects and activities.


 B. FIDUCIARYASPECTS

 93.     Fiduciary aspects and strengthening of the Government's own systems are
 key in this operation. As indicated in the PRSC-3 document, the public financial



                                             - 35 -

management system i s considered reasonably adequate to support the PRSC series.
Weaknesses are found in internal control systems, the limited coverage o f the external
audit, and the high-level o f off-budget spendingmainly from external project finance. An
action plan on PFM reforms (discussed above), focusing on comprehensiveness and
financial accountability system i s being implemented. The PRSC series supports
implementation o f key reforms in the action plan, in close coordination with the IMF
program. Public financial management has been improving steadily in line with
government commitment to reform, and the dialogue between the Government and the
donors has beenconstructive.


C. DISBURSEMENT      ANDAUDITING

94.     Disbursement and auditing procedures remain the same as indicated for
PRSC-3. The proposed credit will be disbursed following standard IDA disbursement
procedures. The credit will be released as a single tranche at the request o f the Ministry
o f Planning and Development. IDA will deposit the funds in a dedicated foreign
exchange account o f the Bank o f Mozambique inFrankfurt. It i s the same account which
i s usedby other GBS donors to transfer their GBS contributions, as specified in the MoU.
Within two working days, Bank of Mozambique will credit the Metical equivalent
counterpart funds to the Transit Account o f the Ministry o f Finance dedicated to GBS
funds. It will be transferred from the dedicated GBS Transit Account to the Central
Treasury Account in accordance with the treasury plan and will be used as state budget
revenue and recorded in the state accounts as such. Auditing procedures are the same as
defined inthe MoU. A legally registered, private and independent audit company meeting
international standards will perform annual audits based on the quarterly financial reports
according to Terms o f Reference attached to the MoU. The audit costs will be met by
GoM. The final audit report will be submitted annually to G o M as well as to GBS donors
including the Bank no later than three months after the year's end.


D. ENVIRONMENTAL,      POVERTYAND SOCIAL ASPECTS

95.     The reforms related to roads, irrigation, and agriculturalextensions are not
expected to have significantenvironmentaleffects, becauseof the systems in placeto
manage them. The PRSC series supports policy actions that create the enabling
environment to support poverty reduction, and which by themselves do not have a direct
environmental impact. It i s expected, however, that the private and public regular
investment activities which may result from such policy actions, could have stronger
impacts on the environment. The legal framework for the environment i s relatively well
developed in Mozambique. The framework for environmental management in
Mozambique i s defined by the Law o f the Environment (Law no20/97), which applies to
all public and private activities that may influence environmental aspects. All activities
that may result in a significant impact on the environment are subject to an
Environmental Impact Assessment, which has to precede any issuing o f licenses and
investment activity. The Ministry for the Co-ordination of Environmental Affairs
(MICOA) i s the main entity responsible for conducting Environmental Impact
Assessments. The capacity o f MICOA, however, is limited due to financial and technical


                                           - 36 -

capacity constraints, and the potential environmental impacts o f such interventions i s
analyzed and monitored by the responsible authority. For example, in the case o f the
rehabilitation and construction o f the road network, the National Roads Authority has
received institutional strengthening for environmental management under the Bank-
supported Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program, in particular
through the social and environmental unit of the National Roads Authority. A similar
situation prevails in the case o f the expansion o f irrigated agriculture. The Ministry o f
Agriculture has received much support - including from the Bank - to build up its
capacity to carry out EIA's. The institutional framework for the water sector i s largely
consistent with international good practice, and includes the ongoing establishment o f
Regional Water Administrations (AMs) responsible for water resource management.
Some additional details are providedbelow:

96.    Roads rehabilitation and maintenance: IDA'Sproject on Roads and Bridges
Management and Maintenance Project (RBMMP)                 finances routine and periodic
maintenance o f the national road network through a pooled fund, while construction and
rehabilitation are funded directly by IDA investment lending. As part o f this operation,
the Bank has already verifiedthe government capacity to adequately address and mitigate
any environmental risks.

97.    Irrigation: Although IDA i s not presently involved in financing irrigation in
Mozambique (a project focusing on the development o f irrigation i s in the pipeline for
FY09), irrigation investments are part o f the second phase o f the government's National
Agricultural Program (PROAGRI II),      and i s funded by a group o f development partners.
As part of the PROAGRI I1 a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been
carried out in order to provide the Ministry o f Agriculture (MINAG) and other
stakeholders with a tool for strategic management o f environment issues that will result
in the implementation of PROGAGRI 11. An action plan to mitigate potential negative
impacts has been prepared as part of the SEA. Moreover, it should be emphasized that
since the late 1990s until present, MINAG has been emphasizing small scale irrigation
projects (2 to 20ha), which are less likely to have significant environmental impacts.

98.     Extension systems and Integrated Pest Management (IPM): While the Bank i s
not directly involved in supporting the agricultural extensions in Mozambique, the
relevant Government departments are aware and able to address any negative effects
related to the use o f new technologies in agricultural production. The government's
extension system supports IPM. During the PROAGRI I,an environmental unit was
created within MINAG, which pushed for the establishment o f IPM and safe use o f
pesticides. This environmental unit also trained public and private sector extension staff
on management o f pesticides. A Pilot Plan for I P M was started and implemented, and
the plan i s currently beingrevisedinorder to scale up implementation.

99.     Beyond the need to ensure that the environmental impacts of reform
supported by the PRSC is mitigated, the sustainable use of Mozambique'snatural
resources (land, mining, fisheries, forestry, water) represents a great opportunity
for poverty reduction as well as social and economic development, and needs to be
strengthened. As outlined inthe 2005 CEM, public revenues from naturalresource rents
could be increased from USD31 million to USD82 million per year under current
economic conditions, mostly by improving transparency and fairness in the issuing o f


                                             - 37 -

licences, quotas and concessions and in the collection and use o f revenue. Sustainable
exploitation o f natural resources by communities and individuals should be promoted to
contribute directly to poverty reduction and livelihood security. Investments inextractive
and exploitative industries can promote further growth and economic activity through
providing markets for local goods and services as well as inputs for processing industries.
Licensing and taxation o f natural resource use can provide significant revenue for
Government, which in turn, can support funding development and poverty reduction
programs, especially where (local and global) market demand and prices allow significant
margins. However managing these resources i s complex. While GOM legislation and
policies recognize and seek to facilitate the role o f different models o f resource use for
poverty reduction and development, little attention has been given to the specific
mechanisms for: (i)access, (ii)promoting efficient use and (iii)monitoring and
compliance with existing norms. This has lead to a situation where regulations appear to
have produced unnecessarily complex procedures that create opportunities for rent
seekingand corruption, harming both the poor and private commercial interests. Over the
next few years IDA, in collaboration with the IMF and other development partners, will
work closely with Government to maximize the benefits from the sustainable exploitation
o f natural resource. An important step to enhance the revenue collection efforts was the
approval by the parliament in December 2006 o f the new laws on the fiscal regimes for
the miningand oil sectors, which have become effective inmid-2007.

100.     The poverty and social impacts of the policies supported by the PRSC series
are expected to be positive. Analysis carried out on the impacts o f growth on poverty
reduction in Mozambique, has shown positive links, which has so far not been
accompanied by significant increases in inequality. As highlighted in the Program
Document for PRSC-3 the poverty reduction impact o f the policies supported by the
series i s expected to be significant, increasing the likelihood that Mozambique will reach
the first Millennium Development Goal. The specific country policies supported by the
PRSC series are not expected to have significant distributional and social impacts, except
possibly positive ones arising from the irrigation investments, the expansion of
extensions services, and the increased effectiveness o f the tax administration system (as
the tax system is considered to be reasonably progressive).


E. RISKSANDRISKMITIGATION

 101.    The risks to this operation fall in the same four areas already flagged in the
PRSC-3 document (as risks for the whole PRSC series), and relate to: (i) potential for
                                                                            the
macroeconomic shocks, (ii)administrative capacity to implement reforms and
decentralization, (iii)deterioration in governance that could compromise economic
reforms, and (iv) the impact o f HIV/AIDS. While there continues to be progress in the
capacity to mitigate macroeconomic shocks and building administrative capacity, these
are long term processes, and it will take a long time for these risks to be eliminated.
Additional efforts are required to mitigate risks inthe area o f Governance and inthe fight
against HIV/AIDS, and accordingly IDA i s increasing its efforts in these two areas.
Details for each o f these four areas are providedbelow:




                                             - 38 -

102.    One set of risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic
instability. Instability may arise as a result of terms of trade shocks, climatic shocks,
financial  sector    weakness,    regional instability,   or  unpredictability    o f donor
disbursements. Some o f these risks are exogenous and could be more important in the
long term rather than being o f concern to PRSC-4 itself. Considering the high level o f
reserves, the robust increase o f exports over the past five years, a flexible exchange rate
regime and low external debt vulnerability, the likelihood o f terms o f trade shocks
causing severe macroeconomic instability i s low, even though no stabilization
mechanism exists at this point. Mozambique also remains vulnerable to drought, floods
and cyclones. To mitigate the country's vulnerability to climatic shocks, the Bank i s
working with government to prepare a Country Disaster Risk and Vulnerability
Assessments (under the GF DRR Track I1program) which will lead to recommendations
to strengthen the disaster response institutions. It i s worth highlighting that the
government capacity to handle natural disasters i s improving, as demonstrated by it's the
handling o f the response to the floods and the cyclone which affected the central
provinces o f Mozambique in early 2007, for which the Government has been widely
praised. The new legal framework for the banking sector and strengthened supervision
have reduced the risk o f banks accumulating a high share o f non-performing loans, and
reduced the      vulnerability  o f Mozambique's       financial   sector.   Regarding the
unpredictability o f donor disbursements, the Government has made significant progress
to make them more predictable inthe short andmediumterm, last but not least by signing
the M o Uwith the 19 GBS donors and several MoU's for sector support.

103.    A second set of risks, relates to the macroeconomic impacts of new mega-
projects. Mozambique has huge potential to gain from new mega-project investmentsif
they can be proactively identified and marketed, and if the related risks are adequately
managed. Major risks related to debt sustainability, government exposure including
quasi-fiscal activities, ensuring an optimal fiscal/BOP impact and a healthy investment
climate, and ensuringthe sustainability o f investments. To mitigate these risks, the Bank
andthe Fundare working closely with government to strengthenprocesses related to the
selection and monitoring o f new mega-projects to minimize risks, while maximizing the
benefits for economic growth and poverty reduction.

104.    A third set of risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement
reforms and effective decentralization. To mitigate this risk, the Government and
donors agreed during the Joint Review to develop an integrated strategy for capacity
development in public finance management, and to strengthen the coordination and
management of reforms. A new strategy for the second phase o f the public sector
reforms was agreed with all stakeholders including the development partners and was
approved by Cabinet in October 2006. To strengthen capacity at the district level and to
improve control mechanisms (auditing). The Government is about to finalize its strategy
for capacity building at the decentralized level. Upon finalization o f the strategy, the
development partners, including IDA, are planning to integrated several decentralization
projects into a national program that i s expected to deliver capacity building and
oversight more effectively.

105.    A fourth set of risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could
compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. The Joint Review in


                                           - 39 -

April 2007 has noted that reforms in the legal andjudiciary fronts are not moving at the
desired pace. A deterioration in governance can have negative effects on economic
growth and compromise poverty reduction. To mitigate this risk, IDA i s increasing its
activities inthe areas o f Governance. Strengthening voice and accountability i s one o f the
three pillars o f the Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy approved by the Board in
May 2007.       IDA already holds an active policy dialogue with the authorities on the
subject and closely monitors developments associated with governance. In addition, the
restructured Public Sector Reform Project has a new legal sector capacity building
component. A further approach to enhance accountability o f the executive i s increased
disclosure o f information to the public, particularly regarding financial management.
Some progress has been made through the use o f an official internet portal o f the
Government, but more effort i s still required. Also, as part o f the activities supported by
the CommGAP Trust Fundin Mozambique, IDA is working to enhance citizen's voice,
strengthen the media, and modernize the government's communication functions. Last
but not least, IDA is working with Government to carry out a program o f beneficiary
surveys to increase public involvement inthe monitoring o f service delivery.

106.     A final set of risks concerns the impact of HIV/AIDS. This pandemic has two
potential impacts: it can reduce human and institutional capacity to deliver public
services and it may pose a long-term contingent liability. Free ARV treatment i s rapidly
expanding financed by donors. Should donor support wane at some point, then there
would be big pressures for the health budget to pay for it. IDA i s therefore working
closely with Government and development partners to develop a medium term
framework for financial needs in the health sector as a whole, and i s also supporting
Government in preparing its applications to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. IDA i s
taking the HIV/AIDSpandemic very seriously and i s dealing with it as an essential cross-
cutting issue in all o f its projects in addition to having two dedicated HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment programs.23




23The Bank is providing financial and technical assistanceto support the government inimplementing its
HIViAIDSResponseProject (MAP)which aims to slow the spread ofHIV/AIDS inMozambique and
mitigate the effects o fthe epidemic, through prevention, care, treatment and mitigation. The Bank i s also
supporting implementation o f the Treatment Acceleration Project (TAP) inMozambique which covers: (i)
scaling-up o fHIV/AIDS care and treatment; (ii)    strengthening institutional capacity o f M O H for
HIV/AIDScare andtreatment; and (iii)     facilitating regional learning from the TAP country experiences.

   IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
                                 with Mozambique


On June 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with M~zambique.~~

Background

The Mozambican economy has continued to perform well in recent years and is
increasingly resilient to exogenous shocks. Real GDP growth has picked up in 2006
led by a recovery in agricultural production and construction activities while the trade
balance improved due to a surge in exports. Headline inflation has fallen to single
digit levels anchored by a prudent monetary stance. The outlook for 2007 is for
continued strong growth, inflation in the range of 5-7 percent, and a sustainable
fiscal and external position, with some risks related to a further rise in oil prices.

Policy challenges remain, however, in sustaining Mozambique's growth takeoff and
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The stabilization effort and a
first-wave of reforms helped sustain a growth of 8 percent a year, on average, since
the early 1990s. Broad-based growth and foreign aid, including debt relief, helped
reduce poverty and improve social indicators. The experience of countries that have
kept growth accelerating over the long run suggests a need to consolidate
macroeconomic stability and implement second-generation reforms, including a
scaling-up of basic services to address human capital and infrastructure gaps.


24 UnderArticle IV of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusseswith officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On returnto headquarters,the staff prepares a report,which forms the
basisfor discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion,the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,summarizesthe views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmittedto the country's authorities.


                                        - 53 -

The arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) helped
maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of exogenous shocks and addressed
the structural weaknesses identified in the Ex Post Assessment (EPA, IMF/04/53).
Overall performance under the program has been good, which has helped the
authorities maintain inflation control and a comfortable level of international reserves
in the face of exogenous shocks. The authorities also completed reforms identified in
the EPA-particularly in strengthening revenue mobilization by creating a central
revenue authority (ATM), improving expenditure efficiency through the rollout of a
government financial management information system (e-SISTAFE), and addressing
vulnerabilities in the financial system.

The three-year Policy Support Instrument (2007-1 0) is focused on consolidating
macroeconomic stability to sustain Mozambique's growth takeoff in the context of
scaled-up foreign aid. Fiscal policy will be reinforced to finance additional priority
spending in a sustainable manner and ensure that a scaling-up of aid-financed
expenditures reaches the most productive and pro-poor sectors. Monetary control
will anchor inflationary expectations while a flexible exchange rate regime will help
maintain competitiveness and a comfortable level of international reserves to
cushion against exogenous shocks. The structural program aims at improving the
business environment by deepening the financial system and reducing the cost of
doing business, as well as strengthening the fiscal and transparency regime of the
natural resource sector. Institutional and capacity building need to keep pace with
the rapid structural transformation of the economy and facilitate the implementation
of second-generation reforms.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Directors
commended the Mozambican authorities on the impressive macroeconomic
performance and overall satisfactory program performance since the last Article IV
consultation. They noted that the economy has been resilient to numerous
exogenous shocks, and the outlook is for continued strong growth, moderate
inflation, and a sustainable fiscal and external position. Progress has also been
made in reducing poverty.

Directors agreed that there are policy challenges related to sustaining Mozambique's
growth takeoff and to achieving the MDGs. The strategy to consolidate
macroeconomic stability in the context of a continued scaling-up of foreign aid and
the acceleration of a second wave of reforms outlined in the authorities' poverty
reduction plan (PARPA II) for 2006-09, to be monitored under the new Policy
Support Instrument arrangement, should help sustain strong broad-based growth.

Directors noted that consolidating macroeconomic stability would require
persevering with sound fiscal and monetary policies, as well as prudent public debt
management and public finance reforms. In this regard, the medium-term fiscal
framework will need to continue to target an annual 0.5 percent GDP revenue
increase and no recourse to financing from the domestic financial system. This
should help contain inflation and allow private sector credit to expand further and



                                           - 54 -

decrease its cost, while maintaining competitiveness and debt sustainability and
reducing aid dependency.

Directors agreed that the 2007 budget was appropriate as it targeted a 0.5 percent of
GDP rise in domestic revenue with the share of priority expenditures exceeding 65
percent of total spending. The rollout of the public financial administration system (e-
SISTAFE) to all public entities at the central and provincial level, and direct
execution of a greater share of current spending should improve monitoring of
expenditures. The finalization of guidelines to include donor-funded projects in the
single treasury account (CUT) and e-SISTAFE as well as the opening of a
multicurrency CUT should be expedited to encourage the donors to transfer projects
on CUT.

Directors noted that the public sector reform program is at a critical juncture. They
looked forward to the installation of a clean integrated payroll database based on a
civil service census and the piloting of program budgeting. The government's
decentralization strategy should be clarified and well sequenced with sufficient
capacity building and reporting systems to ensure accountability of budgetary
resources. This would help address concerns about the accountability and
transparency of district spending. Directors looked forward to visible results of the
anti-corruption strategy and judicial sector reform.

Directors supported the Bank of Mozambique's policy framework of base money
targeting, in conjunction with a flexible exchange rate regime. They welcomed the
abolition of the exchange rate band, which demonstrates the commitment of the
authorities to a flexible exchange rate regime, and which should help cushion
against exogenous shocks and improve competitiveness.

Directors emphasized that second-generation institutional reforms are critical to
sustain economic growth. A private sector led growth strategy calls for a
strengthening of the business environment, particularly a deepening of the financial
sector while strengthening the supervisory framework. Directors welcomed the
approval of the new mining and petroleum fiscal laws, and looked forward to the
timely adoption of their implementing regulations. They also encouraged the
adoption of new model contracts in the mining and petroleum sectors while ensuring
that all new sizable projects abide by the principles of the new fiscal regime and the
core principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Directors welcomed the good progress made in seeking financing for the transfer of
majority ownership of the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant from Portugal to
Mozambique. They noted the authorities' renewed commitment to non-recourse
financing so as not to increase the government's liabilities to commercial creditors,
and ensure transparency and accountability. These principles could be applied to all
future infrastructure projects, while encouraging greater private participation to
reduce risks to debt sustainability.

Directors emphasized that the timely implementation of the strategic action plan to
reduce the cost of doing business will be key to promote export diversification and



                                           - 55 -

generate employment. In this regard, high fees charged for scanning freight is a
concern, as they increase export/import transaction costs.

It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Mozambique will be held
within 24 months, subject to the provisions of the Executive Board decision on
consultation cycles in program countries.
