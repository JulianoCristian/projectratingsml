macroeconomic policy, good governance, and sound economic\n            development. policy development operations can reduce\n            poverty by increasing growth and improving institutions that\n            have responsibilities for poverty reduction, but that focus\n            was not sufficient for significant poverty reduction in\n            Mozambique.development policy operations that use general\n            budget support as the instrument for providing assistance\n            can also be appropriate vehicles for the harmonization of\n            donor strategic assistance. the
