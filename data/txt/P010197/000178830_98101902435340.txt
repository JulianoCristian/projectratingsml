KARNALI PREPARATION PROJECT - PHASE I
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Kingdom of Nepal
Beneficiary:          Ministry of Water Resources
Amount:               SDR 10.2 million (US$ii.U million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard
Proiect Objectives   The main objective of the proposed project would be to
and Description:   assess the economic justification and technical viability
of the Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project on the
Karnali River in Nepal. The studies under Phase I
would be carried out over about two and a half years and
would include the following components:
(a) preparation of the feasibility study for the
Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project. The
project has a power potential of about 3600 MW;
(b) prefeasibility of a smaller hydroelectric
project upstream of Chisapani; and
(c) provision of consulting services to HMG in the
form of general advice on all aspects related to the
studies being undertaken by the main consultants.
Benefits and
Risks:              The project's main risk is that the future physical
works might not be economically justifiable or techni-
cally viable. However, previous studies indicate that
the project is very attractive and technically possible
and that further studies are justified. To minimize
this risk the studies are being phased, and only phase I
is being proposed now.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR THE KARNALI PREPARATION PROJECT - PHASE I
--   1.  I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal of SDR 10.2 million (US$11.0
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Karnali
Preparation Project - Phase I.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.      The most recent economic report, Nepal:  Recent Developments and
Selected Issues in Trade Promotion (Report No. 4663-NEP), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on October 14, 1983. The principal features and
recent performance of the economy are described below. Country data are
shown in Annex I.
3.      Nepal is one of the least-developed countries in the world.  Per
capita income is estimated at US$150 (1981) and health and education
standards are below the average fcr South Asia: life expectancy at birth is
only about 45 years; infant mortality, about 148 per thousand; and adult
literacy, only 20%. The population, estimated to be 15.0 million (1981),
grew at a rate of about 2.6% per year during 1971 and 1981. About 95% of the
population live in rural areas.
4.      Population density with respect to arable land (356 per sq km) has
reached very high levels, and cultivation has been extended onto marginal
lands and forests. Forests have been further denuded to meet the growing
demand for fuelwood, on which Nepal depends for over 90% of its energy
consumption, mostly for household cooking and heating. On account of
deforestation and excessive grazing on the hills and mountains, with high
rainfall, there is accelerated soil erosion leading to silting of rivers,
downstream flooding and loss of agricultural productivity all along.
5.      Agriculture, largely rainfed, still accounts for nearly 60% of
Nepal's GDP and 80% of merchandise exports, and provides the main source of
livelihood to over 90% of the population. Crop production accounts for about
60% of agricultural output, livestock for 30%, and forestry for 10%. Paddy
is the principal food crop (planted on about half of the total cropped area),
followed by maize, wheat, millet and barley. Cash crops (oilseeds, jute,
sugarcane and tobacco) are grown on about 10% of the cropped area. About 15%
of total rural incomes rise from nonagricultural activities, of which cottage
industries are one of the more important and engage over one million people
on a part-time basis.



-2-
6.      Apart from agricultural land, Nepal's only other important
exploitable resources are hydropower and tourist attractions. The exploita-
tiorn of the vast hydropower resources beyond that required to satisfy the
courLtry's own power demand, however, will depend crucially on Nepal's ability
to enter complex financial, exploitation and export agreements with neighbor-
ing countries. The tourism sector, based on Nepal's mountain environment and
its rich cultural heritage, has been dynamic, though it accounts for only
abouLt 1% of GDP. Tourism now provides about 20% of the country's foreign
exchange earnings. About 60% of earnings from tourism are retained in Nepal.
7.      Following centuries of self-imposed isolation, efforts to develop the
economy of Nepal began in the mid-1950s against extremely heavy odds. The
counitry had virtually no physical infrastructure, an ancient administrative
system, and limited educational and health services. The resource base is
relatively narrow and its development hindered by the difficult topography
and landlocked position. Against this background, Nepal's primary develop-
ment objective for twenty years, between 1955 and 1975, was to build basic
infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future economic growth. The
country has made good progresis in pursuit of that objective. It now has a
basic road network linking mainy economic centers. Kathmandu and a few other
town's have basic utilities and public transport. Schools have been built for
almost half of the primary school age children and there are a number of high
schools and a national university. A rudimentary hospital system, including
rural health posts, has been built. Some progress has also been made in
establishing the institutional framework for agricultural and industrial
development, including extension and research activities, financial institu-
tions and industrial enterprises. Yet in all these areas, the country has a
long way to go to achieve a level of development comparable to other develop-
ing countries: thus, for example, the public and private institution in
Nepal must continue to expand and upgrade essential physical facilities,
acquire the necessary expertise in handling economic and financial affairs,
build up adequate technical and managerial cadres, and establish merit-based
systems of personnel managemenit.
8.      The Fifth Plan (1975/76-1979/80) marked a shift in development
objectives, with increased emphasis being placed on acceleration of economic
growth, employment creation, and raising the living standards of the
population. These objectives have been reiterated in the Sixth Plan
(1980/81-1984/85). Moreover, the stated strategy of the Sixth Plan quite
appropriately (a) accords higlh priority to developing agriculture, small-
scale industries and Nepal's abundant water resources; (b) stresses soil
conservation and population control; and (c) emphasizes full utilization of
existing infrastructure and alleviation of absorptive capacity constraints,
including human resource deveLopment. The development strategy also calls
for increased involvement of the private sector in agriculture,
manufacturing, trade, tourism, construction and transport operations.
Investment expenditures, supported by growing foreign assistance, have
increased rapidly over the last two Plans, from US$146 million (9% of GDP) in
1974/75 to about US$390 million (15% of GDP) in 1981/82, and there have been
substantial shifts in the composition of spending away from transport to



-3-
agriculture, power and social services. GDP growth, however, has barely kept
up with that of population.
9.      Part of the explanation for this stagnation lies in factors beyond
Nepal's control such as, for example, the difficult topography and the poor
resource base. But factors within Nepal's control have also contributed to
the stagnation. Severe project implementation problems have been encountered
by Government and donors alike in most sectors of the economy, thereby lower-
ing the rate of growth of capital formation. In addition, the expected
returns on those investments which took place often did not materialize
largely because necessary complementary investments or current spending were
lacking, and because of managerial deficiencies. A good example is the
agriculture sector. In the past, insufficient attention was paid to bringing
water down to the farm level and this was compounded by inadequate support
services such as extension and research, by the lack of timely supplies of
improved seed, fertilizer and other inputs such as credit, by the lack of
farm-to-market roads, and by very low producer margins. Future development
of irrigation and agriculture would therefore need to emphasize complementary
investments, improvements in agricultural input supplies and adequate
producer margins.
10.     The shortage of funds for current spending needs to be addressed by
further efforts at domestic resource mobilization. In recent years, Nepal's
efforts at resource mobilization have focussed on tightening income tax
assessment and collection; on discretionary measures largely in the area of
indirect taxes; and on reducing subsidies to public enterprises. While there
has, as a result, been a steady increase in revenues, the tax structure
remain inelastic. Some scope exists for increasing Nepal's tax elasticity
by shifting items on the indirect tax schedules from specific to ad valorem
basis. There also seems to be scope for increasing yields from the land tax,
urban property taxes and income taxes.
11.     Over the past two years, several positive steps have been taken to
strengthen public sector management. These steps have included increases in
the traditionally very low civil service salaries, establishment of public
service training facilities, simplification of budgetary procedures accom-
panied by stricter enforcement of expenditure accounting, and granting of
more autonomy to public enterprises in matters concerning personnel and
pricing policies. The implementation of these administrative reforms would
have to be pursued by a high-level monitoring of important administrative
issues such as appointment of competent staff, job security and decision-
making authority. Also, public enterprise reform needs to be pursued by
measures aimed at reducing costs and increasing efficiency. In this regard,
the Government has taken initial steps, subjecting public enterprises to
increased competition from the private sector through liberalization of
licensing in industry, transport and small-scale hydropower generation. At
the same time, in September 1983, the Government announced its intention to
involve the private sector in the ownership and control of public enterprises
through the sale of some public enterprise shares to private investors.



-4-
12.      Because of slow economic growth, Nepal's balance of payments has been
characterized by widening trade deficits, partly offset by surpluses from
invisibles. The current account deficit (averaging US$100 million annually
durinig 1979/80-1981/82) has traditionally been more than matched by inflows
of official grants and concessional loans (averaging US$128 million annually
during 1979/80-1981/82), leading to surpluses inL the overall balance of
payments in most years. Nevertheless, foreign exchange reserves have
declined from being equivalent to about one year of imports in the early 1970s
to s:Lx months in 1982, and four months in mid-1983.
13.      To sustain and further develop its economy, Nepal must therefore
mobiLize additional free foreign exchange through export promotion and effi-
cient: import substitution. Improving agricultural production, rural incomes
and food distribution within the country is a major way of doing so, if only
to avoid the need to import and distribute large quantities of foodgrains in
the iuture. Agricultural development also remains the key to a gradual
expansion of Nepal's traditional merchandise exports. In addition, develop-
ment of energy resources is a major means to strengthening the balance of
payments by reducing the need to import fuel and opening up an export
potential. Recently, Nepal has legislated a wide range of fiscal and
administrative incentives for industrial investors and exporters, par-
ticularly in the private sector. The implementation of these incentives,
and the alleviation of the severe transport and transit constraints facing
the country's trade sector, must constitute essential elements of a trade
promotion strategy for Nepal.
14.      Nepal is faced with highly challenging prospects and tasks in
addressing its multiple long-term development problems. While it attempts
to mobilize domestic resource to finance about 40-50% of development
expenditures, external assistance, at concessional terms, will continue to be
a vital factor in financing investment and effecting economic growth. In the
last three years, aid commitments to Nepal have averaged about US$250 million
per year, almost entirely in tlhe form of grants and concessional credits with
grant elements in excess of 70%. Aid disbursements have grown from about
$110 million in 1979/80 to an estimated US$175 million in 1982/83. Nearly
70% of total aid disbursements have come from members of the Nepal Aid Group,
formed in 1976 and now comprising eight DAC countries and four multilateral
agencies.
15.      As of December 31, 1982, Nepal's official foreign debt outstanding
was US$297 million, of which US$251 million was due to multilateral agencies.
As virtually all loans have beten concessional, debt service payments, includ-
ing payments to the IMF, have remained small in relation to exports of goods
and services. In 1982/83, debt service payments were about US$15 million,
equivalent to 7% of exports of goods and services. Over the medium term,
these payments are projected to remain at less than 10% of Nepal's exports of
goods and services.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL 1/
16.     Bank Group operations in Nepal began in FY70 with an IDA credit of
US$1.7 million equivalent for a telecommunications project. Since then, 32
additional credits have been approved, bringing total IDA assistance to Nepal
to US$369.5 million equivalent, net of cancellations. In view of Nepal's
many development needs, this assistance has been for projects in a wide
variety of sectors. Six of these sectors account for about 86% of IDA
credits by amount: irrigation/agriculture (US$170.0 million for twelve
projects); water supply and sewerage (US$46.8 million for three projects),
power (US$40.8 million for one project); telecommunications (US$21.7 million
for three projects); highways (US$19.2 million for two projects); and rural
development (US$19.0 million for two projects). The proposed credit would be
the second in FY84, the first being Second Forestry Project for a credit of
US$18.0 million equivalent which was approved by the Executive Directors on
July 12, 1983. It will bring the total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to
US$380.5 million equivalent, net of cancellations. No Bank loans have been
made to Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal (US$3.1 million) in a
hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75. In addition, IFC approved a loan of
US$6.23 million equivalent to Nepal Orind Magnesite (Private) Limited (i.e. a
private company) on March 16, 1982. The loan was to help finance a US$24.9
million project to mine and process magnesite ore.
17.     Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for external assistance. The international
community has shown considerable interest in Nepal's economic development
and, to date, the shortage of funds has not been a major bottleneck. The
main constraint on the utilization of increased aid has been Nepal's limited
absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation and
implementation. The Bank Group has provided assistance to the Government
in project preparation through a Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No.
659-NEP) and by acting as Executing Agency for a number of technical assis-
tance projects financed by UNDP. Furthermore, the present Resident
Representative in Kathmandu has had a significant impact in improving project
implementation performance. As a result, the rate of disbursements is
improving; during FY82 and FY83, US$28.5 and US$37.4 million equivalent,
respectively, was disbursed compared to an annual average disbursement of
about US$17 million during the previous five years. Project completion
reports have been prepared for five projects--First Telecommunications
(Credit No. 166), First Highways (Credit No. 223), Tourism (Credit No. 291),
Birganj Irrigation (Credit No. 373) and Settlement Project (Credit No. 505).
All five projects experienced delays in implementation, and institutional
improvements were less than anticipated; however, all five generated accept-
able rates of return.
1/ As of September 30, 1983.



-6-
18.     The Bank Group's current lending strategy places major emphasis in
assisting the Government in its efforts to contain the high level of popula-
tion growth, address major constraints in the country's development of human
resources and promote agricultural development. Selected infrastructure
mostly in transport and power will be undertaken to alleviate serious
development constraints. In population, a project is being prepared with
Government and other donor interest to cofinance it has already been
expressed. For the development of human resources, in addition to the
propcised project in primary education, other projects under preparation
include an agricultural manpower project, engineering education, vocational
education and a secondary education project. For agriculture, the basic
strategy is to assist Nepal maintain overall foodgrain self-sufficiency,
where possible promote exports of agricultural products and encourage afores-
tation efforts. Projects under preparation would extend the assistance
provided so far in building the irrigation infrastructure in the Terai mainly
to increase paddy production, helping reduce the food deficits in the Hills
both through rural development projects which emphasize increasing food
production and through specific Hill food projects.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
19.     Nepal's energy resources consist mainly of hydroelectric potential
estimated to be around 83,000 MtfW of which only 113 MW have been developed.
Traditional fuels, primarily wood, represent around 95% of Nepal's total
energy use. Commercial energy, which accounts for 5% of total use (coal,
petroleum, and electricity), supplies industry, commerce, transport, and
residential users in the capital city of Kathmandu and other major towns.
Coal and petroleum products are imported as there is no domestic production
or known reserves of fossil fuels in Nepal.
The lower Subsector
20.     About 5% of the total population in Nepal has access to electricity
and the annual per capita generation is about 18 kWh compared to 36 kWh in
Burma, 29 kWh in Bangladesh, and 170 kWh in India. In 1982 the total energy
generated in Nepal was 229 GWh and another 55 GWh were imported from India.
Of the 122,000 consumers registered in 1982, 89% were residential, most of
whom are located in the major towns of the Kathmandu valley. These consumers
used about 49% of the electricity whereas industry used 32% and commerce and
others 19%.
21.     The installed capacity operated by the utilities in Nepal amounts
to 138 MW of which 82% (113 MW) are hydro and the remainder (25 MW) are



-7-
diesel. There are some 12 MW operated privately. Current plans for expan-
sion up to 1993 include the addition of 313 MW of hydro power. 1/ Nepal is
administratively divided into five regions: Eastern, Central, Western,
Mid-Western and Far Western. The Central Region system is interconnected at
66 kV and there is a 132 kV single circuit line connecting the central system
with Pokhara (150 km to the west of Kathmandu) and one more under construc-
tion that will connect the Central and Eastern Regions by 1985/86. The
distribution system is overloaded and poorly maintained. Consequently elec-
tricity losses are high (30-35% compared to a desirable 10-15%) and service
interruptions are frequent. HMG has undertaken a program for loss reduction
and upgrading of the distribution system under the auspices of the ADB and
the World Bank.  The plan was prepared with the assistance of external con-
sultants and is being implemented successfully.
22.     Despite the constrained supply of electricity, total sales grew at an
annual rate of around 18% in FY71-78 and at 9% during the last five years.
In an effort to improve the living conditions in the rural areas and to
control the rapid deforestation of the country, the Government has promoted
rural electrification of small villages; and it is expected that this program
would add to the demand of electricity in the near future. Total demand is
expected to grow through 1991 at an annual rate of about 14.7%.
23.     In spite of this growth in demand, Nepal will not be in a position to
use a substantial amount of its hydropower potential in the coming 40 to 50
years. Due to the limitations of the local market, Nepal has been building
small projects (up to 60 MW) at high unit costs. On the other hand, the
construction of medium- and large-size hydropower projects with lower produc-
tion costs is not possible unless Nepal can export a substantial portion of
the electricity generated to India, the natural customer for it. Electricity
exports would not only reduce the cost of internal consumption through the
economies of scale but also would generate foreign exchange to support
development efforts in Nepal. Under these circumstances, Nepal recently
started its planning actions to a more systematic analysis of hydropower
development considering both its internal needs as well as export
possibilities.
24.     India's electricity is sulpplied through five regional systems, one
of which is the northern system serving the area adjacent to Nepal. The
Government of India is planning to interconnect the regional systems in the
coming decade through a 400 kV transmission grid.  The northern system is
the biggest in terms of installed capacity, being about 10,266 MW as of March
1983 (of which 43% is hydro). There are plans to substantially increase this
capacity from 1984 to 1995 by adding about 22,000 MW of which 63% would be
hydro. This region has had shortages in recent years, both in energy as well
1/ Devighat, 14 MW, 1984;
Kulekhani II, 30 MW, 1985;
Marsyangdi, 69 MW, 1987; and
Sapt Gandaki, 100 MW in 1991, and 100 MW in 1993.



-8-
as in capacity terms, which are expected to continue at least until 1990.
Regional demand is growing annually at about 13%.  Although the region has
attractive hydro sites under study and an abundant supply of coal, the large
potential of the Karnali River in Nepal and the relative low cost of gener-
ation make it a very attractive source of electricity for the Northern
region, as well as for the country when interconnected.  Chisapani, with
3,600 MW installed capacity could contribute a significant portion of the
region's electricity requirements around the year 2000.
Institutional Aspects
25.     Electricity planning and development in Nepal are the responsibility
of the Ministry of Water Resources. Electricity development programs are
integrated into the five-year plans through the Planning Commission. To
assist in the planning of water and energy sectors the Government created in
1976 the Water and Energy Commission (WEC) and in 1978 retained consultants
financed by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) to help WEC
in the development of planning capabilities. Power sector planning is only
in its early stages in Nepal and has been limited during the last one or two
years to the preparation of demand forecasts and to the identification and
ranking of potential hydropower projects. Preparation of a long-term power
expansion program is planned as a next step but it may take long before it is
available.
26.     There are two authorities involved in the construction and operation
of power projects in Nepal:
(a) Electricity Department (ED) of the Ministry of Water Resources;
and
(b) Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC).
27.     The Electricity Department under a Chief Engineer, is responsible for
the investigation, engineering, construction and commissioning of new power
facilities which upon completion are turned over to NEC for operation.
However, because of the limited implementation capability on the part of ED
and NEC, the construction of K(ulekhani Hydroelectric Power Project (para. 31)
was managed by a separate Development Board. Similarly, another Development
Board has been established for the management of the Construction of the
proposed Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Power Project (para. 32). In addition,
small hydropower stations, varying between 25 KW and 500 KW are presently
being constructed and operated by a Small Hydro Development Board.
28.     NEC is a government-owned corporation responsible for generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity throughout the country. It
is the largest entity in the lpower sector. NEC also takes care of routine
minor distribution expansions, extends supply to new customers and is respon-
sible for metering, billing anad collections.
29.     Currently, the Govermnent assisted by consultants is carrying out
an institutional study financed by ADB. Phase I of the study has been



-9-
completed. Based on its conclusions, ADB and HMG signed, in November 1982, a
memorandum of understanding to form a single entity called the Nepal
Electricity Authority (NEA), incorporating ED and NEC. This decision, when
implemented, would improve considerably the coordination required for the
sector expansion.
Human Resources and Training
30.     Nepal's shortage of qualified personnel and skilled labor as well as
the lack of experience in planning, design, and construction of major
projects makes it necessary to provide for intensive training and external
assistance in the planning and execution of medium- and large-sized projects.
HMG has undertaken to send 20 to 30 engineers each year to India with this
purpose in mind. The first group is about to return to Nepal, and it is
expected that some of the engineers will be retained to work on the proposed
project studies. Local staff would be directly retained by the consultants
or seconded from government agencies.
Past Bank Experience in the Sector
31.     The first Bank operation in the power sector in Nepal was an IDA
credit in January 1976, of US$26.0 million (Cr. 600-NEP) for the construction
of the Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project (2x30 MW units). The cost of the
project was estimated at the time of appraisal in 1974 at US$68.0 million.
The additional financing came from OECF-Japan (US$10.0 million), Kuwait Fund
(US$15.9 million), UNDP (US$3.0 million), OPEC Fund (US$3.3 million) and the
balance from HMG. The project, which cost US$120.8 million equivalent,
represents by far the largest civil works ever undertaken under a single
project in Nepal to date, with the participation of an unprecedented number
of donors (five). It also introduced for the first time two donors (OECF-
Japan and Kuwait Fund) who have since remained important sources of develop-
ment assistance to the country. Moreover, it offered Nepalese officials and
engineers an opportunity for practical experience with major civil works
related to a hydropower scheme.
32.     The project was inaugurated in December 1982, 1-1/2 years behind
schedule. This delay, however, is not considered excessive when compared to
projects of the same nature and technical complexity. In addition, the
remoteness and conditions of the site made the construction even more
difficult. The project had cost overrun of about 75% due to much higher than
anticipated price escalation of unit costs and to a lesser degree quantities
as well as some changes in design. Moreover, there was a substantial
appreciation of the yen in dollar terms when a major portion of expenditures
for equipment and consulting services were committed in that currency. On
May 10, 1979, the Association approved a supplementary credit of US$14.8
million and a Special Action Credit (from the European Community Fund) of
US$3.0 million to assist in the financing of the cost overrun. Other donors
and lending agencies involved, as well as HMG, met the balance. IDA
appraised in November 1982, a second hydropower project, Marsyangdi (3x23 MW
units), to assist in the supply of electricity through 1991. In addition, a
Bank mission visited Nepal in November 1982 to carry out a comprehensive



-10-
energy assessment. The report containing the findings and recommendations of
the mission was discussed with HMG and subsequently issued in August 1983
(Report N-4474-NEP).
Bank Lending Goals and Strategy
33.     IDA's strategy for power development in Nepal comprises the following
objectives:
(a) to assist HMG in the supply of power required for industrial
and agricultural development as well as for domestic uses;
(b) to pursue, in coordination with HMG and other lenders, the
necessary sectoral reorganization and improved efficiency
in sector management and operations; and
(c) to help upgrade local technical and managerial capabilities
through technical assistance and on-the-job and formal training.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Origin
34.     In 1962, HMG obtained financial aid from UNDP for a survey of the
Karrnali River potential. The studies, carried out by Nippon Koei Co. Ltd.
(NK) of Japan between December 1962 and February 1966, identified ten sites
with potentials ranging between 18 and 1800 MW. Out of these, two appeared
especially promising for which the consultants completed more advanced
prefeasibility studies. One was at the Chisapani gorge (with a high dam and
a run-of-river alternative of 1800 MW and 75 MW, respectively) while the
other was Lakarpata, a run-of-river site (360 MW) upstream from Chisapani.
The consultants recommended consideration of the Chisapani high dam alterna-
tive as the first option for future development due to its relatively low
unit cost and its advantageous location in regard to the main load centers in
northern India. The project :is located about 45 km north of the Indian
border (see map).
35.     The studies and recommendations of NK were reviewed by the Snowy
Mountains Hydroelectric Authority (SMEA) of Australia in 1968 who were
employed by HMG with funding iErom UNDP. They agreed with the general
conclusions of NK but recommended an increase in the installed capacity of
Chisapani to 3600 MW and a gravel fill dam instead of a concrete arch gravity
dam proposed by NK. In 1976 IIMG hired two firms, Norconsult from Norway and
Electrowatt from Switzerland, to review both recommendations and resolve the
differences.  Both firms concurred with the SMHA recommendation and proposed
further studies for final designs of the Karnali (Chisapani) multipurpose
project, the main features of which were construction of a gravel fill dam of
about 35 million cubic meters,, two power houses of 6 x 300 MW units each
totalling 3600 MW and the necessary substations and transmission lines. The



-11-
construction period was to be 12 years with an estimated cost of about US$3.0
billion in 1983 prices.
36.     In view of the results of the studies, HMG and the Government of
India (GOI) established a Committee on Karnali (CK) to promote bilateral
discussions on Chisapani. 1/ The Committee met in 1978, 1979, 1981, and
February 1984. At the first meeting, the Committee agreed to review the
consultant's reports and the economic and financial aspects of the proposed
project. In addition, it agreed to form separate groups in each country to
study the use of power from the project as well as flood and irrigation
consequences downstream of Chisapani for both Nepal and India. At a meeting
in January 1981 in Kathmandu, CK agreed in principle to pursue the studies
for Chisapani under joint supervision, mutually agreed terms of reference,
and jointly selected consultants. Subsequently, IDA was invited to propose
draft terms of reference (TOR) for the studies of Chisapani. The draft TOR
were completed in September 1981 and were reviewed by both Governments.
After receiving comments from both sides, an IDA mission visited Kathmandu in
June 1982 to assist in the preparation of a revised draft. This draft was
the basis for the appraisal of the proposed project. At the meeting of
February 1984, CK approved TOR for the Chisapani studies, and the powers,
functions and responsibilities of the Coordinating Committee (CC) (para. 42),
as agreed during negotiations.
37.     The proposed project was appraised in February-March 1983.  GOI sent
a team of four representatives to Nepal during appraisal to work together
with HMG's and IDA staff, and the proposed TOR for the execution of the study
related to Chisapani were agreed upon. Negotiations for the credit took
place May 26-30, 1983. HMG's delegation was led by Mr. M. Dhakal, Secretary,
Ministry of Water Resources. There is no separate Staff Appraisal Report.
A supplementary data sheet is attached as Annex III.
Project Obiectives
38.     The main objective of the proposed project would be to assess the
economic justification and technical viability of the Karnali (Chisapani)
Multipurpose Project on the Karnali River in Nepal. The project would also
assess the prefeasibility of a smaller hydropower project upstream of Chisapani.
The findings of the feasibility studies on Chisapani would form the basis on
which the two countries would decide whether or not to undertake the next
phase which would include detailed engineering, design and the preparation of
bidding documents.
Project Description
39.     The project consists of:
1/ Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project.



-12-
(a) preparation of the final feasibility study for Chisapani
including all the necessary engineering work to confirm the
technical and economic feasibility of the scheme;
(b) prefeasibility of a proposed smaller project upstream of
Chisapani; and
(c) provision of consulting services to HMG for general advice
on all aspects related to the project.
In order to carry out the services mentioned above, the proposed Credit
includes financing for special equipment, materials, vehicles, instruments
necessary for field investigation and office work, and minor construction
works, including temporary housing and office facilities at the project
sites, rehabilitation of about 45 km of access roads and the small aircraft
runway of about 2 km and related airport facilities at Chisapani, construc-
tion of a small heliport at Karnali bend, and about 800 meters of exploratory
tunnels.
Arrangements for Project Execution
40.     The studies under the project would be carried out by consultants
selected and retained accordLing to IDA guidelines. The project is expected
to be completed by June 1988. The studies for Chisapani would be carried out
in accordance with TOR approved by CK in its February 1984 meeting and
satisfactory to IDA. The feasibility for the smaller project upstream of
Chisapani would be executed under TOR satisfactory to IDA.
41.     The Ministry of Water Resources would be the agency responsible for
the administration of the project.  HMG has appointed a Project Director,
whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to
IDA.. The Project Director, who would report to the Secretary of Water
Resources, would be the Chief Executive for the project, and would take care
of the day-to-day administrative matters. He would provide the necessary
logistic support to the consultants and would serve as liaison between the
parties involved in the project. He would have the necessary staff to assist
him in discharging his duties including disbursements and payments, procure-
ment and supplies, project accounting, housing, and transport. The respon-
sibilities of the Project Director were agreed upon during the appraisal of
the project.
42.     The Coordinating Committee (CC), established with equal numbers of
technical staff appointed by both Governments, is considerably smaller than
CK and would advise CK on technical matters regarding the execution of the
Chisapani studies. Powers, functions and responsibilities of the CC have
been approved by CK during its February 1984 meeting.
43.     At present, Nepal does not have the capability to properly execute
projects of the size and complexity of Karnali and it is necessary to provide
for adequate technical assistance to HMG.  HMG would retain, under the
project, consultants acceptable to IDA and independent from the main



-13-
consultants, to serve as general project advisors to HMG. The consultants,
who would be employed under IDA guidelines, would station in Kathmandu a lead
advisor, with broad experience in similar projects, who would report to the
Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources. The consultants would also provide
for specialized staff as needed. The advisory services would cover, among
others, general management, contract administration, review and analysis of
the main consultant's proposals and recommendations, assistance in preparing
for discussions with the Chisapani consultants or within the committees and
review of approach and staffing proposed by the consultants for the main
contract.
Project Cost and Financing
44.     Total project cost is estimated at US$14.0 million net of taxes and
duties, of which US$10.8 million (77%) are foreign exchange costs. The base
costs of US$11.9 million have been estimated at end 1983 prices. It is
estimated that about 440 man-months of consulting services would be necessary
for the feasibility studies and about 50 man-months for the advisory services
to HMG. The cost of the services is estimated at US$11,500 per man-month of
senior staff and US$9,500 for other staff. These figures include salaries,
fringe benefits, and overhead. Allowances have been included in project
costs for reimbursable expenditures. In accordance with HMG's desire for
local staff training and participation, it is also estimated that some 150
man-months of local staff would be used by the consultants in charge of the
feasibility studies. Project costs provide for the purchase of equipment and
instruments for field investigations estimated at about US$0.8 million.
Necessary construction work estimated at US$3.1 million (base cost) is also
included in the project costs. Physical contingencies for the project are
estimated to average 10%; and an 8% price contingency over total costs has
been provided.
45.     The proposed IDA Credit of US$11.0 million would finance 79% of total
project cost; the remaining 21% (US$3.6 million) would be provided by HMG.
The IDA credit would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost (US$10.8
million) and about US$0.2 million of local costs.

La  Figures in parenthesis represent IDA financing.
lb Limited international bidding.
47.     The consultants for the feasibility studies and the general advisors
to HMG would be recruited in accordance with IDA guidelines (estimated to
cost US$7.5 million or 54% of the project cost). In view of the specialized
nature of the equipment and parts required for the engineering work, procure-
ment of these goods (except vehicles), would be through limited international
biidding according to IDA guidelines, after obtaining bids from at least three
sources (estimated cost of this item totals US$0.7 million). Contracts for
the supply of other non-specialized goods such as vehicles would be procured
through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA (estimated at
US$0.1 million). Due to the nature and small size of the construction works
international competitive bidding is not justified and it is proposed that
civil works be contracted on the basis of local competitive bidding proce-
dures acceptable to IDA. Holwever, foreign contractors would be allowed to
participate (construction work is estimated at US$3.1 million or 22% of total
project costs). All contracts for procurement of goods having an estimated
cost of more than US$100,000 equivalent each or contracts for civil works
having an estimated cost of imore than US$300,000 equivalent each would be
subject to IDA's prior review.
Disbursements
48.     The credit would be ,disbursed against 100% of foreign expenditures
for: (a) consulting services for the feasibility studies; (b) consulting
services of the general advisors to HMG; (c) materials, equipment (including
vehicles) and instruments necessary to carry out the project; (d) miscel-
laneous construction works; and (e) costs of travel and operation of the



-15-
Project Director's office and of the Coordinating Committee. The credit
would also finance 65% of local expenditures on imported instruments,
materials or equipment (including vehicles) locally procured. Disbursements
would be fully documented and are expected to begin during the first quarter
of FY85 and be completed by December 31, 1988.
Project Justification and Risks
49.     Preliminary studies indicate that the Chisapani Project would be able
to produce abundant electricity at low cost (around US$0.02 per kWh) compared
to current costs in Nepal (US$0.14-0.17 per kWh) and in India (some US$0.03
per kWh) which makes it a very attractive power generation source for both
countries. The advantageous location of Chisapani and the natural conditions
of the site make it unique in facilitating the supply of electricity to the
northern part of India at a relatively low cost. Chisapani also has the
potential to become a good source of foreign exchange to Nepal. In addition
to Chisapani, there may be other projects of a similar nature suitable for
joint development to the benefit of both Nepal and India, and Karnali can
serve as an initial step and model to establish an appropriate approach and
to resolve many of the issues that are common to such projects. The proposed
Phase I project would provide an opportunity to enhance the technical and
managerial skills of the local staff through direct association with the
consultants, which will facilitate the learning of techniques to explore and
identify new projects needed in Nepal.
50.     The main risk of the Phase I project is that the future physical
works might not be technically viable or economically justifiable. However,
given the amount of information provided by the previous studies, it appears
that Chisapani is very attractive and technically possible and that further
studies are warranted. To minimize this risk further and to keep it at an
acceptably low level the engineering work has been phased, and only phase I
is being proposed now. Another risk concerns future implementation.
Although there cannot be a formal commitment of Nepal and India at this stage
to execute the future physical works, formation of CK, and the establishment
of the CC indicate the interest of both countries in the project.
Implementation of future physical works requires substantial financial
resources as well as binational agreements on power prices and other related
issues. The proposed studies are geared to confirm the competitiveness of
Chisapani as a low-cost source of energy to facilitate the agreements leading
to project construction.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
51.     The Draft Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal and IDA and
the recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d),
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. There are no special conditions.



-16-
52.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Art:Lcles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
