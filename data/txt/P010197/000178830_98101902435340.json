Project on the Karnali River in Nepal. The studies under\n            Phase I would be carried out over about two and a half years\n            and would include the following components: (a) preparation\n            of the feasibility study for the Karnali (Chisapani)\n            Multipurpose Project; (b) prefeasibility of a smaller\n            hydroelectric project upstream of Chisapani; and (c)\n            provision of consulting services to HMG in the form of\n            general advice on all aspects related to the studies being\n            undertaken by the main consultants."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
