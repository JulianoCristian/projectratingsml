program, which represents an acceleration\n            and deepening of reforms implemented successfully since the\n            beginning of 1990 and supported by the First Structural\n            Adjustment Loan (SAL 1). The objective of the reforms is to\n            establish a competitive market economy in Hungary, and to\n            preserve Hungary's external creditworthiness. The\n            program has four main components: (a) reduction of the role\n            of the state -- regarding ownership of productive assets,\n            the extent of administrative intervention in resource\n            allocation, and the amount of resources redistributed\n            through taxes and transfers; (b) intensification of\n            competition, by way of further liberalization, the promotion\n            of new private ventures, implementation of effective\n            anti-trust action against enterprises engaged in unfair and\n            restrictive practices, and tightening of financial\n            discipline through the financial system and strengthened\n            bankruptcy procedures; (c) financial sector reform, through\n            further liberalization, implementation of improved\n            prudential regulation and tighter supervision, and\n            restructuring of insolvent banks; and (d) establishment of\n            financially viable well-targeted, and efficient programs of\n            social assistance to alleviate the social costs of\n            adjustment and to provide an adequate social safety net that\n            will protect the poor."}, "docdt": "1991-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
