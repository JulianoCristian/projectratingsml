PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a project completion report for the Urbaa and Rural Com,-
zunities Water Supply and Sewerage Project, for which Loan 1324-BO was
approved on November 15,  1976.   The loan was originally approved for
US$11.5 million, and was later reduced to US$5.2 million. An undisbursed
balance of US$0.487 million was cancelled.
The project completion report of January 31, 1987 was prepared by
the Latin America and Caribbean Projects department, with assistance from
the Water Supply and Urban Development Department, on the basis of docu-
ments contained in regional files, information provided by staff members
involved with the project during its execution, and a mission to Bolivia in
August 1986. The exacuting agency (The Water and Sewerage Corporation -
CORPAGUAS), a semi-autonomous agency under the Ministry of Urbanism and
Housing, prepared a completion report which is available in the files. The
executing agenecys opinion is attached as Annex 12.
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the Project Comple-
tion Report were sent to the Borrower for comments. Comments received from
SkGUAPAC and ANESAPh have been reProduced as Annexes 14 and 15 to the report.

cost.    This  is  a notable  accomplishment  in  light  of  the  political
instability and economic difficulties affecting Bolivia during proiect

rural communities and two cities; (ii) extend sewerage in one citv: and
Mill) strengthen sector institutions.   The comPonents in the two cities
(Potosi and Sucro) were never initiated due to the financial weaknesses of
the implementing agencies. and the loan proceeds allocated for these
components were cancelled (Para. 3.01).
The rural water comPonent was substantiallv completed in 1985,

component were exceeded. Construction was completed (or nearlv completed)
in all 70 communities and the oooulation served was larger than intended.

LOAN 1324-BO
URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I* INTRODUCTION
1e01       Loan 1324-BO financed a project designed to improve and extend
water supply in 70 rural communities and two cities, and to extend sewerage
in one city. A loan of US$11.5 million was signed on November 15, 1976.
The components in the two cities (Potosi and Sucre) were never initiated,
and in 1979, US$6.3 million in Loan funds allocated for these components
was cancelled.  The rural water component was substantially completed in
1985, and a loan balance of about US$0.5 million was cancelled effective
12/31/85.
1.02      The rural component sought to expand service levels by construct-
ing 70 water supply systems serving a total population of approximately
100,000 persons.  The National Water and Sewerage Corporation (CORPAGUAS)
was the executing agency.   The selection and design of subprojects was
supposed to simplify operation and maintenance by the communities
themselves.   The project also intended to develop sector institutions
through the provision of technical assistance in managemer., project
evaluation, and manual preparation to the Ministry of Urbanism and Housing
(MV) and the executing agencies. This supported an institutional concept
which included a decentralization of responsibilities for rural water
supply from CORPAGUAS to the Departmental DevelopmelL Organizations (i.e.,
Regional Corporations or D.D.0's).
Main Conclusions
1.03       The physical objectives of the rural component were exceeded.
Construction has been completed (or nearly completed) in 70 communities
with a current population of 157,000, and the water supply systems have a
design capacity to serve 240,000 persons.  This is 157% and 240% of the
expected number of beneficiaries at appraisal.   The physical components
were, with few exceptions. implemented satisfactorily, although in most
cases with substantial delays.   Per capita construction costs were lower
than   appraisal estimates (see para. 3.10).   The achievement of the
physical objectives is remarkable, as the last half of the project occurred
during extremely trying times in which inflation exzeeded 20,000% per year,
national strikes were frequent, real incomes and employment declined, and
counterpart funds were scarce.



-2-
1.04         Operations and maintenance are adequate in the majority of
communities (see Annex 10) because the systems are simple and most
communities have a functioning water committee. However, some communities
have experienced difficulties in operations due to insufficient tariffs, a
tenfold increase in real gasoline prices (which make some pump operations
unaffordable), poor design of intake works, and inadequate training and
oversight by the executing agency.   CORPAGUAS has started to implement
ambitious plans to correct maintenance problems in this and future projects
(para. 4.05).
1.05      The institutional objectives have not been achieved yet.  MUV and
CORPAGUAS were not insulated from the problems affecting Central Government
institutions. They have suffered from frequent changes in management, high
staff turnover, extremely low salaries, and lack of funds. The transfer of
responsibilities to the DDO's did not take place. Today only two or three
of the DDO's have an installed capability to manage construction of water
supply projects, and none of them is doing an adequate job on operations
and maintenance. However, the strengthening process has begun once more.
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) completed a far reaching
institutional plan for CORPAGUAS, using funds from the project. CORPAGUAS
has started to implement this plan through internal reorganization.
Furthermore, the MUV has initiated a coordinating mechanism in the sector
in which project evaluation based on technical criteria will play a
significant role.
The Sector
1.06      At the time of appraisal, Bolivia had one of the lowest service
levels for water supply and sanitation in Latin America. Low service le-
vels were particularly acute in the rural areas, in which 70% of the popu-
latior lived. In 1973, only 4% of rural dwellers were served by water sup-
ply and only 3% by sanitation.   Low service levels were linked to low
health standards and high infant mortality (160 per 1,000 births). The
Government set ambitious targets to increase service levels in both rural
and urban areas.   The Government hoped to achieve these targets through
institutional changes and the implementation of higher tariffs. The insti-
tutional changes were to include (a) a transfer of responsibilities for
operation, maintenance and some construction of rural water supplies to
DDO's and (b) the build-up of the Division of Urban Engineering (DIU) in
the MUV for technical and financial project evaluation. All the relevant
institutions would be strengthened as well, including CORPAGUAS for rural
water supply systems, the Division of Environmental Sanitation (DSA) of the
Ministry of Health for rural water supply and latrines, the DDO's for rural
and small town water supplies, the semi-autonomous water undertakings
(companies) in the eight largest cities and the municipal councils (for
sewerage schemes).
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, APPRAISAL, AND NEGOTIATION
A, The Process
2.01        This was the first Bank supported project in the water supply
sector in Bolivia.   It arose out of a Bank/PAHO sector study issued in



- 3 -
April 1975.  Identification was initiated by a Government request in July
1975 for financing of projects in Potosi,  Sucre and Riberalta.    The
Riberalta project was later rejec-ted because it was overdesigned and
located in a Department in whic't the 'Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
was expected to become involved.
2.02       Preparation, negotiations, and loan approval proceeded rapidly.
Designs were completed by consultants (for the urban components) and
CORPAGUAS staff (for the rural component). Negotiations with representa-
tives of the MUV, CORPAGUAS, and the Finance Department of the Ministry of
Finance, were held in Bolivia in July 1976. Board approval and loan sign-
ing followed within two and a half months.
2.03      The main issues during preparation and negotiations related to
the finances of the urban water companies. Both water companies (AAPOS in
Potosi and ELAPAS in Sucre) were subsidized, as were all the other urban
water companies at the time. Neither had sufficient financial capability
without tariff increases and other measures to cover operating expenses,
debt service and the counterpart financing for the project. It was only
with great reluctance that loan covenants were accepted by the water compa-
nies to increase their cash generation (through tariff increases in both
cities and imposition of a sewerage tariff in Sucre), to install water
meters (in Potosi), and to repay the Government for the Bank loan. These
same issues ultimately resulted in the cancellation -- at the request of
the Government - of the urban components of the project.
B. Objectives and Description of Project
2.04       The objectives of the project were not explicitly stated in the
SAR, but presumably were to support the expansion of both urban and rural
water and sanitation services and to help strengthen the relevant institu-
tions. The project originally comprised a rural component to be implemen-
ted by CORPAGUAS, urban components to be implemented by AAPOS and ELAPAS in
Potosi and Sucre, and a technical assistance component with the
Government. The rural component consisted of water system construction in
70 small (population of 500-5000) communities in the highlands serving a
total population of 100,000. All were to have pipea distribution systems.
Priority was to have been given to gravity systems which did not require
water treatment.   The Potosi component concentrated on water system im-
provements, including (a) repairs and improvements to production facili-
ties, (b) distribution expansion -% poor areas, and (c) metering, technical
assistance and loss reduction. The Sucre component comprised water system
improvements similar to those proposed in Potosi, as well as major sewerage
system improvements and expansion. The technical assistance component in-
cluded consultancy help to MUV (for administration and training in project
evaluation); to CORPAGUAS (for design standardization, operation and main-
tenance manuals, organizational planning, and accounting); and to AAPOS and
ELAPAS (for administration, meter repair and development of financial
practices).  Loan covenants designed to improve the policies, administra-
tion and finances of the relevant institutiona are presented in Annex 8.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. History
3.01        Start-up (1976-7).  The loan was signed on October 15, 1976,
after Board approval, and effectiveness was declared on December 20, 1976,
one  month  earlier  than  scheduled.    Then  problems  started  to occur.
Disbursement of the Bank loan required the signing of subsidiary loan and
financing agreements between the Government and the implementing agencies.
These agreements were delayed. In the case of CORPAGUAS, the delay was not
for substantive reasons, and a financing agreement was signed by September
30, 1977. However, the subsidiary loan agreements with the urban companies
were never finalized because these companies were unwilling or unable to
meet financial and other covenants, and did not want to cover debt service
for the Bank loan. On November 9, 1977, the Government informed the Bank
that Potosi and Sucre had withdrawn from the project. This withdrawal was
nominally due to the objections to the interest rate (8.92) of the Bank
loan.   In any case, AAPOS had failed to meet disbursement conditions
covering water tariff increases and installation of meters and consumption
based tariffs, and ELAPAS had been unable for political reasons to impose a
sewerage tax in Sucre.   The Government requested that the corresponding
funds of the urban components be used to finance sewerage construction in
Santa Cruz. A new project in Santa Cruz was subsequently prepared, and a
credit (Credit-948-BO) app oved on July 12, 1979, to finance this project.
In 1979, US$ 6.3 million in loan funds (55% of the total) allocated to the
urban components were cancelled from Loan 1324-BO.
3.02        Initial Construction Period (1977-79).  This was a period of
relative economic stability for Bolivia, and design and construction of the
rural component p-oceeded fairly consistently. However, even during this
period, the pace of implementation was only 60% of that planned at
appraisal.   Both CORPAGUAS and MUV had difficulty retaining senior staff
due to low salaries.   By the end of 1979, CORPAGUAS had completed 36
systems, half of the total planned for the project.  Bank disbursements
during this period were US$ 1.9 million (40% of the total eventually
disbursed).
3.03      Transition Period (1980-82).  Economic and political instability,
accompanied by an increase in inflation and limits on Government funding
slowed implementation. The DDO's were incapable of operating and maintain-
ing systems due to lack of funds, technical capability and support from
CORPAGUAS, and CORPAGUAS decided to give up on the transfer of
responsibility - at least until sector responsibilities were better
defined through a national planning exercise then in progress. Work start-
ed on the Trinidad subproject. By the end of 1982, 18 additional systems
had been completed.   Bank disbursements during  1980-82 were US$  0.8
million (17% of total).
3.04         flperinflation Period (1982-85).   Hyperinflation and social
instability slowed implementation even further. Staffing problems became



more serious.   Counterpart contributions were problematic throughout the
period, and repayments from communities became valueless. CORPAGUAS com-
pensated somewhat by requiring higher upfront contributions fron the commu-
nities. PAHO-executed technical assistance to CORPAGUAS was carried out,
and the Bank agreed to a large purchase of pipe to be stockpiled for sub-
project implementation after loan closing.   Four subprojects are still
under construction (Annex 4). Bank disbursements during this period were
US$1.4 million (30% of the total).   After approving three extensions of
1 - 2 years each, the loan was closed on 2/28(85, and disbursements were
honored until 12/31/85. A remaining undisbursed balance of US$500,000 (11%
of the total disbursed) was cancelled effective 12/31/85.
3.05      The appraisal schedule called for the project to be completed by
December 31, 1980, an implementation schedule of 4.5 years. However, as of
that date only US$2.5 million (48%) of the US$5.2 million modified loan had
been disbursed and only 39 systems (56%) of the intended systems had been
completed.  Even though this was before the period of hyperinflation and
social instability, the project was moving only about half as fast as
intended. The reasons for the slow pace throughout the project were: (a)
an unrealistic schedule set at appraisal (a previous IDB project had a pace
3 times slower than the Bank target); (b) high turnover rates of senior
officials and delays in filling senior positional/; (c) difficulty in
hiring and retaining professional staff due to lou salaries; (d) lack of
counterpart funds; and (d) logistical problems caused by strikes, poorly
maintained roads, floods and other problems.
Reporting
3.06        Progress reports were prepared in a timely manner until 1980.
After that date reports were irregular, i.e. prepared especially for super-
vision missions or to support a particular request. Accounts were audited
in a timely fashion by external auditors.   CORPAGUAS prepared a letter
(Annex 12) supported by extensive annexes evaluating the project.   The
evaluation exercise included a field inspection of 31 of the 53 systems
which had been completed as of August 1986 as well as 4 systems still under
construction.
Revisions
3.07      Major,revisions included: (a) the withdrawal of Potosi and Sucre
from the project and the subsequent cancellation of the US$6.3 million in
loan funds associated with these components and; (b) the addition of
Trinidad, the capital of the Department of Beni, as a subpr,ject.   In
addition, the nature of approved subprojects shifted during project
implementation from small new systems in the Highlands toward (a)
1/ For example, during a single year (1977), there were changes in the
Minister of MUV, the undersecretary, all the division chiefs, the head
of the engineering department and the general manager of CORPAGUAS.



- 6 -
improvements or expansions to existing systems (12 systems were improved);
(b) inclusion of small urban systems (6 systems served populations of over
5000 people, including the three largest serving populations of 13,000,
15,000, and 27,500); and (c) the inclusion of communities located in the
tropical lowlands where economic growth may have the most potential. These
shifts did not conflict with project objectives.
Costs and Financing
3.08      A comparison of appraised and actual project costs and financing
for the rural component is summarized below. Details are in Annex 9.

Appraisal                      Actual
IBRD                     4.8  (71%)                     4.7 (36%)
Government               2.1  (31%)                      7.2 (56%)

TOTAL                 7.7                           13.0
3.9       Total costs were about twice those estimated at appraisal.  The
increase was financed almost entirely by Government contributions, which
were channeled through CORPAGUAS.   Cost increases were caused by: (a) an
increased number of beneficiaries (para. 1.03); (b) slow project implemen-
tation,  which  increased  prices   (through  inflation  and  CORPAGUAS'
overhead)2/; and (c) an unrealistic and overvalued official exchange rate
which overstated Government and community contributions in local currency
to the project (this particularly affected systems in construction after
1982).
2/ Although the SAR did noc assign CORPAGUAS overhead to the project, all
overhead is assigned in this report as an indirect project cost,
because the Bank-supported project was virtually the only activity of
CORPAGUAS during the period.



3.10      Average per capita costs were US$81.  This is 24% below evaluated
per capita costs at appraisal.3/   There were s4gnificant diffhirences in
per capita costs between the early and latter part of the project.
Although costs were somewhat distorted by exchange rate problems,  per
capita investment costs were significantly lower4/ after 1982 ($45 vs.
$120).   Lower per capita costs in later subprojiects were due to:  (a)
economies of scale (the later subprojects were for larger communities); and
(b) the shift away from new systems toward improvements and expansions.
Procurement
3.11       Procurement was done in accordance with Bank guidelines.   All
goods were procured through international competitive bidding.  Although
local firms were given a 15% margin of preference of the c.i.f. value for
goods, most contracts were won by foreign suppliers.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01       CORPAGUAS was directly responsible for construction of the sys-
tems. Force account was used for the larger subprojects, and donated com-
munity labor for many of the smaller subprojects. Some force account works
were  of  poor  quality.    Furthermore,  CORPAGUAS  did  a  poor  job  of
coordinating construction.   Professional staff, materials, vehicles and
funds were often not available at the same time.  This caused delays and
waste.  The use of some contractors (at least in some of the larger and
more accessible communities  such as Trinidad) might have improved the
efficiency and reduced the cost of construction.   CORFL(UAS also did not
make maximum use of community resources, partly because of insufficient
field staff. 5/ CORPAGUAS management has (as of 1986) recognized the need
for improved community work, and is implementing a plan to maintain better
coumunications with potential and completed subproject communities.
4.02      All tne systems were piped systems with house connections and, in
some cases, very few standpipes.   83% of the systems conduct water by
gravity, and most of the remainder use electrical pumps.   The level of
service is appropriate and consistent with the communities' desires. All
3/ The SAR did, not make a formal estimate of per capita costs. For the
purposes of comparison, per capita costs at appraisal were recalculated
at US$107.
g/ More realistic exchange rates would have reduced post 1982 costs
denominated in US$ even further.
5/  It  would  have  been  better  if  there  had  been  two  CORPAGUAS
representatives per community -- one for engineering and the other for
community relations. Only an engineer was sent. Other organizations,
(particularly non-governmental organizations) have been able to obtain
better community participation in similar projects.



- 8 -
the completed systems are unmetered. Water charges should in the future be
based on some assessment of consumption to make them more equitable and
improve the financial viability of the systems, particularly where large
consumers are present.
4.03      As a whole, the operational performance of the water supply sys-
tems is adequate.   CORPAGUAS and the Bank project completion mission
visited about half of the subprojects (Annex 10) in June-July 1986.  Two
thirds of the systems were functionixig satisfactorily.   Another 15% were
functioning but had serious problems. These problems included insufficient
water intake (caused by inadequate design and flood damage), poor water
quality (caused by mine contamination), and problems with the size, type
and maintenance of pumps.  Only 3 of the inspected systems (9%) were not
functioning. Of these, one had never been completed, another was not used
reportedly due to the high cost of gasoline for the pump, and the third had
flood damage to a main that should be repaired quickly by the community
itself, In addition, several communities had successfully completed needed
modifications such as the construction of new intakes and conduction
pipelines with assistance from Departmental Development Corporations or
CARE (an NGO).
4.04      During the period of planning and construction, CORPAGUAS helped
the communities organize water committees and set up simple accounting sys-
tems.   All the communities which were visited had a functioning water
committee or cooperative with volunteer officers and at least one paid
employee. The employee made simple repairs to the system. Major repairs
remain problematic because communities did not have the technical
capability or financial savings to attend to them.   Communities kept
reasonably adequate records of revenues, expenses, and customers. However,
many communities had problems in enforcing payment, particularly when the
water systems were not functioning properly.  Also most communities made
tariff adjustments only when immediate cash needs became overwhelming.
4.05       Thus far, CORPAGUAS has not systematically monitored completed
systems.  It is now launching an ambitious program to remain involved in
some of these systems.  In some cases, it has even signed contracts with
communities to operate and maintain systems and to collect tariffs on their
behalf. We feel that CORPAGUAS should have a modest presence in the opera-
tion of completed systems.   Specifically, we recommend that it: (a) give
more training in operation and maintenance to the communities during system
construction; (b) review community accounts on a regular basis; and (c)
provide technical assistance for major repairs and the setting of tariffs.
4.06      The subproject in Trinidad was the largest included in the loan,
both  in  terms  of  cost  and  number  of  beneficiaries  (27,500).    The
construction of the subproject is nearing completion.   The subproject
comprised the replacement of badly corroded and undersized pipes in the
central part of the town.   These replacements were not in themselves
sufficient to increase the supply of water to consumers. To describe the
existing situation in Trinidad as an emergency is an understatement. Only
a trickle of poor quality water is normally available in much of the



-9-
system. Complementary investments are needed to increase production and
replace house connections.   New wells which are under construction by
AROS-BENI, the water company, have been delayed due to technical problems.
In addition, AROS-BENI does not have the funds to install new water
connections.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      CORPAGUAS is not an autonomous organization, and its finances are
organized much like those of a Government department. Nearly all its fund-
ing is provided through normal budgetary channels by Government and by
external agencies. Government allocations were problematic during much of
the project period due to macroeconomic and financial difficulties.   The
Government is covering the debt service on the project, as intended at
appraisal.   CORPAGUAS accounts have been audited each year by external
auditors.
5.02          Community contributions to construction were greater than
expected6/.  At the time of appraisal, CORPAGUAS' policy was to receive a
contribution from the community in cash or labor equivalent to 15% of
direct investment costs (i.e. works and materials). In fact, the majority
(sixty percent) of the communities donated between 202 and 40% of the
direct costs. Loan agreements contracted before 1986 were also signed with
communities to repay all the remaining direct investment costs at fixed
(and very low) interest rates.7/ Bolivian law required that contracts for
repayment be denominated in Bolivian pesos. Unfortunately, inflation made
these  repayments  nearly  valueless.u/  New  national  laws  now  require
repayments of old loans in US$ equivalents, however few communities are
willing to comply with this retroactive requirement.
5.03       Loans for subprojects completed or still under construction in
1986 have been denominated in US$, with repayments in pesos equivalent at
the current exchange rate when payments are due. This should substantially
improve cost recovery.  CORPAGUAS hopes to raise sufficient funds through
internal sources to cover its overhead and assistance to communities in
operation and maintenance.   This will give  it a degree  of  financial
6/ Community contributions to total project costs (i.e. direct and
indirect, Table 1) were lower.
7/ Community debt service was not anticipated at appraisal, as it was felt
they could not afford it.
8/ The average loan to communities served in the early part of the
project was B$1.2 million, equivalent to US$ 60,000, to be repaid over
18 years. By 1985, inflation had reduced the value of B$1.2 million to
US$ 0.60.

self-sufficiency, though external support (from the Government and external
agencies such as the Bank) would still be needed for capital programs.
5.04         The tariff structure of rural and small urban communities
requires  further  study  and  refinement  (para.  4.02).    In  general,
communities are not charging sufficient amounts to adequately oover
operations, maintenance and debt service. A tariff system which includes a
sinking fund for major replaoement pumps is particularly needed.   In
addition, a study should be done of household incomes and expenditures in
order to determine appropriate levels of service, tariffs, and subsidies.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01           The institutional goals described at appraisal were uot
achieved,     Frequent  changes  in  Government  impeded  the  long  term
implementation of institutional change. Declining economic conditions and
poor Government finances inhibited the development of institutions.  Low
salaries made it difficult to retain staff, and funding problems prevented
program achievements, further reducing staff morale.
6.02      The Division of Urban Engineering (DIU) in the MTJV did not become
an evaluating arm of the Central Government as envisioned. However, during
the last two years, two important national bodies have been formed with a
mandate for technical and financial evaluation and overall coordination of
sector activities.   These include: (a) COTEAS, a technical advisory com-
mittee made up all the relevant national entities in the sector (COTEAS is
assisted by a technical secretariat); and (b) ANESAPA, a private
association of all urban water companies and other water supply
organizations.
6.03        Though CORPAGUAS signed contracts with decentralized regional
corporations (DDO's), DDOs did not consistently comply with agreements on
operation and maintenance of completed  systems.    However,  some DDO's
(CORDEOR and CORDECRUZ, for example) have developed a capability for rural
water supply development, and CORDEOR, in particular, has, with the assist-
ance of CARE, carried out a promising training program for communities in
operation and maintenance. Recent changes in funding formulas for regional
corporations, will alter their basic programs. A reassessment is needed of
their potential for rural water supply development, construction, operation
and maintenance.
6.04       During the early years of the project, CORPAGUAS became a more
capable institution with a number of well-trained engineers and other pro-
fessionals.  After the macroeconomic decline, CORPAGUAS was only a shell
with a few professionals.   Salaries remain a serious problem.  CORPAGUAS
lacks institutional and financial autonomy.   It is not permitted to set
salaries, and it does not have the financial resources to pay competitive
salaries.   Low salaries have led to serious anomalies.   Supposedly full
time staff support themselves with outside jobs, permitting only part-time
work for CORPAGUAS. Per diems are excessively high to compensate for low



- 11-
salariesg/ discouraging CORPAGUAS  from authorizing needed field trips of
their personnel because of a lack of funds.
6.05      The Bank loan financed a PAHO-executed consultancy on the manage-
ment and organization of CORPAGUAS. The terms of reference emphasized the
improvement of accounting, finance, collections, operations and maint-
enance.  The consultency work resulted in a number of volumes of manuals
with recommendations.   It did a good and thorough job of describing an
improved organization and better procedures.   However, it neglected to
identify priorities or help define a step by step transition from the
present circumstances to the improved organization. CORPAGUAS is trying to
implement the Tecommended organization; but it does not have the capability
to absorb all the recommendations, well founded as they are in themselves.
Assistance in implementing the recommendations is required.  In addition,
CORPAGUAS has no concrete plans for future subprojects, therefore a high
priority at the moment is the identification of communities which need
water supply systems, a determination of their feasibility and the
preparation of engineering designs.   Unless this is done very quickly,
CORPAGUAS' existence as an entity would be in question.
VII* JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The project had a significant impact on water supply services in
rural areas of Bolivia, as it included 5% of the total number of rural
residents among its direct beneficiaries.
7.02       The project had a positive impact on sanitary conditions in the
highland areas of the provinces of La Paz, Potosi, Oruro and Cochabamba
where the early and completed subprojects are concentrated, the lowland
areas of Tarija, Beni, and Chuquisaca when the later subprojects are
completed, and, in the case of Beni, when necessary complementary works
have been completed (para. 4.06).
7.03       Upon completion, there will be at least 60% more beneficiaries
(para. 1.03) than expected at appraisal. Beneftciaries report considerable
satisfaction  with  the  facilities   constructed  under   the  project.
Beneficiaries are particularly happy with the improvements in convenience
(e.g., time savings in drawing water) which the project has brought. They
also report direct productive benefits (e.g. animal watering) and
improvement  in health.    The health  impact  of  the project cannot be
accurately assessed due to: (a) the inherent difficulties in evaluating
these impacts in any water supply project, and (b) a lack of health data
from  the  subject  communities  either  before  or  after  subproject
construction. Health statistics show a decrease at the national level in
reported cases of water-borne diseases (diarrhea and typhoid fever) which
is consistent with a national increase in access to drinking water among
rural residents from 32 in 1973 to 182 in 1985.
9/ A few days of per diems results in more excess cash (above typical
travel expenses) than the monthly salary.

7.04       The projeot also assisted in the formation of rural sanitation
committees, an improvement in the organizational capabilitied of rural
areas.   These committees are operating, maintaining and expanding their
respective water systems.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE AND CONCLUSIONS
8.01         The project was successful in expanding and improving water
supply services in rural areas of Bolivia at a reasonable cost. This is a
notable accomplishment in light of the political instability and economic
difficulties affecting Bolivia during much of the project's implementation.
8.02       The implementation took more than twice as long as the 4.5 years
anticipated at appraisal.   Implementation is not yet fully completed.
Though much of the implementation delay was due to maroroeconomic problems,
the  appraisal  was  also  overly  optimistic  regarding  the  pace  of
implementation.   The size of the project and the number of communities
included exceeded CORPAGUAS absorptive capacity even before economic
problems began to affect implementation.   The appraisal also did not
correctly assess the resolve of local authorities (in Sucre and Potosi) to
address financial problems.   In retrospect, the appraisal seems to have
been premature.   A longer and more intense period of preparation--and
better communication with implementing agencies--might have resulted in a
realistic project size, a better implementation schedule, and a recognition
that AAPOS and BLAPAS were not willing to raise tariffs sufficiently to
meet financing requirements.
8.03      The Bank's relationship with the Borrower and with CORPAGUAS was
good throghout the execution period.  Bank staff worked closely with the
Borrower, and showed a needed flexibility to expand the project when condi-
tions warranted.   The Bank also did not insist rigidly on adherence to
project covenants when they proved irrelevant to conditions in the sector
or the country. CORPAGUAS indicated an appreciation of the efforts of Bank
staff (Annex 12).
8.04       The participation of the communities was a positive element in
the project. Communities contributod a higher proportion of cash and labor
to the construction of works than expected. In addition, they have proven
themselves capable of operating and maintaining most systems and
effectively pressing for help on major repairs and modifications (para.
4.03). A number of other specific lessons have been learned. Specifically
with regard to project content, these include the need for including: (a)
rehabilitation and expansion components in rural as well as urban water
supply projects (para. 3.08); (b) consultancy services or other technical
assistance to design the next stage of system expansion and rehabilitation
and to assist in implementation of recommendations derived from technical
assistance components (para. 6.05).  Regarding institutions, there is a
need for increasing the autonomy of water supply implementing agencies
(para. 6.04).   Recognizing the importance of the relationship with the



- 13-
community is a key element in successful rural water supply projects.
Specific lessons include the need for: (a) assigning specific persons from
the implementing agency solely to community relations (para. 4.03); and
(b) providing training in operations and maintenance to local communities
(para. 4.04).
8.05       An extremely important objective in any water supply project is
to develop sustainable programs and strong institutions.   This objgctlve
has not been achieved yet. The most important requirement at the moment is
work toward sustainability by building on this largely successful effort.
To this end, a follow-up project should be prepared. Th:s project should
include further development (including sources and house connections) in
the city of Trinidad, and the rehabilitation of some existing, as well as
the implementation of some new systems in rural areas. It also should pro-
vide for institutional strengthening of CORPAGUAS and selected Regional
Corporations.

Summary Assessment
Sector Institutional Arrangement
Lack    of    central    resposibility    for    formulating
policies and overlapping responsibilities for coordinating and
carrying out investments persisted throughout the project.
o CORPAGUAS,  a  decentralized  agency  attached  to  MUV    is
responsible for planning and executing water supply and
sanitation projects in small 6 medium sized communities (2,000
- 10,000) except Department Capitals.
o The Ministry of Health is (through DSA) responsible for
communities below 2,000.
o The Ministry of Agriculture also carries out water &
sanitation investments in rural areas.
System operation & maintenance under the responsibility of
commur.ities.
o Water & sewerage tariffs set by Government on the basis of
CORPAGUAS's request.
Assessment of CORPAGUAS
Staff
o Adequate for construction activities.   Weak  in  planning,
control  and  coordination  of  activities.    Has  failed  to
implement strategy to improve staffing capacity.   Low salary
levels also affected retention of qualified staff and ability
and willingness of staff to work full time.

Nanagement
Weak operational procedures in CORPAGUAS.  Government signed
with  PAHO    a  technical  assistanoe  program  to  improve
operations. The T.A.   program ended in aid-1986.   Overall
manageLent was adversely affected by uncertainty surrounding
the outcome of the sector reorganisation (within the context
of (PLANASBA).
Planning & Budgeting
Planning was virtually non-existent during a major part of the
project execution. Poor subproject implementation planning &
budgeting resulted in late disbursements.
Design
Usually done by local consultants.   Technical designs were
generally adequate.   The design unit lacked an information
system for project preparation and design.
Hydrogeology
Key weakness. Inadequate training of well drilling personnel
and technicians.
Construction & Supervision
Work  done  by   force  account.         Inadequate  means  of
transportation affected the pace of implementation. Vehicles
and equipment were purchased under the loan. No preventive
maintenance done, only emergency repairs. All vehicles still
working. Those bought at start of project in bad state.
Operation &'Naintenance
CORPAGUAS lacked the staff to assist the communities to
operate and maintain. The DDOs defaulted on this function.
There was no training for operators- Systems are reasonably
maintained, however many of those requiring pumping work only
intermittently.
Accounting & Auditing
The accounting system lacked procedures to fully evaluate cost
of completed systems and inventories. Accounts were audited
in a timely fashion by external auditc's.  TA successfully
given to communities to establish community level accounts and
records, but no follow up.

Tariffs
Fixed  monthly  tariffs  with  inadequate  adjustments  for
inflation. Average tariff was estimated at US $0.11/month in
1983, one of the lowest in Latin America.   Insuffioient to
cover O&M  and debt  service.    No  replacement  reserve  for
pumps. Absence of procedures to periodically update tariff.
Training
CORPAGUAS failed to institute training program.
Subloans Recovery
Poor and meaningless. Accounts receivable grew progressively
worse until 1985 when hyper-inflation reduced the value of
repayments to practically nothing.

cation Mission         cities.
The recently created National Housing Bank - Banco de
Vivienda (BANVI) is preparing a set of criteria and
policies for lending in the water sector for
examination by preappraisal mission.
S Sector institutional capacity is very weak and newly
emarging.
Augtst 29, 1975
Memo from Res Rep      Memo recommending the proposed project be modest in
scope because of the low payment capacity of the
population and the weak Central Budget. Recommends
that the Project should consist of:
(1)   a national metering program
(2)   system rehabilitation
(3)   chlorination program
(4)   groundwater program
(5)   a national training program
October 10, 1975    Appraisal Stage
BTO Appraisal          The Housing Bank (BANVI), proposed intermediary
Mission                Borrower, has been in operation only since mid-1975.
Because of its inexperience any Bank loan channeled
through BANVI shouLtd be small.

Document/Date                                 Major Issues
e  Institution building promoted by a bank loan should aim
at rationalizing the roles and functions of the large
number of institutions active in the sector.
o The Bank's lending rate became an issue with BANWI
particularly since other donors were lending at lower
rates.
o The Sucre project is not attractive on financial and
economic grounds. Moreover, ELAPAS has staffing
problems due to low salaries.
o The Potosi project is also unattractive because of the
low incomes of potential beneficiaries and is unlikely
to permit a loan of more than US$ I million.
o The Riberalta project is overdesigned and unsuitable
because of its location in " state in which IDB expects
to become involved.
October 29, 1975
Aide-Hemoire         °  Executing agencies selected:
Appraisal                 -  Departmental Development Committee (DDO for
Potosi)
Mission                   - CORPAGUAS 1/
- ELAPAS for Sucre
* The loan should be channelled through the Central Bank
and Ministry of Finance. The utilization of BANVI no
longer deemed necessary because of its inexperience.
o Special conditions for loan approval include: (a)
Water tariffs for Sucre and Potosi should be increased
and water metering introduced in Potosi; (b) Corpaguas
should be strengthened; (c) The Water Authority for
Potosi (AAPOS) should take over responsibility for
sewerage in Potosi and be developed into a Regional
Authority; and (d) Counterpart funds of about $5
million should be provided during project execution.
November 12, 1975
Decision
Memorandum              Cost recovery issues: systems in Potosi (AAPOS) and
Sucre (ELAPAS) are subsidized by the DDOs and officials
reluctant to raise tariffs while services remain
unreliable.
I1  The Corporaci7n de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (CORPAGUAS) is a
suni-autonomous agency under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Plan-
ning; its functions include: planning, design, construction, financing,

° Recommend DDO make financial contribution to Potosi to
cover current operational cost and prepare a metering
and tariff study for Potosi and Sucre by 12/31/76 for
implementation by June 1977.
e Recommend annual tariff increases for both cities
beginning in 1976. The first increase should be a
condition for disbursing Bank funds.
February 17, 1976
Memo from Projects      Proposed rncrease in loan to US$12 million against
to Programs            US $10 due to: (a) Increase in the rural program from
60 to 70 systems. (b) A consumer/connection survey
added to Potosi project. (c) Cost of financing
interest during construction.
March 4, 1976
Memo from Projects  *  Recorded a change in the loan intermediary to the MUV
rather than the Central Bank (as proposed in the
Decision Memo), following a review of the role of MUV's
Division of Urban Engineering (DIU).

BTO Preneg.         -e AAPOS reluctantly accepted covenant to raise water
Mission                 charges requiring a 54Z increase by Dec. 1976.
Authorities have not yet resolved matters concerning
the source of local financing and proposed earmarked
tax to subsidize operation of the sewerage subproject
in Sucre.
MUV requested including a WSS component in Riberalta
(where IDB is operating). Bank proposed consulting
with IDB in Washington.
July 29, 1976
Neg. Memo              N Vegotiations were held July 26-28, a 2-month delay from
original plans caused by internal disucssions on
whether (1) to finance interest during construction
(idc) or (2) to lend for 23 or 25 years. (The Bak
eventually decided not to finance ldc and to lend for a
20-year period)*
* The Bolivian delegation comprised the Subsecretary,
MUV; the Chief Engineer of DIU; the GM of CORPAGUAS;
and the Chief of the Finance Departmaent of the Ministry
of Finance.
e No major design and substantive changes were
negotiated. It appears that the Riberalta subproject
was not seriously considered.
e The Bolivians were unsuccessful in getting 'softer
terms' for the project, particularly the rural
component.

August 25, 1976
Memo to Mr. Stern   e  In July 1976 Ministerial Order No. 133 on tariffs for
water and sewerage was amended to reflect project
requirements, i.e., to raise charges to cover O&M and
debt service costs.
° The provision for retroactive financing of engineering
services was increased to $100,000 to reflect faster
progress in design work than anticipated.

o AAPOS late in fulfilling conditions for disbursement,
i.e., to increase water charges; to present to the Bank
a plan for (i) installation of meters and (ii) adoption
of a tariff system based on quantity consumed.
o ELAPAS obtained approval of covenanted tariff increase
from National Tariff Council effective January 1, 1977,
but slow in fulfilling other disbursement condition,
i.e., to take steps to enact a tax to finance the sewer
component in Sucre. An earmarked cement tax was
authorized by the President of Bolivia, but the
enabling legislation was not yet complete.
e Subloan agreements between MUV and AAPOS and ELAPAS,
and financing agreement with CORPACUAS delayed which
are holding up disbursements.
July 14, 1977
Cable from Res Rep  e  Sucre unable to pass special tax to finance sewer
component for political reasons.
September 30. 1977
aTO Report           e  Subsidiary loan agreements still not signed, which is a
condition for disbursement.
*  ELAPAS (Sucre) has increased its tariffs.  Local
authorities are worried about the subsidiary loan
agreement and future commitments and would prefer
Covernment to assume debt service. Proposed cement tax
increase no longer a viable alternative; studies were
proposed to pursue other tax sources that would help
finance sewerage project in Sucre.

Letter from             G overnment informed Bank that Potosi and Sucre have
Min. of Housing         withdrawn from the project due to high interest rate
(8.91) of Bank Loan. The Govt. requested the

to SAGUAPAC (US$6.0 million) to finance sewerage
construction in Santa Cruz and CORPAGUAS (US $0.5
million) for development of new wells in the city of
Oruro. Plans for this work are well advanced.
November 16, 1977
Letter from          e  CORPAGUAS is having difficulty retaining and motivating
CORPAGUAS               technical staff because of the low salary levels (below

US$ 0.1 million
e  Delay in replacing senior staff has slowed work in the
DIU particularly in training of Project Evaluation
staff.
* CORPAGUAS, though not affected by Ministry changes, is
losing trained staff to the private sector and other
public agencies with higher pay scales. The Minister
coumissioned a comparative survey of professional
salaries to serve as basis for salary adjustment.
*  Design work has been completed bor more than half of
the proposed systems. Progress however is slowed by
delays in tendering procedures and CORPAGUAS's lack of

Letter from mm          About US $2.5 million of the loan have been disbursed
to date and nearly US $1.2 million out of the $5.2
million for the project would remain undisbursed.
The Subsecretary of MUV requested that the US$ 1.2
million in savings be allocated to the following:
(a) US $ 0.5 million for urgently needed work in
Trinidad, the capital of the Department of Beni (total
project costs are estimated at US $700,000). Estimated
execution April 1980 - September 1981; and (b) US $0.7
million to finance additional village systems.
November 30, 1979

* CORPACUAS would be executing agency with AROS-BEMI

o CORPAGUAS requests to take over O&M of systems it
constructed, although this represents a violation of
the Project Agreement.
e Although Project Evaluation Unit was created, it was
later dismantled and ministerial regulation was never
issued. New officials do not seem aware of loan
conditions to create unit.
* Technical Assistance not yet initiated by CORPAGUAS
although it was covenanted to end June 30, 1978.
CORPAGUAS' failure to initiate program is due to
reluctance to accept transfer of O&M to DDOs.
October 30, 1980
BTO Report           0  CORPAGUAS project execution record fell below achieve-
ments of its first 2 1/2 years as construction came
Cum Disbursement        close to a halt in 1980 due to (i) change in internal
US$ 2.8 million         management, of CORPAGUAS and (ii) political instability
in Bolivia.
e CORPACUAS now plans to construct the remaining 35
systems by end 1982 at an estimated cost of US$3.1

Document/Date                                Major Issues
e Maintenance of newly constructed systems is being
neglected.  The DDOs and communities are contractually
obligated to do O&H but lack of funds, technical
capacity and lack of support from CORPAGUAS are major
reasons for neglecting O&M.
e CORPAGUAS has decided to uadertake maintenance at least
on an interim basis u1il sector responsibilities are
defined by PLANASBA. I  CORPAGUAS plans to mobilize
community involvement using a mobile maintenance team.
e Mission concerned that CORPAGUAS was carrying excessive
inventory its warehouse and recoumended that CORPACUAS
draw up a plan of action for disposal of obselete
materials.
C Covenanted tech. asst. program still has not been
initiated. MUV's explanation for non-compliance is the
continuous uncertainty about the future of the sector
and MUV's preoccupation with PLANASSA.
C COIPAGUAS' debt recovery from beneficiary communities
poor. It intends to improve collections through
increased contact with the communities through its
planned 06K and community motivation unit.
C ORPAG UA  will use US $0.64 million to construct the
Trinidad subproject. A condition of disbursement is
the preparation of a tariff study by AROS-BENI.
Construction now expected to last April 1981 - November
1982.

BTO Report             To date a total of 41 rural systems have been
completed. Only 3 were constructed in 1980.
Cum Disbursement
US$2.8 million          Reasons for this slowdown in performance include (i) a
weakening in CORPAGUAS caused by lack of continuity in
top management (3 managers in 2 years), (ii)
uncertainty about the future sector organization.
e Preparation of the Trinidad subproject not yet
finalized which could lead to its elemination from the
loan. Delays are due to (1) slow prepration of bidding
documents and (2) delay in finalizing CORPACUAS-AROS
BENI contract.

BTO Report          e  Progress still slow.  CORPAGUAS now plans to complete
51 of the 74 projects in its program by end 1982.
Cum. Disbursement      Completion of all 74 would require extension of closing
US$ 3.3 million        date to 12/1985, as only 71X of the loan (US$3.5
million) could be disbursed by 12/30/83 under the most
optimistic scenario.
e  The rurl projects also delayed by slow finalization of
agreements with coamwunities and DDOs as stipulated in
Loan Agreement.

Document/Date                            Major Issues
e After maintaining large cash surpluses in previous
years, CORPACUAS now has barely enough cash to finance
planned investments in 1982 and 1983 and will have cash
deficits in 1984 when it plans to construct 4 of its
most expensive projects. The Govt6 is the only source
of funds for covering the deficit. Even the collection
of the overdue accounts would not provide sufficient
funds because of high inflation which has eroded the
value of these assets.
e  CORPAGUAS auctioned off its obsolete inventory in June
1982, in response to Bank's recommendations; Purchase
of insurance delayed due to its poor cash position.
e CORPACUAS has delayed implementing the TA component of
the project because of uncertainty of its future as a
result of a sector reorganization effort begun under
PLANAS8A in 1980. Legislation reorganizing the sector
was sent in late September 1982 by the UV and the
Minister of Planning to Congress for approval. The
legislation defines the legal framework for the opera-
tion and organization of CORPAGUAS as . decentralized
government agency, and establishes a new commission
consisting of the Deputy Ministers of Planning, Health
and Urban Affairs with responsibility for sector
policy.
* Closing date extension to December 31, 1984 recommended
because US$1.5 million will remain undisbursed by
6/30/83 and only 54 out of planned 74 systems will have
been constructed.
e Conditions for extension are: (a) passage of legisla-
tion defining CORPACUAS' role in the sector ji)
substantial progress on the Trinidad project- (at
least 30X of pipe installation completed); (c) contract
awards for supply of pipe for Tupiza project and
purchase of vehicles; (d) receipt by Bank of a revised
investment program and a financing plan for projects
already under construction and only new projects which
could be completed by 12/31/84 (e) receipt of a 75 of
collectibles and (f) hiring of local consultants as
construction managers for larger projects and to assist
with procurement.
This project has been delayed by (i) late shipment of pipe due to
currency exchange restrictions (ii) poor management and coordination
problems in CORPAGUAS and (iii) disagreement between CORPACUAS and
Trinidad DDOs on who would pay for increased cost of the project during
the inflationary period.

US$3.5 million         were completed.
CORPAGUAS expects to accelerate Loan disbursements
during 1984.
° During 1983 the Covernment assigned sufficient
counterpart funds which helped to compensate for Bank
suspension of loan withdrawals for Bolivia. CORPAGUAS
agreed to keep the Bank informed on budget developments
for 1984.
e Recovery of debt service by CORPAGUAS frG;a communities'
subloans continues to be low. As o' October 31, 1983,
overall recovery of overdue receivables since 1980 had
been only 262 of the outstanding total. Although
CORPAGUAS improved collection of receivables during
1983, its current resources and procedures are weak.
In addition, water tariffs are insufficient to pay for
systems' O&M costs and for debt service partly because
of inflation. Furthermore, communities' water systems
lack appropriate assistance from CORPAGUAS on
managerial and financial aspects.
0 CORPAGUAS expects to strengthen its organization with
the implementation of the TA under the loan. (The PAHO
contract is expected to be signed in early 1984). The
Bank had agreed on PAHO's TA conditioned on Bank's
clearance of the terms of reference and individual
consultants. CORPAGUAS agreed to submit to the BANK
terms of reference by January 15, 1984.

May 1983 for submission to Congress in 1984 CORPACUAS

1. Modified Appraisal refers to the Appraisal for the Project after the
deletion on 11/9/77 of the urban sub-projects for the cities of Potosi
and Sucre.
2. The original Appraisal estimated the total cost of the rural
subprojects to be US$7.67 million, including US$4.80 million from the
IBRD loan. However, the total of US$8.08 million presented here takes
account of the increase in the IBRD funding to US$5.21 million, without
any corresponding changes in government or local contributions.
3. The government contribution (via CORPAGUAS) is equal to the amount
disbursed to CORPAGUAS by the Bolivian National Treasury for the project
and CORPAGUAS overhead.
4. 4ppraisal estimate of government contribution was inconsistent,
stating in Appraisal paragraph 6.03 that it would be 20 %, but in
Appraisal Table 5 a figure of US$2.07 million was given, out of a total
US$7.67 million, which would be 27 %. In addition, the appraisal estimate
did not include CORPAGUAS' overhead as a project cost.

To:       Mr. Alain Thys,
Division Chief, Water Supply and Sewerage, Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office, World Bank.
From:     CORPAGUAS (Corporaci6n de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado)
Re:       Loan No. 1324-BO
Date:     December 1986
I.        BACKGROUND
In 1975, when the IBD-financed program of works was nearing
completion, CORPAGUAS submitted a new program to the government and requested
it to open negotiations with international lending institutions with a view to
obtaining a further loan to finance its implementation. On October 15, 1976,
negotiations with the World Bank culminated in the signing of Loan Agreement
No. 1324-BO between the Bank and the Bolivian government for a loan totaling
of US$11.5 million, US$4.71 million of which was allocated to CORPAGUAS for
the construction of about 70 water supply systems to serve localities with
populations ranging from 500 to 10,000 inhabitants -- an activity for which
CORPAGUAS is responsible -- thus benefiting about 100,000 persons over five
years.
Later, when the Sucre and Potosi urban projects were cancelled (both
of wbich were included in Loan No. 1324-BO), an additional US$0.5 million was
allocated to CORPAGUAS in order to finance the Emergency Plan for the City of
Trinidad. Special authorization was requested for this through a Government
Decree. The World Bank gave its approval, and the proceeds granted to this
institution totaled US$5.21 million. In addition, the government agreed to
allocate US$2.1 million to the project, and, together with the communities'
contribution of US$0.8 million, this brought the total to US$8.11 million.
II.       PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
It is necessary to describe briefly the conditions in which the
project was implemented, so as to provide a clearer picture of the work
performed by CORPAGUAS as executing agency while facing a series of problems
that arose mainly because of the serious economic crisis affecting the
country. To this end, the project implementation period can be divided into
the following three stages:



- 46 -
ANNE 12
1977-79: A stage characterized by comparative economic stability, during
which CORPAGUAS completed installation of 36 potable water supply systems
(i.e. about 50% of those planned under the project).
1980-82: A period marked by incipient inflation and, particularly, a
lack of government financing. This slowed down the rate of
installations, so that only 17 systems were constructed.
1983-85: During this time, hyperinflation affected not only the
government and its agencies, but all sectors of the population, leading
to considerable social unrest and making it very difficult to obtain the
financing committed to the project by the government. As a result, only
eight systems were completed. Eight others - consisting mainly of the
upgrading and extension of existing systems using imported equipment and
materials financed with loan funds -- did not get through the
construction stage. They are expected to be completed early in 1987.
Project implementation also encountered many other problems,
including the following:
- problems and delays in the supply of equipment and materials to most
work sites, because of inadequate roads;
- repeated and prolonged strikes and stoppages brought on by the
economic crisis;
- a lack of timely and adequate disbursements from domestic sources;
- the departure of specialized professional personnel, and the
difficulty of finding replacements in view of the extremely low
salaries paid by the institution.
III.      INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
Regarding PAHO/WHO technical assistance under the Technical
Cooperation Agreement for strengthening Bolivia's operating capability, see
CWS-050, Annex I (photocopy).
IV.       THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF CORPAGUAS (ANNEX II)
The technical cooperation program profoundly changed the
institution's organizational structure, with the establishment of the Services
Management Bureau (divided into a Commercial Department and an Operations and
Maintenance Department) and the Planning Unit.
The following were the main objec-ives of this restructuring:
(1) capital cost recovery;
(2) management of the systems installed;



- 47 -                                  ANNEX 12
Page 3 of 5
(3) operation and maintenance of the water supply systems constructed by
CORPAGUAS.
V.        CONDITION OF THE SYSTEMS CONSTRUCTED BY CORPAGUAS (ANNEX 3)
As one of CORPAGUAS' basic operating policies in 1986, and one of
the responsibilities of the new Maintenance Unit, inspection and evaluation of
32 of the IBRD-financed systems were scheduled. As a result, repair and
rehabilitation programs are being planned for 1987 and an external-credit
package for the rehabilitation of potable water supply systems serving
communities is being prepared.
These evaluations show that the shortcomings in most of the systems
result from the lack of any real maintenance program, rather than from defects
in design or construction.
VI.       FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE LOAN (ANNEX 4)
The attached Annex contains a detailed analysis of investment and
amortizations, including changes in relation to the US$. It refers to
completed systems, but not to those installations now in process of delivery
or construction, details of which will be available once they are completed.
VII.      SITUATION AS REGARDS BASIC SANITATION IN BOLIVIA (ANNEX  )
Sanitation has been reorganized over the recent period, and this
work will continue in the coming years. Data now prepared will enable us to
improve our planning. The Annex contains eight explanatory tables.
VIII.     GENERAL INFORMATION ON CORPAGUAS (ANNEX 6)
The Annex contains general details of CORPAGUAS, including
organization, work plans, recent agreements, projects currently being
executed, locations for which it is responsible (i.e. at present, communities
with more than 2,000 inhabitants), and systems constructed.
IX.       EVALUATION AND CONCLUSIONS
In pursuit of the main objectives for which it was established as a
government agency, CORPAGUAS has directed most of its efforts toward designing
and constructing water supply systems. These activities could not have been
performed without external financing. Thus, the IBRD loan has enabled
CORPAGUAS to fulfill its important objectives and responsibilities by
executing these works. In addition, this financing has also permitted
implementation of a program of institutional strengthening which will, in the
future, enable us to optimize our resources, upgrade design and construction
procedures, and manage, operate and maintain the systems installed.

The fact that the target for the number of systems to be installed
was actually achieved is evidence of the efficient use of the loan. Any
delays and extensions of the implementation period were a consequence of the
economic chaos affecting all the country's institutions.
As regards the quality of construction and present condition of the
systems, no further comments need be made on their design and construction
other than those normally applicable to such works. Many were carried out in
areas remote from towns and from any sources of assistance, communications,
infrastructure, etc. Any shortcomings in the systems inspected and evaluated
are basically due to lack of maintenance, because no specific maintenance
policy was applied. We are currently doing our best to remedy this problem,
and are hoping for credit support to enable us to efficiently rehabilitate and
upgrade the systems and also to recover the capital costs.
Capital cost recovery from the various systems has been very low,
particularly because of the constant changes in the value of the Bolivian peso
and the effects of inflation, which meant that amortization payments became
ridiculously small in terms of the US$ (the loan currency), while the previous
government's decrees restricting the use of the US$ made adjustments
impossible. Similarly, the systems that have now been constructed are not
properly maintained, so that the defects now appearing have the effect of
reducing total revenue and amortization payments can only be met by falling
back on the guarantees. We are currently doing our best to gradually recover
the costs by means of a program of repairs, maintenance and management assist-
ance*
The following conclusions can be drawn:
- All projects scheduled were completed.
- There was a considerable time overrun, a major reason being the
country's economic position.
- The defects in most of the systems are due to lack of maintenance
rather than design or construction faults.
- The institutional strengthening program achieved its objectives with
respect to preparation of models and presentation of prospects.
- Cost recovery has been made very difficult by the recent economic
situation. In some cases amortization payments have been made only
on minor items, and in others payments have been inadequate.
We wish to make the following recommendations:
- It is absolutely essential to obtain external credit in support of a
wide-ranging program for rehabilitating and upgrading the systems
constructed.

- 49 -                               Page Sof 5
- A program of regular preventive maintenance must also be prepared.
- If the models and training provided under the Institutional
Strengthening Agreement are to be properly used, they must be
complemented by a program for their application. For this,
financial support will be necessary, so that in future we can
efficiently recover capital costs and make management, operation and
maintenance of the systems self-financing.
In view of the circumstances in which the project was implemented,
and the degree to which the original objectives were achieved (see Table
No. 1), it must be concluded that the project has fulfilled its purpose, even
though the factors identified above caused a considerable time overrun.
We wish to make particular mention of the cooperation provided by
all IBRD staff concerned with the project, particularly the members of the
visiting missions; their vision, understanding and diligence assisted us in
completing the project.
Yours, etc.

The pipe trench being excavated here is five kilometers long, and
will allow a water seur-e at a higher elevation to be connected,
via "gravity flow," to the distribution in the town of Eotte Rios
(population approximately 1,700).  This will eliminate the higher
operating expenses of the old pumped system which the new system
will replace.

This intake was constructed by CORPAGUAS in the town of Poopo in
1980. However, it had to be abandoned due to annual damage from
river flooding, and in 1985 it was replaced by a new intake
constructed by the community with materials provided by CARE and a
design provided by the departmental Development Corporation of
Oruro.
PHOO NO. 2 - ROAD CONSTRUCTED ALONG PIPELINE ROUTE
In order to facilitate transport and installation of construction
materials, this road had to be constrt¶cted along the pipelin
route for the project in Entre Rios. The need for such a road
illtustrates the difficult access of many of the project sites, and
accounted for some construction delays.
