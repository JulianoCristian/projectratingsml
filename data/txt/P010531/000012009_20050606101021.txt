3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The Reproductive and Child Health (RCH 1) project was a SIL intended to assist the GOI improve the
performance of the Family Welfare Program (FWP) in reducing maternal and infant morbidity and
mortality, and unwanted pregnancies, leading to the stabilization of population growth. The two phases of
IDA financing, of which this project was the first phase, were to support a comprehensive reorientation of
India's Family Welfare Program, to bring it into line with the intended new GOI family welfare policy.
Underlying Bank Economic and Sector Work (ESW) supported such a policy change. This project was to
be a nationwide undertaking by the Family Welfare Department to operationalize the paradigm shift to a
non-coercive `target free' approach, which would then progressively evolve into an integrated holistic RCH
program.

Within the overall umbrella of reducing infant, child, and maternal mortality, the objective was to:
(a)      improve management and performance by nationwide implementation of policy change,
         referred to as the 'participatory planning approach' (target free approach), and institutional
         strengthening for timely and coordinated utilization of project resources;
(b)      improve quality of coverage and effectiveness of existing FW services;
(c)      progressively expand the scope and content of existing FW services to include more elements
         of a defined package of essential reproductive and child services; and
(d)      increase access by strengthening FW infrastructure and improving quality in selected
         disadvantaged districts.

These objectives are considered relevant because they supported the GOI strategy of a multisectoral
approach to population stabilization without targets and were in keeping with the ICPD Action Plan (Cairo
1994), an issue of high international visibility at that time.
The India CAS of 1995 (Report No. 14509-IN), confirmed by the Executive Directors in 1996 (Report No.
IDA/R96-154/1), provided the basis for supporting the Government's effort to accelerate the pace of
sustainable economic and social development. The objective of the CAS was to reduce poverty, strengthen
institutions, enhance beneficiary participation in project design and implementation, and enable women to
participate more fully in the development process, including health. The two fundamental issues in the
sector analytical pieces influencing project objectives and design were:
l inadequate slowing of population growth (despite a long established FP program) and,
l major disparities in health and fertility between states, and rural and urban areas due to differentials in
    socioeconomic status, levels of political commitment and management capacity.

The project objectives would thus, concurrently, address, among others, the heavy burden of disease among
women and children for which there were known, highly cost effective interventions; underutilization of
existing large public facilities and manpower; program distortions due to excessive focus on
method-specific contraceptive acceptor targets and use of financial incentives; poor quality of care due to
shortages of supplies and improper staff behavior; inadequate and inflexible funding, top-down
management and inadequate support of front-line workers; and, inadequate mobilization of private and
NGO resources.

Within the Family Welfare Program, the RCH project would strengthen the coordination of FW and
Department of Women and Child Development (WCD) outreach workers; FW and Ministry of Rural
Development community level investments; and increase domestic and foreign assistance for the sector with
greater emphasis on performance-based funding of state level activities. The major beneficiaries of the
project were to be poor women and children under five years of age (U5), residing in rural areas and urban

slums, helped through improvements in reproductive health, especially family planning and better child
survival.


RCH-1 initiated a fundamental reorientation of India's Family Welfare Program. Given the long history of
the program and the many forces that were beyond project control, the goals proved to be very ambitious
and difficult to achieve during the first phase of the project.


3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the project were never revised but there were substantial amendments to activities and
financing under Component 2 and, to a lesser extent, Component 3, which did not justify changing the
overall development objectives.

3.3 Original Components:
The project originally had the following three components, divided into seven sub-components:

CO1: Improved Management Performance

   l Sub-co i: Expanding existing monitoring system and decentralized planning - by expanding
        service delivery data through exit polls and technical assessments, rapid assessment of perceptions.
   l Sub-co ii: Institutional strengthening through a/ Procurement and Technical support - by
        appointing consultants for specific technical and operational needs, and b/ Research for RCH
        management - operational and evaluative research to inform and disseminate progress.
   l Sub-co iii: Enhancing program management capacity - for planning, implementation, supervision
        and monitoring.

CO2: Nationwide Improved Quality, Coverage and Effectiveness, and Expanded Content of the
Essential Package of RCH Services

   l Sub-co iv: Upgrading service delivery - to improve quality and scope of care and referrals between
        communities and facilities. Equipment and drugs were included in this component.
   l Sub-co v: Training - to upgrade technical and management competence and skills at all levels.
   l Sub-co vi: IEC - to change health seeking behavior and increase community participation.


CO3: Local Capacity Enhancement/Improved Access in Selected Disadvantaged Districts and Cities

   l Sub-co vii: District and city sub-project - to improve infrastructure and service delivery to the
        most disadvantaged districts and urban slums and encourage innovation.

3.4 Revised Components:
There were multiple significant reallocation of resources and restructuring of the content of some
components. The first restructuring, in June 1999, provided US$50 million for enhanced immunization
coverage through support of polio vaccines and social mobilization activities. US$25 million was
reallocated from the following expenditure categories, "Civil works", "Consultant services" (including
IEC), "Incremental salaries & operating expenses" and "Unallocated", to "Drugs"; another US$25 million
for social mobilization came from the "Training and workshops" and "Incremental salaries and operating
expenses". (In December 2000, IDA approved a free-standing Immunization Strengthening Project to take
care of all subsequent immunization activities). The second restructuring followed the recommendations at
the MTR in November 2000 and involved three areas - project content, financial arrangements and



                                                      - 3 -

organization and management. The content areas affected in the restructuring included, training, IEC,
NGO, RCH schemes, civil works and local capacity enhancement. The resulting changes in project cost
are given in Annex 2

A variety of measures were also put in place to improve management. This included the appointment of an
additional officer to support the Joint Secretary at the center; defining activities to be funded under
"financial envelopes"; appointment of additional consultants under contract; and the decentralization of
approval procedures to reduce IDA involvement in the review details. The latter would include increased
state level responsibility for training plans, local capacity enhancement and the RCH schemes. These
changes had specific implications for both procurement and supervision which the Mid term review tried to
address.

The third amendment allocated US$30 million from the project to the Gujarat earthquake disaster.
Supplementary financing was later granted (SDR 10 million; US$12 million equivalent) to cover for the
disbursement. An undisbursed amount of approximately US$11.4 million from the Gujarat earthquake
allocation was later moved back to the original categories under the RCH project.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry Assessment was not a regular Bank practice at the time of the design of the project. The
design was, however, carried out with rigor and due support from Bank management and senior GOI staff.
The following project alternatives considered and rejected:
l a time slice operation;
l further state-specific investment projects akin to the previous Population Projects;
l a nationwide program investment for a second Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) project;
l a totally district-based approach;
l greater focus on supporting reduction of the infrastructure gap and reaching GOI norms; and,
l incorporation of private providers into the mainstream of the project.


The design also took into consideration the lessons from previous Family Welfare projects, especially
state-based Population Projects with perennial problems of slow disbursements, inadequate integration and
weak IEC/community components. Poor procurement and vertical approaches had plagued the CSSM
project. Additional lessons from related projects in Education and with USAID, that had introduced
registered societies to reduce fund flow delays, were also incorporated in the design. Indications of
borrower commitment and financial assessment were all satisfactory. But, the design also failed to deal
adequately with certain perennial recurrent issues in India such as the complex relationship between the
center and the states limiting federal oversight of state activities, especially fiduciary and capacity issues at
all levels.

The extensive preparation did not completely eliminate design flaws that became apparent during project
implementation, notwithstanding, the extensive efforts. However, quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall rating for the project is unsatisfactory. The project preparation process clearly contributed to
adoption of the Target Free policy, but implementation of the policy was weak and in some areas even
reversed. The project's effectiveness was diluted by its complexity in the attempt to combine prior
state-level initiatives into a single national project, and by inadequate attention in the design to measures
needed to roll such a fundamental policy change out to the many levels of India's complex FW system, as

well as forces beyond the control of the project. As a result, implementation of the policy change did not
gain momentum in the critical period after it was announced. The project did support a variety of activites
and introduced some innovations (e.g. maternal audits in TamilNadu), but their scope remained confined
and a substantial proportion of important targets were not achieved. The rating was further diluted by the
weak performance of the critical second component focusing on quality of care (comparable data from the
two rounds of District Household Surveys conducted between 1998 and 2003 has been used for this
analysis).

To its credit, the project increased the visibility of reproductive health and brought many issues into the
public domain. This emboldened the stakeholders working on the policy change that the GOI was planning.
The National Population Policy was launched in 2000, `affirming the commitment of GOI towards
voluntary and informed consent of citizens while availing of reproductive health care services' (NPP,
2000). This success was however tempered by weak IEC and management components. It should be noted,
for example, that the target system has not disappeared in India. The policy dialogue on sterilization was
ongoing throughout the life of the project but was made more complicated because of the strong ongoing
opposition of women's groups to the introduction of hormonal methods in the national program, making it
difficult to expand the method mix. Today, female sterilization is still given priority over other methods,
including increased payments to clients and motivators and surgeons who perform surgical contraception
in the public sector. These are deep rooted issues that will take more than a project to solve and would have
required a much longer time period -beyond this project -- to change.

The project is also to be credited with introducing the concept of participation and equity among
beneficiaries in the planning and delivery of RCH services. By focusing on the poorest districts and
disadvantaged populations under component three, the project created awareness of the large disparities in
health outcomes at both state and district levels. The data also showed positive trends in some key output
and outcome indicators. Overall, full ANC increased by 8.4% and assisted delivery by skilled attendants
went up by 7.9%. But the increase in assisted deliveries was only in the private sector, where deliveries
rose from 9.4 to 21.5%. Public sector deliveries actually decreased by 5.5%. While the contraceptive
prevalence rate (CPR) appears to have increased by 4.3%, immunization saw a steep drop, from 52% to
44.6%.

4.2 Outputs by components:
CO1: Improved Management Performance
This project was implemented at three levels: the Center was responsible for monitoring policy
implementation, advocacy, financial management and bulk procurement of basic drugs and equipment;
States were responsible for training, financial management and monitoring of activities implemented in
their districts; District Family Welfare Bureaus or Zilla Parishads were the implementers of most project
activities, relying on technical support from the higher levels. This arrangement worked, but was not
without its problems. Overall, this component is rated satisfactory.

Sub-co i/ Expanding existing monitoring system and decentralize planning - by expanding service
delivery data through exit polls and technical assessments, rapid assessment of perceptions.
Decentralized planning was an important part of this project, starting with Community Needs Assessments
(CNA). The target of districts implementing decentralized planning was met. However some concerns
were raised by the Districts, States, MOHFW staff and other development partners who know the project
well, regarding the process and quality of what was achieved. First, implementation of CNA has been
mixed but overall unsatisfactory. This weakness adversely affected the process of decentralized planning
from the onset, making it easy for sub-centers, PHCs and Districts to derive their own programs, instead of
perceived community needs. Second, the MIS was improved by reducing the number of reporting formats
and widening the range of RCH activities monitored at state and national levels. Computers were supplied
to 530 districts and 32 states/UTs. 56% of districts submitted monthly statistical summaries in 2004,
although many were late and internal validation or feedback was lacking. Thus, although some data of
mixed quality are being collected, it was not always effectively used to inform service delivery and
management. Third, the original plan to monitor quality of services through small scale opinion polls and
exit interviews, as well as on-going supervisory quality monitoring, was not undertaken. Apparently this
was changed at the request of GOI, who needed district specific data for planning and was replaced by the
District Household Surveys. The first round of the surveys was completed in all the districts
(approximately 600) in 1998/9 ­ a huge undertaking ­ and have been analyzed and published. The second
round, conducted in 2002/03, is still being analyzed and data for only half the districts were available by
the time of the ICR. While the household survey data will be useful, it does not adequately fulfill the
original objective of quality monitoring. The data has, however, been used to assess the completeness of
routine MIS data, provide district specific patterns and barriers to utilization of both health services, and
provide information on the range of basic services at various levels. In the absence of the latest DHS data
(scheduled for 2005), the two rounds of household surveys are the only objective measure of RCH1
performance.

The overall rating of this sub-component is satisfactory.

Sub-co ii/ Institutional strengthening through a/ Procurement and Technical support - by appointing
consultants for specific technical and operational needs, and b/ Research for RCH management -
operational and evaluative research to inform and disseminate progress.
Three related bottlenecks to implementation were addressed under this component: procurement, funds flow
and financial management.

A/ Procurement was a problem throughout this project. Two consultant firms (HSCC+ and HLL+) were
appointed by the GOI as its procurement agents to assist with procurement at the central level. The
agencies were successful in improving some aspects of procurement process but delays in decision-making
persisted, resulting in repeated stock-outs of essential RCH drugs at the front line. Logistics, which was



                                                      - 6 -

weak from the onset and is critical to effective supply chain, was not addressed by these agencies and
remains as problematic as ever. The project also aimed to decentralize procurement to state level but this
only happened in Tamil Nadu which already had a functional procurement capacity. The mixed
performance in procurement and the fact that little additional capacity has been built at any level renders
the rating of this activity unsatisfactory.

B/ Funds flow: The biggest contribution of the project was the establishment or strengthening of SCOVAs
as pass-through for funds both at state and district levels and recruitment of consultants to help with
specific administrative activities. The well performing states were not expected to form SCOVAS although
several did so. The project provided each SCOVA with at least an accountant and statistical clerk. A total
of 118 consultants were hired by various states to strengthen the SCOVAS. State level (and district level in
some instances) SCOVAs have reduced the hitherto intractable problem of funds flow and the mechanism
has been adopted by other agencies and projects. This has created a multiplicity of project specific
SCOVAs which has become a burden to the sparse resources without effectively strengthening the regular
financial systems. On aggregate, this activity is rated satisfactory.

C/ Financial monitoring: Timely submission of withdrawal requests and audit certificates was a problem
throughout the duration of the project. The project design had not provided for a financial management
plan nor was any agreement was ever sought on financial management. Funds continued to be released for
different schemes by different MOHFW sections at different times. Similarly, expenditure by schemes was
monitored by different sections and there was no one focal point for financial management in the MOHFW.
At the recommendation of the MTR, significant improvement took place including computerization at the
center and recruitment of consultants at state level. This however did not alleviate the problems in the
Districts where the bulk of the implementation and expenditure was taking place. Thus, financial reports
and audits were often late (except in the last year) and, every year, disbursements to many states were
suspended. In all, efforts to build state or lower level capacity in this area were inadequate. The rating for
financial management is unsatisfactory.

D/ Research for RCH management - operational and evaluative research to inform and disseminate
progress. The project intended to fund a broad array of research (on technical issues as well as on studies
evaluating the implementation of the RCH project), disseminate the research results through workshops and
publications, and utilize the research finding to strengthen program management. The MOHFW
established two expert committees on reproductive health and contraceptives research and 22 clinical and
operational research studies were supported by the project. Nine of these were clinical and seven project
implementation studies were conducted which facilitated the dissemination of project lessons across States
as well as the assess the contribution of project to service improvement. The full list of research studies
conducted is in Annex 9. The research activities are rated marginally satisfactory and overall, this
sub-component is rated satisfactory.

Sub-co iii/ Enhancing program management capacity - for planning, implementation, supervision and
monitoring
There is considerable overlap between this sub-component and all the others. Indeed, successful
implementation of the other sub-components would enhance capacity for planning, implementation,
supervision and monitoring. As stated above the process of decentralization of planning through
implementation of CNA enabled some districts to prepare their own implementation plans based on local
needs. It also enhanced the M&E systems. GOI reports estimate that district planning and M&E has
improved to some extent in 60% of the districts, thus meeting the set target. Management capacity at both
district and state level was also strengthened by the presence of over 2000 staff who attended various
management courses. In addition to the training, retired experienced civil servants with strong managerial


                                                      - 7 -

skills were recruited on contract to support specific areas such as accounting and data collection. The
impact of this sub-component was, reduced due to high turnover of regular staff and low remuneration of
consultants. These were factors beyond the project and the sub-component is therefore rated satisfactory.

CO2: Nationwide Improved Quality, Coverage and Effectiveness, and Expanded Content of the
Essential Package of RCH Services
Data from the two rounds of Household Surveys (HS1, 1998/9 and HS2, 2002/3) were used to assess
project performance in this component although matched data was available for only 274 districts at the
time of the ICR. In safe motherhood, there was an upward trend in full antenatal care (defined as 3 ANC
visits, at least one TT immunization and IFA tablets) and assisted deliveries in 239 and 238 districts
respectively. But, institutional deliveries in public facilities increased in only 121 districts, compared to the
much higher increase in private sector deliveries in 242 out of the 274 matched districts. Post-natal visits
by ANMs declined in the majority of districts. For child survival, awareness of danger signs and
management of both diarrhea and ARI by health professionals declined in 161 and 162 districts
respectively. Child immunization declined in 197 districts and marginally rose in only 77 districts. The
project's contribution to the polio eradication campaign with subsequent reduction of polio cases needs to
be noted. However, routine polio, DPT and measles declined in 191, 199 and 153 districts respectively
despite this support and the subsequent approval of a free standing project to strengthen immunization.
Somewhat paradoxically, the SRS estimates show a 11% decrease in infant mortality during the period of
the project, despite the bad output indicators.

The project also provided training in STI management and provided STI treatment kits. Training on
newborn care and equipment was provided in 80 districts, working together with local professional groups.
This component is considered central to the success of the whole project and therefore it has been given
additional weight. It's overall rating is unsatisfactorily.

Sub-co iv/ Upgrading service delivery - to improve quality and scope of care and referrals between
communities and facilities. Equipment and drugs were included in this component.
The performance of this sub-component is unsatisfactory. The sub-component aimed to upgrade quality
and widen the scope of RCH services through improved clinical care and communication and establishment
of effective referral systems. This sub-component also procured drugs and equipment, renovated facilities,
initiated emergency transport, hired selected contractual personnel to ensure 24 hour deliveries and
availability of anesthetists, and defined schemes to encourage retention of skilled staff in remote areas. The
project procured and delivered drugs and equipment to facilitate service delivery. Service expansion was
done by way of three RCH schemes ­ i/ RCH camps, ii/ Outreach sessions, and iii/ Training of Traditional
Birth Attendants (TBAs). Overall performance varied according to management and implementation
capacity and availability of staff at state and local level.

l RCH camps and outreach sessions increased geographic access to both family planning services and
     safe motherhood activities, and may account for the modest increase in CPR. Expansion of the RH
     package was done by adding treatment of STIs, and introducing programs for adolescents. Efforts were
     made to expand contraceptive choice but were limited. Long term progestogens (Depo-provera and
     Norplant) are not a part of the national program and are thus not provided through public facilities.
     There is also widespread use and support, at clinical level, of tubectomy and 'sterilization camps',
     despite the change in policy.
l The TBA programhas not had any discernible impact. Utilization of trained TBAs increased in half
     the districts while declining in the other half. Part of the problem was the quality of training and the
     debate over the value of TBAs that emerged during project implementation. Because the debate was
     never concluded the program continued to support the activity but with different levels of commitment


                                                       - 8 -

    by states.
l Contractual staff:        Over 2000 Staff Nurses and 6000 Auxilliary Nurse Midwives have been recruited
    on contract to improve the delivery of RCH services. Out of these, 250 staff nurses were recruited in
    the financial envelope state of Tamil Nadu. The introduction of Financial envelopes gave flexibility to
    better performing states to undertake intensive RCH activities. This worked very well as shown by
    increased activities and service utilization in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, use of
    contractual staff has been so successful in increasing institutional deliveries that the state is considering
    further measures. The performance of "medium performing states" was, however, less impressive,
    mainly due to shortage of skilled personnel for hire. The remuneration for safe motherhood consultants
    was also too low to attract suitable candidates for the contractual positions in the latter states. The
    project however, introduced the concept of performance based financing to the better performing states
    through this scheme. Overall, improvement in quality of services has been less obvious outside well
    performing states such as Tamil Nadu, where standards of care were already reasonable. This could
    be a reason behind the declining utilization of public facilities for delivery and increased use of the
    private sector. The quality of referrals , especially emergencies, had not improved much either.
    Although the project piloted emergency transport through the sub-projects (GOI report confirmed that
    20,384 women had received assistance with transport) the decline in utilization of the public sector for
    deliveries, and the decrease in immunization are indicators of poor quality in the public sector.
    Outreach services and quality of care are important determinants of utilization of services. Despite the
    attempt to provide both in the project, the performance and outcome are rated unsatisfactory.
l Partnership with NGOs: The RCH project facilitated establishing and strengthening the
    public/private/NGO partnerships to address some key sensitive RCH issues, community mobilization
    and to reach the undeserved areas and groups. The NGO partnership scheme focused on promoting
    private sector participation through increased demand for services at community level through
    advocacy and counseling, and using innovative approaches for service delivery in difficult to reach
    areas. Initially, the activities were centralized led, and were slow to pick up. In 2001 however, the
    MOHFW, constituted a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to strengthen the scheme. This led to
    revision of guidelines, including decentralization, simplification of disbursements, rationalization of
    jurisdiction and interface with local government authorities. The project funded 105 Mother NGOs
    (MNGOs) which in turn supported over 800 Field NGOs (FNGOs) in 439 districts. The project also
    supported an independent assessment of this component which concluded that 'the NGO schemes had
    done commendable work on mobilization and had helped focus on issues such as gender, adolescents
    and sexuality education'. The report further pointed out that 'more could have been done on male
    participation; the selection process of both MNGOs and FNGOs were generally good but suffered
    from inconsistencies; some MNGOs were allotted more FNGOs across districts, than they could
    carry, thus forsaking quality of supervision; baselines were not insisted on from the onset, making
    subsequent follow up difficult; delays in release of funds and accounting was a problem; high staff
    turnover among NGOs made continuity difficult; the designated project implementation periods
    were rather short. There was in addition, an attempt to build MNGOs as Collaborating Training
    Institutes (CTIs), but most of them lacked the requisite management systems and skills base needed
    to accomplish this'. The study recommended expansion of the MNGO program to include service
    delivery and the development of Regional Resource Centers as focal points for capacity building.
    Although the NGO scheme encountered several implementation problems, its overall contribution to
    advocacy, community mobilization, innovative approaches such as adolescent health programs merit
    the rating as satisfactory.

Sub-co v/ Training - to upgrade technical and management competence and skills at all level
This component financed training for FW personnel in all districts and levels, from community level
activists to district level managers. Training systems established under earlier Population Projects were


                                                       - 9 -

also supported and expanded. A 60% target was set for staff with proficiency certificates by category and
skill type. Eligible items under district training plans for funding included refurbishment of clinical training
sites, training materials and allowances for both trainees and trainers. Training was provided by the central
nodal institution (the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW) and eighteen collaborating
centers at the state level. Additional institutions were identified to provide specialized skills training in
management and communication. The core courses given were in a/ RCH Awareness Generation Training
(AGT) for increasing awareness and community mobilization, targeting health personnel, teachers and local
leaders; and, b/ Skills up-grading training of two types ­ Integrated Skills Training (IST) for Auxiliary
Nurse Midwives (ANM), Lady Health Visitors (LHV), Medical Officers (MO), Staff Nurses and Health
Assistants (HA) at district and Primary Health Centers (PHC); and Specialized Skills Training (SST) in
specialized areas such as management, communication/behavior change and specialized clinical skills
(Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP), IUD insertion, surgical contraception etc). The NIHFW
played dual technical and financial/administrative roles. It developed training curricula and materials and
networked with the CTIs+. It also handled funds and audited accounts for all training activities.

At MTR, training activities were unsatisfactory and a number of amendments were recommended,
including the discontinuation of AGT and the scaling back of some activities to reflect state capacity. The
MTR are also addressed over-centralization of training and long approval procedures. Despite delays in the
first half of the project, training guidelines and comprehensive manuals were developed. Planned trainings
were completed for over 600,000 trainees; 55% of the target IST+ trainings were completed; 18% of the
target SST trainings were completed as of January 2004.

Most training institutions did not follow-up their students, but a rapid assessment of IST and SST
conducted in late 2003 found mixed performance by states and Union Territories, with regard to
completion of all planned training. 14 states were designated good performers ( >70% training completed),
13 states were medium performers (40-70%) and 8 states were poor performers (with less than 40% of the
planned training completed). The majority of poor performing states were also the ones with the greatest
need. The rapid assessment also found that competences gained in maternal and child health and family
planning were satisfactory in all workers. 80% of personnel (LHV, HA, HW+, SN, MO) had satisfactory
performance in immunization, FP, post-natal care. ANMs were the only category with less than 50%
satisfactory performance in antenatal care and delivery, an important finding given their role and numbers
as first line care providers. The study reported that the course curriculum was considered as very helpful
and useful by 60% and useful to some extent by 40% of trainees. It recommended more practical
experience in future courses. These findings were in keeping with the views expressed by both trainers and
trainees during the ICR mission who, in addition, mentioned over- centralization and poor/irrelevant and
rigid curricula as some of the major problems. Despite these shortcomings, the training activities were
quantitatively significant and the sub-component is rated satisfactory.

Sub-co vi/ IEC - to change health seeking behavior and increase community participation.
The project design recognized the importance of IEC and planned the focus at three levels: At the National
level (strengthening quality of mass media approaches), State and District level (develop state strategy and
district IEC plans based on local needs) and at the frontline (better interpersonal and counseling skills). A
national IEC strategy was developed and adopted in October 2000, albeit with a less consultative process
and with less state participation than envisaged. The strategy is generally sound but has not been applied.
On specifics, interactive TV discussion programs and limited spot advertisements were initiated. Private
agencies ware involved in production of mass media materials, such as films and radio serials. The quality
of most of these was poor ­ and the good quality films produced lacked a good distribution plan. State and
district activities were even less successful. A major initiative to involve Zila Sakshastra Samities (ZSS) or
District Literacy Committees, to mobilize community participation and support for RCH using local media,

failed because of lack of ownership by District Health Officers and Family Welfare Departments. The
scheme was stopped at MTR in 2000 and the funds reallocated. Capacity building for IEC personnel also
performed poorly. Finalization of the curricula and identification of appropriate training institutions took a
long time and was only completed by the end of 2000. The first training for District IEC Officers began
after that and by end of 2003, only half had been trained. It is should be noted that failure of the IEC
sub-component was most severely in the low-performing states where the need was greatest. This
sub-component is rated unsatisfactory.

CO3: Local Capacity Enhancement/Improved Access in selected disadvantaged districts and cities
Sub-co vii/ District and city sub-project - to improve infrastructure and service delivery to the most
disadvantaged districts and urban slums and encourage innovation.
District and city sub-projects had great potential for improving access. Their performance was, however
mixed, depending largely on state capacity. A total of 24 subprojects (17 districts/7 cities in 17 states),
selected on a previously agreed criteria (such as lower RCH indicators than the state average, poor access
to services and staffing of health facilities below the GOI norms) were implemented. A detailed proposal
and implementation was prepared for each subproject and the following intervention were undertaken;
l Infrastructure improvement and equipment ­ Of the 1243 new sub centers, PHCs, community health
    centers and staff quarters that were to be completed, 927 (75%) of the target has been achieved.
    Mehboobnagar (AP), Vadodra and Sangrur (Punjab) accounted for a large portion of the construction
    (284 out of 316) that were not completed due to the large volume of new construction in the
    sub-projects. Another 2216 (over 90% of target) of buildings were renovated, including the addition of
    delivery rooms and operation theatres. Essential drugs and RCH equipment were supplied and
    innovative ambulance pilots tried in some districts, often in conjunction with private sources.
l Training and deployment ­ Training was undertaken under the nationwide project described above. In
    addition, special needs based training was provided to staff in areas such as MTP and for community
    workers to enhance participation in RCH. Vacant staff positions were also filled with contract
    workers, especially ANMs and SNs, to provide 24 hour obstetric coverage. Anesthetists were also
    hired as consultants to provide services to the newly renovated operation facilities.
l IEC for demand generation ­ Special efforts were made to create awareness and increase utilization
    through women's groups, religious groups and using films and other mass media.

Considerable delays and other problems were identified at MTR which recommended scaling back of
activities in districts where progress was modest. This led to performance based financing and reduced
allocation to sub-projects that were too slow. The decision to reduce expenditure in slow sub-projects (most
of which were in low performing states), while understandable, denied areas which had the greatest need
and punished the most disadvantaged populations.

At the time of the ICR, data from the two rounds of the Household Survey (HS1, 1998-99 and HS2,
2002-03) was available for 9 of the 24 subprojects and was used to assess the performance. Four key
indicators were chosen - deliveries assisted by a health professional; use of modern FP methods; child
immunization; and rural household reporting health worker's visit. As seen in Table 3, assisted deliveries
increased in 7 of the 9 sub-projects, but the separation between private and public facilities was not
possible. Performance was rather mixed but generally poor with regard to modern family planning while
child immunization decreased in 8 of the 9 sub-projects. Households visited by a health worker also
decreased in 5 of the 9 sub-projects. Only 1 sub-project (Churchandpur in Manipur), recorded
improvement in all the 4 indicators. If the 9 subprojects are representative, then it is unlikely that the
targets for improvement set against state levels have been realized.

Thus, despite the effort that went into the subprojects, output data available at the time of the ICR is not
positive. There are several explanations for this. One is that these are difficult districts from which not
much should be expected. Second, the interventions were completed late in the life of the project and their
impact will therefore be seen later. Or, three, as reported by Gupta and Talwar, the sub-projects lacked the
requisite implementation capacity (indicated by the fact that less than 60% of funds had been spent by
December 2003). Based on available data, the component is rated unsatisfactory.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
N/A

4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional development impact is rated as marginal.
The nationwide project was centrally driven and did not build any significant sustainable managerial
capacity at both state and district levels. The frequent use of consultants was a short term solution to a
protracted human resource management problem which the project could not address. Failure of
sustainable institutional capacity building is notable for procurement, where neither central nor state
structures are stronger. Logistics have not improved. Financial flow and management improved due to the



                                                                - 13 -

establishment of SCOVAs and contracting of private audit agencies. But this is also a short term solution
which, while beneficial to the project, will not serve the long term instutional needs of India. The GOI has
now recognized the need for sustability, and according to the National Rural Health Mission launched in
April 2005, the existing district and state health and family welfare societies would be integrated under one
umbrella.

Planning, especially in a few Districts, has improved or is moving in the right direction. But it is not
through the bottom-up steps that had been envisaged, starting with CNA. Institutionalization of CNA is
unlikely in its present form and will need further review. More generally, much more work is needed to
build on what has been started if effective decentralized planning is to be institutionalized.

Supervision of states by the center, and district activities by states, had mixed performance. The impact of
central supervision was negligible and may not have been necessary for well performing states. It is the
EAG+ states where effective supervision is required, but the center provided limited interventions. This
was evident in the case of Bihar where despite poor state performance, the center did not intervene. Poor
performance of states and districts was the underlying reason for most of the amendments and reallocation
of finances during the project cycle, itself an admission of failure to build institutional capacities in those
most deserving states. Management training for CMOs was highly appreciated, but its impact was
diminished by frequent transfers and resignations from the public sector.

On the technical side institutional development impact appears more promising. The expanded HIS is
secure but data collection and feedback will require more attention. Although the National IEC strategy
was developed, the roll-out was not a success. The need for a new approach to build on the strategy cannot
be overstated. There was an extensive effort to improve clinical skills. Although evidence of improved
performance is limited, the training should impact on patient care and expanded access. This will happen
irrespective of whether or not the staff join the private sector. The use of clinical consultants and contract
nurses can work if sustained funding is provided. The impact of subprojects in the districts where the
schemes worked well is clear. But they need continued support to ensure that the changes introduced by the
project are institutionalized.

Community participation was not highly visible except for a few districts in well performing states. NGO
and private sector participation lacked the visibility envisaged. This raises the need for explicit policies and
structures to be put in place to facilitate institutionalization of public private partnership in India.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were three factors that affected the project outcome that were beyond the control of the government:

(a) Throughout the implementation period, and with increasing stridency, there was opposition of a
significant number of indigenous NGOs to the government's provision of hormonal contraceptives (such
methods are readily available in the private sector). This is a problem unique to India. The range of
contraceptives that the project could finance and that the program could offer was therefore significantly
reduced, partly undermining one of the key development objectives. However, the government was able to
maintain a dialogue with these very vocal and influential women's groups, with the result that the NGO
position has softened a little and there is now agreement to initiate a pilot on injectables.

(b) The 2001 Gujarat earthquake indirectly affected the project by the reallocation of some $30 million to
natural disasters. This is relatively modest, being about 12% of the original credit. This amount was



                                                       - 14 -

replaced through the 2003 supplemental credit; and

(c) Supervision - the uneven performance of the World Bank especially on supervision before and after
MTR (see discussion in section 7 below).

The effect of these three factors on project outcomes was substantial.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

(a) The key policy aspect of the project that was within central government control ­ and the
implementation of which was important in affecting the final outcome of the project ­ was the decision to
widen the scope of the family welfare program away from female sterilization and to eliminate the
associated program targets. While this policy was formulated by 2000, its follow up by the central
government and its implementation by the state and union territory governments during project
implementation was disappointing. Even today, broadly speaking, female sterilization remains a strong
program focus, de facto if not de jure.

(b) This links to the second major factor ­ the central government's reluctance, particularly in the early
years of project implementation, to delegate power and responsibility for project activities to the state
governments. In the early years, detailed standardized plans were the norm. Decentralization was an
important plank in the project, but it was really not until after the MTR that serious delegation steps were
taken e.g. the granting of relative freedom to the more advanced states to decide on the detail of their
project activities within an agreed financial envelope. Similarly, while the central government eased up in
later years, the weak IEC component and the deficiencies in much of the training program can be traced to
limited decentralization by the center despite the states having the prime responsibility for implementation.
Throughout, the state governments had difficulties in using resources - recognizing that by far the largest
allocations in the program were already committed to staff salaries and allowances.

(c) The lack of decentralization was largely responsible for the limited state ownership of project activities,
and hence the lukewarm commitment to the project and objectives. In fact, given these constraints, it is
somewhat surprising that the project performed as well as it did at the state level ­ and that the state
governments were able to, by and large, marshal the necessary state-level support.

(d) The consequent implementation delays totaling 18 months were the result of these and other factors ­
see discussion below in section 7 on government implementation performance.

(e) Lack of differentiated support for the better and poorer performing states was a major deficiency.
This, coupled with little state-specific implementation support and advice, especially in the early project
years, did little to ameliorate the weaker performance of the disadvantaged states ­ which were typically the
states with the greatest needs and the least ability to address these needs.

(f) Intensive polio operations and other health campaigns affected program performance. Because of
continuing high level of wild virus, northern states in particular, had to take up as many as 8 rounds of
polio, each needing huge mobilization of resources and health personnel and extending into weeks. All this
diverted management attention, personnel and resources especially from child health services. Furthermore,
the budget crunch in the states reduced funding for the health infrastructure; and positions were not filled;
funding for operational expenses of facilities was reduced, and infrastructure deteriorated for want of
maintenance. All of this affected the performance of the RCH program and the project.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Management capacity of the state implementing agencies, the DHFWs, was generally strengthened through
the project, although it remains highly variable across states. The effectiveness of project management
varied widely depending on the specific institutional arrangements, staff continuity and experience, and
degree of delegated authority. But limited state, project and district management capacity clearly limited
project performance at the field level. Within this, procurement capacity development at the state level
failed (with the exception of Tamil Nadu) and financial management capacity effectiveness was highly
variable. Both of these fiduciary constraints reduced effective implementation at the state level. On
monitoring and evaluation, much data were collected but its use in day-to-day management or in guiding
project implementation strategy was limited. Multiple progress reports were produced but again the use of
these reports in guiding project implementation was also limited. State staffing of incremental posts was
broadly satisfactory in accessible areas, although shortages of some key specialist groups (e.g. anesthetists)
constrained operations significantly; filling positions in remote rural areas was a continuing headache. The
use of technical assistance at the state level again varied widely, from zero to considerable. Most of the
DHFWs did not have experience of working with (Indian long term) consultants and so there was mixed
appreciation and effectiveness of project funded technical assistance. (Further discussion of the
implementation performance of the executing agencies is in section 7 below).

5.4 Costs and financing:
The original cost of the project was estimated at $308.8 million, including an IDA contribution of $248.2
million equivalent; the project was planned to be implemented over five years. The financial history of the
project is somewhat complex ­ and complicated further by substantial rupee/US $/SDR exchange rate
fluctuations. In essence, the 2000 mid-term review kept the overall amount of IDA funds unchanged, but in
the process of simplifying the project there was some re-allocation of funds between categories ­
particularly towards drugs and away from civil works, training and incremental operating costs. The
increase in the drug category (from $34 million to $83 million) included a special allocation of $25 million
for polio vaccine that had been made in 2001. In addition, $30 million from the project was reallocated to
the Gujarat earthquake relief emergency project. An undisbursed amount of approximately US$11.4
million from the Gujarat earthquake allocation was later moved back to the original categories under the
RCH project. In 2002, supplemental financing of SDR 10 million (US$14.9 million equivalent) was
approved by the Bank's Board. The total IDA allocation available for RCH under the project after
excluding US$17.6 million contributed to the Gujarat Earthquake disaster was US$239.1 million
(US$224.24 million from Credit N0180 and US$14.85 million from Supplemental Credit No. 0181). The
project was extended twice for a total of 18 months and closed on September 30, 2004. At completion, the
project cost was US$268.15 million, out of which IDA was US$237.7 million.

The final expenditure pattern by type of input is remarkably close to that projected at the MTR after the
reallocation. Although three categories (goods, consultancies, and incremental operating costs) show
variations, for a project of this size and mixed implementation record, these differences are not significant.
Not surprisingly, the differences between the planned and/or the expenditure by project component and by
state and territory are much more marked.

The 18 month extension for project implementation and disbursements arose from a combination of:
l a slow start-up due to limited state project ownership, which carried through until the MTR, and which
    was too great a lag to be caught up subsequently;
l an overly complex project design, that was somewhat simplified at the MTR and;
l continuing project management and financial problems especially with the weaker performing states.


Disbursements lagged through most of the project period with the major additional unplanned expenditures



                                                      - 16 -

on polio activities (US$50 million) and earthquake relief (some $18 million) helping disbursements
significantly. In retrospect, the need for the relatively modest $12 million 2002 supplementary financing is
not obvious although it certainly helped in bridging the gap between the closed RCH1 project and the
planned RCH2 project.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Overall sustainability is rated as likely more so because interventions are largely financed by GOI.
Additional resources and technical assistance will however be needed. The rating takes into account
multiple aspects of the project - financial, institutional and technical. The ratings are complicated due to
the different levels of resources, governance and performance between the center and the states and among
states. There are also activities that were routine and on going, to which the project's contribution was
minimal. Such activities would more likely be sustained than new ones. Other factors affecting
sustainability are political commitment and human resources for both managerial, support and clinical
services. Despite the large number of staff trained under this project, current distribution of human
resources makes sustainability more feasible in urban than rural areas. Taking the aforesaid into account,
activities undertaken by this project are highly likely to be sustained in well performing states (eg. Tamil
Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat etc), likely in medium performers (e.g West Bengal) and unlikely in poor
performing states (e.g. Bihar, Jharkand etc). The use of consultants and contract staff requires special
mention because it is questionable whether any state can sustain this activity. For example in Tamil Nadu,
salaries for the staff of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), nurse-midwives and anesthetists on contract
or consultancy has been an issue in the interval between RCH1 and 2. Sustainability of SCOVAs, that were
set up as a temporary response to weak state systems of accountability, will depend on an agreed long term
policy of GOI.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The project was largely implemented by regular staff of the MOHFW, except for Tamil Nadu where a
separate PIU was established. All states engaged the services of several consultants and contract clinical
staff to support management and service delivery. Although the numbers of management consultants and
clinicians engaged was relatively small, no state has made any arrangements to regularize them. This
included well performing states like Tamil Nadu. It should be noted that the low remuneration by the
public sector, and reluctance of skilled workers to go to rural areas, is the real dilemma facing India. While
the issues are beyond the scope of this project, sustainability will be difficult without addressing them.
Another systemic problem is procurement. The two firms recruited to strengthen procurement operations
have not built additional capacity centrally and have done little at the state level. The end of their contract
would risk returning procurement back to where it was prior to the project.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance during project preparation is judged to have been marginally satisfactory. The
project addressed key public health areas ­ essentially in maternal and child health (MCH) ­ that were high
priority for both the national government and the Bank. In India, any national project will be complex due
to the difficulties of implementation in 28 states and 7 Union Territories. A project that was more focused
on those states with weaker capacity and where the MCH needs were proportionately greater, would
potentially have been more effective. The technical aspects of project preparation were well handled by
seasoned staff and much technical assistance was provided to the central and state governments during
preparation. Appraisal, risk analysis, the lending instrument, safeguards and the indicators were all



                                                       - 17 -

satisfactory. The project design was based on well reviewed pieces of ESW (see Annex). Deficiencies
other than that, related to the national scope, include:
(a) The design of the main components in such a way that there was some overlap and lack of clarity about
which activity should be included where. As a consequence, the definitions of the project components are
difficult to understand and confusing for implementers;
(b) Limited state and territory level ownership due to a highly standardized design (`one size fits all states')
that was delivered to the states by the central government with only limited consultation;
c) Little consultation with the then few development partners interested in RCH;
d) Given that this was the one of the first IDA funded national health projects, the fiduciary aspects were
acknowledged as being likely to create difficulties ­ although it is not entirely clear if they were
comprehensively addressed.

USD 667,800 was spent preparing the project.

7.2 Supervision:
Supervision missions visited India twice yearly, with frequent follow-up especially by those task team
members based in Delhi. Any supervision mission faced with such a large national project has severe limits
on what it can achieve. There was good staff continuity during the implementation period although
throughout the entire project the task team leader was based in Washington DC; around the MTR time a
Delhi-based co-task team leader was added, supported by three technical consultants. The wisdom of
retaining the TTL in Washington DC for such a complex project with multiple executing agencies/states is
questionable, as has been raised in the GOI report. Supervision was detailed but because of the project's
complexity, there was a focus on day-to-day problem solving, with a relative underemphasis on policy and
program issues. The number of development partners interested in RCH increased over the years, but the
project's involvement with them was largely confined to information sharing rather than developing a truly
coordinated and integrated program. The 2000 mid-term review (MTR) effectively sought to address many
of the problems identified at that time, including some of the design issues. While it tried to resolve the
problems of poor implementation by the weaker states by limiting the range of interventions that
they were authorized to implement ­ it did not strengthen support to these states. One strong
supervision point was the handling of the stream of changes in the project's financing. The restructuring
during the MTR, the reallocation of funds for the 2001 earthquake relief and the subsequent supplementary
financing were all handled well.

The supervision teams planned to visit low performing states twice yearly and better performing states
annually. This proved to be impractical and visits were supplemented by state meetings in Delhi. There was
no strategic or systematic pattern to the state visits during project implementation. There are wide
variations with some states visited as many as six times, and other large and/or difficult states not visited at
all during the seven years of implementation. Further, there are a large number of IDA funded health sector
projects in India ­ and the degree of coordination between the task teams was limited. While both financial
management and procurement issues figured prominently during supervision, at one point to the extent of
causing implementation to be rated unsatisfactorily in the PSR and at other times causing disbursements to
be suspended for selected states, the supervision of the fiduciary aspects was satisfactory. The PSRs did
not always fully describe the difficulties encountered. USD 971,000 was spent on project supervision over
the implementation period. Overall supervision of the project was marginally unsatisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Band performance is rated as unsatisfactory, albeit with some significant plus points as
discussed above.




                                                       - 18 -

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during preparation was satisfactory. The project was designed to address
inter alia key sensitive policy issues, particularly relating to the widening of family planning method choice,
and to introducing an effective maternal and child health program. It is notable that the government was
prepared to allow an external donor to become involved in this debate. The government requested support
for their national program with resulting issues in project design. Central government control over the
details of project design and the detailed inputs to individual states was substantial and highly
standardized. The inevitable result was limited project ownership by the states. Nonetheless, the
government completed a large amount of preparation work at both central and state levels, including
complying with their own substantial preparation requirements as well as those of the Bank, broadly on
schedule.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
The implementation performance of the central and state governments is mixed. The federal government
consistently maintained its commitment to the project ­ and sought to chase progress with the states and
territories. However, it was reluctant to engage in a serious dialogue with the Bank on RCH policy issues,
especially around the key issues of the program's over-emphasis on female sterilization and the program's
difficulties with NGOs over introducing injectable hormonal contraception. At the state level, government
implementation in the better and middle ranked states was broadly acceptable across the major project
activities but there were significant delays in some key components e.g. IEC. In the poorer performing
states, overall performance ranged from satisfactory to highly unsatisfactory (i.e. virtually nonexistent).
Across the states and territories, the degree of support from state Finance/ Planning/ Human Resources etc
departments also varied widely, while the availability of funds to the implementing agencies and the level
of interference in operational decisions followed a similar pattern to that of the states' capacities. The
simplification of the project design at the MTR, by allocating states to one of three categories with
consequential much greater delegated authority to the best performing states, and much reduced
implementation options for the weaker states, was pivotal. Project implementation from inception to 2000
lagged badly, but picked up significantly after the MTR. Nonetheless, ultimately, an 18 month extension
was required to complete disbursement of the available IDA funds, with implementation of project
activities being incomplete on several aspects. On balance, the governments' implementation performance
is rated unsatisfactory.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The lead implementing agencies were the federal, state and territory Departments of Health and Family
Welfare (DOHFW) ­ in all, hundreds of institutions ­ which inevitably again had a wide range of
performance. The preferred mode of project implementation also varied ­ Tamil Nadu had traditional
project implementation units or similar, while others did not and relied on some strengthening of their
existing line implementation capacity. Adequacy, experience and continuity of project staffing varied
widely. As would be expected, implementation by those states with good staff in special implementation
units fared better than others ­ while the longer term capacity built in those using and strengthening
existing systems is likely to be greater. In the early project years, the central level provided almost no
direct support to the states other than issuing very detailed instructions. Following the MTR and the
appointment of an officer in the center to guide project progress, implementation support improved.
Nonetheless, the situation of very little constructive central support being available especially to the weaker
states remains a serious omission which was ultimately reflected in the continuing poor performance of
many of these states. Implementing agency performance on individual components of course varied widely.
But the general picture discussed above of limited success in widening family planning methods and with
uneven success in strengthening child health programs is a reflection of the limited effectiveness of state



                                                       - 19 -

level DOHFW implementation. The poorly implemented IEC program and the limited effectiveness of the
training program (despite its improvement after central controls were eased) are two important examples.
Attempts to establish procurement capacity in the states failed with one exception. On finance, problems of
funds flow were generally minimized by the establishment of the state (and district level) SCOVAs (see
above), whose performance was mostly satisfactory. Financial management was more problematic,
especially the difficulties encountered in obtaining timely regular financial statements and audits ­ and
reviewing them ­ from such a large number of executing agencies. Due to such problems, disbursements to
individual states were suspended several times. Obtaining project progress reports suffered similar
problems. Otherwise, there were no major problems with covenant compliance. The need to ensure that so
many regular reports were prepared was a continuing headache, but unavoidable given a national project.
Overall the implementing agency performance is rated unsatisfactory.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. Cumulative delays of about 18 months to
implementation, with some important project activities sparely implemented, and some states/territories
with very poor performance, are clearly major deficiencies. It is judged that the implementation
achievements, including the general improvements in service delivery and quality, do not outweigh these
deficiencies.

8. Lessons Learned

The project provides several important lessons:

1. To enhance the impact of RCH programs, there needs to be more focus on poor performing states.
This was one of the few nationwide health projects in India and therefore did not have the benefit of
extensive prior experience. Problems and risks met during implementation exceeded those anticipated at
design. The problems and risks were due to the enormous size and complexity of the country. India
bestrides several levels of socioeconomic development and the grouping of states by performance provides
only a partial glimpse of the realities. The Bank should focus attention increasingly on the poor performing
states.

2. The Bank needs to be more pro-active in addressing difficult policy and implementation issues.
There were, for example, several issues related to governance in India that affected performance - the clout
that the GOI is willing to wield over states; the lag time for decision making; and the effectiveness of
central supervision and accountability for performance, where the Bank should have adopted a more
vigorous programmatic approach. In addition, the Bank underestimated the challenges of implementing a
nationwide project dealing with sensitive issues on population and reproductive health. This contributed to
the delays in the first half of the project and was acknowledged during the MTR. Weakness in management
of the Family Welfare Department was known from the onset but little preparation was done up front to
improve its capacity to manage the project. The Bank may have overestimated the capacity of the sector,
or substantially underestimated the efforts needed to engage effectively nationwide, especially with the
EAG states to bring them to par. This is reflected in the overall project design and relative budget
allocation for supervision which was similar to less complex Bank investment operations.

3. State ownership and adequate management capacity are critical for successful implementation.
The RCH project was centrally designed and controlled. This perception remained throughout the life of
the project and was reinforced by the approach used in implementing the components. The MTR attempted
to correct this by restructuring financial, training and managerial responsibilities, but this was not enough.
The resulting limited state ownership and commitment for results affected project performance in key areas



                                                      - 20 -

such as training, capacity building, IEC, procurement and HMIS. In some instances, the states simply
ignored instructions from the center and continued with business as usual. One area in which state
response made a difference was with SCOVAs, which solved some of the funds flow problems but were
unable to fulfill the added roles such as autonomous planning, implementation and monitoring entities.
State performance varied with capacity and governance. But apart from the district subprojects, no special
efforts were made to build capacity in the EAG states. The lesson here is clear. State ownership, capacity
and governance are key to the success of any project in India, and especially in the EAG states.

4. Partnership with DPs, NGOs and the private sector are critical for the future success of the RCH
program. Better coordination with other health projects supported by the Bank at national and state
levels is also important
The value of partnership and coordination with other partners cannot be overstated, especially in a large
and complex country as India, where no single agency can do it all and attribution of success must be
shared. Some Development Partners felt that they were not sufficiently involved during the design of the
project and felt ignored during implementation, especially since some had long experience with RCH in
India. Partnership between RCH1 and USAID in Uttar Pradesh and with DFID in West Bengal worked
reasonably well. This was, however, not the case with the EU health systems project.

There was also lack of effective coordination among the 13 IDA financed projects in the health sector
which led to many missed opportunities. The state based Health Systems Development projects, and the
support to the centrally sponsored schemes such as the Integrated Child Development Program, Polio
Eradication Program and the National AIDS control program are some examples where closer coordination
could have yielded substantial returns.

In India, a large proportion of health services are provided by the private and NGO sector, and the
importance of engaging this sector is clear. The NGO scheme, despite many problems, provided important
lessons for India. It is important to establish a positive policy and regulatory environment in which further
advancements in public-private partnership can be anchored. This is, however, beyond the scope of the
project and needs to be addressed as a central policy issue.

5. Stronger emphasis is required on Information Education and Communication (IEC), targeting
both communities and providers
The weakness of the IEC component of RCH1 compromised the roll out of the target free approach and
expansion of contraceptive choice, both on the supply and demand side. The project design underestimated
the effort and transformation needed at all levels to effect a policy shift, and subsequent reallocation of
resources from IEC at MTR did not help. Future efforts should focus on behavior change, and on
improving service utilization. Community mobilization and participation needs to be well planned up front,
with adequate funding and measurable targets. The limitations of implementing an important policy change
through a sub-sector project also needs acknowledgement. It requires the engagement not only of the whole
sector, but also the active participation of key actors in sectors such as education, gender, rural
development and information, not to mention high level political support.

6. For successful project implementation, management capacities of the DOHFW should be
strengthened and the Bank should ensure the availability of more resources for effective supervision

The success of some of the district subprojects in EAG states is attributable to closer supervision and
technical support, a lesson that should be taken seriously. The leadership of a nationwide project of this
size needs to be engaged on a daily basis in India. Greater on the ground presence is therefore important to
nurture a close relationship with GOI counterparts, the states, NGOs and other development partners. This
is underlined in the GOI report and appears to have made a difference after the MTR when staff were
added in New Delhi and three Indian consultants recruited for operational and technical support. Strong



                                                      - 21 -

supportive engagement of Bank management in a project of the size and complexity of RCH1 is essential.

7. Building sustainable institutions is essential for successful programs

The weakness of RCH1 on institutional capacity building and impact can be attributed to two things -over
reliance on traditional institution based skills training, and use of consultants to by pass the weak public
sector systems. This arrangement satisfies immediate needs and is attractive for Bank projects when the
focus is on quick results. It, however, merely postpones the problems, may be harmful to institutions, and
counterproductive in the long run. As pointed out in the GOI report, 'systems need to be put in place to
provide a long-term view of skills development and ensure appropriate nominations to different training
programs'.

8. Harmonization of technical interventions and mainstreaming gender are important to improve
outcomes

Although the project aimed to provide a comprehensive RCH package, this was planned in an incremental
manner. While the reasons for this are understandable, the sequence of additionality was not well thought
out. Immunization and nutrition need to come together but were not given adequate attention during
implementation, partly because there were other projects supposedly focusing on these areas. It is clear
that child survival interventions are unlikely to succeed without due attention to these two issues. In
addition to this, the project was rather slow in adapting new technical approaches which became available
after its inception. More attention should have gone into newborn health, focused antenatal care,
management of the post partum period and expanding options for legal termination of pregnancy.. Although
one could argue that the women were the major beneficiaries of the project, gender was not adequately
addressed. Continued emphasis on female surgical contraception with limited alternatives methods is
evidence of this problem. Male participation was also generally weak. The GOI report emphasized the
missed opportunity to target men in RH awareness activities.

9. Human resource management requires priority attention.

This project clearly showed that India's skilled health resources in the public sector continue to be
underutilized and are inadequately serving the needs of the population. This is partly a problem of staffing
norms and appropriate mix of skills. The contractual arrangements made by the project with nurses and
doctors are a stop gap measure only and may not be effective in the long term. Obviously, these issues
cannot be handled through a project and require a systems approach. Solving this perennial problem may
accelerate the pace at which India can achieve the MDGs. This is an area in which the Bank has
considerable institutional advantage and should be considered a priority for future IDA interventions in the
HNP sector in India.

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

Summary of GOI Report
on Reproductive and Child Health Project I
(See full report in Annex 10)

I. Introduction
Reproductive and Child Health Program was the flagship program of Government of India encapsulating
the new approach to population and development agreed during Cairo ICPD in 1994. The new approach
was marked by shifting focus from achieving population goals to meeting reproductive health needs of
actual and potential clients, broadening the basket of reproductive services to include maternal and child
health care, RTI/STI services, MTP etc., consideration of reproductive and sexual health needs during the
entire life-cycle, focus upon the underserved groups such as male, adolescents, vulnerable groups such as
tribals, urban slum dwellers, active involvement of communities, social groups & active consideration of
gender and other issues that hinder full enjoyment of sexuality and reproduction. In short, the approach
placed the reproductive & sexual needs of individuals (and couples) at the center of the entire scheme of
things.

The funding was envisaged to come in two phases. The first phase of Bank's assistance lasting for 5 years
was to commence immediately in 1997 with an investment of about US $ 308.8 m, while the 2nd phase was
to commence mid-way with almost equal investment. The focus of the assistance was on strengthening
institutional capacity to implement the policy changes envisaged under Paradigm Shift and addressing
implementation weaknesses and on operationalizing the newer interventions such as referrals for essential
and emergency obstetric care, RTI/STI diagnosis and care. As it happened, the follow-on RCH project was
not taken up as envisaged, instead the assistance was availed for a project focusing upon the immunization
component of the RCH program. The project also supported polio activities during 1999. The assistance
was restructured during early 2001 with rationalization of schemes for increasing access to RCH services
esp. in EAG states, greater emphasis on NGO activities, new IEC activities in pursuance to IEC strategy,
decentralization of authority of approval of plans and toning down of training and LCE activities The
RCH I formally closed on 30 September 2004, 1.5 years later than scheduled. Project design chose
investment into public sector as the primary instrument for considerations of equity, geographical access
etc.

The project implementation was to be largely through District Family Welfare Bureaus or Zilla Parishads
(District Councils) under the supervision of State Health and Family Welfare Departments, while
coordination and oversight was to be provided by MoHFW. The capacities for management and oversight
were to be augmented by consultants at both state and central levels. Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee,
as well Project Management Committee was constituted centrally for inter-sectoral convergence and regular
monitoring respectively. Similar structures were created at the state level too. Major procurements, either
by center or the states, were to be made through selected and agreed PSAs. Consultant support for
technical assistance was encouraged. Monitoring and evaluation was to be done against agreed benchmarks
on the basis of (a) service delivery and utilization data from the Management Information System (MIS);
(b) financial and physical performance data from state project directors; (c) data from technical quality
assessments by service supervisors; and (d) rapid assessments of service coverage, quality and facilities by
independent agencies, and of technical quality of training and IEC by competent agencies.

II. Objectives
The Bank's assistance was broadly envisaged to assist the Government of India (GOI) to improve the
performance of its National Family Welfare Program (NFWP) in reducing maternal and infant mortality
and morbidity, and unwanted fertility, thereby eventually contributing to stabilization of population growth.

The specific objectives for the RCH I project were set as assisting the NFWP to:-
(a) improve management performance by nationwide implementation of policy change referred to as the
"participatory planning approach,"' and institutional strengthening for timely, coordinated utilization of
project resources;
(b) improve quality, coverage and effectiveness of existing FW services;
(c) progressively expand the scope and content of existing FW services to include more elements of a
defined package of essential reproductive and child health (RCH) services; and
(d) in selected disadvantaged districts and cities, increase access by strengthening FW infrastructure while
improving its quality.

III. Achievement of Project Objectives
Overall Achievement
RCH I was a complex project having interventions for the entire range of reproductive health services
besides bringing about changes in the way services are planned, delivered and monitored in the context of a
wide diversity of systemic capacity and complexity. This project provided an opportunity to individuals and
communities to participate and determine the type of services required as per their felt needs. The project
conferred direct social benefits by increasing access to quality, family planning and MCH services; thereby
it promoted a decline in fertility, morbidity and mortality among mothers, infants and children.       It also
provided for affordable and accessible health services through more and better trained health personnel,
improved supply of drugs and consumables, expanded range of services and better IEC and community
mobilization. The project also strengthened the institutional structures, improved technical capacity and
MIS systems. Although, achievements have not been uniformly good, they are for the most part positive.

One of the important objectives of the RCH project was to carry forward the reform agenda and policy
dialogue necessary for it. It has been one of the very productive areas. National Population Policy 2000
encapsulated RCH approach of free choice, sensitivity to clients' needs, gender sensitive improved quality
of care and affirmed state's commitment to provide assured, affordable, equitable, and comprehensive care
to all. RCH programme has provided umbrella framework to this policy. Evolution to sector wide approach
and reform has been necessitated by the large canvas of challenge of RCH
One of the key goals of the RCH I was to reduce the disparities in RCH between the regions,
socio-economic groups, etc. However, comparison of RHS data for EAG states for both the rounds of
surveys (Bihar, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal)
indicate no reduction in disparities in RCH status. Home visit by outreach workers have declined
everywhere but more sharply in rest of the country than the EAG states. The recent or proposed initiatives
such as EAG focus or NRHM, in whose evolution RCH dialogues/analyses have played a role have this
challenge cut out before them.

IV. Project Cost and Expenditure
As mentioned earlier, the original approved cost for the project was US $ 308.8M (credit US $ 248.2 M)
for the period August October 1997-March 2003. After the mid-term review in 2000, the project was
restructured with same level of credit. The Bank permitted procurement of vaccine and funds for social
mobilization for PPI in 1999-2000 from the project funds. The restructuring in 2000 also permitted
provided for new schemes such as RCH camps, TBA training, RCH Outreach scheme etc. A sum of US $

17.624 M for Gujarat earthquake was drawn as an emergency relief. Subsequently, a supplementary credit
of US $ 14.854 M was provided for the project. The project has used credit of US $ 247.64 M including
that diverted for Gujarat, and claim applications of Rs. 365.292 M are in pipeline, which would use up US
$ 8.347 M. Thus, only 0.610 M or 0 .23 % of available credit would be left.

V. Project Impact
RCH I Project is a complex project covering a wide gamut of reproductive and child health services whose
impact is influenced by a wide variety of operational, systemic, governance, socio-economic, cultural issues
both intrinsic and extrinsic to the sector. Impact in terms of outcomes like maternal mortality, fertility also
can't dramatically change over life of a medium-term project such as RCH I, therefore, the project has
rightly laid emphasis on process indicators for measuring the improvement attributable to it.

Although baseline for the project is available in terms of Rapid Household Surveys carried out during
1998-99 covering the entire country, similar endline surveys are available only for 294 districts carried out
during 2002-03. Although the two surveys are not true representative of baseline and endline, however,
their proximity to these time-points as well as the fact of slow start-up of the program enable us to use
them for measuring the achievement of the program. A comparison of key indicators based on results of
274 matched districts in the is shown in Annexure V. As endline survey was made two years prior to
actual completion of the project, therefore further improvement and correction of negative trends is not
ruled out.

Maternal Health: Full ANC defined as at least 3 ANC visits, receipt of IFA tablets and at least 1 TT
injection rose by 8.4 % to reach 40.3 %. Similar rises are noticed for any ANC visit or women with at
least 1 TT injection. Proportion of women delivering at home declined by 6.9 %, whereas that in
institutions rose by 6.6 % to reach 40 %. Surprisingly, delivery in government institutions declined by 5.5
% to 18.5 %. Most surprisingly, it is the women in the better placed states which have deserted the
government institutions the most ( decline in % delivering in government institutions for Andhra Pradesh,
Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are 9.8 %, 28.9 %, 10.2 %, 9.1 % and 15.3 %
respectively). It may be due to the fact that rising aspirations of service quality may not have been matched
by the public facilities. There has been a very modest increase in home deliveries being attended by trained
persons (1.3 %), whereas safe delivery i.e. assisted by health professional rose by 7.9 % to reach 47.5 %.
The proportion of women with 1 post-partum visit instead of improving declined marginally (1.4 %) to
12.7 %, again an effect of declining home visits.

Family Planning: Comparison of the two indicate contraceptive prevalence increasing by 3.3 % to 52.0
%, while that due to spacing method rose by 3.3% to 10.7 %, while that for permanent methods remained
more or less same. While the CPR rise is welcome, lack of rise in permanent method CPR and likely rise in
traditional methods CPR are causes of concern as is slowing down of improvement in CPR, which(as per
NFHS data) rose by 10 % points between 1992-93 to 1998-99. It may be largely due to the fact that
programmatic attention to family planning declined during the period both in terms of management
attention and inputs. It is significant that operational definition of RCH as CSSM + RTI/STI + adolescent
reproductive health left out family planning. Overall unmet need for contraception declined by 3.6 % to
15.9 %.

Child Health: The child health component aimed at bringing down sharply the infant mortality by
addressing neonatal care apart from consolidating the immunization and protection against diarrhea and
ARIs. Infant mortality came down from 71(SRS 1997) to 64(SRS 2002), but not to the extent expected.
The NNMR is also showing a declining trend, but its ratio to IMR stays put at ~ 65 %, reflecting probably
better coverage of programs, but not the extent of services or quality.


                                                     - 25 -

The immunization performance is a cause of worry. As per RHS data, full immunization coverage declined
52.0 in 1998-99 to 44.6 % in 2002-03. Disaggregated data show decline of 7.1 % in coverage with 3 doses
of DPT and 9.1 % in that of polio. This has to be viewed against the fact that alongside an initiative for
improvement of immunization program ran also including the supporting polio eradication activities (World
Bank Credit IN 3340), which aimed at increasing full immunization coverage by 5 %. Probably
deteriorating outreach is a cause as may be low profile of routine immunization. The proportion of women
visited by any health worker during 3 months prior to survey has declined by 9.6 % to 10.1 % during this
period.

Polio incidence has come down from come down from 1931 in 1998 to 133 in 2004. From being spread
allover India, it has been localized to some pockets in Bihar and UP, although eradication target slipped by.
A variety of factors including socio-cultural belief, health system weaknesses and overdose of polio IEC
may have been responsible for this.

The awareness of diarrhea management and ARI danger signs have also gone down slightly (2.3 % and 4.8
% respectively) reflecting lack of emphasis. Lack of due attention may again have been the cause.

Sub - Projects: The RHS surveys have showed that institutional and safe deliveries increased in large
majority of 9 projects for which matched data is available. However, full immunization coverage has
decline in 8 out of 9 sub-projects, in 5 sharply. The performance in FP and home visit was found to be
mixed. Because of likely data problems, evaluators have employed pooling of data and on that basis have
reported that 4 sub-projects reached state average, whereas remaining lagged in one area or another.
Sub-projects in Mehboobnagar and Murshidabad could not close the gap between them and the state
average in any area.

VI. Bank Performance
The project approach was consistent with World Bank's strategy and Government policy and was
appropriate for achieving the stated objectives. However, the project design had inbuilt problems especially
in terms of uniformity of package for the entire country, large number of schemes each addressing only a
small area of package and lack of delegation of authority to states. All these resulted in slowing
implementation. It is not surprising that MTR had to restructure the project on these lines too and a delay
of about 1& 1/2 year in the completion.

The supervision missions from June 1998 to June 2003 at least twice a year helped States/GOI in taking
remedial action, modifying their plans as and when required and realistic monitoring of the project
activities. However, a project of this magnitude required much more hands on technical assistance than
merely operational support and periodic monitoring specially in some of the poor performing states and on
addressing new technical/programme areas than was possible with the existing arrangement of project
management headquarterd at Washington DC and a partial presence in Delhi.

The Bank also showed sensitivity to the MoHFW's suggestions. Polio funding in 1999-2000, schemes of
TBA training, RCH Camps and RCH outreach as well as purchase of Kits A & B are some of the
example, where without compromising project objectives, credit was extended. Furthermore, MTR brought
further flexibility in respect of approval of plans viz. procurement plan of sub-projects or training plan
etc., thus simplifying implementation. However, procurement process was still a difficult and lengthy one.
The process of filing claim is also a complex one, in which there is a lot of scope for streamlining. The
Bank staff was supportive of innovative initiatives.




                                                    - 26 -

MoHFW had visualized RCH as a programme in which all the development partners were to contribute to
addressing common goals. This required coordination and convergence of DPs as much by the GOI as by
the Bank, as Bank was one of two principal financiers of the RCH Programme. The extent of engagement
of other partners into the Project and Bank's into that of others could have higher and led to more
synergistic realization of project objectives, as it is likely to happen in the second phase of RCH. Need was
also felt for higher coordination among Bank's projects in health and related sectors viz. nutrition,
HIV/AIDS even as good coordination was achieved in projects of the Department of Family Welfare.

Overall, MoHFW regards as Bank's contributions valuable.

VII. Sustainability
The effectiveness of a project depends largely on the institutional and financial sustainability of the project
activities after donor funding has ceased to be in place. The state and central governments that implement
the program have also faced continuing resource crunch. This crunch is most evident in maintenance of
facilities and availability of drugs and consumables besides establishment support. Community
mobilization for health through NGO and other sources would also contribute to sustenance of investments
in this program. It must be however said that polio operations have squeezed investments in other areas of
RCH.

Managerial sustainability is one issue which must continue to be addressed, even though program
management training as enumerated earlier as well as in Immunization Strengthening Project for
immunization management has led to strengthening of skills. Still, attrition factors coupled with the need
for more comprehensive approaches especially for addressing underserved areas/ groups require further
attention. Policy changes for effective deployment of programme managers are also required.

Overall, it is felt that the project made significant efforts to ensure sustainability, still at this stage
programme requires further inputs both in terms of resources and technical assistance to realize ambitious
goals set out in MDGs, National Population Policy 2000, National Health Policy 2002 and other related
policies and plans given the existing resource and capacity constraints as well as need to base them on best
available evidence.

VIII. Major Factors Affecting the Project.
The Project had a slow start up and low levels of implementation during the first three years. The factors
which affected the implemented adversely inter- alia included delay in recruitment of SCOVA personnel
and activation of its management structures, delay in release of funds to the implementing agencies, delay
in finding suitable sites for civil works, quick turnover of project managers, lack of familiarity with bank
procedures regarding procurement and evolving monitoring arrangements.

Another major factor affecting project performance was multiplicity of externally assisted projects with
each having its own procedures, priorities and reporting formats. The number of such projects exploded
during the life of this project. The state governments were hard pressed to service different partners, and
thus implementation of RCH project, which did not receive technical assistance on an ongoing basis, got
affected since others because of their physical presence were able to draw the attention to them.

Intensive polio operations and such other campaigns run by programs like HIV/AIDS also affected
program performance.

Family Welfare is a part of overall health sector. The personnel for the large part are funded by the states.
States budget crunch reduced funding for the health infrastructure, thus post of male workers or IEC


                                                       - 27 -

personnel etc. were not filled up, funding for operational expenses of facilities got reduced and
infrastructure deteriorated for want of maintenance. This coupled with lack of work-culture, unfriendly
attitude and poor image have led to underutilization of public services. General lack of trust of private
sector also came in way of more use of their services.

Weaker governance and lack of public health orientation was also a factor of weakness of health systems
particularly in the EAG states.

During the implementation of program, many interventions were envisaged to address areas of particular
need without much scope of flexibility at the state level. The approval processes also got fragmented among
different wings of Ministry. The process of annual planning and approval did not take off, thus quite
substantial time of the Ministry round the year was spent in financial and administrative matters. Technical
guidance & handholding to the states could not be effectively provided.

IX. Key Lessons Learnt
Program Design
l There has been limited state ownership of the project and no space for the districts due to their limited
     involvement in the formulation of the program. Fragmented programs did not lead to desired impact. It
     could also not be conceptually need based. Thus, there is a need for creating a single omnibus centrally
     sponsored program with a common budget head giving adequate flexibility and authority to the states;
l The project experience has showed that projectising for specific areas may not be a viable option in
     lower performing states on account of weak management capacities overall and diminution of
     capacities elsewhere on account of focus on a specific area. Meaningful impact also demands a longer
     term plan than available in a medium term Project;

Program Management
l Multiple societies at district level cause duplication of efforts and miss out on synergy.          Improved
     functioning resulted where these were consolidated into integrated professional Program Management
     Units at the State and Districts levels;
l Weak managerial and technical capacities at all levels hampered performance. There is a need to
     provide string public health and management skills to the programme managers.

Financial Management
l SCOVAs were not successful in their role as autonomous planning, implementation and monitoring
     body, because of lack of clarity in roles vis-à-vis government, lack of qualified/ trained staff and nature
     of schemes. Flexibility and fund to states, need based strengthening of the staffing, clarity of roles,
     detailed financial system and strong stewardship is necessary to reap full benefit of SCOVAs.

Planning, Monitoring and MIS
l Decentralized planning could not make headway because of lack of onus on the people higher up in
     hierarchy than ANM, lack of practical guidelines for conducting assessment & consultation, its
     translation in work plan & input requirements and lack of linkage of work plans with inputs. Thus,
     there is a need for practical guidelines, proper accountability and supervision, flexible and untied
     funding for supporting local action and shifting the onus of program development to the states and
     districts based on their local needs and capacities identified through district plans;
l Centralized collection of CNAA plans and form-9 reports reduced state's involvement in the process,
     whereas central feedback could not be conveyed actively. Neither these became the basis of monitoring.
     The state's role in CNAA use both for planning and monitoring is crucial;
l Lack of validation of CNAA plan and reports led to a cynicism about the data, thus exaggerated and



                                                      - 28 -

    unbelievable service statistics;
l Survey data, both RHS and facility, were not used in the planning at the local levels. This is because of
    the long delay in analysis of survey data and lack of skills in using the finding. Mere dissemination is
    not enough;

Training and Human Resources Management
l Systems must be put in place for taking a long-term view of skill development and ensuring appropriate
    nominations to different training programs;
l Programme Managers coming from clinical backgrounds do not have appropriate skills in general
    management as well as appreciation of public health principles. A composite course on these issues is
    needed rather than one focusing solely on technical management;

Underserved Groups
l The RCH approach must be widened to providing quality counseling privacy and treatment for RTIs
    /STIs to unmarried adolescents. The problem of anemia among adolescent girls must be addressed
    before they become pregnant. The induction and training of male health workers needs to be given high
    priority if improvement of male adolescent health and male involvement in RH program are to be
    pursued seriously.

Behavior Change Communication
l Dissemination of information is important, but it does not necessarily result into behavior change.
    Behavior change requires a clear understanding of setting of the intended audience and advocated
    behavior must be conveyed with clarity;
l The production quality of material is important. It is also necessary to use multiple mediums and
    repetition of message in order to lead to necessary behavior change. Inter-personal communication and
    other media need to work in synchrony;
l There was hardly any IEC focused on providers and community members, even as policy shift of
    aligning RCH services with the client needs and expansion of reproductive choice demanded such an
    effort. Mere demand side IEC is not enough, as has been repeatedly demonstrated in efforts such as
    UIP Mission, adult literacy programme. Such an effort must be launched during RCH II.

Child Health
l Communities need to be made aware about the significance of completing the immunization schedule.
l A different approach needs to be devised in the RCH program, for ensuring adequate coverage of
    children of mobile and migrant communities.

Reproductive Health
l RCH program must expand to include treatment for a range of sexual health problems for both men
    and women, as treating a couple and not just an individual, is a more effective way of treating.
l    Perceived poor quality of services, rude, insensitive behavior, and image as centers for contraception
    and maternal care at Public Health facilities is causing underutilization for other reproductive services;

Maternal Health
l Many of the above factors are also responsible for poor utilization of delivery facilities in public
    institutions. There is a strong need to ensure respect safety, privacy and confidentiality for beneficiaries
    within the public health facility to realize the RCH goals and objectives;
l Improving Post-partum care requires an attention to improvement of outreach particularly home visits.

                                                     - 29 -

The project had no other cofinanciers, apart from IDA and the GOI.

(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
DFID comments on RCH-I

At the outset, I would like to clarify that DFID was not central to the design and implementation of the
RCH-I process. During that period, our funding to the Family Welfare (sub)sector was limited to Polio
eradication. In addition, we had State based engagements with the Health Sector in West Bengal, Orissa,
Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. My perception of the programme is based on the following:
        1. Participation in a couple of joint monitoring missions with the World Bank team
        2. Direct feedback from the grass-roots from our State partners.
        3. Desk review of lessons learnt in RCH-I, while designing RCH-II

Did policy change happen?
I would say, that yes, it was certainly initiated. While designing RCH-II, we did not have to go over those
principles once again as Policy makers were well informed about the paradigm shift. Having said that, I
think much more political advocacy would have been useful so that States would have done away with
incentives and disincentives related to Family Planning, in the Population Policies that some States
developed. Again, a robust training programme, particularly for front line health workers would have been
useful, as they are a key interface with the clients.

Did effective local planning occur?
To my mind, States where existing community mechanisms were strong, i.e. Maharashtra, West Bengal
and southern States, local planning did occur. But this was weak in the Empowered Action group (EAG)
States. Our experience in West Bengal and Orissa indicates that Health workers found the tool (CNAA) for
community planning a bit cumbersome.

Bank's performance:
I can say with confidence, that the Bank team working on RCH-I, perhaps has the best sectoral knowledge
in the country. I have been consulting with them extensively while working on a large Operations Research
agenda on Reproductive and Child Health in West Bengal and later, on design of RCH-II. I am most
impressed by their technical knowledge and overall understanding of operational issues within the sector in
India. However, I think, the team was not able to exploit their strengths to the fullest since tracking of
financial disbursements always dominated the monitoring missions.

Government of India's performance:
There is an improvement in GoI's performance from pre-RCH days but the change has been patchy. Some
divisions such as Maternal Health & Immunization have done well whereas the performance of departments
such as procurement, child health and training have a lot of scope for improvement. In general we still do
not find the central team working cohesively as one unit. It may have to do with individual personalities.

I. Introduction

Reproductive and Child Health Program was the flagship program of Government of India encapsulating the
new approach to population and development agreed during Cairo ICPD in 1994. The new approach was
marked by shifting focus from achieving population goals to meeting reproductive health needs of actual and
potential clients, broadening the basket of reproductive services to include maternal and child health care,
RTI/STI services, MTP etc., consideration of reproductive and sexual health needs during the entire life-cycle,
focus upon the underserved groups such as male, adolescents, vulnerable groups such as tribals, urban slum
dwellers, active involvement of communities, social groups & active consideration of gender and other issues
that hinder full enjoyment of sexuality and reproduction. In short, the approach placed the reproductive &
sexual needs of individuals (and couples) at the center of the entire scheme of things.

Encouraged by the convergence of the domestic consensus with the ICPD recommendations, sector reviews
carried out by the World Bank and a host of other agencies, and necessity for mobilization of significant
resources for the ambitious RCH vision indicated in the document Paradigm Shift, the Government of India
formulated the Reproductive and Child Health programme combining its resources with those coming from
World bank, EC, UN agencies and other DPs. World Bank agreed to invest into this program with a view to
improving the performance of the FW program and having a strong policy and program content.

The funding was envisaged to come in two phases. The first phase of Bank's assistance lasting for 5 years was
to commence immediately in 1997 with an investment of about US $ 308.8 m, while the 2nd phase was to
commence mid-way with almost equal investment. The focus of the assistance was on strengthening
institutional capacity to implement the policy changes envisaged under Paradigm Shift and addressing
implementation weaknesses and on operationalizing the newer interventions such as referrals for essential and
emergency obstetric care, RTI/STI diagnosis and care. As it happened, the follow-on RCH project was not
taken up as envisaged, instead the assistance was availed for a project focusing upon the immunization
component of the RCH program. The project also supported polio activities during 1999. The assistance was
restructured during early 2001 with rationalization of schemes for increasing access to RCH services esp. in
EAG states, greater emphasis on NGO activities, new IEC activities in pursuance to IEC strategy,
decentralization of authority of approval of plans and toning down of training and LCE activities The RCH I
formally closed on 30 September 2004, 1.5 years later than scheduled. The present report describes the
experience of the implementation of the RCH I project.

It is also necessary to understand the context of the support so as to be able to appreciate the implementation of
the project. The family welfare program had its major focus on regulation of fertility and for this purpose had a
system of method-specific targets coupled with a system of incentives. Despite this, unmet need of fertility was
close to a quarter of the eligible population not counting the men. This focus had inevitable impact on neglect of
other reproductive services and quality of care. A wide disparity of performance among regions, states and
communities characterized the program. Quality and outreach of the program required improvement in order to
motivate the population to use its services and needed differential strategies. The FP program and CSSM(for
safe motherhood and child survival) program with a host of disparate programs continued to operate separately
each with their own training, IEC, MIS and other operational matters. Even though, many of the factors leading
to high fertility originated elsewhere, the inter-sectoral convergence was weak. A joint GOI-WB review
published as India: Towards a Reproductive and Child Health Approach(1995) made following major
recommendations:

     a.      replace method-specific contraceptive targets and incentives with reproductive health indicators;
     b.      increase emphasis on male responsibility and involvement, broaden the method mix and


                                                         - 55 -

    contraceptive safety;
    c.        increase the role of private sector;
    d.        increase budget for reproductive health to fill staffing and facility gaps, enhance service quality and
    offer a minimum reproductive health package;
    e.        improve program quality and access and incentivize performance; and
    f.        improve referral system, esp. for EmOC, by strengthening PHCs and FRUs.

In pursuance of above recommendations, method specific targets were abolished and were replaced by a variety
of reproductive health indicators with bottom up planning through community based consultations. Safe
motherhood activities were expanded to the entire country. Standards of sterilization were drawn up.The
country also committed itself to the polio eradication goal by 2000. It is in this background that the
implementation and achievement of the program needs to be viewed.

Project design chose investment into public sector as the primary instrument for considerations of equity,
geographical access etc.        The allocations of the project resources took both population as well as
epidemiological data into account for balanced development. Districts were classified in 3 categories. All the
districts were classified into 3 categories, A, B & C on the basis of female literacy and crude birth rate. The
scale of interventions was linked to district category.. Interventions were allowed to different districts as per
their classification and the states they belonged to. At the same time, attention was given to link investment
with performance. The focus was to consolidate and upgrade the infrastructure rather than creating new
facilities. Non-public sector agencies within and outside the sector were to be engaged to pool their strength for
social mobilization, advocacy, improving access and complementing the public sector in operation and
management of the program. The fund flow was envisaged to take place largely through societies at the state
level to provide flexibility in operations.

The project implementation was to be largely through District Family Welfare Bureaus or Zilla Parishads
(District Councils) under the supervision of State Health and Family Welfare Departments, while coordination
and oversight was to be provided by MoHFW. The capacities for management and oversight were to be
augmented by consultants at both state and central levels. Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee, as well Project
Management Committee was constituted centrally for inter-sectoral convergence and regular monitoring
respectively. Similar structures were created at the state level too. Major procurements, either by center or the
states, were to be made through selected and agreed PSAs. Consultant support for technical assistance was
encouraged. Monitoring and evaluation was to be done against agreed benchmarks on the basis of (a) service
delivery and utilization data from the Management Information System (MIS); (b) financial and physical
performance data from state project directors; (c) data from technical quality assessments by service
supervisors; and (d) rapid assessments of service coverage, quality and facilities by independent agencies, and
of technical quality of training and IEC by competent agencies.

II. Objectives

The Bank's assistance was broadly envisaged to assist the Government of India (GOI) to improve the
performance of its National Family Welfare Program (NFWP) in reducing maternal and infant mortality and
morbidity, and unwanted fertility, thereby eventually contributing to stabilization of population growth.

The specific objectives for the RCH I project were set as assisting the NFWP to:-

    (a) Improve management performance by nationwide implementation of policy change referred to as the
"participatory planning approach,"' and institutional strengthening for timely, coordinated utilization of project
resources;


                                                         - 56 -

    (b) Improve quality, coverage and effectiveness of existing FW services;

    (c) Progressively expand the scope and content of existing FW services to include more elements of a
defined package of essential reproductive and child health (RCH) services; and

    (d) In selected disadvantaged districts and cities, increase access by strengthening FW infrastructure while
improving its quality.

Following broad strategies were adopted for achievement of the above-mentioned goals and objectives.

III. Strategies Adopted Under RCH ­ I

Following major and interrelated strategies were adopted to achieve the project objectives:-

    (a) Expansion of existing monitoring system and decentralization of planning: This included validation of
the existing service delivery data through regular client polls and technical assessments of quality, rapid
assessments of community and NGO perceptions by independent agencies, and training and technical support
for more responsive decentralized activity planning.

    (b) Institutional strengthening through consultants for procurement services and technical assistance as well
as research/dissemination for RCH management.

    (c) Enhancement of capacity to plan, supervise and monitor RCH Program implementation (including
district and city sub-projects) through additional staff and individual consultants at national, state and district
levels.

    (d) Upgrading quality and scope of services through improved clinical and communication practices and
establishment of referral procedures from the community to the appropriate facility. The project financed
equipment and drugs from an approved essential list, minor renovations, hiring selected contractual services
(such as anesthetists, obstetricians), referral funds and defined schemes to improve access and staff mobility in
remote areas. It was also to support pilot experimental schemes designed for tribal areas and urban slums.

    (e) Upgrading competence of FW workers and managers by training in relevant technical and clinical skills
for all components of the RCH package, interpersonal counseling skills, improved gender sensitivity, program
management including convergence with WCD services, IEC and community mobilization.

    (f) Improving health and care-seeking behavior among target populations and increasing community
participation and responsibility for reproductive and child health. The project envisaged financing
communication-needs assessments, consultancies for development of IEC strategy, media and materials
support, training, communications activities by NGOs and community groups, and rapid assessments and
monitoring of behavior change.

    (g) District and City sub-Projects: In the most disadvantaged districts and urban slums, in addition to the
inputs provided under the project component "Essential RCH services", the project focused investments for
expansion of physical infrastructure, strengthening human resources for Family Welfare and implementing
innovative approaches to meet needs of local priority groups. The project financed civil works, procurement,
consultants' services including IEC, NGO schemes, honoraria for community health (link) workers, and
women's village health committees.

IV. Achievement of Project Objectives

Overall Achievement

RCH I was a complex project having interventions for the entire range of reproductive health services besides
bringing about changes in the way services are planned, delivered and monitored in the context of a wide
diversity of systemic capacity and complexity. This project provided an opportunity to individuals and
communities to participate and determine the type of services required as per their felt needs. The project
conferred direct social benefits by increasing access to quality, family planning and MCH services; thereby it
promoted a decline in fertility, morbidity and mortality among mothers, infants and children. It also provided
for affordable and accessible health services through more and better trained health personnel, improved supply
of drugs and consumables, expanded range of services and better IEC and community mobilization. The project
also strengthened the institutional structures, improved technical capacity and MIS systems. Achievement in
respect of some important process and impact indicators are tabulated in Annexure I. Although, achievements
have not been uniformly good, they are for the most part positive.

One of the important objectives of the RCH project was to carry forward the reform agenda and policy dialogue
necessary for it. It has been one of the very productive areas. National Population Policy 2000 encapsulated
RCH approach of free choice, sensitivity to clients' needs, gender sensitive improved quality of care and
affirmed state's commitment to provide assured, affordable, equitable, and comprehensive care to all. RCH
programme has provided umbrella framework to this policy. Evolution to sector wide approach and reform has
been necessitated by the large canvas of challenge of RCH. Under the lead provided by Sector Reforms
Program, this too has contributed to evolution of consensus towards this approach. Social marketing and
franchising have been one of the hotly debated topics, as has been the role of NGOs in RCH. Both of these
debates have led to policy reforms. As a consequence, revised NGO guidelines came in force in 2003 allowing
service delivery and more effective interface with states. National IEC Strategy was drawn up after a wide
consultation with the experts, states and technical agencies, proving framework of IEC/BCC activities in the
new scenario. Another achievement of the project was development of a tribal health strategy.

In course of the implementation of the project, many innovative interventions were taken up. Some of these are
establishment of a panel of voluntary blood donors in Rajasthan for improvement in blood availability during
emergencies, maternal and infant death audits and monitoring of institutional deliveries in Tamil Nadu,
rickshaw vans as      ambulances and public recognition to families practicing good RCH practices in
Murshidabad sub-project in West Bengal, training database for all health personnel in Andhra Pradesh etc.
which emerged as good practices, that need to be followed by other states too.

One of the key goals of the RCH I was to reduce the disparities in RCH between the regions, socio-economic
groups, etc. However, comparison of RHS data for EAG states for both the rounds of surveys (Bihar,
Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal)              indicate no
reduction in disparities in RCH status. Home visit by outreach workers have declined everywhere but more
sharply in rest of the country than the EAG states. The recent or proposed initiatives such as EAG focus or
NRHM, in whose evolution RCH dialogues/analyses have played a role have this challenge cut out before
them.

The experiences gained, lesson learnt and factors which affected the implementation of this project are being used
to design future RCH Programs which is one of the thrust areas under the Tenth Five Year Plan, National
Population Policy, 2000, National Health Policy, 2002. These experiences also feed into the formulation of the
National Rural Health Mission, which pins it on the bedrock of RCH program by suitably restructuring it. It
seeks to improve Rural Health Care delivery in the States by integrating multiple vertical programs at the District
level along with their funds and by utilizing inter sectoral action provided by Panchayati Raj.

       Component-wise Achievements

Co. I/Improved Management Performance: The RCH program had the goal of improving the MIS,
decentralizing the planning, institution strengthening and enhancement of program management capacity with a
view to improving the efficiency of program as well as achievement of program objectives of quality,
accessibility, responsiveness etc. Each of the major strands under this component is detailed below.

Sub co. i/Expand existing monitoring system and decentralize planning: This component supported the
adoption of the CNAA approach for decentralized planning and monitoring for the program. Training, IT support
etc. were the major areas of support. Computers were supplied to 530 districts and 32 states/UTs. The goal of 60
% of the district plans being prepared in a decentralize manner has been met, the true spirit of community
consultation was found to be missing in many plans. Also, only 56 % of the districts on an average submitted
monthly progress reports in the terminal year of assistance, although some of the districts were not submitting
them in time and there were no efforts for internal validation. The feedback mechanism has not been
institutionalized at any level.

Rapid Household Surveys have been one of the successes of the Program, where 2 rounds of high quality surveys
have been held to ascertain the service use and knowledge statistics. Instead of surveying only 20% districts every
year as planned, all districts(except those of Bihar and Jharkhand in 2nd phase of 2nd round) were surveyed



                                                            - 59 -

twice to provide baseline and endline data. Its use for technical quality monitoring has not been met although the
data have been used for advocacy and central level program planning. Facility surveys have also been conducted
to provide data on infrastructure, personnel and services being provided by different levels, but covered only 221
districts in1998-99. Rest (372 districts) was covered in 2002-03. Results of the latter are being compiled. Delay
in abstracting results reduced utility of both the surveys. Monitoring of technical quality through supervisors
could not be developed into a quality management tool. The experience of concurrent monitoring of RCH
implementation in UP through IIM Lucknow was disappointing; therefore it was not extended to other states.

Sub co. ii/Institutional strengthening: RCH project envisioned hiring of procurement support agencies (PSA),
technical assistance for specialized areas e.g. IEC as well as research studies relating to RCH management. The
nomenclature is at variance with the activities envisaged therein. PSA assistance helped in managing large scale
procurement through complex World Bank procedures, though at times beset with delays. The PSAs services
were largely used for goods procurement. States other than Tamil Nadu did not come forward for procurement on
account of a host of factors including lack of capacity, likely delays. To that extent, the project goals could not be
met. Although, logistics development was not a specific goal, efforts were made in many states e.g. Karnataka,
Assam, Uttar Pradesh etc. were made. The inputs provided in this project have helped NIHFW and IIPS to
develop capacity for managing nationwide activities in trainings and surveys.

SCOVA society as financing vehicle for state level activities was really a successful innovation. All states other
than Tamil Nadu employed this mechanism, even though 8 states had initially planed to use budget mechanism
for fund flows to the state. The project enabled development of a finance manual, TOR of audits and streamlining
of accounting functions of SCOVAs and districts. It also enabled strengthening of financial management unit at
the central level. It was a fruitful activity which should yield benefit for the next phase.

NGO sector saw development of Technical Advisory Group (TAG), Apex and Regional Resource Centers for
training and guidance of MNGOs. This project also supported peer assessment as a tool for NGO selection.

The project aimed to fund a broad array of research (on technical issues as well as on studies evaluating the
implementation of the RCH project), disseminate the research results through workshops and publications, and
utilize the research finding to strengthen program management. Seven project implementation studies were
conducted which helped share project experience across States as well as helped assess the contribution of project
components to improving services. Workshops were undertaken and research results disseminated. Two expert
committees on research in reproductive health and contraceptives were established in the MOHFW and 22
clinical and operational research studies were approved and financed by them.

Sub co. iii/Enhancement of capacity: The objectives of this component overlapped with that of others. Capacity
to formulate district plans in a decentralized manner is a type of enhancement of skills. Similarly, capacity to plan
for and undertake procurement, training, surveys through support agencies is another area of capacity
development under the programme. Specifically, this component enhanced the capacity of Ministry and States for
program management and planning through placement of consultants/staff. States were allowed to choose the
areas of consultants. In all, states recruited about 118 consultants/staffs for this purpose and placed with
SCOVAs. Reluctance of some of the states to conduct recruitment themselves came in way of better utilization of
this provision. Services of a recruitment agency were hired in 2003 to facilitate recruitment of more consultants in
states. Management training of different kinds trained more than 2000 programme managers. Most promising
among them was 3 month training in public health and management for district officials.

Co. II/Nationwide Improved Quality, Coverage and Effectiveness, and expanded content of the Essential
Package of RCH services




                                                             - 60 -

The RCH Project aimed to contribute to strengthening delivery systems, improving quality and widen the package
of services available to the people. As explained earlier, the RCH programme included all RH including FP and
maternal care services as well as child health. The results of the programme led to improvement in maternal care
as well as the coverage of family planning, as explained below in the section on Project Impact. The indicator
relating to child health, however, shows contradictory trends. Although infant mortality rate estimated by SRS
declined by 11 points over the project period, the full immunization coverage declined by 7.4 % to 44.6 %
(comparison of matched 274 districts of RHS I & II). The knowledge of ARI danger signs and diarrhea
management also marginally declined. It is likely that massive polio operations diverted attention from other child
health activities during this period. Detailed description by component activities is given below.

Sub co. iv/ Upgrading service delivery: This is the core of World Bank support with a variety of initiatives in
various areas of maternal and child health care. On one hand project supported minor repairs and renovations viz.
OT, labor room to make FRUs/CHCs to make facilities more useful, on other hand drugs, consumables and
equipment were supplied relevant to particular level with special emphasis on EmOC / EsOC and neonatal care.
Operational support was provided for strengthening of outreach, holding camps, referrals or ensuring round the
clock delivery. Support was also extended to hiring of anesthetists, safe motherhood consultants, staff nurses,
laboratory technicians and ANMs for augmenting service delivery in areas with identified need. Some significant
achievements may be commented here.

l Additional Personnel: The scheme of additional ANMs was allowed in EAG states, North-eastern states and
    some other states where population coverage or terrain made it difficult for existing ANM to service the area.
    In all 6478 nurses were reported to be hired with this support. 1519 Staff nurses were reportedly placed in
    PHCs of B and C category districts to prepare these facilities for conducting delivery, IUD insertion and
    other RH services. 374 Lab technicians were also reported to be hired to enable the FRUs to be fully
    functional. Safe motherhood consultant was envisaged to provide MTP and other RH services during their
    periodic visits. At the end of December 2004, report of 1278 SM(safe motherhood) consultants had been
    received. The response to engagement of anesthetists was tepid principally because of reluctance of city based
    anesthetists to go to rural areas. As a result, only 1059 cases have been reported to be assisted by private
    anesthetists. It is against this backdrop that short anesthesia course etc. are being thought of. It may also be
    mentioned that the governance crises prevented very needy states of Bihar, Jharkhand and some others to
    fully avail of contractual personnel.

l Operational Support: These included schemes for supporting 24 hour delivery in PHCs, referral transport
    through "Panchayats"(local bodies), integrated financial envelope etc. During MTR, new schemes RCH
    camps, TBA training and extension of outreach services especially meant for EAG/ weaker states were
    added. As per available reports, 20384 women received assistance for referral transport services, while
    223465 night deliveries were conducted in night in PHCs hitherto not conducting such deliveries. The RCH
    camp scheme enabled holding 13,556 camps in underserved or remote areas. TBA training scheme was held
    in areas with less than 30 % safe delivery and reportedly trained 33,017 persons. The scheme of integrated
    financial envelope allowed flexibility to the relatively advanced states to plan on their own maternal health
    interventions esp. for round the clock institutional delivery and EmOC. All the southern states have done well
    in this regard. Another scheme of note was operationalization of essential newborn care in which through
    support of National Neonatology Forum, 3826 doctors have been trained in neonatal care in 80 districts.
    RCH outreach scheme was designed to improve planning, provide social mobilization and operational
    support and improve supervision. The scheme was extended to 151 districts. However, for lack of
    handholding and ownership, this did not receive a good response.

l Procurement: RCH strategy for improving quality included supply of necessary drugs, consumables and kits
    from FRU till sub-centers. The supplies to sub-centers included Kit A and Kit B necessary for RCH related


                                                            - 61 -

    services as well as minor ailments. The supplies to PHCs and above were confined to the areas of MCH
    including MTP and RTI/STI. The procurement agencies included HLL, HSCC and RITES. Delays were
    occasioned in procurement in different years principally because of systemic weaknesses within the Ministry
    and lack of adequate experience within PSAs. Even though the quality of supplies was reasonably good and
    shortage of supplies was seldom reported, attention must also be paid to storage, distribution and utilization
    and MIS relating to this.

l Expansion of range of RCH services: The services relating to RTI/STI have been introduced in all district
    hospitals and a large proportion of FRUs. Not only the health personnel have been trained under IST about
    RTI/STI, but support for diagnosis by way of laboratory technicians, consumables and lab equipment and
    treatment through RTI/STI drug kits have been made available. The options for safe abortion have been
    expanded by introduction of MVA and medical methods of abortion. The newborn care training and
    equipment has been provided in 80 districts with the help of National neonatology Forum. However, the
    project failed to make headway with regard to adolescent health because of lack of unananimity among
    stakeholders about the approach to this issue and their role. It may also be pertinent to mention that
    expansion of contraceptive choice was not explicitly addressed as a goal. The efforts in this direction by the
    Ministry were bitterly opposed by some women groups.

Sub co. v/Upgrading competence: This component sought to increase skills and awareness of FW workers and
managers by training in relevant technical and clinical, interpersonal counseling skills, improved gender
sensitivity, program management, IEC and community mobilization. NIHFW took up management of training
through 18 CTIs located in the states. CTIs provided technical supervision and monitoring of the training
activities taken up by the States.

l Awareness generation training was taken up to sensitize health personnel and other officials/ community
    leaders about the RCH approach and program. In all 400, 741 personnel were trained. This was discontinued
    after December 2000 to concentrate upon the task of skill development.
l Skill development training continued in 2 directions. Integrated skill training(IST) aimed at refreshing overall
    skills for RCH services including IPC, gender sensitivity and program management for ANM, LHV, staff
    Nurse, MO etc, while specialized skill training aimed at developing specific competencies such as MTP, NSV
    etc.
l Management training aimed at upgrading program management skills of district and state managers, while
    communication training was for communication skills of district and block level communication personnel.

Overall achievement is summarized in Annexure - II. It will be seen while 73.5 % of overall training load under
IST was met, only 30 % of training load was met for specialized skill training. The shortfall in IST is due to
inclusion of vacant posts in estimation of training loads as well as poor performance of states like Bihar,
Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Assam and West Bengal. Poor performance in specialized skill
training was because of shortage of eligible public institutions and reluctance of private institutions to offer
themselves as training sites. Management training covered 89 % of load, while communication training met 87.4
% and 73.1 % of load at district and block level respectively. A rapid assessment in late '03 found good level of
competencies development among all type of trainees except ANM, only about half among whom had satisfactory
level in MH care. NIHFW also piloted training database in 2 districts of AP. The achievement has been
particularly good in after the MTR.

Sub co. vi/Improving health and care-seeking behavior and community mobilization: The project envisaged
financing communication-needs assessments, consultancies for development of IEC strategy, media and materials
support, training, communications activities by NGOs and community groups, and rapid assessments and
monitoring of behavior change.


                                                         - 62 -

IEC and Social Mobilization
One of the first tasks that were taken up by the Ministry was to develop a Communication Strategy for the FW
programme as a whole. This strategy was developed after rounds of consultation with the states, NGOs and
experts and launched in October 2000. Pilot projects proposed in 10 districts based on new strategy did not take
off due to lack of enthusiasm of development partners and lack of capacity in states. Slightly better was
experience in regard of schemes sanctioned to 7 northern states and West Bengal under the Project.

For community mobilization District Literacy Committees (ZSS) were engaged to propagate RCH messages. In
all, 227 ZSSs were engaged. The scheme could not achieve its desired impact on account of problems in fund
flow as well as lack of coordination between FW and adult literacy officials at different levels.

Project funds were also used for developing a series of interactive panel discussions as well as video spots on
RCH messages using professional agencies. These were aired at Doordarshan on slots advised by R K
Swamy/BBDO. This campaign ran for about 8 months. In addition, messages were disseminated on radio using
film songs, folk songs, dramas and on stand alone basis too.

The training of communication officials as mentioned above was taken up. About ¾ of training load could be
completed. A review of the training found it to be relevant but not entirely in keeping with their experience and
suggested improvement in training methodologies.

NGOs

The NGO scheme in the RCH scheme was directed largely at the awareness generation and mobilization. The
principal vehicle of NGO was mother NGO scheme, in which a nodal NGO took responsibility of guiding field
NGOs both operationally and technically for the above purpose. Fund flowed to the FNGOs through MNGOs,
who were also the sole interface with the Ministry. At the end of project, 106 MNGOs and over 800 FNGOs were
functioning. The experience has been one of the exceptional features of the project. This achievement gave
confidence to partner NGOs in service delivery. The NGO guidelines have been accordingly amended. Another
development of note in this regard has been the decentralization of NGO implementation activities to state with
assistance from NGO coordinators located in the states. In order to provide professional assistance to NGOs, 5
resource centers have been started. Some innovative NGO projects in specific areas of service delivery, training
etc. were also taken up. NGO involvement brought focus on gender, adolescent health, sex education and other
such pertinent issues. A external review endorsed the achievement of the component, however, also brought to
fore some operational issues, many of which have been addressed in amendment of NGO guidelines.

Despite above efforts, overall awareness on RCH has not improved although the awareness of polio campaign,
HIV/AIDS have improved (the latter by 9.7 % (women) and 14.2 %(men) RHS I & II data). However, the
awareness of diarrhea management, ARI danger signs and RTI/STI have suffered decline by 2.3 %, 4.8 % and
9.6 % respectively among women respondents. This may be due to squeezing out of other IEC activities by polio
campaigns, vacancies in IEC set-up, lack of a clear-cut media plan and professional execution of activities.

Co. III (also Sub co. vii)/District and City sub-Projects: Under the Project, sub-projects were implemented in
17 districts and 7 cities for improving access and enhancing quality to bring these disadvantaged areas at par
with that of the state as a whole and meet specific needs of local priority groups by optimizing use of available
resources, strengthening infrastructure and implementing innovative approaches. The projects were intended to
enhance commitment to ensure program success and impact over time. The total approved cost of the project was
Rs. 283.88 crore, involving new construction of 1379 facilities, repair of 2602 facilities, supply of drug,
equipment, vehicles, IEC activities, contractual staff and other operational funds. Some of important activities


                                                         - 63 -

undertaken in sub-projects include:-

l Construction of 998(72 % of target) & repair of 2440(94 % of target) facilities
l Although no separate training was visualized at the inception, training of community workers, TBAs etc.
     were taken. Nasik trained 630 RMPs to engage them in RCH service delivery.
l Sub-projects contributed a lot in improving mobility. 5 Projects funded 444 ANMs for moped purchase. 66
     Jeeps, 18 ambulance, 4 IEC vans and        24 other vehicles were bought. However, some projects used hired
     vehicle.
l Group meetings, mass and interactive media and CHWs were used for demand generation activities.


As per an evaluation conducted by Gupta and Talwar, 9 (out of which 5 are in EAG states) sub-projects could
spend less than 60 % of funds available, even as of December 2003, indicating lack of implementation capacity.
This has been attributed to delays in releases by State Finance Deptt., complex procurement procedures, lack of
technical capacity, project implementing authorities lacking decision making authority, delay in getting sites for
new works etc.

V. Project Cost and Expenditure

As mentioned earlier, the original approved cost for the project was US $ 308.8M (credit US $ 248.2 M) for the
period August October 1997-March 2003. After the mid-term review in 2000, the project was restructured with
same level of credit. The Bank permitted procurement of vaccine and funds for social mobilization for PPI in
1999-2000 from the project funds. The restructuring in 2000 also permitted provided for new schemes such as
RCH camps, TBA training, RCH Outreach scheme etc. A sum of US $ 17.624 M for Gujarat earthquake was
drawn as an emergency relief. Subsequently, a supplementary credit of US $ 14.854 M was provided for the
project. The project has used credit of US $ 247.64 M including that diverted for Gujarat, and claim applications
of Rs. 365.292 M are in pipeline, which would use up US $ 8.347 M. Thus, only 0.610 M or 0 .23 % of
available credit would be left.

The cost analysis of the expenditure component wise is given in Annexure III. It shows combined expenditure of
main (N0180) and supplementary credit (N0181). It does not include claims in pipeline. The reasons for better
utilization are:

Category 1: substantial (2275 facilities) civil works for up-gradation of CHCs /District Hospitals besides
renovation of 988 facilities and repair of 2440 facilities under sub-projects.
Category 3:     addition of polio vaccine in 1999-2000 as well as Kit A & Kit B supplies.
Category 4:      partly attributable to inclusion of social mobilization expenses under polio campaign in
1999-2000.
Category 6:      2 rounds of full household surveys compared to planed coverage only once (20 % districts every
year for each of the 5 years).

Reasons for poor performance in some categories were:

Category 2: (vehicles & equipment): Only 50 % of provision was utilized because only one cycle of equipment
procurement was carried out.
Category 7: Lack of success in operationalizing urban and tribal RCH projects was the cause.
Category 8: (incremental salaries etc.): less than expected hiring of additional ANMs and other project personnel
in several of large northern states     such as Bihar, Madhya Pradesh.

Time trend of expenditure, both projected and actual can be seen in Annexure IV. The first half of the project


                                                            - 64 -

saw ¼ of total expenditure, whereas second half saw ¾ of total credit outgo, as compared to almost even pattern
of expenditure envisaged in the project. This was due to initial time spent on preparatory activities relating to
implementation of the project activities viz. filling up of the posts, selection of sites for various facilities,
preparation of plan and identification of agencies for civil works and procurement. MTR went a long way in
rationalizing schemes and approval processes thereby facilitating execution. Another factor for this expenditure
trend was the weakness of the financial management system, which could not file claims as the expenditure
occurred.

VI. Project Impact

RCH I Project is a complex project covering a wide gamut of reproductive and child health services whose impact
is influenced by a wide variety of operational, systemic, governance, socio-economic, cultural issues both
intrinsic and extrinsic to the sector. Impact in terms of outcomes like maternal mortality, fertility also can't
dramatically change over life of a medium-term project such as RCH I, therefore, the project has rightly laid
emphasis on process indicators for measuring the improvement attributable to it.

 Although baseline for the project is available in terms of Rapid Household Surveys carried out during 1998-99
covering the entire country, similar endline surveys are available only for 294 districts carried out during
2002-03. Although the two surveys are not true representative of baseline and endline, however, their proximity
to these time-points as well as the fact of slow start-up of the program enable us to use them for measuring the
achievement of the program. A comparison of key indicators based on results of 274 matched districts in the is
shown in Annexure V. As endline survey was made two years prior to actual completion of the project, therefore
further improvement and correction of negative trends is not ruled out.

Maternal Health: Full ANC defined as at least 3 ANC visits, receipt of IFA tablets and at least 1 TT injection
rose by 8.4 % to reach 40.3 %. Similar rises are noticed for any ANC visit or women with at least 1 TT injection.
Proportion of women delivering at home declined by 6.9 %, whereas that in institutions rose by 6.6 % to reach 40
%. Surprisingly, delivery in government institutions declined by 5.5 % to 18.5 %. Most surprisingly, it is the
women in the better placed states which have deserted the government institutions the most ( decline in %
delivering in government institutions for Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are
9.8 %, 28.9 %, 10.2 %, 9.1 % and 15.3 % respectively). It may be due to the fact that rising aspirations of
service quality may not have been matched by the public facilities. There has been a very modest increase in
home deliveries being attended by trained persons (1.3 %), whereas safe delivery i.e. assisted by health
professional rose by 7.9 % to reach 47.5 %. The proportion of women with 1 post-partum visit instead of
improving declined marginally (1.4 %) to 12.7 %, again an effect of declining home visits.

Family Planning : Comparison of the two indicate contraceptive prevalence increasing by 3.3 % to 52.0 %, while
that due to spacing method rose by 3.3% to 10.7 %, while that for permanent methods remained more or less
same. While the CPR rise is welcome, lack of rise in permanent method CPR and likely rise in traditional
methods CPR are causes of concern as is slowing down of improvement in CPR, which(as per NFHS data) rose
by 10 % points between 1992-93 to 1998-99. It may be largely due to the fact that programmatic attention to
family planning declined during the period both in terms of management attention and inputs. It is significant that
operational definition of RCH as CSSM + RTI/STI + adolescent reproductive health left out family planning.
Overall unmet need for contraception declined by 3.6 % to 15.9 %.

Child Health: The child health component aimed at bringing down sharply the infant mortality by addressing
neonatal care apart from consolidating the immunization and protection against diarrhea and ARIs. Infant
mortality came down from 71(SRS 1997) to 64(SRS 2002), but not to the extent expected. The NNMR is also
showing a declining trend, but its ratio to IMR stays put at ~ 65 %, reflecting probably better coverage of


                                                          - 65 -

programs, but not the extent of services or quality.

The immunization performance is a cause of worry. As per RHS data, full immunization coverage declined 52.0
in 1998-99 to 44.6 % in 2002-03. Disaggregated data show decline of 7.1 % in coverage with 3 doses of DPT
and 9.1 % in that of polio. This has to be viewed against the fact that alongside an initiative for improvement of
immunization program ran also including the supporting polio eradication activities (World Bank Credit IN
3340), which aimed at increasing full immunization coverage by 5 %. Probably deteriorating outreach is a cause
as may be low profile of routine immunization. The proportion of women visited by any health worker during 3
months prior to survey has declined by 9.6 % to 10.1 % during this period.

Polio incidence has come down from come down from 1931 in 1998 to 133 in 2004. From being spread allover
India, it has been localized to some pockets in Bihar and UP, although eradication target slipped by. A variety of
factors including socio-cultural belief, health system weaknesses and overdose of polio IEC may have been
responsible for this.

The awareness of diarrhea management and ARI danger signs have also gone down slightly (2.3 % and 4.8 %
respectively) reflecting lack of emphasis. Lack of due attention may again have been the cause.

Sub - Projects: The RHS surveys have showed that institutional and safe deliveries increased in large majority of
9 projects for which matched data is available. However, full immunization coverage has decline in 8 out of 9
sub-projects, in 5 sharply. The performance in FP and home visit was found to be mixed. Because of likely data
problems, evaluators have employed pooling of data and on that basis have reported that 4 sub-projects reached
state average, whereas remaining lagged in one area or another.              Sub-projects in Mehboobnagar and
Murshidabad could not close the gap between them and the state average in any area.

Other areas: The impact of the project on expansion of RCH services, strengthening of institutions have already
been commented upon earlier, thus, need not be gone through again. The project's aim of reaching underserved
groups such as urban poor, adolescents did not make much headway. A consensus approach to urban RCH could
not be forged early enough even as IPP VIII and other pilots for urban RCH continued. The adolescent related
programming could only emerge only during 10th Plan(starting April 2002), when specific attention was paid to
it by the Planning Commission.

It could be said on the basis and other strands of evidence that there has been good progress in the area of
maternal health, family planning. Though, the child mortality has definitely declined, the traditional child health
components especially immunization has suffered as explained above having adverse implications for child
morbidity. The delivery system and implementation capacity has improved and package of services widened even
though equity issues were not very explicitly addressed. Community involvement in planning and monitoring has
increased. Thus on the whole the impact of the project has been quite positive.

VII. Bank Performance

The project approach was consistent with World Bank's strategy and Government policy and was appropriate for
achieving the stated objectives. However, the project design had inbuilt problems especially in terms of uniformity
of package for the entire country, large number of schemes each addressing only a small area of package and lack
of delegation of authority to states. All these resulted in slowing implementation. It is not surprising that MTR
had to restructure the project on these lines too and a delay of about 1& 1/2 year in the completion.

The supervision missions from June 1998 to June 2003 at least twice a year helped States/GOI in taking remedial
action, modifying their plans as and when required and realistic monitoring of the project activities. However, a


                                                           - 66 -

project of this magnitude required much more hands on technical assistance than merely operational support and
periodic monitoring specially in some of the poor performing states and on addressing new technical/programme
areas than was possible with the existing arrangement of project management headquarterd at Washington DC
and a partial presence in Delhi.

The Bank also showed sensitivity to the MoHFW's suggestions. Polio funding in 1999-2000, schemes of TBA
training, RCH Camps and RCH outreach as well as purchase of Kits A & B are some of the example, where
without compromising project objectives, credit was extended. Furthermore, MTR brought further flexibility in
respect of approval of plans viz. procurement plan of sub-projects or training plan etc., thus simplifying
implementation. However, procurement process was still a difficult and lengthy one. The process of filing claim is
also a complex one, in which there is a lot of scope for streamlining. The Bank staff was supportive of innovative
initiatives.

MoHFW had visualized RCH as a programme in which all the development partners were to contribute to
addressing common goals. This required coordination and convergence of DPs as much by the GOI as by the
Bank, as Bank was one of two principal financiers of the RCH Programme. The extent of engagement of other
partners into the Project and Bank's into that of others could have higher and led to more synergistic realization of
project objectives, as it is likely to happen in the second phase of RCH. Need was also felt for higher coordination
among Bank's projects in health and related sectors viz. nutrition, HIV/AIDS even as good coordination was
achieved in projects of the Department of Family Welfare.

Overall, MoHFW regards as Bank's contributions valuable.

VIII. Sustainability

The effectiveness of a project depends largely on the institutional and financial sustainability of the project
activities after donor funding has ceased to be in place. The state and central governments that implement the
program have also faced continuing resource crunch. This crunch is most evident in maintenance of facilities and
availability of drugs and consumables besides establishment support. However, few important factors point to
better financial sustainability of the activities. The social sector expenditure (excluding food subsidy, BMS and
rural development) has grown since 1990-91 in real terms at a rate of 4.2 % per annum, while the share of family
welfare in that has also grown therein from 9.6 % to 13.1 % (DfID supported Public Expenditure Review, 2004).
UPA government's manifesto aims to raise ratio of public expenditure on health from 0.9 % to between 2-3 %.
All sub-centers, which provide in main RCH services, are now covered by central funding. Furthermore, several
successful examples of cost-sharing (e.g. Naogaon, Assam) show promise of cost sharing and cross-subsidization
of services. Community mobilization for health through NGO and other sources would also contribute to
sustenance of investments in this program. It must be however said that polio operations have squeezed
investments in other areas of RCH.

Under RCH institutional sustainability has been addressed through (a) having a system in place for community
involvement in planning; (b) securing effective partnership with the private sector and NGOs; (c) putting in place
the societies at state level and clarification of role/strengthening them for effective functioning; (d)
development/strengthening of institutional structures/capacties for research, training, surveys etc. However,
integration of different health societies, more effective coordination between directorate and SCOVA, capacity
development of directorates and empowering of states require further work.

The technical sustainability of the program has been addressed by a large scale skill development program
supported by RCH I, under which 221,859 personnel were trained under IST, while specialized skills were
provided to 38,740 personnel. Over 3000 MOs were trained in neonatal care. In addition training in several areas


                                                            - 67 -

of promise has been initiated e.g. 4 month training in anesthesia to alleviate shortage of anesthetists, training of
community based mid-wives for skilled birth attendance, MVA training. In addition trainings were provided to
TBAs would improve quality of home deliveries. Several manuals/guidelines e.g. FRUs, blood storage at FRUs,
RTI/STI were also brought out during the program, which strengthen the technical base of the program. These
need to be carried on even as induction courses for new recruit, revision of curriculum and refresher for others
and continuing medical education need to be addressed in a future program.

Managerial sustainability is one issue which must continue to be addressed, even though program management
training as enumerated earlier as well as in Immunization Strengthening Project for immunization management
has led to strengthening of skills. Still, attrition factors coupled with the need for more comprehensive approaches
especially for addressing underserved areas/ groups require further attention. Policy changes for effective
deployment of programme managers are also required.

Overall, it is felt that the project made significant efforts to ensure sustainability, still at this stage programme
requires further inputs both in terms of resources and technical assistance to realize ambitious goals set out in
MDGs, National Population Policy 2000, National Health Policy 2002 and other related policies and plans given
the existing resource and capacity constraints as well as need to base them on best available evidence.

IX. Major Factors Affecting the Project

The Project had a slow start up and low levels of implementation during the first three years. The factors which
affected the implemented adversely inter- alia included delay in recruitment of SCOVA personnel and activation
of its management structures, delay in release of funds to the implementing agencies, delay in finding suitable
sites for civil works, quick turnover of project managers, lack of familiarity with bank procedures regarding
procurement and evolving monitoring arrangements.

Another major factor affecting project performance was multiplicity of externally assisted projects with each
having its own procedures, priorities and reporting formats. The number of such projects exploded during the life
of this project. The state governments were hard pressed to service different partners, and thus implementation of
RCH project, which did not receive technical assistance on an ongoing basis, got affected since others because of
their physical presence were able to draw the attention to them. Weak coordination arrangements of Bank
vis-à-vis other DPs was a factor in competitive rather than synergistic implementation of different DP
assistances. Insufficient coordination among different Bank funded projects also affected optimum use of project
resources. RCH II should break this cycle with this with pooling of DP resources.

Intensive polio operations and such other campaigns run by programs like HIV/AIDS also affected program
performance. Because of continuing high level of wild virus, states, particularly in northern parts had to take up
as many as 8 rounds of polio, each needing huge mobilization of resources and health personnel extending to
weeks. All this diverted management attention, personnel and resources etc. especially from child health services.
Even as country could not have avoided supporting polio eradication operations, attention thereon was
disproportionate to its epidemiological impact.

Family Welfare is a part of overall health sector. The personnel for the large part are funded by the states. States
budget crunch reduced funding for the health infrastructure, thus post of male workers or IEC personnel etc. were
not filled up, funding for operational expenses of facilities got reduced and infrastructure deteriorated for want of
maintenance. This coupled with lack of work-culture, unfriendly attitude and poor image have led to
underutilization of public services. General lack of trust of private sector also came in way of more use of their
services.




                                                               - 68 -

Weaker governance and lack of public health orientation was also a factor of weakness of health systems
particularly in the EAG states.

The PRIs/ULBs are evolving institutions in many states in terms of role in health sector, resources, orientation
and accountability. These factors came in way of adequate involvement of local bodies. Weaker convergence with
other sectors, partly due to lack of willingness on their part too, hampered benefit of potential synergies. Weaker
local bodies also could not mount enough pressure and ensure coordination.

During the implementation of program, many interventions were envisaged to address areas of particular need
without much scope of flexibility at the state level. The approval processes also got fragmented among different
wings of Ministry. The process of annual planning and approval did not take off, thus quite substantial time of
the Ministry round the year was spent in financial and administrative matters. Technical guidance & handholding
to the states could not be effectively provided.

Factors contributing to the subsequent recovery and good progress inter-alia included (a) commitment of the
management at national and state level (b) strengthening of financial management and systems (c) streamlining
the funds flow mechanism (d) responsiveness to strong technical feedback provided by bank supervision missions
and other DPs (e) flexibility in the project design (f) adequate supplies of quality drugs and consumables(g)
successful community mobilization and advocacy by NGOs.

X. Key Lessons Learnt

RCH Project had a vast scope in terms of thematic and geographical areas, target groups, administrative systems
and policies to deal with. The implementation of the project has led to a variety of lessons, technical,
programmatic and policy based, which need to be considered for designing of next phase of support. Major ones
are enumerated below:

       Program Design

       Ø There has been limited state ownership of the project and no space for the districts due to their limited
involvement in the formulation of the program.
Fragmented programs did not lead to desired impact. It could also not be conceptually need based. Thus, there is
a need for creating a single omnibus centrally sponsored program with a common budget head giving adequate
flexibility and authority to the states;

       Ø The project experience has showed that projectising for specific areas may not be a viable option in
lower performing states on account of weak management capacities overall and diminution of                capacities
elsewhere on account of focus on a specific area. Meaningful impact also demands a longer term plan than
available in a medium term Project;

       Ø Program design should have included family planning as one of its explicit target area and accordingly
planned for inputs. The working definition of RCH services as CSSM + RTI/STI caused enormous confusion and
led to loss of focus on family planning in planning, monitoring and coordination.

Program Management

       Ø Multiple societies at district level cause duplication of efforts and miss out on synergy. Improved
functioning resulted where these were consolidated into integrated professional Program Management Units at the
State and District levels;


                                                           - 69 -

      Ø Weak managerial and technical capacities at all levels hampered performance. There is a need to provide
string public health and management skills to the programme managers;

      Ø Active implementation requires adequacy and continuity of critical project staff.

      Ø There is a need for building program management capabilities at the State and District level through
induction of professional managerial support and clear roles and accountability;

      Ø There is a need for giving strong attention to the low-performing EAG and North Eastern states by
providing intensive technical assistance at state as well as district levels to strengthen their management,
accounting, planning and implementation capacities and intensive monitoring of the performance of EAG states
by the center;

      Ø There is a need for strategically using information technology and consultant support to link physical and
financial performance;

      Ø Performance orientation can not be brought about in absence of specific instrument for doing so. PBF in
RCH could not materialize because of lack of linkage between objectively verifiable outputs and financing. MOU
mechanism of EC funded SIP is a good instrument to follow;

      Ø Coordination mechanisms must be instituted at district, state and central levels for promoting inter and
intra sector convergence but advocacy must be done with and mutual benefit demonstrated to relevant
departments for assurance of willing cooperation ;

      Ø The mechanism to orient various committees and staff members of project and other concerned officials
and sanctioning authorities about the bank         procedures, rules and regulations etc. must be a part of the project
design so as to expedite decision making particularly on issues concerning procurement;

      Ø There is a need for establishing stronger partnerships with private sector for improving the access to
essential services, particularly in urban areas;

      Ø For reaping the benefits of procurement, PSAs of relevant experience, having experienced staff etc.
should be chosen, appropriate systems in the purchaser's office regarding clear accountability, complaint
redressal and analysis mechanisms, post review of contracts, system of quality control at all level from
production stage till delivery in the districts, improvement of storage and distribution systems is a must. Effective
state-center-PSA liaison is necessary to ensure need based purchases, quick acceptance of supplies etc. Effective
logistic systems with appropriate IT inputs are also a must.

Financial Management

      Ø SCOVAs were not successful in their role as autonomous planning, implementation and monitoring
body, because of lack of clarity in roles vis-à-vis government, lack of qualified/ trained staff and nature of
schemes. Flexibility and fund to states, need based strengthening of the staffing, clarity of roles, detailed financial
system and strong stewardship is necessary to reap full benefit of SCOVAs.

Planning, Monitoring and MIS

      Ø Decentralized planning could not make headway because of lack of onus on the people higher up in


                                                           - 70 -

hierarchy than ANM, lack of practical guidelines for conducting assessment & consultation, its translation in
work plan & input requirements and lack of linkage of work plans with inputs. Thus, there is a need for practical
guidelines, proper accountability and supervision, flexible and untied funding for supporting local action and
shifting the onus of program development to the states and districts based on their local needs and capacities
identified through district plans;

      Ø Community involvement right from the stages of planning to implementation and monitoring of the
project helps in acceptability, accessibility and         affordability of the services and in developing a sense of
ownership by the community;

      Ø Centralized collection of CNAA plans and form-9 reports reduced state's involvement in the process,
whereas central feedback could not be conveyed actively. Neither these became the basis of monitoring. The
state's role in CNAA use both for planning and monitoring is crucial;

      Ø Lack of validation of CNAA plan and reports led to a cynicism about the data, thus exaggerated and
unbelievable service statistics;

      Ø Survey data, both RHS and facility, were not used in the planning at the local levels. This is because of
the long delay in analysis of survey data and lack of skills in using the finding. Mere dissemination is not enough;

      Ø There needs to be fewer indicators for monitoring and supervisor checklists need to be devised on this
basis for CNAA to have meaningful impact.

Training and Human Resources Management

      Ø Systems must be put in place for taking a long-term view of skill development and ensuring appropriate
nominations to different training programs;

      Ø Programme Managers coming from clinical backgrounds do not have appropriate skills in general
management as well as appreciation of public health principles. A composite course on these issues is needed
rather than one focusing solely on technical management;

      Ø Curriculum of medical education must be revised to incorporate RCH programme approaches and
principles. Additionally they should be used as technical resources for concurrent monitoring of the programme.

Underserved Groups

      Ø The RCH approach must be widened to providing quality counseling privacy and treatment for RTIs
/STIs to unmarried adolescents. The problem of anemia among adolescent girls must be addressed before they
become pregnant. The induction and training of male health workers needs to be given high priority if
improvement of male adolescent health and male involvement in RH program are to be pursued seriously.

      Ø RCH programme must target men in RH education and awareness building programs and not focus
exclusively on women only.

Behavior Change Communication

      Ø Dissemination of information is important, but it does not necessarily result into behavior change.
Behavior change requires a clear understanding of setting of the intended audience and advocated behavior must


                                                           - 71 -

be conveyed with clarity;

       Ø The production quality of material is important. It is also necessary to use multiple mediums and
repetition of message in order to lead to necessary behavior change. Inter-personal communication and other
media need to work in synchrony;

       Ø Behavior change normally requires encouragement and support at the community and family level.
Effective communication programmes include in their target groups community leaders, opinion makers and
functionaries of related programmes;

       Ø Technical capacity for IEC is declining. Urgent efforts must be made to reveres the impending manpower
crunch in the area. Medical stewardship of IEC community has only worsened the situation.

       Ø There was hardly any IEC focused on providers and community members, even as policy shift of
aligning RCH services with the client needs and expansion of reproductive choice demanded such an effort. Mere
demand side IEC is not enough, as has been repeatedly demonstrated in efforts             such as UIP Mission, adult
literacy programme. Such an effort must be launched during RCH II.

Child Health

       Ø Communities need to be made aware about the significance of completing the immunization schedule.

       Ø A different approach needs to be devised in the RCH program, for ensuring adequate coverage of
children of mobile and migrant communities.

       Ø Education on neonate care and health must form an essential part of child health services and new / first
time mothers must be adequately educated before their discharge from the hospital and though field health
workers' visit at home in the case of home delivered babies.

Reproductive Health

       Ø RCH program must expand to include treatment for a range of sexual health problems for both men and
women, as treating a couple and not just an individual, is a more effective way of treating.

       Ø There is a need to expand the RH services (fertility related or otherwise) to encompass all age groups of
women and not just those in child bearing age-group.

       ØIn some parts of country, the use of herbs and roots for infertility, abortion, and other needs places
women's health in unsafe hands. There is a need to train and involve the traditional healers and practitioners of
indigenous medicines in the RCH program towards more responsible use of natural products
.
       Ø It is important to respond to women's unmet need of `safe contraceptive' and correct and complete
information about contraceptive use, side      effects and their management. Health providers, especially
doctors, need to counsel women about contraceptive use and side effects rather than ignore them as
misconceptions.

       Ø Widespread awareness needs to be created against the misuse of MTP in communities and its negative
effect on women's health. MTP should not be given as a conditional service.

       Ø Perceived poor quality of services, rude, insensitive behavior, and image as centers for contraception and
maternal care at Public Health facilities is causing underutilization for other reproductive services;

Maternal Health

       Ø Many of the above factors are also responsible for poor utilization of delivery facilities in public
institutions. There is a strong need to ensure respect safety, privacy and confidentiality for beneficiaries within the
public health facility to realize the RCH goals and objectives;

       Ø Improving Post-partum care requires an attention to improvement of outreach particularly home visits.
