"Morocco's structural adjustment\n            program aims to achieve a sustainable increase in the rate\n            of economic growth in order to ensure employment\n            opportunities and acceptable living standards for its\n            growing population, while enhancing external\n            creditworthiness. This First Structural Adjustment Loan will\n            support the first phase of a program of action covering an\n            increase in the levels of public revenues and savings to\n            finance essential infrastructure and social investment,\n            while reducing the need for public sector borrowing. Also\n            financed will be the further rationalization of trade and\n            industrial policies, and the elaboration of an external\n            liability management plan. Specific policy measures, tax\n            policy and administration, public investment budget, and\n            export promotion, will help raise the overall efficiency of\n            the economy in line with the program goals."}, "docdt": "1988-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
