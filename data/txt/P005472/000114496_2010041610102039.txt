is substituted therefor:
     "2.8 Notification and Advertising
          The international  community  should  be  notified  in a
     timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by
     advertising invitations to apply  for inclusion in a bidder's
     invitation list, to  apply  for  prequalification, or to bid;
     such  advertisements  should  be   placed  in  at  least  one
     newspaper of general  circulation  in  the Borrower's country
     and, in addition, in at least one of the following forms:
          (i)  a  notice  in   the   United  Nations  publication,
               Development Forum, Business Edition; or
         (ii)  an  advertisement  in  a  newspaper,  periodical or
               technical journal  of  wide  international circula-
               tion; or
        (iii)  a notice to local  representatives of countries and
               territories referred to in the Guidelines, that are
               potential suppliers of the goods required."
2.   The following is added at  the  end  of paragraph 2.21 of the
Guidelines:
          "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require
     the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely
     used in  international  trade  and  specified  in the bidding
     documents."
3.   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.

autonomous entity, and  which  is  governed  by the Borrower's Law
(Dahir) No. 1-59-271  dated  April  14,  1960,  as modified by the
Borrower's Law (Dahir) No. 1-62-402  dated June 30, 1962, relating
to the financial control by the Borrower of public enterprises.
Part C:   Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.   (a)  With respect to  each  contract  to  be  procured on the
basis of the procedures referred  to  in  Part A of this Schedule,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the submission to
the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the
Loan Account in respect of  such contract, two conformed copies of

statements of expenditure.  Such  contracts  shall  be retained in
accordance with Section 3.03 (c)(ii) of this Agreement.
