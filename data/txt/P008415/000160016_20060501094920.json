The performances of both the Bank and the Borrower\n            were satisfactory. The main lessons learned are: Considering\n            the political uncertainty in Georgia, it is critical to\n            allow for adjustments during project implementation. Lessons\n            learned from ongoing projects, including this project, show\n            that it is important to create trust among all stakeholders\n            before the project can enter the main implementation phase.\n            Capacity building in all institutions dealing with the\n            project as well as a step-by-step approach during project\n            implementation is essential in order not to overwhelm local\n            authorities and institutions. Improved access to credit\n            gives a substantial boost to agricultural investment,\n            output, and rural livelihood and can be done without\n            distorting financial markets. Success or failure of the\n            project's credit components was highly correlated with\n            the intensity and quality of project supervision and\n            management. The performance of partner financial\n            institutions depends on the ability of their staff to\n            appraise loan proposals, particularly the ability to assess\n            market prospects for the commodities to be produced and to\n            develop repayment schedules consistent with income streams.\n            There is a strong demand for locally based credit facilities\n            (such as credit unions) in rural villages, but these\n            institutions need sustained, strong support in the form of\n            training and supervision if they are to evolve into viable\n            financial institutions. Small village-based credit\n            cooperatives are not an appropriate mechanism for\n            large-scale credit delivery. Rural credit cooperatives\n            should be based in rural towns be saving-driven, and\n            encouraged to lend for all purposes, rather than focus only\n            on farm lending. This would enable them to expand to a wider\n            membership base, a more diversified loan portfolio, and a\n            stronger member commitment to the organization - all of\n            which improve sustainability. Gradual growth in lending is\n            important so that it is commensurate with the growth in\n            management skills and savings mobilization among members.\n            Finally, inclusion of donors engaged in parallel development\n            programs in the project design process and their subsequent\n            oversight of program implementation is essential if\n            confusion is to be avoided and synergy to be enjoyed."}, "docdt": "2005-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
