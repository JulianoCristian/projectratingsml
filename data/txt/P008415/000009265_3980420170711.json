The specific\n            goals are to develop an agricultural credit system;\n            facilitate increased liquidity in land markets; and identify\n            an agricultural development and investment  program to\n            address major constraints to increasing agricultural\n            productivity.  To support the above objectives, the project\n            will provide financing to the Project Coordinating Unit and\n            to four free-standing components.  Three of these\n            components: a) Credit to Enterprises; b) Credit Unions; and\n            c) Agricultural Services, will have nation-wide coverage.\n            The Land Registration component will be limited to two\n            administrative districts (rayons) in the vicinity of Tbilisi."}, "docdt": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
