There are\n            four components. The first expands health service coverage,\n            improves health services performance, improves heath\n            facility utilization rates, institutes quality assurance\n            measures. The second component strengthens the planning,\n            management, and administrative performance of the Ministry\n            of Health and Social Affairs (MSAS); decentralizes\n            decisionmaking to districts and health facilities;\n            strengthens coordination of donors and nongovernmental\n            organizations; improves health sector financing; implements\n            effective health information and epidemic surveillance\n            systems; and improves health personnel management. The third\n            mitigates the effects of infant and child mortality,\n            maternal mortality, young child malnutrition, and infectious\n            diseases (while increasing preventive care).
