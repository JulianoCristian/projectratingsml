                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last Implementation Support mission in February 2013, the implementing agency has concentrated its efforts in moving forward procurement processes for the main civil
                         works activities, completing the execution of ongoing contracts and processing an extension of the closing date to allow for the conclusion of key activities both under the civil works
                         and the institutional strengthening components. Said extension was approved by the Bank in December 2013, as a result of which the new closing date of the project is June 30th,
                         2014.
