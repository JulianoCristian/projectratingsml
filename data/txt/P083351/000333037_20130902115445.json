The report comprises a social assessment and\n            cultural policy framework, identifies environmental impacts,\n            and proposes mitigation measures aimed at integrating\n            environmental and social dimensions into regional\n            development, specifically, into the medium- and long-term\n            development endeavors of each of the poles. It ensures that\n            tourism development is sustainable in environmental and\n            social terms. It also seeks to rationalize future\n            subprojects. Anticipated impacts include soil erosion and\n            sedimentation, loss of biodiversity, coral destruction due\n            to starfish proliferation, water contamination from human\n            pollutants, economic loss, disappearance of animal species,\n            and, restricted access to land for the population and\n            traffic congestion, further diminution of cultivable land,\n            destruction of ancient buildings and homes, degradation of\n            the marine environment and beaches from tourism activities,\n            air pollution, disrespect of cultural taboos and moral\n            values, and loss of cultural identity and increased sexual\n            tourism. Some recommended mitigations include: signage and\n            traffic management, installing drainage systems, building\n            repair, land use management, public education and publicity\n            campaigns about the risks of sexually transmitted diseases,\n            promotion of public health, protection of water resources,\n            installing latrines, privatizing garbage collection,\n            feasibility studies on incineration, composting and biogas\n            production, installing mechanisms to control air pollution\n            including dust dispersion, scheduling work during normal\n            business hours, repairing and maintaining transport\n            vehicles, using other means to minimize noise such as\n            planting a greenbelt along transport corridors, restoring\n            land and woods, carefully handling hazardous substances,\n            avoiding traveling through water courses, conserving\n            vegetation, planning for emergencies, locating work camps at\n            a reasonable distance from villages, and involving local\n            authorities in operational activities and ensuring\n            women's representation."}, "docdt": "2013-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
