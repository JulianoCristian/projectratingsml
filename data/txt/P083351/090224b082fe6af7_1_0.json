Growth Poles\n            Project for Madagascar were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: in the absence of stability,\n            leadership and ownership at the central government level,\n            project implementation can still be effective if engagement\n            at local government levels is high and there is strong\n            project management. Sufficient institutional support and\n            governance capacity building should be integrated into\n            growth poles projects to promote their durability and\n            replicability. Collaborative and multi-sector Bank projects\n            can be useful in development contexts where there are\n            multi-dimensional constraints, provided there is a uniform\n            standard of quality in project design and implementation\n            among the different participating units. Concentrating\n            investments in spatially-limited areas with lean governance\n            structures can help mitigate the risks associated with a\n            complex design, weak implementation capacity, and the thin\n            spreading of resources."}, "docdt": "2015-06-15T23:34:01Z"}
