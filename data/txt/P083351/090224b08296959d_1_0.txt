 economic activity in the tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness and mining sectors; (ii) putin placeappropriate incentive measures to achieve rapid
 growth; (iii) develop the instruments to ensure equitable, sustainablegrowth; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of local authorities to formulate,
 prepare, implement, and manage medium- and long-termintegrated of future regional development projects

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Sixteenth and final Implementation Support Mission for the Madagascar Integrated Growth Poles Project (IG2P) was conducted on
 November 10-28, 2014. The main objectives of the mission were to take stock of implementation progress following the Fifteenth
 Implementation Support Mission; and ensure that the due diligence process is timely adhered to for the closing of the project, including
 preparations for the implementation completion report.
 Overall Implementation Progress and Progress towards Achievement of the Development Objectives are both rated Satisfactory. The PIU has
 performed strongly throughout the implementation period. The Overall Safeguards rating for this Category A project is Satisfactory at project
 closing and so are the ratings on procurement and financial management.
 The original credit (Cr. 4100, US$125mn) was fully disbursed on December 31, 2012. By November 31, 2014, the disbursement rate of the
 additional financing credit (Cr.4399, US$40mn) was 89% and total commitments were 95% of the credit. The PIU and Task Team agreed upon
 a revised Procurement Plan that will bring the disbursement rate to near 100% by December 31, 2014. The Project disbursed US$7.9 million in
 Q1-Q2 FY14 and US$9.1 million in Q3-Q4 FY14. The projected disbursement for Q1-Q2 FY15 is US$10.1 million.
 Data for October 31, 2014, reveal that the Project has achieved its PDO level results indicators. Fort Dauphin and Nosy Be have seen a ten-fold
 increase in the stock of formal enterprises (to 5,291) and a near seven-fold increase in the number of formal jobs (to 15,745) since the start of
 implementation. The results should be viewed in an overall context of political uncertainty and economic malaise since 2009.
 The Project has achieved, or is on track to achieve, the great majority of its intermediate results indicators. Data for 2014 of some outcome
 indicators will only be available in 2015 and will be presented in the Implementation Completion Report. The time it takes to start a business
 has been cut by up to 75% and to obtain a construction permit by up to 86%. More than 5,200 people have benefited from subsidized business
 development services. The number of hotel rooms in Nosy Be (+125%) and Fort Dauphin (+103%) has more than doubled and the number of
 tourist arrivals—notwithstanding the political crisis—had increased by more than 60% in 2013 since the start of the project. The number of
 people in the two regions that have access to improved water resources has more than quadrupled (to 133,350 people) and the number of
 people in urban areas with access to regular solid waste collection has also nearly quadrupled (to 143,600). Nosy Be and Fort Dauphin are
 today the only towns in Madagascar with solid waste dumpsites managed to international standards. By 2013, the municipal revenue in Fort
 Dauphin had increased by 659% and while the amount for 2014 is likely to decline vis-à-vis 2013 due to a reduction in exports of ilmenite it is
 still a significant improvement. In addition, all output indicators (urban and rural road rehabilitation, electricity generation capacity, electricity
 network construction/rehabilitation) have been achieved, exceeded, or will be achieved by December 31, 2014. Private investments and IG2P
 support have transformed the two regions in terms of the local economy structures and access to basic services.
 Two intermediate outcome indicators are most unlikely to be achieved for 2014. First, the number of tourist arrivals in Nosy Be will be lower
 than projected because of the poor performance of Air Madagascar and due to an insecurity problem. The murder of two foreign tourists in
 September 2013 led the French Embassy to put an orange alert to its nationals from Sept 2013 to April 2014 and this warning led to a high rate
 of holiday cancellations in the fall of 2013 and for 2014. National and local authorities have since reinforced security in Nosy Be and the alert
 has been lifted. The Regional Tourism Office stressed that holiday reservations by French tourists have bounced back strongly in the fall of
 2014 for the forthcoming season. Second, the volume of traffic in Ehoala Port will experience a dip in 2014 due to the depressed price for
 ilmenite, which has resulted in a slow-down of operations in the QMM mine outside Fort Dauphin.
 The Mission inspected several recent project completions. The rehabilitation of Nosy Be Port and Ankify Port were recently completed and the two ports
 are now operating as normal and both seem to be well managed. The new Joby Bridge in Nosy Be and the partial rehabilitation of Rip 118 as well as
 the collapsed section of the cornice in Fort Dauphin were also visited. The development of the Mont Passot tourist attraction is particularly pleasing and
 it is already making a healthy profit for the local public-private association. The continuous effort to strengthen maintenance and by extension the
 sustainability of Project investments was rewarded by the Government of Madagascar’s recent decision to include the Nosy Be ring road—of which the
 Project rehabilitated and expanded core segments—will be classified as national road and hence covered the National Road Fund for future
 maintenance. Local authorities have already allocated budget for 2015 to do spot improvements of the ring road.
 EDBM and the One Stop Shops it operates are now financially autonomous following some decisive action taken by the new Government. A covenant
 in the Project’s Development Credit Agreement states that: “No later than June 30, 2014, the Recipient shall take all measures, in form and substance
 satisfactory to the Association, to implement the strategy and action plan referred to in (A) immediately above to ensure that EDBM becomes financially
 sustainable and can continue its activity of one stop shop.” The "Loi de Finance Rectificative", which was adopted by the Parliament in August 2014,
 paved the way for a Decree (N°2014-1822) adopted on December 5, 2014, which revised the statues of EDBM. The agency will from now on report
 directly to the Presidency and it will collect and manage its own financial resources. A long held ambition to strengthen and guarantee the financial and
 operational sustainability of EDBM has thus come to an end in time of the closing of the Project. The Second Integrated Growth Poles and Corridor
 Project will consequently finance technical assistance and capacity building for the agency so it after years of relative neglect during the political crisis
 can take up its original mandate to proactively facilitate and promote investment in addition to operating the One Stop Shops and lead the public private
 dialogue in the country. It will also be lead agency for the implementation of the investment climate reform agenda that the soon-to-be-established
