sustainability is unlikely, and institutional\n            development impacts were modest. Performance ratings gave\n            mixed results, for while the Bank's lending performance\n            was satisfactory, its overall performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory due to the lack of flexible, and proactive\n            supervision, which should have adapted to the country's\n            changing circumstances. Conversely, overall borrower\n            performance is assessed as marginally satisfactory, namely\n            due to personnel factors, which hindered implementation.\n            Lessons address the need for more proactive approaches in\n            light of weak component performance, stressing project\n            restructuring as a way to deal with emerging realities.\n            Moreover, the extremely limited budgetary resources in the\n            country should have raised substantial questions on the\n            sustainability of project components, placing greater\n            emphasis during project design, and execution, on the\n            sustainability of benefits considering the uncertain\n            macroeconomic climate. In addition, the absence of linkages\n            to adjustment operations, and no mechanisms for\n            conditionality precluded policy, and structural reform;\n            whereas an analysis of existing policy and structural\n            weaknesses, could have linked the approach taken in each\n            component, to ongoing improvements in policy framework.\n            Although the independence of the Project Unit somehow eased\n            procurement, rigorous procurement plans should have been developed."}, "docdt": "2000-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
