Activities for which\n            Montenegro will need to assume responsibilities include\n            three IBRD loans (so-called Consolidation Loans) which were\n            taken by the FRY in 2001, nine IDA credits, and four trust\n            fund grants. Obligations related to the IBRD loans consist\n            of principal, interest and other charges repayment. The\n            proposed changes will result in Montenegro assuming formal\n            responsibility for implementation, reporting, fiduciary and\n            repayment and other associated obligations attached to the\n            loans, credits and grants involved."}, "docdt": "2007-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
