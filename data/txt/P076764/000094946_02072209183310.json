Structural Adjustment Credit\n            Project, will support the Government of the Republic of\n            Montenegro, in the implementation of a structural reform\n            agenda, to enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability, and\n            improve the prospects for economic growth, as a basis for\n            sustained poverty reduction. The project will support\n            specific reforms in the areas of pubic expenditure\n            management, pensions, the energy sector, labor markets, and\n            the business environment. While the project will enhance\n            recent stabilization gains, by supporting up front actions\n            to tackle major fiscal imbalances, and sectoral reforms, to\n            enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability, and finance\n            budgetary gaps to prod external reserves, risks include\n            political issues regarding the proceeding points for a new\n            union between Serbia and Montenegro, since the precise\n            development of implementation arrangements will require\n            agreement on critical details, including on the financing of\n            the new union structure, and on harmonizing external trade\n            policies, which may prove more difficult than originally\n            envisaged. Moreover, the challenge of mitigating the\n            short-term social impacts of reforms in the face of public\n            expectations of rising living standards, could create\n            pressures to raise government expenditures above budgeted\n            levels. Also, the limited institutional capacity may hinder\n            the pace of reform, and, economic recovery could be affected\n            by delays in the disbursement of pledged donor assistance,\n            and in concluding a concessional debt restructuring\n            arrangement with the London Club."}, "docdt": "2002-07-10T00:00:00Z"}
