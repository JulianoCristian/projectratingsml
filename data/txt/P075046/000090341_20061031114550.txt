Project development objective: Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3
The objective of the Program is to systematically promote the use of geothermal energy in the Europe and Central Asia
region by removing barriers to the development of renewable energy.
Global environment objective: Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3
The Program's global objective is to reduce greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) emissions.
Project description:
The Program will be an umbrella for geothermal subprojects in participating countries of the Europe and Central Asia
Region and will involve the provision of technical assistance for (i) capacity building to remove knowledge barriers; (ii)
policy reviews and amendments; (iii) project preparation as well as financial assistance to facilitate the access to
additional commercial financing on reasonable terms; (iv) direct investment funding; and (v) geological risk insurance.

The Global Environment Facility provided grant financing to set up the World Bank implemented Geothermal Energy
Development Program (GeoFund). Funding of the tasks above will be through the three principal instruments of the
GeoFund:
          A technical assistance window, to address barriers that retard the use of renewable energy resources and
          geothermal energy. It will also help set up or systematize geothermal databases, will contribute to dissemination
          of geothermal knowledge and know-how, and will help to identify and prepare/implement geothermal projects.
          A direct investment funding window that would provide low cost loans, contingent grants and outright grants,
          covering part of the project cost through monetization of external benefits.
          A geological risk insurance window to partially insure project developers/investors against the short-term and
          medium-term geological risks.

Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any?
As the environmental category of the Program will be FI, no safeguard policies are triggered by the GeoFund Program
itself. Subprojects will be individually assigned environmental screening categories.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

1.       Many countries of the Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA) lag behind current European Union
(EU) member states in regards to the use and the development of renewable energy resources (RER).
Significant barriers impede the increased utilization of renewable energy and, more specifically, geothermal
energy (GeoE) in these countries. There are three major barriers hindering the development of RER, and two
more that are specific to the development of GeoE. The major barriers that retard the increased utilization of
RER in ECA countries include:

         The lack of expertise and know-how about RER among energy sector decision makers at
         government-, industry- and local consulting services' levels;

         Energy market issues, including distorted energy policies (e.g., high subsidies for fossil fuels, energy
         tariffs not covering costs, lack of synchronization between various environmental support programs
         and the very frequent crowding out of potential support by excessive national subsidies), and
         inadequate and non-transparent legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks, leading to
         uncertainties in the heat and power industry and to a bias in favor of fossil fuels; and

         High transaction costs due to the typically small size of RER projects compared to the large fossil-
         fuel-based projects.

2.       In addition to the barriers impeding the development of RER, there are technology barriers particular
to developing projects based on geothermal energy:

         High up-front costs relative to conventional heat/power generation technologies (due to the need to
         identify the geothermal deposits and drill the high cost production/re-injection wells), and

         The associated geological risks of not finding sufficient resources during exploration or premature
         resource depletion during operation.

3.       The barriers associated with the management of geological risks appear to be among the most
difficult ones to tackle. Geological risks can be summarized as follows:

         Exploration risks: Dry well or insufficiently productive reservoir; lower than expected yield of the
         aquifer; lower than predicted temperature of geothermal fluid; lower than expected geo-physical/geo-
         chemical parameters of geothermal fluid (i.e. high Total Dissolved Substances (TDS), too much
         captive CO2).

         Operating risks: Re-injection risks due to insufficient or quickly deteriorating long-term ability of the
         reservoir rocks to absorb the returned geothermal fluid due to gradual non-reversible clogging;
         thermal draw down caused by thermal breakthrough; critical corrosion or scaling of the walls steel
         casing endangering their strength or dramatically increasing the pressure losses.

4.       While investors and financiers are willing to take conventional economic/financial and technological
risks, the special knowledge that pertains to the assessment and handling of geological risks is often beyond
the experience and capacity of both potential energy investors and lenders which reduces their willingness to
undertake or participate in geothermal projects.

5.       The above issues relating to the technological investment hurdles are common to all ECA countries
(see Annex 1). Financial barriers show a less even picture across the region as these are related to the
availability of public and private equity finance, the performance of the banking system, the general
investment climate, and economic development in a given country. Financial barriers tend to be less
significant in the western parts of the ECA region, i.e., in the countries that have recently joined the EU or
are designated EU accession countries, but can be prohibitive in Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries.




                                                        1

6.      Legislative support to the development of RER in the ECA region has been growing and has reached
different levels in different countries. The strongest support is found in Turkey. Some of the countries that
recently joined the EU exhibit various degrees of support for RER, following the recommendations of the
EU. Non-EU countries for the most part do not have any favorable rules and regulations towards RER in
place:

    In Turkey electricity production from RER is encouraged. The "Turkish Electricity Market Law"
    contains two regulations pertaining to the promotion of the use of RE. The Turkish Electricity
    Transmission Company and/or distribution companies are required to give priority to generating
    facilities based on renewables.

    A number of indirect incentives exist in Hungary and other Central European Countries to promote the
    use of RER, including lower import duties on equipment and lower taxes or tax holidays; there is also
    substantial legislative support for RE in these countries.

    Armenia adopted a legal framework supportive to the development of RER. Armenian law guarantees
    purchase of RE and provides payment assurance. The regulatory commission has set attractive tariffs
    (USc 4.5/kWh for small run-off river hydropower and USc 7.0/kWh for wind and biomass plants) for 15
    years. As a result, over 30 project developers have been granted construction licenses for RE projects
    recently. A number of barriers and constraints, however, still impede large scale private investments in
    RE projects (lack of long-term financing, unfamiliar risk profile of RE developers, lack of reliable
    information, etc.).

    The main provisions of the Russian Energy Strategy place relatively little emphasis on environmental
    issues. Only a short section focuses on the development of technologies and the technical means for the
    long-term development of energy resources. A Federal Law on RER has not been adopted yet.

    Ukraine has introduced some incentives for wind energy development in its legislation but there is no
    special support for geothermal energy.

7.      Most of the potential client countries of the GeoFund Program do not have a policy framework in
place that transparently supports renewable/geothermal energies. The role of the GeoFund Program is to
assist participating countries' legislative and regulatory bodies to increase the use of GeoE by developing
and implementing appropriate legislative frameworks as well as to provide financial support to geothermal
project implementation.

8.      The sector issues noted above, in particular the financing barriers to RE, along with the
Governments' commitment to address them, provide a compelling case for a GEF-supported contingent
finance operation in the ECA region for building a sustained market-based capacity to develop and finance
geothermal projects on commercial terms under the proposed GeoFund.

9.      In principle, all ECA countries are eligible for participation in the Program, provided that the country

             is eligible to receive GEF co-financing,1 and

             has submitted an endorsement of the GeoFund concept with a written indication of its wish to
             participate in it.

10.     Countries that wish to participate will submit an endorsement of the concept of the Program and a
request for support to the Bank/GEF. So far, Armenia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia,


1       A country is eligible for GEF financing for climate change if it has ratified the United Nations Framework
        Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and is eligible for borrowing from IBRD/IDA or for assistance
        from UNDP.




                                                          2

Ukraine, Tajikistan, and Turkey have provided written endorsements, while Georgia has indicated that they
would like to participate in the Program.

11.     All recipient countries of the projects proposed for the Start-up Phase (see Table 1) have submitted
National Communications to the UNFCCC in all of which the importance of increased renewable/geothermal
energy utilization as a key measure within the energy sector to mitigate global climate change is highlighted.
This is also reflected in respective sector development plans of most of the concerned countries.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

12.     The rationale for Bank involvement is as follows:

    a) The Bank in its capacity as one of the three Implementing Agencies of the GEF has experience,
        knowledge, and responsibility in implementing projects of GEF operational programs (see Annex 2).
        The proposed GeoFund complements and builds on the efforts to promote the adoption of RE by
        removing barriers and reducing implementation costs.

    b) The Bank has a comparative advantage in managing complex, multi-country and regional programs,
        especially in

                 Analytical and operational work that draws on the Bank's cross-country experience;

                 Ensuring that policy reforms are consistent; and

                 Using the specific expertise of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to promote
                 private sector investments.

    c) The Bank has played a major role in developing and fostering global partnerships among other
        development and multilateral financial institutions.

    d) Furthermore, the concept and objectives of the Program support the Bank's strategy to assist its
        client countries in the sustainable development of their energy resources. More specifically, this
        initiative builds upon the World Bank strategy for increasing the use of geothermal energy in ECA as
        described in the Bank Strategy Paper "Fire without Smoke" endorsed by the ECA regional
        management in October 2002.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

13.     The importance of the global climate change, its potential implications, and the need to address it is
understood across the countries of the ECA region. Nevertheless, national climate change strategies show
certain variations that are implied by respective Kyoto commitments; country-specific GHG emissions
reduction potentials and the economic situation of countries play a role in setting energy generation import
and use priorities. While middle-income countries have, in most cases, already implemented, or are
considering implementing measures that lead to decreases in the emissions of GHGs, those with struggling
economies lack the necessary financial resources. National climate change strategies of recipient countries
are detailed in their National Communications to the UNFCCC.

14.     For all recipient countries, the Program is consistent with CAS development objectives pertaining to
sustainable use of natural resources, the promotion of undistorted energy markets and support to private
sector investments.

15.     GEF eligibility. One of the Program's principal objectives is to facilitate the creation of an enabling
business/regulatory environment in participating countries of the ECA region so that the development of
geothermal energy becomes attractive to investors.

16.     In this way, the Program directly supports the GEF Operational Program #6: Promoting the
adoption of renewable energy by removing barriers and reducing implementation costs. In so far as the
construction of geothermal plants requires the upgrading/modernization of existing district heating networks



                                                        3

or combined heat and power plants, the Program also supports the removal of barriers to energy efficiency
and energy conservation, although this is not formally claimed here.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Financing instrument

17.     A GEF grant amounting up to US$25 million will finance about 20 subprojects over a period of eight
years. As in the case of the Hungary subproject, the GeoFund will provide only a small part of the overall
project investment. It is expected that the GeoFund will cover approximately 10 percent of the overall Project
investment costs and thus mobilize around US$200 million in additional financing2.

18.     The grant is to be provided through three windows of instrument:

             Technical assistance window for barrier removal, capacity building, and project preparation/
             implementation in the amount of US$7 million;3

             Direct investment funding window which could provide low cost loans, contingent grants as
             well as outright grants in the amount of US$8 million;

             Geological risk insurance window to help mitigate geological/ geothermal resource risks in the
             amount of US$10 million.

19.     The proposed GeoFund Program, envisioned as a region-wide and multi-country facility, will
establish a GEF facility for up to US$25 million using an approach similar to that of horizontal Adaptable
Program Loans4 (APL). As the PAD describes in more detail later, the GeoFund will be implemented
through a series of individual subprojects. The first subprojects will be implemented in Hungary through the
Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) and through the International Geothermal Association (IGA) with TA on a
region-wide basis. All relevant information about the IGA and Hungary subprojects is presented in Annexes
19 and 20. These two subprojects will be presented to the Board for approval along with the GeoFund
Program facility. In accordance with the procedures for horizontal APLs, for each of the following
subprojects, the Project Appraisal Document will be circulated to the Board for information after approval in
principle of the corresponding GEF Trust Fund by the management. Approval of subsequent individual GEF
Trust Fund Grants will be delegated to the regional level (i.e. Regional Vice President or Country Director)
after obtaining GEF CEO Endorsement. In the absence of requests from three or more Executive Directors
for Board consideration of the GEF grant, management approval will become effective ten working days
after the circulation of the documents to the Board. For approval of those subprojects which will be executed
by IFC as GeoFund's executing agency, the IFC management will have authority in accordance with its own
rules and procedures as granted under the 1996 Arrangement (see Annex 6 for detail).

20.     Program phases: The GeoFund will be implemented in a series of individual subprojects over a
period of eight years. To assure high quality and achievement of the defined project goals as well to provide
support in a flexible manner, the Program will be implemented on a project by project basis. A first set of
subprojects will be implemented in a start-up phase that is expected to last 24 ­ 30 months. The GeoFund is a
new and innovative approach to barrier removal for the utilization of geothermal energy combining several
instruments. Its systematic approach allows adjusting and refining the specifications of its instruments based


2There are already offers from France, Iceland, the Russian power company RAO UES and other potential partners
 which, when secured, are expected to augment the confirmed budget through donor funding or co-financing.
3The GeoFund Coordination Team (GCT) has identified about 25 projects in different countries. With a few
 exceptions, all are in need of TA for project preparation. This led to a higher demand of TA during the Start-Up Phase
 of the GeoFund Program than was anticipated at the time of the Project Brief preparation. It was, therefore, suggested
 by the GCT to increase the allocation of the TA from US$5 million to 7 million.




                                                            4

on experience gained during the Program implementation and changing market conditions. This will not only
enhance each subproject's results but also maximize the impact of the utilized funds.

21.      As requested by GEF, it was originally planned to establish a region-wide fund with further
multilateral and bilateral contributions. In case a region-wide geothermal organization cannot take over the
GeoFund, subprojects will continue to be implemented on a country-by-country basis. Lessons learned
during the implementation of the start-up phase will be integrated into project design and management.

22.      One of the key lessons in international efforts to promote renewable energy has been the importance
of uninterrupted project implementation through right timing that also allows for necessary adjustments and
changes in project design.

23.      APL triggers: Two sets of triggers apply under the horizontal APL: project triggers which
determine when an individual investment is eligible to receive Bank funds, and policy triggers determine the
eligibility of an individual country to receive Bank assistance under the APL program.

24.      Policy triggers are:

            proven country commitment by GEF focal point endorsement of the GeoFund Program
            established country program on RE development (or program is in the process of being
            established)

25.      Project triggers are:

            proven commitment of the project sponsor by co-financing in a ratio of approximately of 1:5
            proven project readiness by a sound screening package as described in "Subproject processing
            overview" on page 49
            project eligibility criteria are met as described in Annex 4.G.
            individual project triggers as established at the respective Quality Enhancement Review meeting
            (e.g. regulatory framework and procedures in the country)

2. Project development objective and key indicators

26.      The Program objective of the GeoFund is to systematically promote the use of geothermal energy in
the ECA region by removing barriers to the development of renewable energy. The most important barriers
include (i) knowledge and information barriers; (ii) institutional, policy, legal and regulatory barriers, and
(iii) financial barriers. In pursuing the above objective, the Program will:

         Provide technical assistance for capacity building, methodological, informational, and institutional
         support that will lead to changes in the current unfavorable investment and incentive conditions and
         create an enabling environment in participating ECA countries that fosters the development of
         geothermal energy utilization for heating and power generation applications; (barriers (i)-(ii));

         Increase financing availability through extending geological risk insurance to mitigate the geological
         risks (barrier (i)) which would help facilitate commercial lending to geothermal projects through
         leveraging private finance, and through providing grants through the DIF window (barrier(iii)).

27.      The increase of geothermal energy use by developing and implementing a number of financially
viable projects throughout the ECA region will help to accelerate the use of RE, build private confidence in
investing into this resource, and demonstrate to the regulatory bodies at national and local government levels
the feasibility and sustainability of geothermal energy use.

28.      The Program's global objective is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the interest of
climate change mitigation by systematic and streamlined implementation of geothermal projects. Thus, the
Program would help participating countries in the ECA region to initiate or expand their efforts to reduce the
emissions of GHGs in view of the fact that these countries are large emitters of GHGs on a GDP per capita



                                                           5

basis. The principal outcome of the Program for the global environment will be the reduction of CO2
emissions.

29.     Key performance indicators of the GeoFund Program. Performance indicators with respect to the
GeoFund Program objective include:

        Number of successful projects implemented;

        Amount of private capital raised for every dollar of GEF financing through the GeoFund Program
        (Leverage Ratio);

        Measurable reduction of CO2 emissions per year (tons/year);

        Adoption of policies.

30.     Key performance indicators for subprojects. Progress toward achieving the project outcome at the
project level will be measured by such project parameters as:

        Quantity of Energy generated (MW/h);

        Amount of thermal/electric capacity installed (MW);

        Cost per ton CO2 reduced (US$/t CO2);

        Installed yearly geothermal production;

        Reduced CO2 emissions per year (tons/year);

        Associated investment volume of the project with the investor or potential investor;

        Number of GeoE projects and associated investment volume with other financial institutions and
        investors.

31.     The institution/company that is implementing a subproject, will prepare a set of monitoring
indicators (physical/technical, operational, financial and environmental) including the key indicators which
will be monitored and reported upon on a quarterly basis in the context of the Project Management Reports.
A list of monitoring indicators acceptable to the Bank will be agreed at negotiations. The final commitment
to the monitoring indicators selected (including numerical targets, as appropriate) will be made at the signing
of the legal agreements by attaching an appropriate supplemental letter.

32.     Additional indicators describing further impacts and benefits will be developed during appraisal of
each subproject to evaluate other development contributions (industrial, local manufacture, employment, and
other social benefits). For more information on this topic see Annex 3.

3. Project components

33.     The GeoFund Program will be an umbrella facility for geothermal subprojects in participating ECA
countries and will involve the provision of Technical Assistance, Direct Investment Funding, and Geological
Risk Insurance. (For further information see Annex 4.)

34.     Initial allocations for each window will be indicative. Based on the experience during
implementation and cooling market conditions, the allocations of funds among the three windows could be
adjusted. A combination of three windows to co-finance one project could also be possible.




                                                        6

Component 1: Technical Assistance Window (US$7 million)

35.      The Technical Assistance (TA) component of the GeoFund will address information and capacity
barriers that retard the use of RER and geothermal energy. Assistance will be provided for:

    a) Region-wide and country specific capacity building to improve understanding of the nature of
         barriers and to find ways to remove them;

    b) Region-wide and country specific policy reviews concerning energy demand and use and
         amendments to legislation favorable to geothermal energy; and

    c) Project preparation and implementation.

36.      The GeoFund Coordination Team (GCT) will work with participating governments, NGOs,
international organizations, and project developers to identify key constraints, determine their priorities and
measures to implement improved policies, legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks. The TA window
will also help to improve geothermal databases and help disseminate knowledge and know-how regarding
geothermal energy. Not least, it will assist in identifying, preparing and implementing geothermal projects.
This may include co-financing of (pre-) feasibility work, financial due diligence and business planning. The
amount of the TA window is proposed to be US$7 million, to be potentially supplemented by TA funding
from multilateral and bilateral donors, as well as local counterpart funding. Further information is contained
in Annex 18.

Component 2: Direct Investment Funding Window (US$8 million)

37.      Direct Investment Funding (DIF) will support project developers through providing low-cost loans,
straight grants, or contingent grants where refund of a grant may be required under certain circumstances or
the disbursement will be tied to fulfillment of pre-determined milestones.

38.      Grant funds may be used solely to defray a portion of the direct investment costs associated with
geothermal drilling of production and reinjection wells and post drilling project implementation. The
GeoFund will give priority to providing grant funding for exploration drilling and well testing expense in
order to maximize the risk coverage offered to project developers at that critical juncture of project
development. After a positive drilling result, further project direct investment costs may be considered for
grant funding to the extent that the project developer is able to demonstrate that further support is critical to
enhance project economics sufficiently to allow the project to proceed to implementation.

39.      For support of up-front investment costs and risks during the exploration and drilling phase, GRI
would be a preferred instrument from the GEF resource efficiency point of view. However, in countries
where geothermal energy reservoirs have not been much exploited and reliable geological data are not
available, it would be more appropriate to use a grant facility to support experimental geothermal projects
through the DIF window. In addition, in capital scarce lower-income countries, capacity of the project
sponsors to mobilize their own resources and local public and private capital for up-front investment tends to
be more constrained than in middle income countries. Broadly, DIF would be deployed under resource-
constrained situation while GRI would be deployed under risk-constrained situation. The conditions to be
met for DIF deployment are stipulated in the GeoFund Operational Manual.

40.      The total amount for the DIF window will be US$8 million. Further information is contained in
Annex 4.

Component 3: Geological Risk Insurance Window (US$10 million)

41.      The Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) component will help to mitigate the geological risks associated
with geothermal energy exploration and operation. The GRI is designed to cover part of the drilling and
exploration cost or operational cost in the event that less than the expected level of geothermal energy is
found in the wells or a higher than expected deterioration rate of geothermal energy coming out of the well
over time. The GRI will insure project developers/investors/lenders against such geological risks which are

generally considered one of the key barriers for geothermal energy investment. GeoFund could issue both
short-term exploration geological risk insurance (EXGRI) or long-term operational geological risk insurance
(OPGRI). It is envisaged, however, that EXGRI will dominate during the Start-up phase. OPGRI will be
developed during the implementation period by learning through the experience of EXGRI and the new
product development in the market, and, if warranted, may be used in future subprojects. The GRI window
is proposed to total US$10 million. Any amount committed but not paid under the GRI will be reutilized for
subsequent GeoFund activities.

42.     A typical GRI (e.g. EXGRI) operation would work as follows (detailed description of the
instruments is in Annex 4):

    a) Geological parameters such as well head temperature and flow rate will be selected as the key
        indicators to measure success and failure of geothermal exploration.

    b) The threshold value for each parameter to define the full success, partial success/failure, total failure
        will be set. (e.g. full success above 150 degree Celsius, total failure below 80 degree Celsius, and
        partial success in between the two thresholds).

    c) GRI will not be paid in the case of full success.

    d) GRI will be paid for up to 85 percent of the eligible testing, drilling and exploration cost in the case
        of total failure defined by the lower threshold value.

    e) GRI will be paid on a prorated basis in the case of partial success/failure based on the defined
        parameter value.

    f) The beneficiaries of the GRI will pay upfront premium assessed by the GeoFund through the project
        appraisal process.

43.     GRI as compensation scheme: GRI, while it is called insurance, is essentially a compensation
scheme. Because of the uncertainty about the geological risk in individual geothermal wells, it would be
very difficult to quantify and measure the risk for individual transactions. As of today, GRI type of insurance
is not being provided by private insurance companies on a fully commercial basis. All existing geological
risk insurance schemes (e.g. those in France, Iceland, the U.S., etc.) are publicly subsidized schemes. It is
expected that as GRI operations establish a track record, risk measurement methodology will improve over
time with the development of the private insurance market. GRI operations are expected to work as an
incubator or prototype model for the development of a fully market-based instrument. Given this nature of
GRI as "market development" instrument, the GRI fee premium is designed as risk-based fee, but set at the
level which may not fully compensate the underlying risk but would encourage potential applicants to utilize
the GRI window.

44.     GRI fund flow. In each subproject, GEF Grant funds for the GRI component will remain in the GEF
Trust Fund Account until claims become payable. As shown in chart 1, GRI fees (risk premium and
processing fee) received from beneficiaries will be credited back to the GEF Trust Fund Account for further
allocation to the GeoFund sub-account. Detailed procedures are described in Annex 4.

        GRI operation and is expected to be substantially less than the maximum amount. GRI will be fully backed by the
        allocated GEF resource through the implementation period.

46.     The GeoFund will support investments in geothermal energy use for:

    a) Electricity generating projects;

    b) Fuel substitution projects in existing or possibly new district heating facilities;

    c) Geothermal energy projects for the purpose of heating of other facilities, and

    d) Any combination of (a) to (c), i.e. cascading applications.

47.     The projects under this component are based on their readiness, economic viability, available co-
financing resources, and willingness of the governments to participate in the GeoFund. Several region-wide
capacity building and policy development activities were identified during the preparatory stage. They aim to
involve experts from all ECA countries, not only from targeted clients. These activities will be implemented
under the TA window through the International Geothermal Association. (See Annex 19)

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

49.      General lessons for renewable energy projects. All countries in the ECA region have made
considerable progress in unbundling the energy market, setting up regulatory bodies, and cutting back
subsidies, but most lag behind the old EU member states in regard to the development and use of renewable
energy.

50.      In recent years, several renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency (EE) projects have been
financed by the World Bank and other international agencies. These include the Romania EE Project, the
Bulgaria EE Project, the Podhale Geothermal District Heating and Environmental Project, the Klaipeda
Geothermal Demonstration Project, the Turkey Renewable Energy Project, and the Caribbean Renewable
Energy Development Programme. Experience shows that relatively high transaction costs associated with RE
project development and financing, the unfamiliar risk profiles of energy users, and the lack of collateral
value of RE project equipment result in very cautious bank lending practices toward smaller clients. In
addition, domestic financial institutions often lack relevant experience, expertise, and capacity with regard to
project finance and lack an understanding of RE business potential and how to assess RE project risk. These
financial barriers will be addressed through the creation of a revolving risk insurance scheme based on the
experiences of the Romania and Bulgaria EE projects. The GeoFund will provide a strategic mix of risk
insurance, investment and TA instruments to move beyond individual projects to a more systematic approach
towards geothermal energy within the ECA Region.

51.      Lessons/experiences from geothermal projects. As mentioned above, the Bank and GEF have been
involved in the preparation and implementation of several geothermal district heating (DH) operations such
as Lithuania (Klaipeda); Poland (Podhale, Stargard). In some countries, these projects have been integrated
well with the mainstream of the Bank's policy dialogue with its clients, and may have contributed to the
removal of some barriers in the use of RER. Generally these small and scattered projects, however, were not
able to contribute to the removal of major barriers to RER development.

52.      The Bank and GEF have recognized that a systematic approach to developing strategies for RER in
general and for GeoE in particular, is essential. Mechanisms need to be developed to systematically support
the identification, preparation, and implementation of GeoE projects. This is even more important when
considering the typically high up-front costs and risks of geothermal energy projects, since drilling costs can
be excessive and the nature of the deposit and the reservoir might differ from expectations of exploration



                                                              11

results. Also no broad generalization of production costs is possible because of the great variability of
technical and economic parameters involved in the implementation of geothermal projects.

53.      The proposed region wide facility will provide risk insurance and investment to project developers
that otherwise would refrain from investing in this energy source. Streamlined procedures for the risk
insurance scheme and successful project implementation are expected to convince the private insurance
market, developers, the public, and decision makers of the viability of geothermal energy.

54.      Since an accelerated and wider use of geothermal resources is mainly linked to policy, legal and
regulatory conditions and to inherent constraints of the geothermal energy utilization, a region wide fund
would provide a mechanism to adequately address these issues.

55.      Lessons from district heating projects. The Bank is and has been involved in many district heating
(DH) projects throughout the ECA region, supporting them with loans and/or GEF grants. Important lessons
have been learned from these projects, as well as from dedicated DH sector studies. The results of these
studies and lessons learned are summarized in ESMAP Report 234/00 of August 2000 entitled "Increasing
Efficiency of Heating Systems in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union," as well as by
World Bank Technical Paper No.493 of March 2001 on "District Energy Trends, Issues and Opportunities."

56.      The key messages of these reports are:

         Modernized DH systems, managed in a business-like fashion, and located in densely populated areas
         (high concentration of heat loads), are well placed to provide efficient DH at highly competitive
         prices.

         Successful commercialization of DH utilities will be a prerequisite for GeoFund support in countries
         where DH utilities have been largely commercialized and systems modernized. Here geothermal heat
         utilization is an excellent energy substitute for coal or oil-fired or even gas-fired heat generation.

         DH systems are natural monopolies but have to compete against decentralized boiler systems or even
         gas-based individual household heating. Required assessments will take into account possible
         scenarios in which geothermal heat could reduce the competitiveness of DH. The GeoFund would
         not get involved under such circumstances because resulting switches to individual household
         heating could lead to increases in GHG emissions.

         In CIS countries, DH systems are still mostly old, decrepit and technically obsolete, and the tariff
         systems often do not cover costs. Rehabilitation would require large outlays of funds, which might
         not be available. Here, policy change and improved corporate governance will be instrumental to
         improve the situation and to help attract private investors. Also, cities need to move from price-based
         subsidies to socially based subsidies in order to help make systems financially viable.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

57.      During the preparation of the GeoFund, three alternatives were considered other than the standard
country-by-country GEF grant scheme: a commercial administrative agent, a new trust fund, and a GEF sub-
account.

         Commercial Administrative Agent as Grant Recipient. Originally, the GeoFund Coordination Team
         (GCT) explored the possibility of using a major commercial Bank as an Administrative Agent (AA),
         headquartered in Europe with operational networks in the participating ECA countries. In this way,
         economies of scale of account management would be assured and returns on unused funds, managed
         professionally would be maximized. Flexibility would be provided as to the use of funds in different
         countries. In case substantial projects in one country were delayed, and in another country would be
         proceeding faster than expected, the AA could easily reallocate funds, as it would manage unused
         funds in-house. This would, indeed, satisfy the critical requirements (regional and revolving) of the
         administration of the funds, and assure the most efficient use of GeoFund resources. The AA would



                                                        12

        establish and operate the accounts for the three windows including a revolving fund for the DIF and
        GRI windows. AA would disburse the fund out of three different windows upon instruction by the
        GCT, and would collect fees, debt service payments and refund of contingent grants from the project
        clients. As the AA would gain experience, more responsibilities could be delegated to it by the GCT,
        including project processing activities such as evaluation, screening, partial due diligence, and
        project supervision and monitoring.

        However, such AA scheme could lead to major legal complications, as a commercial bank- is
        typically subject to the national regulatory jurisdiction while World Bank operations are conducted
        within the framework of international laws.

        New Trust Fund. Creating a dedicated new trust fund for GeoFund at the World Bank for eligible
        recipients as governments and geothermal organizations, which would be funded by the GEF grant,
        was also considered to avoid the legal complications with an external agency. The new trust fund,
        which would be created by submitting an IBTF (Initiating Brief for a Trust Fund), could issue GRI
        insurances and disburse DIF loans and grants and T/A grants against the dedicated resource in the
        GeoFund. However, administration of individual small-size transactions of GeoFund instruments
        would not necessarily meet the capacity of the World Bank's loan and accounting department.

        GEF Sub-Account. A similar operational arrangement could be made, without creating a new trust
        fund, by making use of a GEF sub-account, which would be established for any GEF-supported
        geothermal projects to eligible recipients as governments and geothermal organizations. However,
        under the current GEF policy, GEF sub-accounts can only be used for disbursement of grants. A new
        policy which would allow the GeoFund sub-account to directly issue GRI insurance and DIF loans is
        still under consideration.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership arrangements

58.     Parallel co-financing and donor funding at the subproject level is expected from multilateral and
bilateral donors, as well as from local sources (e.g. local government contributions, local environmental
funds). The financing of individual subprojects will vary, the details of which are not available at this point,
but potential international agencies contributing to the financing of subprojects may include the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European
Investment Bank (EIB), and other IFIs and international organizations. Some of the projects will be financed
together with other national and regional institutions, for example in Russia with United Energy Systems of
Russia (RAO UES) and with the regional administration of Krasnodar. Additional bilateral and multilateral
support at the Program level could come from some countries that have already confirmed their interest in
being a partner to the GeoFund. They include Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Iceland as well as the
European Union.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements

59.     The GeoFund will be established as a program conduit at the World Bank to be fully funded by the
GEF's initial contribution of US$25 million and with participation of other donors and contributors as co-
financiers at the subproject level. The co-financiers would include project developers and investors,
commercial lenders, public sector, sponsors and donors. The GeoFund is conceived as a region-wide
program across the ECA countries, and would seek to become a true regional scheme as it will be
implemented over time. The GeoFund will be implemented in two phases. (Further information in Annex 6).

60.     The GeoFund will be launched for operation in the later part of 2006 starting with two subprojects
for Hungary and IGA, The GeoFund is expected to operate through several host government recipients,
recipient organizations (e.g. IGA) and through IFC and possibly other organizations as executing agency as
shown in the institutional arrangement (Chart 2). The World Bank will enter into a Grant Agreement (GA)


                                                        13

with each recipient and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with IFC as executing agency, and possibly
other organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme.

61.     Depending on the specific needs of subprojects, the GeoFund will provide a combination of products
available under the GeoFund's three windows to the recipients. IGA as recipient will implement a first set of
regional TA activities. IFC as executing agency of the World Bank will implement TA, DIF, and GRI for
certain subprojects which involve private clients or sub-sovereign clients. Other executing agencies and
partner institutions could participate in the GeoFund as the program develops and might attract further
partners.


                                Chart 2. GeoFund Institutional Arrangement




62.     The GeoFund institutional arrangements could evolve during implementation in response to market
demand if a feasible legal structure becomes available to support a new arrangement. It is envisaged that if it
becomes feasible for the GeoFund to operate as a region-wide fund without a country-by-country setup, the
GeoFund could adopt such new framework with attention care to policy, legal and regulatory compliance.

63.     PMUs in government agencies and also PMUs for other clients will be the principal implementers of
all country-based operations. They will be hosted at government ministries or agencies.

a) The International Finance Corporation (IFC) as Executing Agency of the GeoFund Program

64.     IFC's participation will strengthen the GCT's capacity in terms of the identification of private/sub-
sovereign sector clients and the commercial due diligence of projects.

65.     IFC could identify and develop subprojects, and propose them for GCT consideration in accordance
with the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). GCT may recommend IFC for execution of those subprojects
which GCT considers more appropriate to be handled by IFC than through the host government recipients.

66.     In addition to the MoA, the working arrangement between the Bank and IFC for the GeoFund
operations will be also governed by the "Arrangement for the Administration and Management of Funds


                                                      14

from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to be Made Available by the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development Acting as and Implementing Agency of the GEF to the International
Finance Corporation" dated May 31, 1996 (the Arrangement). Pursuant to the Arrangement, those
subprojects which will be assigned to IFC will be administered in accordance with its guidelines and
procedures for financial management, contract implementation, safeguards, etc. IFC has executed many
GEF-supported projects under the Arrangement, and its capacity as Executing Agency for the GeoFund
operations is considered satisfactory in all respects.

b) The International Geothermal Association (IGA)

67.     IGA as a recipient will be primarily responsible for the execution of region-wide TA activities under
the capacity building component. The reasons for the cooperation with IGA are its profound knowledge
about the specific characteristics of geothermal energy and its worldwide operations. It has more than 2000
members in 65 countries, a special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations, and is a Partner of the European Union for the Campaign for Take Off (CTO) Renewable Energy.
Even though it does not have extensive experience in project implementation, it was found to be the only
available organization capable of working on a regional basis. Further information on IGA is provided in
Annex 19.

68.     IGA will contract to national geothermal associations and other institutions for the organization of
training courses, seminars and other events. The work program of IGA's region-wide TA activities will be
prepared jointly by IGA and GCT and periodically reviewed in accordance with the Grant Agreement (GA)
between IGA and the Bank.

69.     During implementation, the GeoFund may expand its partnership with other organizations.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

70.     Monitoring of project activities and evaluation of their results in the GeoFund Program will serve a
dual function. First, it will track progress toward the Project objectives. Second, it will facilitate learning and
generation of knowledge necessary for the preparation of follow-on projects and the further implementation
of the Program.

71.     Each subproject will have its own monitoring indicators, benchmarks, and monitoring plans to
confirm actual amounts of carbon reduction achieved, as measured against a project-specific baseline. This is
very important globally in that cost-effectiveness indicators (US$/CO2 removed) will be established through
the GeoFund for different project types and situations, which will be used in possible future applications by
GEF and by the international community as non-recipient countries enhance their actions to reduce carbon
emissions. Detailed key indicators for subprojects, including performance indicators, as well as monitoring
plans and institutional arrangements for the collection and evaluation of outcome indicators will be addressed
in specific project documents.

72.     Institutional and data collection arrangements at the subproject level will be determined for each
individual project, with reporting responsibility resting on the project sponsor. Monitoring and evaluation of
the outcome indicators of the GeoFund will be the responsibility of the GCT. Sources of data collection will
be reports by subproject sponsors, government offices, national geo-information offices as well as surveys
and interviews conducted with representatives of utilities, the financial sector, etc. These reports will be
expected to be received from project management annually and will cover progress of project
implementation, updated cost and financing plans, financial statements of the project developer and financial
management reports, updated procurement plans, environmental compliance reports, as well as operational
performance reports of the project once started up: physical inputs and outputs, costs of inputs and outputs,
reductions of emissions of local and global pollutants, measured against the baseline.

73.     The beneficiary is responsible for monitoring and controlling the drilling execution, the testing and
the operations of the geothermal wells and plant facilities. All parameters, which are covered under the GRI,



                                                        15

will also be monitored by independent consultants. Monitoring equipment needs to be part of the scope of
investments. The monitoring results will be provided in regular reports, readily accessible to the GCT.

74.     Monitoring indicators are described in section B.2 and Annex 3.

4. Sustainability and Replicability

75.     The GeoFund is designed to demonstrate how financing modalities, such as contingent financing,
incremental risk financing, and the development of public-private partnerships can help develop geothermal
resources for replication throughout the ECA Region.

76.     Replication of geothermal projects is expected because:

     a) Removal of barriers towards use of RER/geothermal energy should expand in participating client
         countries;

     b) Knowledge should improve as the data base on the potential of geothermal energy expands in a
         participating country; and

     c) The understanding of geothermal technology, project preparation and implementation deepens.

77.     Exit Strategy. The exit strategy for any remaining funds will be defined after completion of the start-
up phase of the GeoFund Program based on the following options:

        The remaining balance will be granted to an established regional or global organization, which is
        acceptable to GEF and the Bank, and which would use the funds for geothermal project preparation
        and implementation;

        The remaining balance will be granted to a country with promising geothermal investments; or

        Would be returned to GEF.

5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

78.     The development and operation of the GRI window is the core of the GeoFund. The establishment
and operation of a geothermal risk insurance scheme poses certain risks. These risks relate primarily to the
successful introduction and market acceptance of the instrument, which is expected to be mitigated by market
research and careful design. Additional risks may arise from unwillingness to enact legislative amendments
in recipient countries. The main risks of the Program with mitigation measures are summarized in the table
below:

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

80.       Economic Analysis. "Traditional financial analysis undervalues future fuel price risks and
completely ignores the environmental and health costs of fossil-fueled power plant emissions. As a result, the
current utilization of modern renewable energy (excluding traditional biomass use) in most countries is quite
small. Yet, on a life-cycle cost basis, some renewable energy technologies are already cost competitive with
conventional energy sources. However, the potential of these financially viable renewable energy
technologies is not fully realized because of a variety of "market barriers."




                                                                   17

81.      As shown in Figure 1, if the cost of local environmental externalities and global externalities (e.g.
through "carbon credits") are included in the economic valuation as is done in a typical WBG economic
calculation, the economically viable quantity of renewable energy increases. If the diversification value is
also added to the economic cost, the economically viable optimum quantity of renewable energy becomes
even larger.

82.      Given the market distortion that environmental externalities and diversification values are not
recognized in the market place as well as a series of market barriers, financial incentives are required to
attract investors to achieve the economically viable optimum quantity of renewable energy."5

83.      Economic analysis of each subproject will provide the primary basis for selection of projects.
Primary geothermal project outputs will typically include heat supply for DH systems and/or electricity
supplied to the grid. Economic benefits will include the avoided cost of baseline supplies of the same outputs
as well as quantified values for reductions of CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM10 emissions compared to baseline
supplies. Baselines will be identified through determination of least-cost supplies with appropriate
consideration of both operating margins and build margins. Projects selected for GeoFund support will be
limited to those that demonstrate positive net economic benefits on this basis.

84.      Proper quantification of environmental benefits can be difficult and subject to controversy. To
provide a consistent basis for project selection and to expedite project evaluations, the GeoFund will
establish standard estimates and methods for evaluation of these benefits that reasonably reflect established

values that are currently being used. Countries will be free to establish their own methodologies and
estimates or to use the default approach provided by the GeoFund. If independent estimates are used, the
supporting data and methodology will be subject to review and approval by the GeoFund as part of the
evaluation of the project application. A common set of values and methods must be used for all projects
within a given country.

85.      The GeoFund Program will not have a detailed economic analysis ex ante. However, a pro-forma
economic model of a geothermal project will be developed to illustrate the interplay of local and global
environmental benefits with traditional economic benefits. This model will also provide the justification for
GEF support in terms of barrier removal and global benefits from reduced CO2 emissions at a specified
incremental cost. The anticipated leveraging ratio of 1:8 suggests that incremental costs on the order of
US$4.00 per metric ton of CO2 are likely for the GeoFund project portfolio. As the loan and insurance
facilities will revolve and are expected to insure/finance many more projects until depleted, the cost
effectiveness will multiply over time.

86.      All subprojects will be screened according to the criteria set out in WB BP 10.04 - Economic
Evaluation of Investment Operations and the corresponding WB Handbook on Economic Analysis of
Investment Operations. Details of the economic justification for individual subprojects according to GEF
criteria are contained in Annex 9 and in the GeoFund Operational Manual.

87.      Financial Analysis. In order to gauge the market potential for geothermal projects that can be
supported by the GeoFund in the early years, a preliminary market assessment was carried out and an
indicative project portfolio was developed based on technical and financial feasibility evaluation.

88.      The viability of the above projects and other geothermal investment opportunities that will be
identified on a rolling basis during implementation hinges on the success of drilling geothermal wells. Once
the required quality of the resource is proven, geothermal investments in most cases offer internal rates of
return that are sufficient for commercial project financing, in particular when external but inherent economic
benefits can be monetized through provision of an equivalent amount of grant or low cost loan funding.
Based on the assumption of successful drilling outcomes the pipeline shows favorable economic
characteristics.

89.      The key factor determining profitability prospects are the parameters of the underlying power
purchase agreements. The actual purchase price for geothermal energy will normally be linked to the market
index for the fossil fuels that are being replaced, i.e., the higher the cost for the conventional energy sources
that serve as a market reference, the more profitable the geothermal investment will become. Also other tariff
schemes where preferential purchase is obligatory and has a premium attached to it influence the financial
viability of the project.

90.      All projects will be financed with private equity, GEF funds, commercial loans and contributions
from international, bilateral and/or local sources. Financial due diligence for the demonstration projects will
include, among other requirements, creditworthiness of the developer (including track record); business plan
(technical and financial pro forma); permitting and licensing, including status of privileged producer; heat-
and/or power sales contract, rules of operation in the market.

91.      Fiscal Impact. The Program will have little or no fiscal impact for recipient governments as there is
no or only minimal borrowing by the governments and the investment projects are financed mainly on a
commercial basis. Taxation may be applied as royalties on the resource, calculated on the basis of the heat
content of the exploited geothermal water. The tax system in each country is different and may be applied to
one or more of the above factors. It is therefore impossible to assess the generic effect of the taxation system
on the prices. Nevertheless it is advisable to calculate the tax effect under some typical conditions, and
analyze what effects a taxation system has on the final price of energy and competitiveness of the geothermal
source.




                                                          19

92.       More important than the tax issues in the proposed projects will be the tariff rates for heat and
electricity. In many existing DH systems in the ECA region the tariffs paid by customers barely cover
operating costs and leave little room for even needed investments in renewal and modernization. In projects,
which are not financially viable even after monetization of external benefits because of inadequate levels of
tariffs, the GeoFund will not be able to participate.

2. Technical

93.       The GCT has prepared an Operational Manual (OM) for the TA, DIF and GRI Program components,
which spells out the technical, procurement, Financial Management (FM), M&E, and Safeguard
requirements of the Program as well as the institutional arrangements. (See Annexes 7, 8, 10)

94.       Subprojects will be assessed as to their technical soundness and use of appropriate geothermal
technology as part of the due diligence procedure. This assessment will in particular review geological
information provided and analyses carried out to establish with reasonable certainty the existence of a
suitable geothermal resource and its accessibility, and re-injectivity into the geothermal reservoir; it will also
review and assess the technical know-how and expertise of the project developer and might call for training
and technical assistance.

3. Fiduciary

95.       The financial management assessment for IGA and the MOL has been undertaken, as part of due
diligence procedure, in accordance with the requirements of OP 10.02. For other grant recipients and
implementing agencies (excluding IFC as executing agency) or promoting company, the financial assessment
will include the financial performance and likely sustainability, the financial management systems and
capabilities and potentially needed upgrading and technical capability, track record in project development
and project operation. The assessment will also review auditing arrangements.

96.       For each subproject, the Bank will require the recipient to maintain financial management
arrangements that are acceptable to the Bank and that, as part of the overall arrangements that the recipient
has in place for implementing the operation, provide reasonable assurance that the proceeds of the grants are
used for the purposes for which the grant was granted. Acceptable internal controls should be available prior
to flow of funds. On this basis, appropriate financial management arrangements will be designed and in place
for each according to agreed procedures.

4. Social

97.       Changes in heat price may cause social impacts in the individual subprojects. One important goal of
the Program is to increase the competitiveness of geothermal energy. The terms of the DIF component of the
support scheme for individual DH subprojects will be established on the basis of the financing needs of the
project, which, in turn, is largely determined by the ability of customers to pay for the service. This ability to
pay will be established based on a reasonable percentage of income.

98.       Secondary social impacts in the form of improved local environment are also expected. Appropriate
stakeholder participation in project preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation is ensured
through the application of World Bank guidelines for consultation and disclosure.

5. Environment

99.       A key feature of the Program is the promotion of amendments to policy, regulatory and institutional
frameworks that improve the competitiveness of geothermal energy. This is expected to contribute to
environmentally sustainable growth and resource management. Through endorsing project activities, client
countries subscribe to integrate such amendments into their relevant sector reforms to enhance the Program's
environmental benefits.

100.      The Program will facilitate improved and transparent management of natural resources through
increased use of clean and renewable geothermal energy (and the decreased use of the polluting and


                                                        20

depleting fossil fuels). It will directly reduce vulnerability of the poor to global environmental change
through the reduction of CO2. Furthermore, the Program will protect people's health from pollution by
reducing the emissions of such local pollutants as NOx, SO2 and PM10.

101.    Monitoring of the above environmental benefits will be achieved through the monitoring of the
associated parameters: reductions in the emissions of CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM10.

102.    In case of low enthalpy geothermal projects (up to 100 degrees C), providing for heat and other
direct use, potential environmental issues could be the handling and disposal of drilling mud, of geothermal
brines, as well as noise generation during project implementation and very little during operations. These
environmental impacts are typically limited and can be handled by appropriate management actions. Thus the
projects are typically classified as Category B projects under World Bank guidelines.

103.    An estimated 20 percent of the expected projects might be medium to high enthalpy projects with
temperatures well above 100 degrees C. In those cases there may be environmental issues relating to the
emission of gases, impact from sudden steam bursts during drilling, etc. Moreover, these projects are
typically larger, and have a more significant impact on the environment. Such projects might be designated
Category A with due diligence on all the safeguard policy matters applicable to them.

6. Safeguard Policies

   Safeguard Policies Triggered by the Program                                                Yes                      No

104.    The environmental screening category will be FI. Subprojects will have to follow the environmental
safeguards and will require each subproject to comply with the World Bank's or IFC's safeguard policies.
Each subproject will be individually assigned environmental screening categories. All subprojects will be
screened for environmental purposes in accordance with the Bank's safeguard policy on Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01).

105.    Safeguard policy compliance assessment of subprojects will involve an environmental assessment of
the proposed project with all its implications. This assessment will review the project sponsor's capacity to
implement the safeguard policies recommendations and, if the capacity is insufficient, propose measures to
bring this capacity to the required level. Thus, for every subproject an Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet
(ISDS) will be prepared by the project sponsor and will be reviewed in the Bank.

106.    Responsibility for the supervision of the proper execution of subprojects will be with the Bank. The
Bank requires that each proposed subproject is screened and ensures that recipients carry out an appropriate
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for each subproject. Before approving a subproject, the Bank will
verify that the subproject meets the environmental requirements of appropriate national and local authorities
and is consistent with the safeguard policies of the Bank.



*By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the
 disputed areas.

                               Annex 1: Country and Sector Program Background

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                    (GEOFUND)
A.       HUNGARY

1.       Energy Sector ­ Legal Framework, Policies and Issues. Hungary has targeted an increase in the
share of primary energy utilization of renewables to 5-6 percent from the present level of 3.4 percent by
2010. The Hungarian energy policy also includes provisions for the promotion of European Union priorities
such as security of supply, energy efficiency, economic efficiency, serving national interests, environmental
protection, etc. The CX/2001 Electricity Act requires mandatory purchase of renewable electricity, provided
that the facility's installed capacity is greater than 0.1 MW, the technical conditions of uptake are met and
the price does not exceed the respective price as set by the relevant decree. The law also calls for a system of
green certificates, but delays are expected in the launch of this market for several years until the EU or
international markets for green certificates become operational. The 56/2002 Decree of the Ministry of
Economy on the purchase obligation of renewable electricity (regularly revised) further elaborates on the
regulations for purchasing renewable electricity and sets preferential prices (currently about 11 US$
cents/kWh6).

2.       A separate RE law is currently being prepared. This law envisages decentralized support and
promotion of local use, as well as state guarantee for loans to set up RE enterprises.

3.       Renewable Energy Resources (RER). In addition to biomass, hydro, wind and geothermal energy
have potential in Hungary, with increases forecasted in the use of wind and geothermal energy in the medium
term. The use of geothermal energy is already on a more developed level. In the long term the direct use of
solar energy also has significant potential, but rapid expansion to the mass market is not anticipated due to
technical and economic limitations. The most significant source of renewable energy is biomass, including
not only traditional forests, but also energy plantations specially developed for this purpose.

4.       District Heating (DH) Sector. In 2005, there were 240 DH plants operating in 97 cities and towns
in the country, providing heat for nearly 650,000 homes. This constitutes 16 percent of the 4 million homes
in total. Total DH peak demand equals 6500 MW, while total installed boiler capacity is 12,200 MW.

5.       The tariff for district heat is set by the DH plant, but the respective DH plant observes the relevant
act that sets a tariff ceiling. The XVIII/1998 District Heating Act stipulates that the tariff shall a) promote
safe and lowest cost heat and efficient use of capacities and b) include reserves for the costs of reserve
capacities and for the expenses of eventual decommissioning and environmental remediation (for geothermal
resources, in particular).

6.       Geothermal Energy. Hungary is unique in that is possesses both high-enthalpy and low-enthalpy
resources with temperatures ranging from 10 C to 254 C. The Pannonian Basin is one of the hot spots due to
a thin crust with the geothermal gradient reaching as high as 58.8 C/km in some areas. Use of geothermal
energy in Hungary is predominantly for balneological purposes, including a large portion of space heating
and hothouse agriculture. No reinjection is practiced anywhere at this time. Hungary uses geothermal water
for 61 medicinal baths, 350 public baths, and 1,200 swimming pools. Agriculture has an installed capacity of
120.43 MWt; district heating, sanitary hot water, and industrial applications 58.7 MWt; and bathing and
balneology 187.3 MWt for a total of 366.5 MWt.




B.       ARMENIA


6         November 2005.


                                                         23

7.       Energy Sector ­ Legal Framework, Policies and Issues. The State Energy Policy of Armenia
considers priority development of own renewable sources of energy as one of the main conditions to ensure
energy security and sustainable development of Armenia's energy sector.

8.       The legal framework guarantees purchase of electricity produced for all small renewable power
plants and provides payment assurance. The regulatory commission has set attractive tariffs for newly
constructed run-of the river small hydropower (USc 4.5/kwh), and wind and biomass plants (USc 7.0/kwh)
for 15 years.

9.       Renewable Energy Resources (RER). Armenia has significant renewable energy resources, but
they play a limited role in the country's energy supply. Approximately 740 MW of small hydropower, wind
and geothermal resources have been identified, which, if implemented, would represent approximately 25
percent of the present installed capacity. Hydropower and some of the wind resources are estimated to be
most attractive. There is also interest with respect to biogas generation from farm-based anaerobic digesters
as well as from landfills.

10.      Due to the favorable legal and regulatory framework around 35 project developers have recently
obtained construction licenses for the hydropower plans. However, a number of financial, legal/regulatory,
institutional and informational barriers impede large scale private investments in the development of
renewable resources.

11.      Geothermal Energy. Though Armenia is located in a zone of high tectonic activity and recent
volcanism, its geothermal resources are largely unexplored. At present they only provide low-to-medium
temperature thermal water. Further exploration may reveal high enthalpy resources suitable for electricity
generation.

12.      The Jermakphur area has been identified as suitable for electricity generation with a geothermal
power plant envisaged to have a capacity of 25 MW with a maximum annual output of approximately 200
GWh of sales power. Development technology comprises underground development in doublet configuration
and the establishment of a surface geothermal power plant comprising steam field and power generation.

13.      The Government of Armenia is committed to the development of renewable resources, particularly
geothermal energy as evidenced by the establishment of a supportive legal/regulatory framework. Further the
Ministry of Energy through its own resources has carried out geophysical and geochemical investigations in
the Jermakphur area.

14.      To advance development of geothermal resources in Armenia it is necessary to carry out careful
analysis of available geological and geothermal data including the results of hydrodynamic investigations
and testing of geothermal reservoirs in existing wells to reveal prospective areas.

Identification of Areas/Projects with High Potential for Geothermal Energy

15.      The only definite opportunity for geothermal development in Armenia lies in the creation of state-of-
the art heat supply systems with heat pumps. Any electricity production projects need high cost
investigations with additional exploration drilling.

Barriers/Incentives for Geothermal Energy

16.      Specific incentives for the implementation of geothermal projects in Armenia include:

17.      The shortage of fuel-power resources in Armenia results in the necessity to import large volumes of
expensive natural gas. Development of geothermal resources would preserve capital in the country.

18.      Specific barriers to the implementation of geothermal projects in Armenia include:

           Need for high cost investigations to discover high temperature reservoirs




                                                        24

           Tariffs for geothermal power are set based on a cost-plus approach complicating cash flow
           projections for investors.

C.       RUSSIA

19.      Energy Sector ­ Legal Framework, Policies and Issues. Despite restructuring efforts underway to
privatize the industry, the energy sector faces many of the same challenges as other eastern European
countries, including uneconomic tariff structures, non-payment, and aging electric systems.

20.      In 2001, a phased restructuring program was enacted to facilitate the liberalization of the electricity
sector through 2009. Under this plan, generating companies will be divested into separate, independent
entities.

21.      Russia is the fourth largest generator of electricity, behind the US, China, and Japan. Throughout the
1990's the consumption and generation of electricity fell dramatically. In fact, the total generation is not
expected to reach 1990 levels until 2010. The decrease in production can bee attributed to a number of
factors, including decreased demand through economic downturns, plants being retired, and customers being
disconnected from the system for non-payment.

22.      The Russian government approved the country's energy strategy to 2020 in September 2003. At the
same time, the energy sector ownership remains concentrated and heavily regulated. The present state of
regulation and insufficient steps toward restructuring have resulted in underinvestment in this sector. A
competitive market structure would facilitate more efficient energy costs, which in turn would help
accelerate creation of new industrial enterprises.

23.      The Main Provisions of the Russian Energy Strategy places relatively little emphasis on
environmental issues. Only a short section focuses on the development of technologies and the technical
means for the stable long-term development of energy resources, ensuring ecological and technological
safety of energy production and use. A Federal Law on Renewable Energy Sources has not been adopted yet.

24.      Renewable Energy Resources (RER). With the exception of hydropower, Russia's utilization of
renewable energy sources remains low relative to its consumption of fossil fuels. Almost 75 percent of
Russia's hydroelectric capacity is located at 11 power stations. The Kamchatka Peninsula in the Far East has
rich geothermal resources.

25.      District Heating (DH) sector. Combined electricity and heat generation (cogeneration) is among the
most technologically clear, industrially mastered and commercially efficient ways of cutting down the
consumption of fossil fuels and of reducing the environmental impact involved. In Russia is plenty of
experience available in this field. Cogeneration-based centralized heat supply for municipal consumers dated
back to 1925 in St. Petersburg and to 1928 in Moscow for the delivery of steam to industrial facilities and for
residential heating.

26.      The current challenge is to revitalize the DH and co-generation local energy systems through
modernization, good tariff structure and use of renewable energies.

27.      Geothermal Energy. In Russia there is a good level of information available on geothermal
resources. Geothermal energy development targets are envisaged by the National Program on Renewable
Energy Sources Development. It estimates a geothermal potential for electricity generation with more than
3000 MW, a gross (theoretical) potential of 400 MW, and a technical potential (with proven resources) of
300 MW by 2005.

28.      At present the geothermal energy is used in Russian Federation both for heat supply and electricity
production. High enthalpy geothermal locations are Kamchatka Peninsula (steam- water fields), Kuril Islands
(steam- water fields), and Northern Caucasus (hot geothermal brines). Electricity production is carried out at
two operating geothermal power plants located at Kamchatka Peninsula.

29.      Specific incentives for the implementation of geothermal projects in Russia include:


                                                        25

                  High prices for imported mazute (fuel oil) used at thermal power plants of Kamchatka and
                  Kuril Islands and correspondingly high tariffs for electricity.

                  Shortage of basic power in Eastern part of Northern Caucasia, where the large thermal power
                  plants are absent.

                  Considerable proven resources of geothermal energy including with already drilled wells.

30.      Specific barriers to the implementation of geothermal projects in Russia include:

                  Insufficient legal support at the level of Federal laws. In Russia the federal laws make no
                  reference to geothermal energy.

                  High investment risks because of low electricity and DH prices.

                  Low tariffs for electricity in European part of the country.

D.       TURKEY

31.      Energy Sector ­ Legal Framework, Policies and Issues. Turkey's 67 million people are
significantly increasing their levels of energy consumption, which are currently far below the OECD
average. At present, the country imports 90 percent of its oil and is very dependent on Russia for its natural
gas.

32.      Liberalization has been leading to a gradual opening of the Turkish energy market. Turkey has made
early use of financing models such as build-own-operate (BOO) and build-own-transfer (BOT).

33.      In 2001 the Government of Turkey approved the Electricity Market Law and established the Energy
Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA). In the scope of the "Turkish Electricity Market Law", electricity
production from renewable energy resources is encouraged. It contains two regulations pertaining to the
promotion of the use of renewable energy: The legal entities applying for licenses for construction of
renewable energy facilities are required to pay only 1 percent of the total license fee. Also renewables based
generation facilities are exempt from paying the annual license fees for the first eight years following the
facility completion date as specified in the license.

34.      The Turkish Electricity Transmission Company (TEIAS) and/or distribution companies are required
to give priority status for systems connection of generating facilities based on renewables.

In 2004, the High Planning Council approved the Electricity Sector Reform Strategy to renew the reform
process. According to the 8th Five Year Development Programme", the 2005 target for electricity production
from renewable energy resources is as follows: 643 MW installed capacity from wind energy; 40 MW
installed capacity from geothermal energy; and 10 MW installed capacity from biogas-waste. It is a main
target of the government that wind power should account for 2 per cent of total installed capacity. In May
2005 Turkey adopted a new feed-in law for renewables and a new Development Program is currently under
preparation.

35.      In Turkey electricity production from renewable energy resources is encouraged. The "Turkish
Electricity Market Law" contains two regulations pertaining to the promotion of the use of RE: The legal
entities applying for licenses for construction of RE facilities are required to pay only 1 percent of the total
license fee. Also renewables based generation facilities are exempt from paying the annual license fees for
the first eight years following the facility completion date as specified in the license..

36.      Renewable Energy Resources (RER). Non-fossil energy sources have a high share of energy
supply in Turkey. Hydroelectric power already accounts for about 40 percent of electricity demand. Turkey's
rapid growth in hydroelectric production in the water-starved Middle East has provoked disputes with
neighboring countries. In addition to hydroelectric power, Turkey is encouraging the construction of wind
power plants. The first facility was commissioned in December 1998, and the country has a goal of deriving
2 percent of its electricity from wind power.


                                                         26

37.      Turkey has extended its involvement in geothermal energy projects, supported by loans from the
Ministry of Environment, and geothermal energy is expected to increase substantially in coming years.
Overall, Turkey has an estimated 4,500 MW of geothermal power production potential. Current Turkish
geothermal generating capacity is 820 MW. Solar energy also could provide significant amount of power for
Turkey, given the country's suitability in terms of solar radiation. Currently, solar power is used mainly for
domestic hot water production. Additionally, Turkey needs to create a level playing field for renewables by
allowing prices of conventional fuels to rise to market levels. This would help diversify and increase the use
of alternative energies as sources for transport, such as natural gas-operated municipal buses and electricity-
operated railway systems.

38.      Geothermal District Heating (DH) Sector. Turkey is the seventh richest country in the world in
geothermal potential. Engineering design for nearly 300,000 residences equivalence of geothermal DH has
been completed. Geothermal DH systems are the main geothermal utilization in Turkey. The DH systems
applications were started with large-scale, city-based geothermal DH systems in Turkey; whereas, the GDH
center and distribution networks have been designed according to the geothermal DH systems parameters.
This constitutes an important advantage of geothermal DH systems investments in Turkey in terms of the
technical and economical aspects. An annually average of 23 percent growth of residence connection to
GDHS has been achieved since 1983 in Turkey.

39.      The main units of geothermal DH systems are geothermal water production, reinjection, heat
exchangers, piping system and pumps. By using the new approaches in determining the heat load instead of
classical methods, the initial investment cost has generally been reduced. Fifteen years of experience showed
that real heat loads were approximately three times lower than the heat loads evaluated by theoretical
methods.

40.      Geothermal Energy. Turkey is located on the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, which has high
geothermal potential. 170 geothermal fields have been discovered by MTA (General Directorate of Mineral
Research and Exploration, a Governmental Establishment of Turkey), where 95 percent of them are low-
medium enthalpy fields, which are suitable mostly for direct use applications (heating of cities, residences,
thermal facilities and greenhouses, balneological utilization). Around 1200 hot and mineralized natural
springs and 500 geothermal wells exist in Turkey.

41.      The probable geothermal heat potential of Turkey is estimated as 31.500 MWt (equal to 5 million
residences7 heating). Based on current consumer requirements about 1.25 million residences equivalence
could possibly be heated geothermally in Turkey. However, currently only 65,000 residences are heated
geothermally.

42.      Most of the development is achieved in geothermal direct-use applications by 1077 MWt. 750 MWt
(which equals to the heat requirement of 65000 residences equivalence) of this potential is being utilized for
geothermal heating including district heating, thermal tourism facilities heating and 565,000 m2 geothermal
greenhouses heating. The remaining potential of 327 MWt of this potential is being utilized for balneological
purposes (There exist 195 thermal facilities (Balneology) in Turkey).

43.      By summing up all these geothermal utilizations, the geothermal installed capacity is 1077 MWt for
direct-use and 20.4 MWe for electricity production in Turkey. Moreover, a liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice
production factory (120.000 tons/year) is integrated to this electricity production power plant.




7One residence equivalence is assumed to be 100 m2 floor area.

1.       Results framework. Each subproject that will lead to actual investments will have its own
monitoring indicators, benchmarks, and monitoring plans to confirm actual carbon reduction achieved, as
measured against a project-specific baseline. This is very important globally in that cost-effectiveness
indicators (US$/CO2 removed) will be established through the GeoFund for different project types and
situations, which will be used in possible future applications by GEF and by the international community as
non-recipient countries enhance their actions to reduce carbon emissions.

2.       The institution/company that is implementing a subproject, will prepare a set of monitoring
indicators (physical/technical, operational, financial and environmental), including the key indicators which
will be monitored and reported upon on a quarterly basis in the context of the Project Management Reports.
A list of monitoring indicators, acceptable to the Bank, will be submitted to the Bank by the Recipient at
negotiations. The final commitment to the monitoring indicators selected (including numerical targets as
appropriate) will be made at the signing of the legal agreements by attaching an appropriate supplemental
letter.

3.       Additional indicators describing further impacts and benefits will be developed during appraisal to
evaluate other development contributions (industrial, local manufacture, employment, and other social
benefits). Their specific values will be further defined during project preparation. The following section deals
with the monitoring of outcome indicators of the GeoFund.

4.        Arrangements for results monitoring. Institutional and data collection arrangements at the
subproject level will be determined for each individual project, with reporting responsibility resting on the
project sponsor. The beneficiary is responsible for monitoring and controlling the drilling execution, the
testing and the operations of the geothermal wells and plant facilities. All parameters, which are covered
under the GRI, will be monitored also by independent consultants. Monitoring equipment needs to be part of
the scope of investments. The monitoring results will be provided in regular reports, readily accessible to the
GCT.

5.        Monitoring and evaluation of the outcome indicators of the GeoFund will be the responsibility of the
GCT. Sources of data collection will be reports by subproject sponsors, government offices, national geo-
information offices as well as surveys and interviews conducted with representatives of utilities, the financial
sector, etc. These reports will be expected to be received from project developers annually and will cover
progress of project implementation, updated cost and financing plans, financial statements of the project
sponsors and financial management reports, updated procurement plans, environmental compliance reports,
as well as operational performance reports of the project once started up: physical inputs and outputs, costs
of inputs and outputs, reductions of emissions of local and global pollutants, measured against the baseline.

power plant (Armenia), and the project in Hungary. CO2eq reductions from these three projects are
envisaged as follows:

           Hungary project: the annual reductions are estimated at 20,000 ton of CO2 reduction or 0.6
           million tons over the life of the project;

           Verhne-Mutnovsky project: the annual reductions are estimated at 40,000 tons of CO2 or 1.2
           million tons over the life of the project;

           Jermakhpur project: the annual reductions are 120,000 ton of CO2 reduction or 3.6 million tons
           over the life of the project.

7.     The three projects could generate some 5.4 million tons of CO2 reduction.

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                  (GEOFUND)
A. Overview

1.       The Program follows a strategic approach in providing assistance to barrier removal, provides
geological risk insurances, financial support and technical assistance in project preparation and
implementation to project developers in client countries to ultimately facilitate the implementation of
individual geothermal projects. The Program will be an umbrella for many geothermal subprojects in
participating ECA countries and will involve the provision of:

         1. Technical assistance for the following purposes:

             Capacity building to improve understanding of barriers and their means of mitigation. The
             availability of geothermal resources, modes of occurrence, and methods of utilization will be
             assessed and comprehensive geothermal data bases will be established. Thus, the existence of
             geothermal resources in the participating ECA countries will be confirmed or demonstrated. This
             task will be completed primarily by local geological institutions or associations, with technical
             assistance support by the Project. Development of use of RER, including GeoE, will be
             monitored. Local capacities to develop and implement geothermal energy projects will be
             strengthened.

             Policy reviews concerning energy demand and use and amendments to legislation preferential to
             geothermal energy. Energy sector policies and legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks in
             participating ECA countries will be systematically reviewed to identify key barriers towards the
             use of RER. Policy reforms and framework improvements, which would reduce the bias in favor
             of fossil fuels, will be developed.

             TA support for project preparation and implementation. Feasible geothermal projects will be
             supported with technical assistance and capacity building, assisting project developers to
             prepare, implement and operate their investments.

         2. Financial assistance supporting project developers through providing:

             Low cost loans;

             Contingent and non-contingent grants, and

             Facilitation of access to additional commercial financing on reasonable terms through the
             provision of geological risk insurances for the geological risks of the investment.

2.       The World Bank will set up the Geothermal Energy Development Program (GeoFund). The
GeoFund is designed to respond to medium-/ long-term market conditions existing in the participating
countries. The paramount objective of the GeoFund is to build sustained market capacity to develop and
finance geothermal projects on commercial terms using private capital. Funding of the tasks above will be
through the three principal instruments of the GeoFund, as discussed below.

B. Technical Assistance Window

3.       The Technical Assistance (TA) Window of the GeoFund will address in the first place barriers that
retard the use of RER and geothermal energy. It will work with participating government agencies to identify
the barriers, identify their solution and devise means to implement improved policies, legal, regulatory and
institutional frameworks. Participating countries would carry out the identification of barriers, and delineate
ways of addressing them. The TA Window will also help set up geothermal databases, and will identify and
prepare/implement geothermal projects. The amount of the TA Window is proposed to be US$7 million. As
countries that recently joined the EU are already fairly advanced in the lowering or removal of barriers, TA

would focus more on the "countries further east". For a discussion of four categories of countries, with
increasing need of TA funding, see the discussion of the Investment Funding Window below.

4.       Three major types of TA will be distinguished:

         Region-wide TA: technical assistance for region wide activities, such as review and assessment of
         geothermal resources, modes of occurrence, and methods of utilization, training of local experts in
         preparation and implementation of geothermal energy projects; transfer of know-how through
         establishing a roster of international geothermal experts and implementation of targeted international
         studies; support to organization of conferences and workshops; dissemination of information through
         support to the creation of knowledge resource centers and publications (approximately, 40 percent
         of funding resources);

         Country-specific TA: energy sector policies, technical assistance for legal/regulatory/institutional
         barrier removal and technical assistance for setting up geothermal data bases and information
         systems (approximately, 25 percent of funding resources); and

         Project-specific TA: technical assistance for project preparation and implementation (approximately,
         35 percent of funding resources).

5.       The TA fund is likely to be supplemented by TA funds from multilateral and bilateral sources, as
well as by support from client countries. The GeoFund Coordination Team (GCT) has identified about 40
projects in different countries. With a few exceptions all are in need of TA for project preparation. This led
to a higher demand for TA during the Start-Up Phase of the GeoFund than was anticipated at the time of the
Project Brief preparation. It was, therefore, suggested by the GCT to increase the allocation of the TA from
US$5 million to 7 million.

C. Direct Investment Funding Window

6.       The Direct Investment Funding (DIF) Window will provide contingent grants, low-cost loans or, in
limited cases, grant financing, thereby covering part of the project cost through monetization of external
benefits. The total amount for the DIF Window will be US$8 million. Grant funds may be used solely to
defray a portion of the direct investment costs associated with geothermal drilling of production and
reinjection wells and post drilling project implementation. The GeoFund will give priority to providing grant
funding for exploration drilling and well testing expense in order to maximize the risk coverage offered to
project developers at that critical juncture of project development. After a positive drilling result, further
project direct investment costs may be considered for grant funding to the extent that the project developer is
able to argue persuasively that further support is critical to enhance project economics sufficiently to allow
the project to proceed to implementation.

7.       The grants and contingent grants would be particularly important where, due to distortions in the
energy and financial markets, only demonstration projects could be implemented to help highlight the
substantial benefits of geothermal energy development. The funds of the DIF Window are considered to
compensate project developers for the substantial externalities of geothermal projects by monetizing the
associated benefits. However, it would be expected that the predominant form of DIF instruments would be a
straight grant, at least during the first Start ­up Phase of the GeoFund, mainly from the point of view of
administrative efficiency. Appropriate size of straight grant and applicable conditions for contingent grants
for individual subproject will be determined at the subproject level based on the assessment of desirable
economic and financial impact to the project.

8.       Indicative Terms of DIF Support. It is envisaged that grant financing will be provided only in limited
cases and on the basis of an assessment of factors influencing renewable investments as legislative and
institutional support, the performance of the banking sector and the availability of investment capital across
the region. In addition the required DIF support would be determined for each subproject in consideration of
the required revenue stream necessary for servicing its debt. In the case of DH projects, where heat sales



                                                         35

constitute this revenue, in most countries of the region the ability to pay for the service is a critical constraint
to all district heat projects. Determination of the required type of support scheme will therefore be based on
an assessment of affordability, i.e. an assumed percent of household income. Contingent grants could also
then be reduced if incomes rose enough so that heat prices could be raised. Similarly, the level of the DIF
support justified for a power project at the beginning may need a revision should electricity prices be later
adjusted.

9.       Region and country specific tasks (removal of knowledge barriers, transfer of know-how, assessment
of geothermal potential, preparation of geothermal data bases, monitoring of the development of RER/GoeE
use, implementation of policy reviews and amendments) will be funded through the TA window of the
GeoFund. Subproject specific support extended to project developers will be made available through
different instruments of the GeoFund during different preparatory stages of the project, as illustrated in the
following figure:

D. Geological Risk Insurance Window

10.      The Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) Window of the GeoFund will, in part, insure project
developers/investors against the short-term, up-front geological risk of exploration, and, in limited
circumstances, against the long-term geological risk associated with the unexpected deterioration of the
performance of the geothermal reservoir over time. In the case of long-term geological risks, the geological
risk insurance will provide for a stream of pre-defined payments over the tenure of the insurance, to make up
for lower than estimated revenues, and/or higher than estimated operating costs. The risk coverage and
insurance coverage under the GRI Window will be partial, to motivate project sponsors to carry out a sound
and thorough geological investigation and avoid moral hazard. The main purpose of the GRI Window is to
provide help to project developers to obtain adequate financial resource for their project. The GRI Window is
proposed to be endowed with US$10 million. Any amount committed but not paid under the GRI will be
reutilized for subsequent GeoFund activities.

11.      The risk mitigation of the GRI Window should stimulate private and public investors to proceed with
their projects and enable them to attract additional financial resources at an affordable pricing. This, in turn,
should allow resulting project cash flows to service annual loan repayment obligations comfortably. The GRI
Window will be designed to compensate investors or their commercial banks in case of specified risks
materializing.

12.      GRI Instruments. Broadly there will be two types of GRI coverage available:




                                                         36

              Exploration Risk Insurance (EXGRI): a short-term cover for up-front geological exploration
              drilling risks (the production wells not encountering a geothermal reservoir or not encountering
              yield and temperature parameters as estimated prior to drilling), and
              Operation Risk Insurance (OPGRI)8 a 3 ­ 5 year long cover for operational risk of geothermal
              wells (declining yield and/or temperature, as well as chemistry, mineralization, resulting scaling
              and/or difficulties to re-inject the geothermal brine).

13.      GRI parameters. For each type of GRI, the insurance coverage will be defined against the key
parameters of the geothermal energy production, such as reservoir temperature, wellhead pressure, wellhead
flow rate, geothermal fluid chemistry, etc. In developing the GRI coverage, which is linked with geothermal
performance of the insured production and/or injection well, a scoring model will be established based on the
estimated (i.e., predicted) and actual geothermal data such as wellhead temperature, wellhead flow rate,
estimate of permeability, geochemical analyses of geothermal fluid and non-condensable gasses. Such
scoring model and framework will be critical for quantifying the insurance coverage in a transparent manner
as well as managing and monitoring the geological risk covered under the GRI window.

14.      A well that under-performs due to no injection or thermal breakthrough from a poorly sited injection
well should not be eligible for remedy.

15.      Since there is no established actuarial methodology to reliably quantify the geological risk, the GRI
should not be considered as a pure insurance instrument. It is more like a compensation scheme to cover part
of the drilling cost or operational revenue which is lost as a result of less-than estimated quantity or quality
of geothermal energy resource. Thus, if the temperature of the geothermal reservoir was estimated at about
100 degrees Celsius, but the tests showed only 75 degrees Celsius, the EXGRI would cover the part of the
drilling cost and expenses if such test result is considered total failure and the drilled well becomes a "dry"
hole. GRI could pay prorated amount if the result is less than full success but more than total failure.

16.      The OPGRI would cover the period of the learning curve for smooth operations (e.g. three to four
years), thereby giving enough time to appreciate potential trouble spots of the operations. This would then
require the monitoring of key parameters on a regular basis until the end of the OPGRI, to allow calculations
of claims, if and when parameters change significantly. It may take time to develop the OPGRI scheme as a
standard tool because of the complexity of risk definition and length of insurance period. It is therefore
envisaged that EXGRI will be predominantly used at an early stage of project development.

17.      Coverage. EXGRI would cover up to 85 percent of the eligible cost. Eligible cost will be defined as
the actual loss incurred by the project developer due to drilling results other than expected.

18.      Tenure. Each EXGRI would have tenure of up to nine months from the start of the drilling of well
covered under the EXGRI.

19.      The OPGRI will have to be limited to three to five years of operation. It should also consider using a
formula with a cap set, for example, at the costs of the wells, reduced by some depreciation rate, and
multiplied by an appropriate GRI Ratio. This maximum would only apply in case of necessary complete
abandonment of the installations.

20.      Pre-Conditions and Underwriting Criteria. While GRI will cover in principle the geological and
geology related risk, other technical and commercial aspects including the safeguard issues of the project
need to be carefully reviewed. With respect to GRI applications, technical and geological evaluation of the
geothermal exploratory well under GRI coverage will be conducted and presented in the form and substance
in accordance with the GeoFund operational guidelines. The technical and geological evaluation will be


8 OPGRI is an untested instrument and has not been fully developed. It will not be actively marketed during the Start-Up Phase. It
  will be offered as the GeoFund develops a track record with EXGRI and establishes a workable product framework.




                                                               37

critical to control the probability of GRI payout and to maximize the financial sustainability of the GRI
portfolio in the GeoFund.

21.      Pre-Conditions for EXGRI Application. A key risk mitigation strategy for geothermal energy
projects is to adopt a phased approach associated with the geothermal exploration and development activities
with a clear decision point at the end of each phase, before proceeding to the next phase. However, such
initial geothermal exploration phases as office-type geothermal resource study, field reconnaissance surveys
and investigations and detailed geothermal exploration surveys must be completed and are required elements
for the project to be eligible for the GRI Windows of the GeoFund. The data and information from these
initial exploration phases are the critical elements that will need to be evaluated by the GCT and the
GeoFund Group of Scientific and Technical Experts (STE) to determine whether the geothermal energy
project will be considered for support under the GRI Window associated with the exploration-drilling phase
of the specific geothermal project. Although there can be no absolute pre-drilling determination of whether a
particular geothermal exploratory well will be successful, the technical evaluation data and testing
methodologies described above are necessary for the GCT to assess the probability of successful well drilling
with reasonable confidence. With a positive recommendation from the STE based on their analysis of the
accumulated data and interpretations of the three initial exploration phases and the designation of a probable
exploration-drilling target by the geothermal energy project developers/investors, the World Bank may make
a GRI commitment in form of a grant agreement.

22.      Pre-Conditions for OPGRI Application. Once it has been determined by the Project Task Manager
that the exploration associated with the development of the investment subproject has been successfully
completed, the World Bank may make a GRI commitment to the operational phase of the geothermal project
in form of a grant agreement. The primary long-term geological risks associated with the operational phase
of a geothermal project include producing a geothermal reservoir with lower-than-estimated temperature,
higher than estimated mineralization, or difficulty with re-injection of geothermal fluids back into the
subsurface formations.

23.      The determination of a sub-optimal operational performance and the triggering of the GRI
commitment will be derived from requested well testing, the continuous monitoring and measurements of
physical and chemical parameters, including as a minimum the determination of the wellhead temperature,
wellhead pressure, wellhead flow rate, and geochemical analysis of the produced geothermal fluids and
gasses as a function of time. These geothermal parameters will be continually monitored and analyzed to
document the sub-optimal performance of the geothermal project.

24.      GRI Premium and Fee. The GRI premium could be determined in theory by the probability of risk
occurrence over the life of GRI scheme for EXGRI and OPGRI, respectively. However, because of the
peculiarity of the geological nature of each geothermal well and the lack of reliable data and technical and
actuarial methodologies, it would be very difficult to assess the probability of risk occurrence with a high
degree of confidence. Conversely, if the probability of risk occurrence is measured with high confidence, a
project developer would be willing to proceed with the geothermal project by taking such calculated risk into
account in developing financial feasibility, and the need for geological risk mitigation instruments will be
diminished.

25.      Given the experimental nature of GeoFund as a development vehicle for geothermal energy projects,
GRI premiums will need to be determined with relatively greater emphasis on practical consideration of the
GRI instrument's marketability as a compensation scheme than the theoretical consideration on the financial
sustainability of the GRI scheme as a pure insurance scheme. GRI premiums will be reviewed and adjusted
during the implementation period based on the actual occurrence of geological risk events. Underwriting
criteria may also need to be adjusted. As a medium and long-term prospect, private insurance market may
develop a fully market-based instrument which can mitigate the geological risk with affordable pricing.
Alternatively, technological advancement may enable the project sponsor to assess the geological risk with a
much greater degree of confidence and virtually make any insurance scheme obsolete or needless. In this



                                                        38

respect, the role of GRI as a "market development" instrument is to bridge the gap between the mostly
publicly subsidized schemes to fully market-based instrument.

26.      GRI premiums will be proposed as follows:

                For EXGRI: between 3 to 5 percent on the eligible cost of drilling and payable upfront upon
                signing.

                Applicable fee will be determined based on the risk-assessment of individual projects. Lower
                fee for better risk and higher fee for relatively riskier proposal would apply.

                For OPGRI up to [to be determined] percent p.a. on the total amount of OPGRI payable during
                the OPGRI tenure. Premium can be prorated in proportion to the maximum payout amount.

                Application and Processing Fee: To be determined by the GCT on individual project basis
                depending on the complexity of the project proposal. Application and processing fee is to
                cover part of the preparation and processing expenses including hiring expert consultants for
                technical, financial, and legal advisory.

27.      Fee payment and reallocation procedures. Upon receipt, GRI premium and processing fee will be
first credited to the GEF Trust Fund, and then reallocated to the GeoFund sub-account in the same amount.
The reallocated amount to the GeoFund sub-account will be further utilized as part of the overall GeoFund
resource.

28.      The processing of the fee payment and reallocation in the Bank will take the following steps.

     a) The GCT (or IFC for its operations) will issue an invoice to the recipient for the amount of fees
         payable, specifying that the payment will be credited to Trust Fund No. TF029840 (the GEF Trust
         Fund). Trustee and ACTTF will be copied or informed of the invoicing (date of the invoice,
         expected payment date and amount of the invoice etc.).

     b) The Trustee shall notify IBRD Treasury of the incoming payment.

     c) The recipient pays the amount to be credited to TF029840.

     d) Receipt of the fee will be confirmed by the Trustee to the GCT (or IFC) which will constitute a
         condition of effectiveness of the GRI commitment.

     e) The Trustee shall inform the GEFSEC of the fee income received and request GEF CEO
         approval/endorsement for the increase of allocation to this Project by the fee income.

     f) Upon notification by the GEFSEC of the approval/endorsement of the increase, the Trustee shall
         commit and transfer the approved amount to IBRD as Implementing Agency, who shall allocate the
         same to GeoFund sub account as reallocation of the GEF resource for further utilization for the
         GeoFund operations.

E. Lifetime of GRI and DIF Windows

29.      While funds in the TA window deplete according to a pre-determinable disbursement schedule, those
in the GRI and DIF windows are both of a partially revolving nature. GRI funds become depleted over time
according to an assumed average failure rate of maximum 35 percent. Multiple guarantees will be possible
too, as the probability of the risk materializing is limited. Most of DIF support will be on no contingent basis,
even though it would facilitate a revolving operation. Due to the small transactions and to legal constrains a
contingent operation is envisaged for the second phase of the Program. The overall ratio of depletion for the
DIF window (incl. non-contingent grants and assumed failure rate of contingent grants) is assumed to be 60
percent.

F. Project Types

30.      The GeoFund will support investments in geothermal energy use for the following purposes:

    a) Electricity generating projects in places where the geothermal reservoir promises sufficiently high
         temperatures to achieve that goal. Likely candidate areas for such projects would be in several parts
         of Russia (Kamchatka), in Hungary, Turkey and possibly in Romania and the Slovak Republic;

    b) Fuel substitution projects in existing district heating facilities will be the most likely projects; in
         these cases geothermal energy would be to a large extent substituted for an existing fossil fuel
         source; these have a good potential throughout most of the ECA countries;

    c) Geothermal energy projects for the purpose of heating of individual housing blocks (not involving
         DH networks, or only small new networks), of greenhouses, of wood drying chambers, as well as
         spas and other balneological facilities; and

    d) Any combination of (a) to (c), i.e. cascading applications where geothermal resources would be
         cooled down in successive stages (industrial heating, heating of housing, heating of greenhouses,
         heating of balneological facilities, etc.), before being re-injected.

31.      It is expected that the majority of geothermal projects (well over 60 percent) would involve district-
heating facilities. Only up to 20 percent of projects are expected to deal with electricity generation and the
remaining up to 20 percent would involve other uses. Most projects would involve a combination of district
heat provision and other applications (combination of (b) and (c)). Typically, most projects involving
electricity generation would be in combination with district heating.




                                                         40

G. Project Eligibility

32.     Project proposals will need to fulfill a set of basic eligibility criteria for receiving support from the
GeoFund. Eligible subprojects:
   a) are located in an eligible country9;

   b) conform to the laws, regulations, objectives, and respective development priorities of the country;

   c) comply with applicable social, environmental and safeguard policies of the World Bank;

   d) meet the requirements set out in the Bank's Articles of Agreement and the relevant provisions of
        World Bank Operational Manual;

   e) are based on one of the three eligible project types or a combination thereof, as described above; and

   f) submit an endorsement from the proposing country's GEF Focal Point.

33.     GeoFund support will be available for any type of capital expenditures and investments through
equity, debt, mezzanine, etc. by private sector entities, which might support the financing of geothermal
energy projects as classified above.

1.      About 8 - 10 projects with an estimated total cost of about US$200 million will be financed under
the Program. GEF financing of US$25 million will be made available through three forms as discussed in the
previous annex. Disbursement of GEF funds will be done on a project by project basis. The GeoFund would
expect additional funding from co-financing partners by leveraging GEF funds at an aggregated overall
Project ratio of 1 to 7 (GEF: US$25 million, other sources: US$170 million). It is expected that low-cost
funding could become available on a ratio of 1 to 2 (GEF and other sources, including bilateral sources and
domestic sources) and that bilateral donors or local funds would provide further grant funding for geothermal
development. The minimum debt/equity ratio required for individual projects is 1:5. The modalities of co-
financing arrangements will be established on a project-by-project basis.

2.      Distinction needs to be made between:

                 GEF sources in the form of a geological risk insurance which do not directly contribute to a
                 project's financing plan and therefore should have a very high leveraging ratio depending on
                 actual payout for unsuccessful projects, and

                 Other GEF sources (TA, contingent grant funding, or low cost funding), which directly
                 contribute to a project's financing plan.

3.      Taking only the latter funding (about US$15 million), leveraging would exceed 1 to 10 for those
funds.

                                  Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                   (GEOFUND)
A. Institutions and Role of Participants

1.       The objectives of the Geothermal Energy Development Program are to provide:

     a) Support to Governments in policy improvements and the removal of barriers against the use of RER
         and notably geothermal energy in participating countries;

     b) Capacity building regarding geothermal energy development in ECA countries;

     c) Development of a balanced portfolio of geothermal energy projects across ECA countries and
         applying different geothermal technologies; and

     d) Utilization of Geothermal Energy through implementation of geothermal energy projects supported
         by effective use of the GeoFund resources.

2.       To meet these objectives, a number of actors need to interact as follows:

3.       GEF is providing core funding of the GeoFund in the amount of US$25 million through the
instruments of the GeoFund.

4.       Co-financiers of the geothermal investment projects will be investors (equity), lenders (debt
financing), and donors (grants, contingent grants and low cost loans). Donors will provide co-financing and
technical assistance to support policy improvements and project preparation, implementation. Beneficiaries
of the Project will be Host Governments (TA), who will implement policy improvements to eliminate
barriers to geothermal energy development, NGO and international organizations, which will support
capacity development in all ECA countries, Project Developers (equity and debt financing) who will
implement geothermal projects, and Clients of these project companies who will enjoy stable tariffs for heat
and electricity.

5.       Project developers, typically utilities, financiers or investors, will be the direct beneficiaries of
project-specific technical assistance, Geological Risk Insurances (GRIs) and Direct Investment Funding
(DIF) and the indirect beneficiaries of regional and country-specific TA.

6.       Country authorities involved in the implementation of TA activities and subprojects may include the
national GEF focal point, ministries responsible for energy and environment protection matters, for science,
technology development and innovations, energy regulatory offices, government or private institutions
responsible for geological exploration and regional and municipal authorities. Country dialogue will be
initiated, in most cases, by the GCT in close cooperation with ECA Infrastructure Department with the
appropriate representatives of the client country's respective ministry. Principles of the TA activity, its scope
as well as the terms of the support will be agreed with these authorities. The country should agree on a
counterpart entity with whom the GeoFund enters into a TA project agreement. The regional and municipal
authorities will be involved in the further elaboration of the activity and the preparation of the Terms of
Reference. Institutions responsible for geological exploration will be typically involved during the
implementation phase of the assignment and will be, together with the energy regulatory office, key
counterparts to the consulting firm executing the task. The GEF focal point submits a request for the
participation of the country in the GeoFund and provides endorsement of investment subprojects.

7.       Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), defined as any non-profit organization, group or
institution that operates independently from a Government and has humanitarian or cooperative, rather than
commercial, objectives, can be used as implementing agents and as contractors. An implementing agent is an
entity engaged by and accountable to the executing agency to procure and deliver project inputs and their
conversion to project outputs. NGOs may serve as implementing agents when they possess specialized
expertise in a technical subject or geographic area, thus being well placed to carry out certain project


                                                         43

activities, without assuming overall management (execution) of the project. Henceforth, the executing
agency is not obliged to select NGOs as implementing agents through the competitive bidding process; they
may be designated through a letter of agreement between the two parties, provided certain selection criteria
are met. A contractor/subcontractor is defined as an entity providing services or goods in exchange for
payment or other consideration. The responsibilities of a contractor, therefore, differ from those of an
implementing agent. Selection of a contractor/service provider is considered as procurement, and the World
Bank procurement and contracting regime applies to the selection of an NGO in that respect.

8.       The GeoFund Coordination Team (GCT) will be responsible for the implementation of the
GeoFund Program, providing overall strategy, direction, processing.

9.       The GCT as implementing unit of the GeoFund at the Bank will be formed by the representatives of
the World Bank, IFC and other partners and executing agencies. The GCT will have the following
responsibilities;

         Overall management (setting the GeoFund operational strategy, managing balanced portfolio, etc.)
         and coordination with donors and partners of the GeoFund;

         Promotion and marketing of the GeoFund program and products to the targeted countries and clients;

         Identification, preparation and development of new subproject applications;

         Internal processing and appraisal of subprojects;

         Instructions of administrative actions for project implementation; and

         Supervisions of subprojects.

10.      It is important to note that the GCT will not be involved directly in the implementation of
subprojects. Similar to the Coordination Unit in the Danube/Black Sea program, it tasks will be restricted to
coordinating and supervision of the activities of the GeoFund. The project implementation will be done by
recipients in the participating countries, supervised by a Project Task Manager in the Bank.

11.      The GeoFund Coordination Team (GCT) will work with participating governments, NGOs,
international organizations, and project developers to identify most relevant constraints, determine their
resolution queue and devise means to implement improved policies, legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks.

12.      The GeoFund Advisory Forum (GAF) will provide policy advice towards the strategic direction of
the GeoFund activities. Therefore, it will provide guidance to the GCT for project development and regional,
as well as country-specific and project-specific technical assistance. It will help the GCT to develop its
annual and multi-annual GeoFund activity programs and will comment on the GeoFund's annual reports. An
important objective of the GAF is to promote barrier removal and to discuss related efforts in the
participating countries. The GAF will meet about once a year and will be loosely organized. It will consist of
representatives of participating countries' Governments, nominated by national GEF focal points, and will be
open to staff from the expert community of countries of the ECA Region and the rest of the world, as well as
to representatives of interested donors, project sponsors, private sector participants, and professional NGOs.
GCT will nominate the membership of the GAF.

13.      The GeoFund Group of Scientific and Technical Experts (STE) will be an expert community,
based on a roster of geology, technical, environmental, financial, economic and legal experts. The STE
experts will be responsible for carrying out technical, environmental and financial due diligence related
activities, will in particular, provide geological risk assessment of projects, and will assist in economic
evaluations, as well as legal support for contractual arrangements. The STE will not have permanent staff for
the whole period of the Project. Rather, the experts will be selected by the GCT on an ad-hoc basis from the
roster, as required for individual projects and tasks. The STE is similar in structure to the Scientific and



                                                         44

Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) of GEF, but has a wider focus in that it also supports the resolution of
economic, financial and legal issues in the context of execution of the GeoFund operations.

14.     The World Bank will be implementing the TA Window through each government as recipient.
Distinction is made between Regional TA, Country-Specific TA and project-specific TA. For Regional TA,
the International Geothermal Association (IGA) will be executing individual operations as recipient under
the work program agreement with the World Bank. IGA will be primarily responsible for the execution of
region-wide TA activities under the capacity building component. Reasons for the cooperation with IGA are
its profound knowledge about the specific characteristics of geothermal energy and its worldwide operations.
It has more than 2000 members in 65 countries, a special consultative status with the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations, and is a Partner of the European Union for the Campaign for Take Off (CTO)
Renewable Energy. Even so it has no extensive experience in project implementation it was found to be the
only available organization capable of working on a regional basis. IGA will contract to national geothermal
associations and other institutions for the organization of training courses, seminars and other events. The
work program of IGA's region-wide TA activities will be prepared jointly by IGA and GCT and periodically
reviewed in accordance with the Grant Agreement (GA) between IGA and the Bank. Further information on
the IGA is provided in annex 19.

15.     The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been selected as Executing Agency for the
World Bank to execute part of GeoFund activities through the Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) window, the
Direct Investment Funding (DIF) window as well as the TA window. IFC will mainly focus on the GeoFund
operations for private sector beneficiaries. IFC's participation will strengthen the GCT's capacity in terms of
the identification of private/municipal sector clients and the commercial due diligence of the project
applications.

16.     IFC could identify and develop subprojects, and propose them for GCT endorsement in accordance
with the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA). When the GCT identifies or receives project applications, GCT
may recommend IFC for processing of those subprojects which GCT considers more appropriate to be
handled by IFC than through the host government recipients.

17.     In addition to the MoA, the working arrangement between the Bank and IFC for the GeoFund
operations will be also governed by the "Arrangement for the Administration and Management of Funds
from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to be Made Available by the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development Acting as an Implementing Agency of the GEF to the International Finance
Corporation" dated May 31, 1996 (the Arrangement). In accordance with the Arrangement, those
subprojects which will be assigned to IFC will be administered in accordance with its rules and procedures in
terms of the financial management, contract implementation, safeguards, etc. IFC has executed many GEF-
supported projects under the Arrangement, and its capacity as Executing Agency for the GeoFund operations
is considered satisfactory in all respects.

B. Legal Agreements and Project Documents

18.     Legal relations, distribution of labor, sharing of responsibilities etc. among beneficiaries,
intermediaries and the GeoFund will be governed by a series of agreements, as follows:

        Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with IFC: the GeoFund (World Bank) signs an MoA with
        IFC as executing agency for the GeoFund activities. This agreement spells out the responsibilities of
        IFC, the distribution of roles between the GCT and IFC for identification, processing, approval,
        implementation and supervision, and the modality of the transfer of the GEF grant from the World
        Bank to IFC. In principle, IFC will use its own rules and procedures to execute each GeoFund
        activity.

        Grant Agreement (GA) with recipient: With each recipient (governments and IGA, etc.), the
        World Bank will enter into a GA under which the principles and objectives of the GEF grant for the
        GeoFund activities will be spelled out. In the case of IGA, a work program agreement will be


                                                        45

        attached to the GA to ensure the quality of underlying activities and to measure progress of
        implementation against the program.

        GRI/DIF Agreements: The World Bank and IFC may use additional documents (e.g. detailed term
        sheet) to define specific terms for the GRI and DIF instruments for each subproject.

C. Project Processing

19.     The Project processing will follow an approach of a Horizontal APL, similar to the multi-country
African Stockpile Programme Project 1. The Start-Up considers six countries. The first subprojects will be
implemented in Hungary with a GRI and by IGA with region wide TA. All relevant information about the
IGA -, and Hungary -, subprojects is presented in annexes 19, and 20, respectively.

20.     The internal approval process of the GeoFund Program will take the following steps:

    a) The GEF Secretariat (GEFSEC) will endorse each subproject based on the council approval of the
        whole Program;

    b) Bank Board approval will be sought for each of the two initial GEF Trust Funds for Hungary and
        IGA and the overall GeoFund Program. The approval of subsequent GEF Trust Funds will follow the
        established APL procedures;

21.     The following sequence of activities for project preparation of all subprojects of the GeoFund
Program will be followed:

    a) The GeoFund Program will follow a programmatic approach similar to a horizontal APL;

    b) Each subproject will be given a separate project number. It can consist of a single operation in one
        country or of several small operations in one or more countries as presented in the PAD for Board
        approval. The decision whether to bundle several operations or not depends on the size and nature of
        the operation;

    c) Subprojects that are less than US$1 million would follow the GEF MSP documentation and approval
        instead of a full sized GEF PAD;

    d) In lieu of a PCN for subprojects, we will draft a memo to Files (for the Country Director and Sector
        Manager to sign) that confirms that there are no significant deviations from the Program Objectives.
        Upon filing, this Memo will be circulated to the standard distribution list;

    e) The next step would be obtaining authorization to proceed to the next phase. The Task Manager
        sends a simple memo (one page maximum) to the Country Director requesting authorization to
        proceed with the next phase attached with a draft ISDS approved by the RSC and a draft PAD. This
        memo will be circulated to a standard distribution list of a PCN review. The date of approval of this
        memo by the CD will be considered the starting date for project preparation and will be recorded as
        such in SAP;

    f) A QER will be held for each subproject of the GeoFund prior to the decision meeting authorizing
        appraisal and negotiations. All subsequent steps will be the same as for other SIL projects except
        final approval of subsequent GEF Trust Fund grants will follow the established APL procedures.

Technical Assistance

Submission of request
22.     Regional TA: IGA as recipient of this component will closely cooperate with participating
Governments and the GCT to identify and develop a work program for eligible Regional TA activities. IGA
will also execute requests for such Regional TA coming directly from governments or NGOs or international
organizations or project sponsors. The work program will be reviewed and amended as needed to reflect the
updated project pipeline for the regional TA activities.



                                                      46

23.     Country Specific TA: Requests for support of TA for barrier removal activities will be submitted to
the GCT by participating host governments or institutions. The request will contain a concise summary of the
country's energy sector priorities including future strategy for RER/geothermal energy utilization and the
country's geothermal potential with ongoing/planned exploration activities (if any). This overview must
demonstrate that the country has geothermal potential with meaningful utilization opportunities and that this
potential can be turned into economically exploitable projects, provided that existing barriers are sufficiently
addressed.

24.     Project Specific TA: Requests for TA for project preparation/ implementation/ operation activities
for a Geological Risk Insurance and/or for financial assistance (DIF) for project implementation/ operation
will be submitted to the GCT by the project sponsor (see section (2) below).

Evaluation

25.     Regional TA: IGA will evaluate the proposals based on the principles set out in the Grant
Agreement. The work program will be developed by the IGA jointly with the GCT.

26.     Country Specific TA: The GCT will evaluate the proposals. For a request for support of country-
specific TA to be evaluated positively, it has to demonstrate that the removal of existing barriers to
geothermal energy development in the country will have a fair chance to lead to the successful
implementation of geothermal energy development projects.

27.     Project Specific TA: The GCT and the STE experts will evaluate the justification of the proposals
based on the economic and financial feasibility of the project.

Implementation

28.     Regional TA: The IGA will prepare the TOR for each TA activity to be cleared with the GCT on a
no-objection basis and execute the selection of the consultants in accordance with World Bank procurement
procedures.

29.     Country Specific TA and project specific TA: Upon positive evaluation of the TA requests, the
assigned Project Task Manager will prepare the TOR for the proposed TA activities and execute the selection
of consultants in accordance with the applicable procurement rules. The Project Task Manager will
supervise the contracts' execution jointly with the GCT.

DIF and GRI

Submission

30.     Requests for support of a Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) and/or a financial assistance (DIF) for
project implementation/ operation will be submitted to the GCT by the project sponsor. Details of the
requested support for the different types of activities will be described in the Project Concept Note (PCN) to
be submitted with the request. A GEF National Focal Point endorsement will be requested at the screening
stage of project processing.

Evaluation

31.     Evaluation of requests for support of GRI and DIF begins with the assessment of the overall
soundness of the subproject including:

        Adequate geological data of the reservoir with good prospects for availability of a geothermal
        resource;

        Reliable technologies adopted for exploration;

        Project Economics (market demand, investment cost/produced energy, sustainability of tariff, etc.);

        Availability of financial resources;



                                                        47

        Environmental and social aspects (in line with the WB's safeguard policies).

32.     The project sponsor/developer's experience and capacity to implement the project will be assessed at
an early stage of GeoFund involvement. Projects of very small-size or very large-size may not be considered
as appropriate. However, the GeoFund may be interested to support projects with high potential of
demonstration effect as a replicable model regardless of the small project size. The GeoFund may not be able
to support very large-size projects because of the lack of resources. It will be the responsibility of the project
developer to furnish the GeoFund with sufficient information in the PCN. If the project proposal is
considered to have merits for further work, the project specific TA could be provided through the TA
window.

D. Monitoring and Supervision

33.     For the purpose of monitoring and supervision, the GCT would ensure continued compliance of the
executed subprojects, in particular with environmental and social safeguards. In addition, compliance with
the contract requirements will be subject to regular audits and verification by the GCT, as applicable. The
table below illustrates the processing steps of investment subprojects:

     EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                  (GEOFUND)
Financial Management Arrangements

1.       Financial management. Each activity or subproject will have a separate grant account with the Bank,
and each recipient will be responsible for assuring that the recipient establishes and maintains: (i) financial
management arrangements that are acceptable to the Bank, (ii) adequate accounting systems and procedures;
(iii) funds flow mechanisms including timely disbursements to its suppliers; and (iv) appropriate
arrangements for regular financial audits. These responsibilities will be specified in grant documents.
Participating recipient will be evaluated as to their compliance with Bank financial management standards at
the preparation and launching stages, as well as on supervision missions during grant implementation.

2.       Staffing arrangements. Staffing arrangements will be discussed during Appraisal of the countries and
will be further detailed prior to and during negotiations.

3.       Financial reporting. Maximum use will be made of recipient existing practices and reporting
formats providing that they meet Bank standards. For project monitoring purposes, financial monitoring
reports will be required at least semi-annually.

4.       Financial audits. Audits of project financial statements are required, which are to be carried by the
auditor general of the recipient country acceptable to the Bank, or by acceptable independent auditing firm.
The selection and appointment of the external auditor and TOR will be in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. An audit report prepared in accordance with Bank guidelines will be required to be submitted to
the Bank six months following the end of the recipient's fiscal year-end. In addition to the audit report, the
auditors will be expected to prepare management letters giving observations and comments, and providing
recommendations for improvements in accounting records, systems, controls and compliance with financial
covenants in the Grant Agreement.

5.       Internal controls. Minimum internal controls should be available prior to flow of funds. Controls
over grant funds will be especially important for these projects. The Bank will assess the control
environment of the recipient and implementing agencies during project preparation, and by the auditors in
their annual audit. Significant weaknesses identified will require prompt resolution.

6.       Internal audit. Internal audit arrangements are normally required for each project. Where the scope
of financial transactions does not justify the existence of a dedicated internal audit, internal control will be
required through management supervision and a clear separation of duties.

7.       Risk Assessment. From financial management perspective, this project is considered low to modest
risk because of the following reasons: (a) the Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) Window (US$10.0 million
out of US$25 million) will be managed by the GEF Trust Fund Unit in the Bank and no fund will flow to the
grant recipient unless the event crystallize, (b) The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been selected
as Executing Agency for the World Bank to execute part of GeoFund activities through the Geological Risk
Insurance (GRI) window, the Direct Investment Funding (DIF) window as well as the TA window, and (c)
each subproject or activity would have to have acceptable FM arrangements prior to Board approval.

8.       Activity or subproject specific project documentation (PADs, Technical Annexes). These documents
will provide more detailed information as to the particular financial management arrangements for IGA and
Hungary and other initial proposals acceptable to the Bank before the Board presentation, and for the
subsequent subprojects consistent with ECA specific requirements, to be put in place by each recipient.




                                                        50

Flow of Funds and Disbursement Procedures

9.       The total amount for the GeoFund Program is US$25 million funded by the GEF. The funds will be
managed and administered by the Bank according to existing policies and procedures, including
disbursement methods and arrangements described below. Each recipient country, IFC and IGA will access
the funds after signing appropriate legal agreements such as grant agreements and Memorandum of
Agreement.

10.      The proceeds of the GEF Grant will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's standard
disbursement procedures currently in use, i.e., largely through transaction based disbursement using
withdrawal applications supported by Statements of Expenditures. Direct payment may be used in some
instances.

11.      The pertinent disbursement procedures will be described in the Disbursement Letters which each
recipient will receive after signing the Grant Agreement with the Bank. The letter will describe the applicable
disbursement procedures and the authorized method for withdrawing funds.

12.      As all the countries covered by the GeoFund have some experience with Bank financed operations
and disbursement procedures, no major difficulties are expected in the flow of funds.

13.      As the needs for each country and each subproject will be reviewed so as to come up with an
appropriate funds flow mechanism to finance project activities through GEF funds. Local project accounts
will be opened in some cases to channel counterpart funds to the Project. This will be not required were the
contributions are in kind. All accounts will be opened on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Withdrawal applications, submitted to the Bank, will include such supporting documentation as specified in
the Disbursement letter.

Financial Management Assessments for IGA and first recipients

14.      For the MOL Geothermal Power Pilot Project for Hungary, this is geological risk insurance with
general terms as per those of the partial risk guarantee facility under the GeoFund program. Disbursement is
contingent on project parameters not reaching expected values, as spelled out in the grant agreement. In case
of a loss incurred by the project developer due to lower than expected reservoir parameters, the GEF pays a
certain percentage of this loss through the geological risk insurance window of the umbrella GeoFund
Program. The insurance facility will be managed by the GEF Trust Fund Unit in the Bank and no funds will
flow to the grant recipient unless the event occurs, in which case then only the amounts as agreed in advance
will be paid to developer directly. Accordingly no fiduciary assessment is necessary for this project. From a
financial management perspective, this activity is considered low risk.

15.      A financial management assessment was undertaken in 2006 to determine whether the financial
management systems to be utilized by IGA to manage the grant funds are acceptable to the Bank. It has been
concluded that the current financial management arrangements of IGA are not acceptable to the Bank.
Accordingly it has been agreed that the effectiveness of the grant fund to IGA is subject to the establishment
of acceptable financial management arrangements. From a financial management perspective, this activity is
considered modest risk. An improvement action plan has been agreed with IGA to ensure that it can fully
meet the Bank's requirements prior to the disbursement of grant fund. The action plan includes the following
critical activities:

     a) Recruitment of a part-time accountant/procurement specialist to manage the grant facility;

     b) Establishment of satisfactory FM policies and procedures manual, including appropriate internal
         controls for grant funds, for the grant facility;

     c) Establishment of accounting system that is capable of recording and reporting flow of funds and
         tracking of expenditures of the grant facility;

     d) Finalization of interim financial reports (IFRs) acceptable to the Bank; and


                                                         51

e) Provision of appropriate training to new accountant/procurement specialist on Bank's procedures on
  FM and procurement.

                                     Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                   (GEOFUND)
A. General

1.       Procurement for the proposed Project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated
in the Legal Agreements. The general description of various items under different expenditure category is
described below.

2.       This Annex describes general, "umbrella-type" approach to procurement, while specific
requirements will be added for each subsequent project financed by GeoFund and as may be further detailed
in Operations Manual for subsequent project, as applicable.

3.       For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the application of different procurement methods or
consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and
timeframe are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan
will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements in institutional capacity. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for goods and works and
Standard Request for Proposals for Consultants, as well as all standard evaluation forms, are recommended
to be used throughout project implementation. Other bidding documents may also be acceptable, provided
they are reviewed by the Bank, prior to their first use.

4.       Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) Window. Underlying works under this component will comprise
the geothermal drilling and drilling related services. In the context of the GRI, these works will not be
financed by the GEF grant and the disbursement will not take place unless there is a claim arising from
materializing a geological risk. Therefore, Bank's procurement procedures shall not be applicable as there are
no goods, works or services financed by GEF grant proceeds. However, the national legislation on
competitive bidding procedures normally used for public procurement in the territory of each of the
Recipients acceptable to the Bank should be used to procure underlying works and related technical services
under this component.

5.       Direct Investment Funding (DIF) Window. This component would provide funding in the form of
grants, contingent grants or low cost loans to Recipients under separate projects. Procurement procedures
would be as follows:

6.       Well-established small private companies in countries for which the World Bank has conducted a
procurement review, that has been found satisfactory, could use prudent commercial practices provided that
these procedures will ensure a transparent competitive process of seeking bids and evaluation of bids based
on pre-disclosed clear bid evaluation criteria for award of contract to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.
The contractors and suppliers selected for award should have adequate financial and technical resources to
perform the contract satisfactorily. Enterprises or institutions in the Recipient's country may participate only
if they can establish that they (i) are legally and financially autonomous, (ii) operate under commercial law,
and (iii) are not dependent agencies of the recipient or sub-recipient. The Bank will review the procurement
documents for compliance with these principles based on the assessment of procurement capacity of a
specific Recipient. Normally, bidding documents for the first package would be reviewed by the Project Task
Manager to determine whether subsequent packages could be reviewed as a post review. In addition, for
contracts exceeding commercial practices thresholds established during appraisal of each specific project,
procurement will be conducted by NCB or ICB as the case may be.




                                                         53

Selection of Consultants

7.       Technical Assistance (TA)-Window. The TA ­ window provides funds for region wide, country
wide and project specific Technical Assistance.

8.       Consulting services under the region wide TA window of the Project will be primarily implemented
by IGA, following also the Bank Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants. Further
information on procurement arrangement for the IGA subproject is outlined in Annex 19.

9.       Sub-component managed by the Recipient: Consulting services will be procured in accordance with
the Bank's Consultants' Guidelines. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than the
threshold ceiling per contract established for each Recipient country may be composed entirely of national
consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Guidelines.

10.      Others. The procurement procedures and Standard Bidding Documents to be used for each
procurement method, as well as model contracts for works and goods to be procured, shall be presented in
the Operations Manual if applicable.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

11.      An assessment of the capacity of each Recipient to implement procurement actions for the project
will be carried out during appraisal of each specific project financed by GeoFund.

C. Procurement Plan

12.      Recipient of a specific project, at appraisal, will develop a Procurement Plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. Procurement plan shall be approved
by the Bank covering the initial 18 month (or longer) period of implementation of the project and shall be
updated from time to time but not later than 12 months after the date of the preceding Procurement Plan.

D. Frequency of Procurement Supervision

13.      In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out by the Bank, the capacity assessment of
the Implementing Agency of each of the Recipient will recommend frequency of the supervision missions to
visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions.

14.      The PAD includes a detailed procurement plan for each Recipient in the respective annexes of the
PAD. It shall follow the following model Procurement Plan:

Procurement Procedures of the IFC

15.      Subprojects implemented by the IFC will be governed by the "Arrangement for the Administration
and Management of Funds from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to be Made Available by the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Acting as and Implementing Agency of the GEF to
the International Finance Corporation" dated May 31, 1996. Consistent with the Arrangement, those
subprojects which will be assigned to IFC will be administered in accordance with its rules and procedures in
terms of the financial management, contract implementation, safeguards, etc. IFC has executed many GEF-
supported projects under the Arrangement, and its capacity as Executing Agency for the GeoFund operations
is considered satisfactory in all respects.

                                       Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                           (GEOFUND)
Economic Analysis

1.       Economic analyses are relevant at two levels for the GeoFund. First, the economics of the entire
GeoFund concept will be evaluated to justify the commitment of US$25 million in GEF funding to support
geothermal development. This can most readily be developed as an incremental cost analysis per ton of CO2
reduction based on multiples of a prototypical project of the type that is anticipated to result from the
GeoFund.10

2.       In the lexicon of World Bank projects, the high level economic analysis of the GeoFund is referred
to as a framework project analysis. For framework projects, the economic analysis should identify the
process that will be used to screen and select subprojects that are economically justified and should specify
the criteria that will be used to evaluate projects. Only projects that can demonstrate positive net economic
benefits will be accepted for GeoFund support. In any given funding cycle, project applications will be
ranked in terms of net economic benefits although discretion will be used to assure desirable geographic,
size, and technology distributions of the projects that are selected. This is necessary to maximize the
coverage of the GeoFund to as many countries as possible and to minimize risk through diversification.

3.       The second level of economic analysis applies to each subproject. Economic justification of
geothermal projects often relies in part on recognition of both avoided costs of production from fossil-fueled
alternatives and of the environmental benefits that attend clean geothermal production of heat and/or
electricity. To avoid exaggerated and inconsistent methods of estimating environmental benefits, the
GeoFund will provide default parameters and methods that can be used to estimate the benefits associated
with reduced emissions of CO2, SO2, NOx and PM10. This default approach will be provided to project
applicants. As an alternative, each country will be free to establish their own methodology and values for
reduced emissions of these pollutants subject to approval by the GeoFund. Approved countrywide methods
will be applied to all projects submitted from that country.11

4.       The economic analysis framework for subproject analysis can best be described as cost effectiveness
analysis since no attempt will be made to quantify the benefits from the heat and/or electricity that are
produced by the project. Rather, the life cycle economic costs of producing project outputs will be compared
with the costs of producing those same outputs with the least cost alternative source. Typically, that will be
from existing coal-fired boilers although gas or oil fired boilers would certainly be considered if prevailing
practice in that country shows that these are the more like alternatives to geothermal heat production.
Geothermal projects that produce electricity or a mixture of electricity and heat will also require a more
complex baseline alternative definition. The avoided cost of conventional heat and/or electric production will
be referred to as traditional economic benefits.



10       An indicative analysis based on a project in Stargard Poland can be developed as follows. The target leverage of GEF
         funding is 1:8 which suggests that US$25 million will support total project investment of about US$200 million. The
         baseload geothermal district-heating project in Stargard will produce about 37,500 GJ of heat per year per million dollars
         of investment. Production of that heat in coal boilers with 80 percent efficiency would require about 10,400 MWh of coal
         input, which would result in 3,750 MT of CO2 emissions per year per million dollars of investment. Then US$200 million
         investment would reduce CO2 emissions by 750,000 MT per year. This would translate to 15 million tons over nominal
         twenty-year project lives with a very attractive incremental cost of US$1.67 per ton of CO2. Although not all projects will
         be as attractive as this, these results provide broad grounds for optimism that the GeoFund investment is a cost effective
         means of reducing CO2 emissions.
11        It is anticipated that the GeoFund will sponsor a web-based literature review and survey study to establish the various
         values of costs per ton associated with key pollutant emissions that are now in use. Regulatory agencies, ministries of the
         environment, and select research institutes will be surveyed to establish the values and methods to apply.




                                                                 56

5.      Geothermal project lives can often extend to thirty years or beyond but the analysis will be limited to
the lesser figure of twenty years or the expected economic life of the project. A baseline analysis will
establish the least-cost method of producing project outputs. Both operating margins and build margins will
be considered to the extent necessary. The least-cost method production scenario then provides the
comparative basis for estimating avoided costs and reduced emissions of the specified pollutants. The least-
cost analysis will be conducted in economic rather than financial terms.

6.      In addition to traditional economic benefits, project benefits attributable to reduced emissions of the
specified pollutants will be estimated using either the GeoFund default methods or approved country specific
methods. Conceptually, the per unit benefits represent the lesser figure of control costs or damages related to
the emissions. Reduced emissions of SO2, NOx and PM10 are referred to as local environmental benefits
(LEBS) . Reduced emissions of CO2 are global environmental benefits (GEBS). The total of traditional
         12

economic benefits plus LEBS plus GEBS will be compared with the economic costs of the project to derive
the net present value of the net benefit stream and the economic internal rate of return. All costs will be
estimated in real terms and discounting will be at 10 percent per year unless a different rate is justified for an
individual country. All projects within the same country will be evaluated using the same discount rate for
projects evaluated during the same year.

7.      It is anticipated that the economic analysis will provide a clear and rational basis for synchronizing
various renewable energy support programs within countries. Typically, domestic funding should be
provided to monetize LEBS while GEF or other carbon funds should be used to monetize GEBS. An
incremental cost per ton of CO2 reduction will be calculated for each project but the ongoing test of
economic viability will only be applied to the total GeoFund portfolio.

8.      In addition to the base case net benefit analysis, a full set of sensitivity analyses will be provided to
indicate project dependence on key input assumptions.

Financial Analysis

9.      The Financial Intermediary character of the GeoFund will call for (a) an assessment of the selected
financial intermediary (IFC as Executing Agency), and (b) the methodology to be used for providing a
financial analysis of the individual subprojects.

    a) Financial Intermediary. International Finance Cooperation (IFC)

    b) Financial Analysis of IGA

    c) Financial Analysis of individual subprojects. Financial Due Diligence requires in the context of the
        individual subprojects that two distinct objectives are fulfilled:

           to assure that the project owner is a financially sound and sustainable entity which will not go
           bankrupt during the implementation of the project thereby putting the project at risk; and

           to assure that the project itself is financially sound and feasible, given its financing plan and
           operational projections. This will mitigate against the risk that the project may fail and/or add a
           major financial burden to the project owner.

Project Owner Analysis for World Bank Implemented Projects

10.     The project owner analysis will normally be based on the last three to five years' financial results
and evolving financial position to date, as well as three to five years of financial projections for the project
owner. Thus, the owner will provide financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets and


12Quantification of LEBs is difficult although the development of the EXTERNE LE model by the EU has greatly
  simplified this task for the countries that it covers. For other countries, the GeoFund will provide a default set of unit
  costs that can be used to assure consistency across projects being evaluated for any given country.



                                                             57

fund flow statements for the past three to five years. He further will provide a commentary about the
financial performance and explanations as to unusual events in the financial performance. An audit report for
each of the years under review will also be provided if available.

11.      Projections will again be based on projected income statements, balance sheets and fund flow
statements for the next three to five years. Both historic and projected statements will highlight in appropriate
ratios the financial performance. Typical ratios will be the operating costs over total income, profitability,
and return on investments and on equity, current ratios and debt service coverage ratios.

12.      The information provided by the project owner will be reviewed by, and discussed with the
responsible Task Manager who will subsequently make its own analysis to assure that the project owner is
likely to have a sound and sustained financial performance. The analysis will be reflected in summary form
in the Project Appraisal Document.

Subproject Analysis for World Bank Implemented Projects

13.      The financial analysis of subprojects will be based on estimated project investment costs, the
envisaged financing plan as well as projections for project implementation, learning curve of project
operations, costs of inputs and revenues from sale of the outputs, debt schedules and depreciation plans.

14.      The time horizon for financial projections of the subproject will cover the life cycle of the envisaged
project, including needed re-investments and possible scrap values at the end of the projection period.

15.      The projections should be in real terms. The analysis will provide for calculations of net present
values (NPVs), internal rates of return (IRRs) on the overall investment and on equity, before and after tax.
The risk profile of the subproject will be discussed and documented by providing appropriate sensitivity and
risk analyses. The impact of provision of grants on the projected ratios will also be documented by using
appropriate sensitivity analyses.

                                       Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                   (GEOFUND)
1.       The GeoFund includes multiple subprojects. The depth and breadth of EA and choice of EA
instrument(s) for each component or each subproject is decided on the basis of its respective potential
impacts and risks. The GeoFund Environmental Framework that was disclosed at the Infoshop on June 15,
2006 spells out the requirements with regard to social/environmental safeguards and will require each
subproject to comply with the World Bank's safeguard policies. Each subproject will be individually
assigned safeguard and environmental screening categories. All subprojects are expected to trigger the
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01) safeguard policy.

2.       Safeguard policy compliance assessment of subprojects will involve a social and environmental
assessment of the proposed project with all its implications. This assessment will review the project
sponsor's capacity to implement the safeguard policies recommendations and, if the capacity is insufficient,
propose measures to bring this capacity to the required level. Thus, for every subproject an ISDS as well as
EMPs will be prepared by the project sponsor and will be reviewed in the Bank.

3.       Responsibility for the screening and execution of subprojects will be either with the Bank or
delegated to the Intermediary of the grant. The Bank requires that each intermediary screens proposed
subprojects and ensure that recipients carry out appropriate EIA for each subproject. Before approving a
subproject, the intermediary verifies that the subproject meets the environmental requirements of appropriate
national and local authorities and is consistent with the environmental policies of the Bank. Responsibilities
of intermediary concerning safeguards requirements will be detailed in the Memorandum of Agreement
and/or GeoFund Environmental Framework.

4.       The performance of the energy sector potentially affects the environment. A key feature of the
Project is the promotion of amendments to policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks that improve the
competitiveness of geothermal energy. This is expected to contribute to environmentally sustainable growth
and resource management. Through endorsing project activities, client countries subscribe to integrate such
amendments into their relevant sector reforms to enhance the Project's environmental benefits.

5.       The project facilitates improved and transparent management of natural resources through increased
use of the clean and renewable geothermal energy (and the decreased use of the polluting and depletable
fossil fuels). It directly reduces vulnerability of the poor to environmental change through the reduction of
CO2, which mitigates climate change. Furthermore, the Project protects people's health from pollution
through reducing the emissions of such local pollutants as NOx, SO2 and PM10.

6.       Monitoring of the above environmental benefits is made easy through the monitoring of the
associated parameters: reductions in the emissions of CO2, NOx, SO2 and PM10.

7.       Potential environmental issues could be the handling and disposal of drilling mud, of geothermal
brines, contamination of ground and surface water, subsidence, increased seismicity, impact on surface as
well as noise generation during project implementation and operations. These environmental impacts are
typically limited and can be handled by appropriate management actions. Thus the projects are typically
classified as Category B projects under World Bank guidelines, unless major environmental impacts are to be
expected.

8.       As an example for attention to social/environmental aspects of a specific project, the Stargard
Geothermal DH Project is highlighted here. It was designated a Category B project for environmental/social
safeguard purposes. That project, almost complete, will establish a geothermal base-load heating plant with
an installed capacity of about 14 MWt opposite the site of the coal fired heat plant of the District Heating
Company PEC Stargard. The Project includes two new wells (production and re-injection well) drilled near
the existing district heat plant to a depth of about 2,700 meters and the above ground connections to the
existing district heating system. Aboveground plant components include a new building, which will house


                                                         59

heat exchangers, electrical equipment and installations, process equipment and controls and the piping
connection to the existing district heating network of Stargard. Total project investment costs are estimated
to be US$8.6 million. Geothermal heat will be used to displace some of the heat previously provided by
Stargard's existing coal-fired boilers.

9.      The main risks ex ante for environmental damage and impacts were as follows:

                 Risk of damaging soil and road surfaces during construction works;

                 Risk of intrusion of geothermal water into the surface or deeper layers of the ground during
                 well drilling;

                 Risk of contamination of ground water during well drilling;

                 Risk of damaging impact on the surface of the liquid waste generated by the process of
                 washing out the cuttings during drilling;

                 Risk of de-stabilization of geological formations caused by well drilling;

                 Risk of causing damage to environmentally sensitive areas on the ground;

10.     These risks were minimized through appropriate mitigation measures as per the EMP of 2002,
prepared in close cooperation between the Geotermia Stargard staff and a visiting World Bank team.

11.     Construction is now almost complete and the system is about to start operations. There are several
identified environmental impacts during the imminent operation phase:

                 Impact on the nearby Ina river of geothermal water discharged from a retention reservoir,
                 constructed to safely retain geothermal brine during the drilling process and the cleaning of
                 the geothermal plant filters during operations;

                 Potential impact on the ground water of geothermal water stored in the reservoir as a result
                 of unexpected leakage;

                 Noise generated in the surface plant around the DH pumps.

12.     These impacts are minimized through agreed measures as follows:

                 Discharged brines will be diluted with cleaned municipal sewage waters;

                 Ground water contamination to be monitored to allow timely counter measures;

                 Noise abatement below 70 dB will be sufficient in the industrial area location.

13.     The EMP of 2002 has been updated to reflect additional requirements for operations of the plant
(discharge of limited amounts of geothermal brine). These measures illustrate how environmental risks can
be mitigated successfully.

14.     As can be seen from the example above, and based on experience gained in other earlier geothermal
projects the main risks for environmental damage and impacts during construction and drilling are as
follows:

                 Risk of damaging soil and road surfaces during construction works;

                 Risk of intrusion of geothermal water into the surface or deeper layers of the ground during
                 well drilling;

                 Risk of contamination of ground water during well drilling;

                 Risk of damaging impact on the surface of the liquid waste generated by the process of
                 washing out the cuttings during drilling;

                 Risk of de-stabilization of geological formations caused by well drilling;


                                                       60

                 Risk of causing damage to environmentally sensitive areas on the ground;

15.     Social safeguards concerns are to be addressed through public consultation, invitation of
representatives of appropriate groups of people to participate in both administration procedures: for the
"construction permit" and the "water permits". Especially those local residents potentially affected by the
project in any significant way should be invited. In category A projects, at least two public consultations will
be carried out: ex ante, and after completion of the environmental impact assessment and prior to
implementing the project.

1.       Project preparation has been carried out by a team of World Bank staff, with the cooperation of staff
from the GEF, consultants, as well as government officials and private sector actors in recipient countries.
Ministries of Environment have been the prime counterpart for GEF/World Bank in requesting GEF support
and endorsing participation in the project. The ministries in charge of energy matters and the energy
regulatory agencies have been key partners in preliminary discussions concerning the future implementation
of policy reviews and amendments.

2.       A PDF B grant in the amount of US$700,000 has been received from the GEF for the preparation of
the Project. (One of the prospective client countries of the project, Bulgaria, has obtained a PHRD grant of
US$770,000 to assess the country's geothermal resources and to help prepare two geothermal projects. This
financing is, however, not part of the financing plan of the project.)

                                     Annex 15: Incremental Cost Analysis

    EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                  (GEOFUND)
A. Purpose of Incremental Cost Analysis

1.      Since its inception, GEF has relied heavily on incremental cost analysis to guide its allocation of
funds to projects and to programs based on unit abatement costs expressed as the cost in US$ per MT of CO2
equivalent reduction over the economic life of the proposed project or program. Incremental costs are
defined in economic rather than financial terms. This core GEF concept was established to counter early
fears that GEF interventions in project support would distort domestic investment priorities through support
of specific reductions in emissions of air pollutants that may have been lower priorities than investments in
improved water quality, for example. To neutralize the impact of interventions in projects that are designed
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, GEF direct supports were limited to coverage of the incremental
economic costs. Thus, investors considering such projects would be encouraged to invest in a more
expensive, but cleaner alternatives. GEF policies were then broadened to focus on barrier removal for
groups of similar projects that were similarly disadvantaged by existing markets and/or energy policies.
Recognition was also given to innovative projects that were seen as influential beyond measurable single
project impacts.

2.      Incremental economic costs expressed as unit abatement costs (US$/MT of CO2 reduction) also
provide a basis for judging the relative efficacy of investments in alternative projects using the same or
similar technologies. For a given level of GEF support, the biggest "bang for the buck" would be achieved
by choosing those projects with the lowest unit abatement costs.

3.      The GeoFund has been designed to provide specialized GEF-funded support for geothermal projects
that addresses both the general barriers faced by renewable energy projects and challenges that are unique to
geothermal technology. GEF incremental cost analysis is thus a logical guide to project selection and barrier
analysis is a logical guide to determination of the type and level of support to be provided to individual
projects. While incremental cost analysis provides the economic rationale for projects selected for GeoFund
support, geothermal projects have unique risk characteristics that may make needed private investment
impossible to secure. In such cases, a compelling barrier analysis may justify GeoFund support for a
particular project that differs from the calculated incremental costs.

4.      As noted in Annex 9, incremental cost and barrier analyses will provide both the basis for overall
economic justification of the GeoFund and the primary methodology for selection of projects to be supported
and for design of the support packages offered to those projects. The following sections build the conceptual
foundation for the framework incremental cost analysis. Annex 15 provides the generic incremental cost
model for project analysis. This model is then applied to a specific Hungarian project in Annex 20. The
Annex 20 case study clearly illustrates the kinds of modifications that will often be needed in applying the
generic model to specific case studies.

B. Broad Energy Sector Development Objectives in the ECA Region

5.      Primary energy use will double over the coming decade in the ECA region if economic growth
projections are met. To achieve increases in energy supply without additional pollution-related impacts from
coal burning and threats of global climate change, the countries of the region will need to continue to
improve energy efficiency and diversify away from fossil fuels.

6.      Over the longer term, the only option for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an
expansion of non-carbon energy sources. To tap the full potential of renewable energy sources, the countries
must adopt new market-oriented energy sector development strategies and increase investment in research,
development, demonstration and dissemination of the most promising technologies, including geothermal
solutions.



                                                        68

7.       Within the ECA region, the World Bank is addressing the challenges to the energy sector along the
following four broad areas of intervention and support:

                 Delivery Efficiency: Improving the quality and technical efficiency of energy services.

                 Financial Efficiency: Creating fiscal space by eliminating or restructuring subsidies and
                 improving economic efficiency in the energy sector.

                 Sub regional Integration: Creating regional energy markets and achieving economic
                 efficiency through cooperation and power trading.

                 Mitigation of adverse environmental impacts: Fuel switching, plant upgrades, and the
                 promotion of renewable energy sources and demand side energy efficiency.

8.       The World Bank is promoting sustainable energy in ECA within a framework of market-based
incentives. Based on this strategic approach, two primary areas of focus have emerged to promote sustainable
energy development in ECA:

                 To establish a supportive policy framework and to create investment opportunities:
                 Establishing a supportive policy framework by addressing the institutional and financial
                 barriers and constraints includes providing advice on policies and laws related to renewable
                 energy and energy efficiency, as well as supporting and establishing national institutions that
                 help with policy implementation and project preparation.

                 Creating investment opportunities for private sector investment: and participation in
                 renewable and energy efficiency projects includes developing projects that demonstrate
                 innovative financing, risk-sharing structures, and technical approaches, as well as creating
                 regional or national funding or insurance mechanisms.

C. Current Barriers to Strategic Integration of Geothermal Energy Sources into Energy Sector
Development in the ECA Region

9.       Geothermal energy represents a vast, rarely tapped energy source in most countries of the region. It
is renewable and thus environmentally friendly. It is insensitive to external shocks ­ such as weather
influences and oil price fluctuations. Finally, it is increasingly cost effective and is becoming commercially
viable under ideal circumstances.

10.      Despite a large resource potential and government commitment to clean energy, the contribution of
geothermal sources to the region's current energy supply is very small due to a number of market and non-
market barriers.

11.      The major barrier to the exploitation of geothermal energy is the high financial risk in comparison
not only with the use of natural gas and also compared to most other forms of renewable energy. A
geothermal resource must also be close to an area of high demand. Only countries (e.g. France, Iceland or
Indonesia), which have underwritten the risks at both the reservoir assessment and drilling stage, have been
able to induce systematic development of geothermal resources.

12.      A second major barrier is represented by uneven regulatory playing fields that favor und often
subsidize fossil fuels, and do not pay attention to the specific risk, resource and operating characteristics of
geothermal fields. There is a lack of published technical, financial and legislative information for developers,
particularly comparing the investment climate for geothermal investments in different countries of the ECA
region.

13.      Development risks are high and prediction of the quality of a resource requires capital investment in
drilling and well tests. Unproven resource availability implies a high degree of uncertainty as to the success
of geothermal development. This is linked to technology constraints, which imply a limited ability to
establish certainty on resource availability.



                                                         69

14.      Geothermal development requires considerable up-front investment, which is related to exploration,
appraisal and production drilling. In this regard investors face funding constraints, which are due to political,
resource, technical and commercial risks. If funds are available, be it equity or loan funding, these risks
translate into a significant risk mark-up.

15.      Commercial risk is highly linked to tariffs and to their recovery rate. Tariffs have to be sufficiently
high to allow for cost recovery and an appropriate return on equity. But conditions must also provide for an
appropriate recovery rate, which means that PPAs have to be executed in a reliable manner. This in turn will
depend on an appropriate recovery rate on the retail level. In this regard the paying attitude of public clients,
usually representing the majority of sales, is crucial.

16.      The combination of relatively small world wide geothermal project portfolios coupled with high
front-end investment requirements and substantial front-loaded risk profiles contribute to the sparsity of
lending institutions that are willing to provide debt financing for geothermal projects.

17.      The above-mentioned investment barriers translate into risk and thus into high return on equity
expectations of investors and punitive terms on debt financing. Risks thus dampen investor enthusiasm for
geothermal projects. As a result, competition is limited when geothermal projects are tendered. The barrier
circle is completed as limited competition and lending capacity leads to high tariffs that restrict potential
consumer interest in purchasing geothermal project outputs.

18.      Major generic barriers that retard the increased utilization of renewable energy resources in the
region are:

                  The lack of expertise and know-how about RER among energy sector decision makers at
                  government-, industry- and local consulting firm levels;

                  Issues of ECA countries' energy markets, including poor energy policies (e.g. high subsidies
                  for fossil-fuels, energy tariffs not covering costs, failures to recognize the external costs of
                  fossil fuel use), inadequate and non-transparent legal, regulatory and institutional
                  frameworks, leading to uncertainties in the industry and to a bias in favor of fossil fuels, and

                  High transaction costs due to the typically small size of RER projects compared to the large
                  fossil-fuel-based projects.

19.      Technology-inherent barriers to geothermal energy include:

                  High up-front costs relative to conventional technologies (due to the need of identifying the
                  geothermal deposits and drilling the high cost production/re-injection wells), and

                  The associated geological risks both during well construction/testing and operation.

                  The barriers associated with the management of geological risk appear to be among the most
                  difficult ones to tackle. Geological risks can be summarized as follows:

20.      Exploration risks:

                  Dry well or insufficiently productive reservoir

                  Lower than expected (or decreasing during operation) yield of the aquifer

                  Lower than predicted temperature of geothermal fluid

                  Lower than expected geo-physical/geo-chemical parameters of geothermal fluid (i.e. high
                  TDS, high non-condensable gas content)

21.      Re-injection risks:

                  Insufficient ability of the reservoir rocks to absorb the returned geothermal fluid




                                                          70

                   Thermal draw down

22.      While investors and financiers are prepared for and willing to take economic/financial risks and
conventional technology risks, the special knowledge that pertains to the assessment and handling of
geological risks is often beyond the experience and capacity of both potential energy investors and lenders
which reduces their willingness to undertake geothermal projects. While oil and gas industries face similar
risks, the end products are typically valued in international markets at much higher levels than the heat
and/or electricity output of geothermal projects which are often priced below cost as social necessities.

23.      The above issues that relate to the technology inherent investment hurdles are common to all ECA
countries. Financial barriers show a less even picture across the Region as these have a lot to do with the
availability of public and private equity finance, the performance of the banking system, the general
investment climate, and economic development in a given country. Financial barriers tend to be less
significant in the western parts of the ECA Region, i.e. in the countries that have recently joined the
European Union (EU) or are designated EU accession countries, but can be prohibitive in the countries
further east, i.e. FSU countries and the Balkans. Even in well-developed capital markets, risk aversion
accentuated by a lack of familiarity with certain technologies often leads to punitive lending terms and high
hurdle rates or return on equity investments.

24.      In light of this array of barriers to geothermal progress, a central focus of the GeoFund will be to
assist a portfolio of geothermal projects in ways that demonstrate how barrier mitigation can enhance the
legitimate role of geothermal projects in the energy sector of the region.

D. The Role of Incremental Cost Analysis in GeoFund Portfolio Selection

25.      Incremental cost analysis has a long and well-established history as a central criterion in the selection
of projects and programs for support by GEF. For that reason, the GeoFund will also rely heavily, but not
exclusively, on incremental cost analysis as a component of the justification for both the overall program and
for individual projects to be included in that program. At the same time, the focal point of the GeoFund is on
barrier reduction under GEF program OP-6. This section defines the anticipated interplay of incremental
cost analysis and barrier reduction analysis in screening projects and in defining the level and type of support
for specific projects.

26.      Incremental costs for a project are defined as the difference between the economic costs of the
proposed GEF project and a baseline development that provides the same level of outputs. Annex 9 has
defined three categories of economic costs and benefits that will be analyzed for all projects that are
considered for GeoFund support. Benefits in this context are simply the avoided costs from baseline delivery
of the proposed project outputs. Traditional economic costs for the proposed project equal the sum of all
operating and investment costs valued at economic prices and expressed in constant terms (excluding normal
inflation). These are essentially the out of pocket costs for the project with fuel prices recalibrated to
international levels and all general inflation removed. Local environmental costs constitute the second
category. These costs relate to the effects on health, buildings and crops from emissions that are generated
due to project related combustion of fossil fuels. This includes direct combustion by the project or indirect
combustion caused by the project by consumption of electricity. The third cost category relates to the global
environment. Emissions of greenhouse gasses expressed in tons of CO2 equivalents are converted to
economic costs/benefits based on the current willingness to pay for CO2 reductions.

27.      The following hypothetical example clarifies these concepts. The proposed project has traditional
costs that exceed the traditional costs of the baseline project by US$40 million expressed as a present value
over a twenty year life cycle of the project. This disadvantage is partially offset by the reduced damages to
the local environment associated with the proposed project. The upshot is total incremental costs of US$40 -
US$20 = US$20 million. Since CO2 emissions over the life cycle of the proposed project are reduced by 20
million tons, the incremental cost per ton of CO2 is a very attractive US$1.00. Willingness to pay for CO2
reductions in JI projects currently is near US$6.00 per ton while prices in the EU ETS system have ranged to



                                                        71

levels well above US$20 per ton. Since the incremental cost is well below the economic value, provision of
GEF support to this project can easily be economically justified. GEF could provide up to US$20 million
without exceeding the incremental cost of the project. However, it is further assumed that a barrier analysis
has shown that only US$12 million would be necessary to make this project viable. (This could happen, for
example, if domestic supports for the project would provide coverage for US$8 million of the local
environmental benefits.) The GeoFund would then provide GEF support of US$12 million to the project
which would remove the barriers that were preventing project implementation.13

28.      The final condition for GEF support is that the project must be economically and financially viable
under established World Bank due diligence testing. With 20 million tons of CO2 valued at US$6.00 per ton,
the total economic benefits of the project exceed the economic costs by US$100 million with all discounting
at 12 percent and economic viability is easily demonstrable. It is further assumed, although not illustrated in
the table, that the financial rate of return and debt service coverage will be sufficient to justify the project.

29.      Two essential features of the proposed GeoFund vetting system emerge from this illustrative
analysis. First, the primary ranking criterion for project selection will be the incremental cost per ton of CO2
with the lowest cost projects being given priority. It should be noted, however, that political, geographical,
and technological diversity will also be considered in project ranking to manage the risk of the portfolio and
to maximize the impact of the GeoFund. Second, the primary determinant of the amount and type of support
provided will be based on the type of barrier that is considered most critical. With any less support, the
project will not be implemented. Any more support would be redundant. This approach honors the historic
GEF commitment to incremental cost analysis as a guide to utilization of their funds and the intended focus
of the GeoFund on barrier removal.

30.      To summarize, incremental costs will be used to guide project selection for GeoFund support in the
following ways:

         Incremental economic costs per expected ton of CO2 reduction will be calculated as part of each
         project application.

         Economic analyses of each project that offers incremental costs lower than the then current
         willingness to pay for CO2 equivalent reductions will be prepared in conformance with World Bank
         standards.

         Economically viable projects with incremental costs per ton below the willingness to pay will be
         deemed eligible for GeoFund support.


13Note that the figures are purely illustrative. The GeoFund will not fund any single project at this level.


                                                             72

          Priorities among project applications in any given GeoFund funding cycle will generally be based on
          incremental costs per ton of CO2 although the GeoFund will also seek balance across project sizes,
          technologies, and geographic distribution to enhance the total impact of the GeoFund in geothermal
          barrier reduction.

          The general target for the value of support provided to any given project will be for the GeoFund to
          remove the estimable barriers that would otherwise prohibit project implementation.

          Given a clear project-based illustration of the barriers to attractive geothermal projects in a specific
          country, technical assistance funding for policy reforms that will materially reduce the operative
          barriers can be considered for GeoFund support. Applications for such support should include
          performance targets in terms of the number of geothermal projects that will be realized within a
          defined time horizon as a result of the recommended policy reforms.

31.       This use of incremental cost analysis and barrier targeting at the project level will assure GEF that
the total GeoFund program will comprise economically justified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and
will be focused on maximal reductions in the barriers that currently restrain geothermal development below
its legitimate economic potential in the eligible regions.

E. Barrier Analysis

32.       Section B above characterized the most critical barriers to completion of economically viable
geothermal projects as inherent technological risk, inadequate recognition of the total cost of fossil fuel
combustion, consequent lack of attractive debt financing for these capital intensive projects and project
portfolios that are too small in size and number to realize the lowest possible per unit costs. Section C
indicates that quantification of these barriers for the specific projects chosen for GeoFund support will
provide the primary determinant of the type and amount of assistance to be provided. This section discusses
the kinds of barrier analysis that are envisioned for these purposes.

33.       Incremental cost analysis for GEF purposes is economic in nature and is designed to ensure that
projects and programs selected for support will contribute positively to economic development objectives of
the host country. Barrier analysis can also be economic if the envisaged project investments are likely to be
funded by public agencies in accordance with public investment criteria. However, throughout the ECA
region the demands for public investment in infrastructure are substantial and the access to resources for such
investments is extremely limited. Thus, it is expected that many, if not most, of the projects seeking
GeoFund support will involve substantial private investment. For such cases, the appropriate focus for
barrier analysis will shift to financial rather than economic analysis. The intent must be to elevate the
selected projects to financially viable status from a private investment perspective. Anything short of that
will be unlikely to materially accelerate geothermal development in this region.

34.       Because of the key role of risk in restraining geothermal development, the primary support window
for the GeoFund has been established as a risk insurance program. Projects to be supported through this
window will need to provide a financial analysis of their project that clearly defines the financing structure
and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) with and without GeoFund risk insurance. The ideal project
for this type of support relies on leveraged equity investment to achieve the necessary hurdle rate of return on
equity in light of the risk profile of the project. The operative barrier is then in finding debt finance on terms
that will achieve both adequate debt service coverage, total project FIRR and return on equity. The GeoFund
support for such projects from this window will be defined as the cost of providing the necessary risk
guarantee to allow access to the needed debt financing to achieve all acceptable rates of return.

35.       The GRI Scheme of the GeoFund will partially insure project developers/investors against the short-
term, up-front geological risk of exploration, and the medium-term geological risk associated with the
unexpected deterioration of the performance of the geothermal doublet over time. In the case of medium-
term geological risks, the geological risk insurance will provide for a stream of pre-defined payments over



                                                         73

some time (typically until long-term loans have matured), to make up for lower than estimated revenues,
and/or higher than estimated operating costs. Thus, the Scheme will be a Geological Risk Scheme with
covenanted risk coverage. The Scheme will be partial, to motivate project sponsors to carry out a sound and
thorough geological investigation and avoid moral hazard. The main purpose of the Geological Risk
Insurance Scheme is to provide help to project developers to obtain adequate commercial lending for their
project.

36.     In addressing the second critical barrier of inadequate recognition of the full cost of fossil fuel use,
GeoFund support will be limited by two sets of parameters. First, support will not exceed the reasonably
estimated external costs of the specific fossil fuel combustion that is avoided. Support beyond that level
would lead to market distortion rather than market correction. As discussed in Annex 9, the EXTERNE LE
model developed for the EU can be used for estimation of these costs for all current EU member countries.
For countries outside the EU, standard costs per unit will be adopted for GeoFund evaluation purposes.
Second, all support provided from the client country except for supports directly related to CO2 emissions
will be deducted from the external costs to arrive at the eligible amount for GeoFund support. Examples of
the kinds of support that are now available include the following:

             Current legislative support of renewable energy in Hungary is limited to the preferential buy-
             back of renewable electricity. A separate renewable energy law is currently being prepared. This
             law envisages decentralized support and promotion of local use, as well as state insurance for
             loans to set up renewable energy enterprises.

             Energy companies in Poland are obliged to purchase electricity and heat from non-conventional
             energy sources or from renewables. Funding of geothermal/renewable energy projects is
             facilitated by such general environmental protection purpose funds as the National Fund for
             Environmental Protection and Water Management (loan funding, subsidy funding, equity
             funding) and the EcoFund (to channel part of the foreign debt of Poland into a fund intended to
             support environmental protection projects).

             In the Slovak Republic legislation obliges distribution companies to purchase electricity
             produced from renewable sources and heat suppliers to purchase heat from renewable or waste
             heat sources or from combined heat and power plants. There is also an income tax holiday for
             operators of renewable energy sources and combined heat and power production facilities in the
             first five years of operation.

37.     Most of the potential client countries of the GeoFund that are not yet EU members, and in particular
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, however, do not have an adequate policy
framework in place that transparently supports renewable energy broadly and geothermal energy in
particular. The envisaged role of participating countries' decision making entities in the collaborative effort
to increase the use of geothermal energy is to implement a legislative framework that is transparently
supportive of renewable/geothermal energy.

38.     The type and size of the support provided to any specific project will directly reflect the
demonstrable barriers that currently prohibit the development of that project. Thus, a project may apply for
support from both the guarantee window and the direct investment window when both types of barriers are
shown to apply. Technical assistance could also be sought for establishment of the appropriate barrier
removal supports.

39.     Within these broad guidelines, project sponsors must recognize that the choice of the type of
GeoFund supports sought and the demonstration of eligibility for those supports will be their responsibility.

F. The Benefits and Costs of the GeoFund Program

40.     The ECA Geothermal Energy Development Program (GeoFund) is responding to a number of ECA
countries that requested support to develop geothermal energy. The GeoFund follows a strategic approach in



                                                       74

providing assistance in barrier removal, financial support, and technical assistance in project preparation and
implementation to project developers in client countries to ultimately facilitate the implementation of
individual geothermal projects. The GeoFund will be an umbrella for many geothermal subprojects in
participating ECA countries. It will support the development of geothermal energy for electricity generation,
district heat, and other heating applications in the following ways:

             Provision of technical assistance and capacity building to transfer know-how and to establish a
             geothermal database and capacities to develop and implement geothermal energy projects.

             Support of capital investments in geothermal energy development projects.

             Development of reforms in policy and in the legal regulatory and institutional framework of the
             energy market.

41.      One of the GeoFund's principal objectives is to facilitate the creation of an enabling
business/regulatory environment in participating countries of the ECA Region in which the development of
geothermal energy becomes attractive to investors. In this way, the Project directly supports the GEF
Operational Program #6: Promoting the adoption of renewable energy by removing barriers and reducing
implementation costs. In so much as the construction of geothermal plants requires the
upgrading/modernization of existing district heating networks, or combined heat and power plants, the
Project also supports the removal of barriers to energy efficiency and energy conservation, although this is
not formally claimed here.

42.      In addition to meeting eligibility criteria related to GEF Operational Program #6, the GeoFund
responds to such strategic priorities of GEF as:

             Increased Access to Local Sources of Financing for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
             (CC-2): One key objective of the GeoFund is to facilitate the access of geothermal investments
             to financing through the GeoFund (see later) to be established under the Project;

             Power Sector Policy Frameworks Supportive of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (CC-
             3): One key component of the GeoFund is technical assistance to support improvements to
             policy frameworks supportive of renewable energy;

             Productive Uses of Renewable Energy (CC-4): While implementation of the GeoFund will
             already result in increased geothermal energy use for such productive purposes as heating (DH,
             individual and other) and industrial and agricultural applications (wood drying, fish farming,
             greenhouses, etc.), its long-term outcome will be an improved policy and market environment,
             leading to further geothermal applications.

Global Environmental Benefits

43.      The GeoFund's global objective is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the interest of climate
change mitigation through a systematic and streamlined implementation of geothermal projects. Thus, the
Project would help participating countries in the Region in their efforts to reduce the emissions of
greenhouse gases in compliance with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and further, in view of the
fact that countries of the Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA Countries) are large emitters of these gases
on a GDP per capita basis.

44.      The principal outcome of the GeoFund for the global environment will be the reduction of CO2
emissions. By using geothermal energy, fossil fuel burning will be reduced. Geothermal power and heating
plants emit only excess steam and very few trace gases resulting in dramatic reductions in total emissions of
CO2 compared to coal fired plants.

45.      The GeoFund is estimated to displace about 4 million tons of coal equivalent and to achieve CO2
reductions in an overall amount of approximately 6 million tons of CO2eq over the lifetime of the GeoFund.




                                                          75

Additional Domestic Benefits

46.      In addition to global environmental benefits, the GeoFund would result in significant local
environmental benefits. Renewable energy projects result in substantial reductions in the emissions of
particulates, sulfur, and nitrous oxides. Detailed estimates of the amount of particulates and sulfur that can be
reduced over the life of the Program and the related economic costs from damages to health, buildings and
crops will be quantified during the preparation of specific subprojects.

Incremental Costs

47.      Exploitation of geothermal resources in the countries targeted by the GeoFund is constrained by the
above-described barriers. Development of new sites and the associated environmental benefits will be
unlikely in absence of the GeoFund. To achieve maximum impact, the GeoFund follows a strategic approach
in providing assistance in barrier removal, geological risk insurance, financial support and technical
assistance in project preparation and implementation to project developers in client countries to ultimately
facilitate the implementation of individual geothermal projects. The GeoFund will be an umbrella for many
geothermal subprojects in participating ECA countries and will involve the provision of:

         1. Technical assistance (US$7 million) for the following purposes:

         a) Capacity building to remove knowledge barriers: transfer of know-how. The availability of
             geothermal resources, modes of occurrence, and methods of utilization will be assessed and
             comprehensive geothermal data bases will be established. Thus, the existence of geothermal
             resources in the participating ECA Countries will be confirmed or demonstrated.

         b) Policy reviews and amendments: Energy sector policies and legal, regulatory and institutional
             frameworks in participating ECA countries will be systematically reviewed to identify key
             barriers towards the use of RER. Policy reforms and framework improvements, which would
             reduce the bias in favor of fossil fuels, will be developed.

         c) TA support for project preparation and implementation: Feasible geothermal projects will be
             supported with technical assistance and capacity building, assisting project developers to
             prepare, implement and operate their investments.

         2. Financial assistance (US$18 million) supporting project developers through:

         a) Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) Scheme (US$10 million)

         The GRI Scheme of the GeoFund will partially insure project developers/investors against the short-
         term, up-front geological risk of exploration, and the medium-term geological risk associated with
         the unexpected deterioration of the performance of the geothermal doublet over time. In the case of
         medium-term geological risks, the geological risk insurance will provide for a stream of pre-defined
         payments over some time (typically until long-term loans have matured), to make up for lower than
         estimated revenues, and/or higher than estimated operating costs. Thus, the Scheme will be a
         Geological Risk Scheme with covenanted risk coverage. The Scheme will be partial, to motivate
         project sponsors to carry out a sound and thorough geological investigation and avoid moral hazard.
         The main purpose of the Geological Risk Insurance Scheme is to provide help to project developers
         to obtain adequate commercial lending for their project.

         b) Direct Investment Funding (DIF) Window (US$8 million)

         The DIF Window will provide contingent grants, low cost loans or, in limited cases, grant financing,
         thereby covering part of the project cost through monetization of external benefits. The amount and
         mode of allocation of these funds will depend on the level of financial barriers in the client countries.
         The grants and contingent grants would be particularly important where, due to distortions in the
         energy and financial markets, only demonstration projects could be implemented to help highlight
         the substantial benefits of geothermal energy development. Only in very specific cases, i.e. in a


                                                        76

         country with significant barriers but with a government willing to substantially modify its legal,
         regulatory and institutional framework to reduce these barriers, some straight grant funding could be
         considered to enable such demonstrations.

Incremental Cost Matrix

48.      Incremental cost analyses will guide the GeoFund at two levels. At the program or framework level,
the incremental cost analysis can best be visualized in the following matrix. It is anticipated that the
GeoFund will support approximately 10 geothermal projects that will have collective incremental costs of
about US$25 million. It is further anticipated that the barriers for the projects selected for GeoFund support
can be removed through three support windows as shown below. Finally, generic calculations suggest that
the resulting CO2 reductions from these projects will be approximately six million tons of CO2eq over the
lives of the subprojects. Thus, the program unit abatement cost is expected to be about US$4.17 per ton of
CO2 reduction. Since the various carbon funds administered by the World Bank are now willing to pay in
the range of US$6.00 per ton of CO2eq, economic justification of the program is evident if these general
parameters can be achieved.

GEF Program Total                                                                    US$25 million


49.      The incremental cost matrices for individual projects will have the same format and will provide the
detailed analyses necessary to construct the program ICA table above as the primary program monitoring
report. Annex 16 presents a detailed description of a generic economic model for a geothermal district
heating project. That model is then extended to provide the incremental cost and EIRR analysis for the
Hungarian geothermal power project in Annex 20.

GeoFund Illustrative Economic Model

50.      Annexes 9 and 15 have discussed economic and financial due diligence to meet World Bank due
diligence prerequisites and the role of incremental cost analysis in GEF screening of projects for support
through the GeoFund. Abstract discussions of the interplay between the economic, financial and incremental
costs analyses can easily be misinterpreted. Typically, the clearest way to confirm how the intended methods
are to be applied is through a specific case study that quantifies each of the critical results from the required
analyses. Although no case study will provide results that will cover all possibilities, the economic analysis
of a specific geothermal district heating project in Stargard, Poland offers one representative and clear
example of the calculations and the use of the results to support the application for GeoFund support. The




                                                        77

following table shows illustrative economic calculations for nine of the twenty years included in the analysis.
The spreadsheet that produces these results is available upon request from the GeoFund.

51.     The most important results are highlighted in grey and can be summarized as follows:

        The economic internal rate of return is 10.9 percent which is generally sufficient to demonstrate that
        the Project would meet World Bank due diligence testing that shows that the Project will contribute
        positively to the economic development of the host country. While evidence would need to be
        provided to identify the economic opportunity costs of capital on a risk-adjusted basis, results in
        excess of 10.0 percent for the EIRR would normally be satisfactory if Project risks were not
        excessive.

        The incremental economic costs of the Project compared to the baseline are about US$2.3 million
        while emissions of CO2eq are about 1.5 million tons over the 20 year period of analysis. This yields
        a per unit incremental cost of US$1.56 per tonne of CO2eq. That relatively low figure demonstrates
        that this Project is a cost-effective use of GEF funds to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses.
        There is no absolute standard that assures GeoFund support since applications in each given funding
        cycle will be compared to determine the most cost effective use of GEF funds during that cycle.
        However, historic experience suggests that results in this range should have very good prospects for
        obtaining GeoFund assistance.

        The GeoFund has been established based on the belief that many projects that are economically
        attractive and that offer low cost reductions in GHG emissions can still not be implemented because
        of numerous possible barriers. The identification and quantification of barriers is an important
        determinant of the kind and amount of assistance to be provided by the GeoFund. Obviously, this
        will be specific to a particular project and to the energy policies that apply in the host country. For
        the case study, a simple situation is cited in which the local environmental benefits attributable to
        reduced emissions of SO2, NOx and PM10 are only partially compensated. A financial analysis
        would normally be used to demonstrate the level of support needed to make the investment feasible.
        For the illustrative case, it is simply assumed that full compensation for local environmental benefits
        would be sufficient to realize the Project investment. In this case, GeoFund support may be set at
        US$3.1 million rather than US$2.3 million. The actual form of support to be provided would also be
        based on financial analysis that shows the perspective of the investors in the Project.

52.     It should be noted that GEF would normally desire to see some changes in domestic energy policy
that would render similar supports for future projects unnecessary. In other words, barrier removal should
apply to future similar projects as well as to the project now applying for GeoFund support. In this case, that
could be through more complete monetization of domestic environmental benefits and/or higher financial
penalties for relevant emissions that contribute to domestic damages.

Economic vs. Financial Model Concepts

54.         Typically, Project proponents who seek support from the GeoFund are likely to have a reasonably
developed financial model that provides the basis for their interest in pursuing their Project. Unfortunately,
financial and economic justifications are quite distinct despite frequent misuse of the terms on an
interchangeable basis. The economic model can draw heavily on the financial model but will also require
many elements that will not be found in the financial analysis. Some of the critical distinctions include:

            All monetary flows in financial models will typically be in nominal terms in the domestic currency.
            This is appropriate actual interest rates used for loans to the project will inherently include market
            expectations for domestic inflation. Economic models, however, will be developed in real terms
            (excluding general price escalation) and economic rates of return will reflect the opportunity costs of
            investing capital in the proposed Project.

            Financial models necessarily include consideration of all taxes and subsidies that apply to the
            project. Financial flows basically represent out-of-pocket costs and into pocket revenue streams as
            they will appear in the accounts of the project owner/operator. Heat, electric, and some fuel costs
            often appear in the financial analysis based on tariffs that do not reflect the full economic values for
            these key items. Even full cost tariffs are designed to recover historic investments plus current
            operating costs while economic costs look forward to incremental or decremental costs attributable



                                                                                                  80

         to the Project. Project use of labor that would otherwise be unemployed would enter the financial
         analysis at prevailing wage rates while the economic analysis would assign zero cost to these
         resources.

         Output streams from the proposed Project (heat and/or electricity) will be valued at market prices or
         tariffs for financial analysis. For economic analysis, these products will be valued based on the
         avoided cost of producing the same outputs in a different way.

         Emissions of pollutants will only have a cost in the financial analysis if there is an enforced system
         of fines or costs of permits. The economic evaluation will assign costs to these externalities based
         either on the cost of damages done or on the cost of required control, whichever is less.

         Financial analyses typically include analyses of the mix of debt and equity used to pay the
         investment costs. Annual analyses include repayment schedules for each loan, depreciation, and
         debt service coverage. The capital investment is represented on an annual basis as the sum of
         interest plus depreciation charges to allow calculation of taxable income on an accrual basis.
         Economic analysis is not encumbered by any consideration of debt financing or accrual accounting.

         Discount rates used to convert future monetary flows to present values are chosen differently for
         financial and economic analysis. Financial analysts will typically choose the weighted average cost
         of capital for the Project investor as the relevant concept. Economic analysts will use some estimate
         of the risk-adjusted opportunity cost of capital or the available return on the marginal projects being
         approved in the host country. Since this can be difficult to estimate accurately, World Bank
         conventions suggest use of a rate of 10 to 12 percent for typical situations.

         The period of analysis chosen for financial and economic analyses will often be distinct. Financial
         analyses are most concerned with showing viability over the period when loans to the Project are
         outstanding. Economic analysis is often over a longer period of time determined by the period over
         which benefits are expected to be realized. A nominal period of economic analysis for geothermal
         projects or 20 years should be conservative and can be reasonably adopted as a standard.

55.      Model Structure. The pro forma model consists of three worksheets. The first contains all of the
critical inputs to the economic model.

56.      The second sheet presents the economic analysis and derives all needed indicators including the
economic internal rate of return (EIRR), incremental costs, barriers, and effective incremental costs. The
EIRR will be used as the primary determinant of whether the Project is deemed to be in the national interest
in accordance with World Bank screening procedures. The EIRR derivation includes separate identification
of traditional economic benefits (TEBS), local environmental benefits (LEBS) and global environmental
benefits (GEBS). Incremental costs per ton of CO2 reduction are calculated to indicate whether the Project
is a cost effective investment in carbon reduction. Barriers to realization of the Project are then illustrated
and quantified to show what level of support is needed to implement the Project. For this illustration, it is
assumed that the barrier is inadequate compensation for the local environmental benefits of the geothermal
Project. Completion of these analyses will provide key inputs to GeoFund decisions on the amount and type
of support that could be provided to the Project.

57.      The third sheet provides a convenient summary of the reductions of emissions of each key pollutant
that will be realized due to the proposed Project. Both baseline and Project emissions are presented to show
the derivation of claimed reductions.

58.      Model Limitations. While this model fully illustrates the essential elements of the desired economic
analysis and is generally based on an actual geothermal district heating project that has been completed in
Poland, it does not provide a universal spreadsheet that will apply without modification to all projects.
Project applicants can use the conceptual approach that is illustrated here but will need to modify the model
as necessary to properly represent the specifics of their situation.



                                                         81

59.      There is also no claim that the generic estimates used in this model will apply to other situations.
Project applicants should take care to independently estimate the input parameters to reflect their specific
situation. This is particularly true for the environmental damage parameters. This model uses some vintage
estimates for the US and adjusts those estimates by the ratio of per capita income figures to obtain estimates
for the project location. The EXTERNE model that is now available is a preferred tool for development of
the environmental damage estimates on a per unit basis. The EXTERNE estimates can be used as inputs to
the pro forma model.

60.      The illustrative case study has been developed primarily in US$ although many estimates were
converted from Polish Zloty (PLN). It is often more convenient to develop the analysis in the local currency
and then to simply convert key results to EURO or US$ for reporting purposes. Of course, this will require
careful consideration of the exchange rates to be used and sensitivity to exchange rate forecasts should be
presented.

61.      Illustrative Project .The case study that is used to illustrate the economic calculations is a 14 MW
geothermal district heating project in Poland. The new geothermal wells were drilled at the district heating
plant site so the interconnection to the network is at the same location as the interconnection to the coal-fired
boiler plant that currently provides all of the heat supply. The investment cost for this Project was
approximately US$700 per kW of installed capacity. The geothermal output of about 310 TJ per year will be
used to cover baseload requirements of the district heating company. The total economic cost of the
geothermal heat is approximately US$4.40 per GJ assuming a 20 year life and 10 percent discount rate.

62.      Model Input Documentation. This section provides line by line descriptions for the model inputs on
worksheet 1 including what is needed and some discussion of alternative sources that may be used. The
illustrative inputs are also explained. In the spreadsheet, inputs are color coded yellow while calculations are
shown in blue.

      Line 7:          Enter the years of the construction/investment period. Two years beginning in 2005 are
      illustrated but longer periods may be appropriate for some projects. All discounting will be tied to the
      first year of the construction period which is referred to as the base year.

      Line 8           Enter the operating life of the Project. Most geothermal projects may last longer but the
      maximum figure that should be used here is 20 years. The economic analysis will extend for the
      number of years indicated here beyond the last year of the construction period. Please note that the
      model currently does not automatically adjust to the proper period of analysis based on the input. Use
      of a period different than 20 years will require appropriate modifications of the model.

      Line 9           Enter the investment outlays for each year of the investment period excluding all taxes
      and denominated at base year price levels. In the example, all costs are expressed at 2005 price levels.

      Line 10          Enter the installed capacity of the Project in net MW. Net MW are the total or gross
      MW installed less the average MW used to supply station demands. Net MW multiplied by the full
      load hours of operation in a year will equal the heat or electricity supplied to the purchaser at the sale
      point.

      Line 11          Enter the annual full load equivalent hours of operation of the Project. For district
      heating projects this will depend on the placement of the Project under the annual heat load duration
      curve. For the case study, the Project will be used for baseload supply yielding full load hours of
      operation of 6,000.

      Line 14          For the case study, the Project will use an estimated 7.20 kWh per GJ of output sold as
      shown in Line 37. This is primarily for operation of the production and reinjection wells since there is a
      very small distance between the well head and the entry point to the district heating network. This
      simple model assumes constant electric use for each operating year of the Project. Annual usage should
      be input if changes are anticipated over the operating lift of the Project.



                                                         82

Lines 16-19      Enter the specific annual costs at full load operation for maintenance, labor, general and
administrative and all other non-electric costs for the Proposed Project. If the project uses labor that
would otherwise be unemployed, the labor costs should be below what is actually paid in financial
terms. The case study estimates have been calculated from Stargard estimates assuming that 75 percent
of these costs are fixed and 25 percent vary in proportion to Project heat production.

Line 21          Enter the exchange rate between local currency and US$. If substantial changes are
expected in the future, the model should be modified to use the year by year estimates of the real
exchange rates that are expected.

Lines 25-36      This section provides the inputs needed for estimating the non-electric avoided costs
attributable to the Project. The baseline project used for comparison must be carefully identified using
well documented CDM and/or JI procedures for baseline evaluations. In concept the baseline
alternative is the most probable future scenario without consideration of carbon sales. For the
illustrative case study, the baseline study showed that the baseline alternative was continued supply of
all heat from the existing coal-fired boilers through 2014 and from new coal-fired boilers from 2015 on.
Thus, the avoided costs for 2007 ­ 2014 are just the marginal economic operating costs for the existing
coal boiler portfolio while the avoided costs beginning in 2015 reflect new coal boilers. Following the
language of CDM ACM002 for the electric sector, the period through 2014 bases avoided costs on the
baseline operating margin while the later period has avoided costs based on the build margin.

Line 26          Enter the average annual efficiency for the existing coal-fired boilers that are operating
on the margin during the hours that the geothermal Project is expected to operate.

Line 27          Enter the year when existing boilers will be retired and replaced with new boilers that
will operate on the margin. For the illustrative case, the most likely replacement will come in year 2015
and will again be coal-fired. However, the baseline study by the Project applicant should carefully
assess the build margin using established CDM or JI methodologies to show what type of capacity is
likely to be added and when.

Line 29          Enter the average efficiency for the replacement boilers that will be added in the future.
For the case study, those boilers are added in 2015 and are assumed to operate at 85 percent average
annual efficiency.

Line 30          Enter the delivered fuel price for the existing and replacement boilers. In the case study,
both will use coal. To avoid any distortions from domestic fuel pricing policies, the fuel prices reflect
border prices plus marginal delivery costs to the site of the baseline heat supply.

Line 31          Enter the calorific value of the fuel used in the baseline heat supply source.

Line 34          The illustrative model uses a simplified estimate of the variable non-fuel O&M costs
based on a percent of fuel costs. The illustrative percentage is 15 percent. More detailed costing may
be available and should be used if available. The percentage can be replaced by a direct estimate of the
US$/GJ for all non-fuel variable cost.

Line 35          Enter the cost/kW for the new boilers that will be added in the future. Be sure to include
all costs necessary to assure that the new boilers are fully compliant with all environmental and
efficiency regulations. The Czech Republic, for example, has established efficiency standards that must
be met for new and replacement district heat boilers for different sizes and fuels.

Line 37          This cell provides a simple way to represent all electric use associated with the proposed
Project operation. Note that in this case electric costs comprise almost half of the total operating costs
for the geothermal project. Since most electric use is typically associated with pumping, this is
represented on a kWh/GJ out basis.




                                                   83

Line 39         Enter the net efficiency of the marginal grid electric plants that are supplying electricity
to both the Project and the baseline source of heat supply. Net efficiency is calculated as the MWh
delivered to the Project divided by the fuel input in MWh to the marginal grid electric plants. CDM
methodology ACM0002 provides guidance on ways to identify the relevant margins. For Poland, the
existing plants that operate on the margin are fired with hard coal and operate at a net efficiency of 33
percent.

Line 40         Enter the year of the next anticipated significant capacity addition to the electric
generation portfolio of the grid. This year will provide the dividing point between the operating margin
and the build margin in the analysis of electric usage impacts.

Line 41         Enter the net efficiency of the new grid electric plant that defines the build margin.

Line 42         Enter an estimate of the grid electric plant non-fuel O&M costs as a percent of coal
costs. This will then apply to both existing and new plants with different efficiencies.

Line 44         This line contains four inputs that determine the fixed costs associated with the expected
new grid electric plants. The first input is the investment cost per kW. Figures for this can be obtained
from the USDOE Annual Energy Outlook or from IEA Studies on the Projected Cost of Electricity.
Costs should be adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect local conditions and should be tied to base
year dollars and should exclude all taxes. The investment cost is annualized using a capital recovery
factor (PMT function in Excel). For the case study, the CRF was set assuming a 20 year plant life and
10.0 percent discount rate. The third input is an estimate of the fixed O&M costs for new plants
expressed as a percentage of the investment cost. The fourth input is an estimate of the hours per year
that the new plant will operate. In the case study, the new plants are baseload plants that will operate
about 7,000 hours per year.

Line 45         Enter the kWh usage of the baseline heat supplies on a kWh/GJ out basis. For the case
study, the coal boilers used 1.85 kWh/GJ supplied which is about 25 percent of the geothermal
requirement.

Lines 49-51     These critical parameters are estimates of the costs per MT of SO2, NOx and
particulates whether they are emitted from coal fired heat-only boilers or from grid electric power
plants. A more refined model would distinguish these two sources. The inputs shown are for the U.S.
Adjustment from U.S. damage estimates to the host countries of GeoFund projects should be made
based on gross national income per capita basis with the GNI figures taken from the most recent World
Bank Development Indicators that is available on the web. As noted in the GeoFund PAD, applicants
can use and defend their own estimates of the damages per ton of each pollutant or they can rely on
figures provided by the GeoFund. Use of the EXTERNE model is encouraged as a way to get figures
for these important but difficult to estimate parameters.

Line 52         This figure can be provided by the GeoFund. It represents the current willingness to pay
for CO2 reductions expressed in US$/MT as established by the Carbon Finance Business (CFB) of the
World Bank.

Lines 53 -54    These are the current GNI per capita figures that are used to adjust U.S. figure to host
countries. The case study figures are from 2004.

Lines 59-61     The inputs here are emission factors from a 1990 study by Pace. Pace figures are
reported in pounds per MMBTU of fuel input. These are converted to lbs per GJ of fuel in. Applicants
can provide and defend alternative factors if appropriate for their situation. Of course, those factors
must be converted to correct units for the model to work correctly.

Line 62         This is the emission factor for coal combustion expressed as MT/MWh of fuel input.
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides the methodology for calculating these
factors. The same factors must be used for all Projects submitted from any given country. The same


                                                   84

     factor is used in the simplified model for both the baseline heating plant and for the grid electric plants.
     If very different coals are used, two factors should be input and applied appropriately.

     Line 63          Enter the real economic discount rate for the host country of the Project. Default
     options of 10.0 to 12.0 percent are typically used by the World Bank.

Key Model Outputs

63.     The second sheet of the model develops the economic analysis in lines 1 through 44 and summarizes
the key results in lines 45 through 68. Key results shown in green are interpreted as follows:

     Line 18          The 2005 present value of Project economic costs using a 10 percent discount rate is
     US$22.4 million which is comprised of US$18.9 million in investment and US$3.5 million in annual
     operating costs.

     Line 53          The 2005 present value of Project economic benefits equals US$23.6 million which is
     comprised of US$16.6 million in TEBS, US$3.5 million in LEBS, and US$3.5 million in GEBS.

     Line 47 - 48     Net benefits are then US$23.6 million less US$22.4 million or US$1.2 million. The
     benefit cost ratio is 1.05 and the EIRR is 10.9 percent. If the hurdle rate for is below 10.9 percent, this
     Project would clearly satisfy World Bank economic due diligence requirements. The results are
     satisfactory but not as strong as might be desired but they would probably be deemed adequate if risks
     are not extreme.

     Lines 55-56      Incremental costs can be calculated simply by ignoring the GEBS benefits. Then the
     benefits of the Project fall to US$20.1 million. Those benefits equal the costs of the baseline project.
     The Proposed Project costs remain at US$22.4 million. Incremental costs of the Project are then
     US$22.4 million less US$20.1 million which equals US$2.3 million. These incremental costs are
     divided by the 20 year sum of CO2 reductions which is 1,456,791 MT to obtain the cost per MT of the
     reductions. The cost per MT is US$1.56 which is generally regarded as attractive. It certainly
     compares well with the current willingness to pay or US$6.00 per ton from CFB. A result in this range
     would likely be attractive for GeoFund support if all other conditions prove acceptable.

     Line 63          Barrier analysis is expected to be a central component of many GeoFund applications.
     Barrier analysis may include evaluation of many impediments to Project realization. However, those
     barriers that can be easily translated to monetary terms will provide the clearest basis for GeoFund
     support of a particular kind and amount. The case study provides a very simple example. Here it is
     assumed that existing policies in the host country will only monetize 75 percent of the LEBS that have
     been estimated.

     Line 67          This line introduces the concept of "effective avoided costs" which are the monetized
     portions of the LEBS. In the case study these equal .75*US$3.5 million =US$2.6 million. That is
     actually the incentive that the Project sponsor has to pursue the project under current policies.

     Line 68          Effective incremental costs now equal the Project costs less TEBS less effective LEBS
     which equals US$22.4 million less US$16.6 million less US$1.7 million equals the effective
     incremental cost of US$4.1 million. The GeoFund could consider supports up to this level based on a
     compelling barrier analysis.

Re:     Review of: World Bank - GEF Geothermal Energy Development Project in the Europe and
        Central Asia Region and The Geothermal Energy (GeoE) Development Fund (GEDF)

Summary:
This project is a departure in structure and vision from many previous GEF efforts in that here a portfolio for
regional lending for geothermal energy generally will be supported. There are clear benefits of this approach
in terms of: (1) regional coordination; (2) developing expertise in project design and implementation; and (3)
developing experience and investor/lender trust in high up-front and capital-intensive energy development
efforts.

The project is recommended for approval.

Major Comments:

Pages 4 & 5, Section 4 (pages 6 & 7) and thereafter throughout the text: RER and GeoE technologies are
discussed too interchangeably in this initial overview. Many of the issues facing geothermal energy are
somewhat more akin to the issues in oil well exploration than they are with the classic decentralized
renewable energy systems (solar, wind, biomass) where the energy densities are very different, and the
degree on dispatchable/non-dispatchability are often dramatically dissimilar. This discussion should



                                                          86

highlight these similarities/differences as to many planners GeoE is seen as a very different sort of resource
than the rest of the `new' renewables. A particularly important and problematic example of this is on page
11, The TA Window, where it states, "of the GeoFund will address in the first place barriers that retard the
use of RER." The text, however, is focused on GeoE, and it is unclear how this program will ­ or why it
should -- support other RERs at all. The Polish project (page 52) also blurs the line between the two
technologies and what sort of resources each needs.

Page 7: `provision of technical assistance'. Training of a generation of geothermal RER personnel ­
engineers, financial and policy planners ­ would be greatly facilitated with extended internships at successful
geothermal facilities outside the region, for example in New Zealand, the U. S., and Scandinavia. These
internships would also build collaborations and status of this emerging energy market segment. They could
be arranged as industrial internships through the OECD, EU, and U. S. Department of Energy.

Page 7 and 60, `Regional Initiative', item (d); again , RER and GeoE are being mixed here. Surely the
Regional Initiative is not the ideal body to take on the monitoring of fast moving developments in the RER
field generally. Wind and PV use are both growing by over 25 percent/year. The International Energy
Agency, for example, is far more capably staffed and sized to take on this role. Further, the issue raised
(page 43ff) about the need to use the funds to catalyze new efforts, not just to fund those already of interest
to commercial enterprises, raises the issue of the role of the GEDF. How will the project analysis take place?
Reviewing the GeoE resource is one thing, but examining the market and grid resources to make these
profitable ventures is another. It is unclear ­ so far ­ how the GEDF will either obtain this capacity, or how
and with whom it will partner to bring it into the discussion. This infrastructure/analysis capacity mismatch
should be listed on page 60 (Table in Annex 4) and addressed as part of the project plan for the GEDF.

Page 8: The parallel national local objectives list is exceptionally important to the overall project success. A
component of this program would logically include the training/internship opportunities I discussed from
page 7 (above).

Page 10, ff: The GeoFund. The TA Window fund is set at US$5 million. Given the cost of GeoE projects,
this amount ­ and the fact that it is the first, and thus often the most difficult phase ­ this amount appears to
be insufficient to make a significant impact. Item (d) on page 12 also suggests that the funding level for the
TA Window is going, in practice, to be too small.

Page 12, item (d): This frank assessment of the capacity of many CIS nations to undertake GeoE projects is a
major concern in for the overall structure of this project. On the one hand, the GEDF (GeoE Development
Fund) structure provides significant project flexibility, which is good. However, if many of the nations will
need to undertake pilot projects first that must be financed by other means (due to the larger funding levels,
reaching 40 percent), then what will the GEFD do that direct project evaluation and funding and promotion
will not do? The reason for this worry is not that the GEFD is not a good institution to develop, it arguably
is, but that for the more significant project funding that will generally be needed for the fund not to devolve
into a support mechanism for a small subset ­ Russia and the Ukraine, perhaps ­ of nations?

Page 15: Section 5.4. The GEDF would be far stronger if the participating donor nations had to make their
contributions up front and under a standard arrangement so that these funds are not, directly or indirectly,
used to leverage a greater role for the GeoE industries in each of these nations in the project development
phases in the recipient nations.

Page 43ff: Throughout the document, a mismatch seems to exist between well developed projects, and those
that are fully exploratory. The GEDF structure could be a good one to overcome this problem. An example
would be the degree to which the Sapareva Bania project is clearly exploratory, while some of the Russian
projects, or that of Stargard Szczeci ski, are essentially ready to go. There are no clear safeguards in the
project to keep the most significant support to flow to those less well defined projects, as they are likely to be
the ones that do the most to spur the development of the GeoE industry in Eastern Europe.

Minor Comments:

Page 27/28: Example projects.

To provide a measure of the ability of the GEDF to catalyze the GeoE industry, the total project funding for
the set of example projects (Slovak Republic, Russia, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Poland) should be
totaled, along with the amount that they could logically request from the GEDF. Would each of these
projects be better served by the GEDF, or direct, individual project funding? An evaluation should be made
for each.

Page 32: I agree with the project authors, if this is to move ahead and be seen as a significant catalyst to
geothermal expansion, there should be no delay in approving the first tranche of project funding.

The way this would operate, who would partner, the benefits, and how this would be administered are
completely vague.

        Annex 19: GeoFund Subproject: Regional Technical Assistance Implemented by IGA

  EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                (GEOFUND)

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1.         Country and sector issues

1.       All countries of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region lag behind current European Union
(EU) member states in regards to the use and the development of renewable energy resources (RER).

2.       Most of the potential client countries of the GeoFund do not have a policy framework in place
that transparently supports renewable/geothermal energies. The role of the GeoFund subproject is to assist
participating countries' legislative and regulatory bodies to increase the use of GeoE by developing and
implementing appropriate legislative frameworks as well as to provide financial support to capacity
building and knowledge sharing.

2.         Rationale for Bank involvement

3.       The rationale for Bank involvement is described in detail on page 5 in this document.
Since the IGA has no extensive project implementation experience, it is especially important that the
Bank provides its knowledge sharing and best practices in implementing GEF financed projects

3.         Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

4.       The importance of global climate change, its potential implications, and the need to address it is
understood across the countries of the ECA Region. Nevertheless, national climate change strategies
show certain variations that are implied by respective Kyoto commitments; country-specific GHG
emissions reduction potentials and the economic situation of countries play a role in setting energy
generation import and use priorities

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.         Financing instrument

5.       The financing instrument is an APL as described in the PAD.

2.         Project development objective and key indicators

6.       The project development objective for this subproject is derived from the Program's overall goal:
to promote the use of geothermal energy in the ECA region through assistance in the removal of its
barriers.

7.       This will be achieved through the implementation of a capacity building component and a policy
development component.

3.         Project components

8.       The International Geothermal Association (IGA), will be responsible for the execution of region-
wide TA activities under the capacity building component and partly under the country policy and
knowledge development component.

9.       The IGA, founded in 1988, is a scientific, educational and cultural organization established to
operate worldwide. It has more than 2000 members in 65 countries. The IGA is a non-political, non-
profit, non-governmental organization in special consultative status with the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations, and Partner of the European Union for the Campaign for Take Off (CTO)
the Renewable Energy. The objective of IGA is to encourage research, development and utilization of
geothermal resources worldwide through the compilation, publication and dissemination of scientific and

technical data and information, both within the community of geothermal specialists and between
geothermal specialists and the general public.

10.     Affiliated Organizations are: Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CGEA), Chinese
Geothermal Association, Ethiopia Geothermal Association, Georgian Geothermal Association (GCA),
Geothermal Resources Council [of USA](GRC), Geothermal Association [of Germany](GAG),
Hungarian Geothermal Association (HGA), Iceland Geothermal Association, Indonesian Geothermal
Association (INAGA), Ireland Geothermal Association, Italy Geothermal Association , Japanese
Geothermal Association (JPA), Lithuanian Geothermal Association (LGA), Macedonia Geothermal
Association, Mexican Geothermal Association (AGM), New Zealand Geothermal Association (NZGA),

Association (RGA), Russian Geothermal Association (RUGA), Slovak Geothermal Association (SGA),
Swiss Geothermal Association (SWGA), Turkey Geothermal Association (TGA).Affiliated agreements
are currently prepared with the El Salvador Geothermal Association and the Iranian Geothermal
Association. In addition talks are held with the International Renewable Energy Association to become a
member.

11.     IGA will contact national geothermal associations and other institutions for the organization of
training courses, seminars and other events. The work program of IGA's region-wide TA activities will
be prepared jointly by IGA and GCT and periodically reviewed in accordance with the Grant Agreement
(GA) between IGA and the Bank.

COMPONENT A:

12.     The Capacity Building Component includes:

    a) Review and assessment of geothermal resources, modes of occurrence, and methods of
        utilization;

    b) Training of local experts in the preparation and implementation of geothermal energy projects;

    c) Transfer of know-how through the establishment of a roster of international geothermal experts
        and implementation of targeted international studies;

    d) Support to the organization and execution of conferences and workshops;

    e) Dissemination of information through support to knowledge resource centers creation and
        publications.

13.     Expenditures under this component may be eligible for retroactive financing.

COMPONENT B:

14.     The Policy Development Component consisted of two subcomponents:

        (a) Country policy support activities and (b) Demonstration projects of which only component (a)
        will be implemented by the IGA.

    4.           Sustainability

    28.      The project will contribute to the sustainability of the overall geothermal Program by:

         a) providing knowledge and building capacity among decision-makers and market participants for a
             better understanding and acceptance of geothermal energy

         b) supporting the creation and implementation of the enabling legislation; and

         c) supporting the creation of an attractive climate for private investment that will entice multiple
             market participants to seek business opportunities in geothermal energy;

    29.      Project sustainability will depend greatly on having an effective and enforceable policy and legal
    framework in place. Therefore it is crucial for IGA to cooperate with local geothermal organizations to
    provide regulation and policy recommendations to regulatory authorities and other local institutions. The
    combination of adequate institutional and regulatory capabilities, increased public awareness and
    understanding, and active and informed NGOs play an important role for the sustainability of the project.

    5.           Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

    30.      The critical risks and possible controversial aspects of the project are summarized in Section 5 of
    the PAD, outlining risks, risk mitigation measures and risk rating.

    6.           Grant conditions and covenants

    31.      FM covenants: Establishment of acceptable financial management arrangements and opening of a
    Special Account are conditions of effectiveness for this grant fund.

    32.      IGA will maintain a financial management system both for itself and the project acceptable to the
    Bank. The IGA financial statements, SOEs and special account will be audited by independent auditors
    acceptable to the Bank and on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The annual audited statements


                                                       104

and audit reports together with the Management Letter will be provided to the Bank within six months of
the end of each fiscal year.

IGA shall not draw down reserves to cover operating costs in connection with this project at any time
during project implementation without the prior written approval of the Bank.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.          Economic and financial analyses

33.      The IGA subproject will essentially provide TA and therefore does not lend itself well to typical
economic or financial analysis. For further details are described in Section D1 of the PAD.

2.          Technical

34.      The GeoFund Coordination Team and IGA have prepared a detailed work program that covers
regional assistance for capacity building and policy development. No technical issues are of concern for
this subproject.

Financial Management Arrangements

Conclusion

35.      A financial management assessment was undertaken in 2006 to determine whether the financial
management systems to be utilized by IGA to manage the grant funds are acceptable to the Bank. It has
been concluded that the current financial management arrangements of IGA are not acceptable to the
Bank. Accordingly it has been agreed that the establishment of acceptable financial management
arrangements is a condition of effectiveness. From the financial management standpoint, this activity is
considered modest risk. An improvement action plan has been agreed with IGA to ensure that it can fully
meet the Bank's requirements prior to effectiveness of the grant fund. The action plan includes the
following critical activities:

    1. Recruitment of a part-time accountant/procurement specialist to manage the grant facility;

    2. Establishment of satisfactory FM policies and procedures manual, including appropriate internal
         controls for grant funds, for the grant facility;

    3. Establishment of accounting system that is capable of recording and reporting flow of funds and
         tracking of expenditures of the grant facility;

    4. Finalization of interim financial reports (IFRs) acceptable to the Bank; and

    5. Provision of appropriate training to new accountant/procurement specialist on Bank's procedures
         on FM and procurement.

IGA ­ Organization structure

36.      International Geothermal Association (IGA) was incorporated under the New Zealand
Incorporated Societies Act 1908 on the 6th July 1988. It is currently located in Iceland where the bank
account is kept. It is relatively small association, with total revenue (membership and contribution) of
around US$40,000 and total expenditures of around US$55,000 in the year ended 31 December 2004.

37.      The accounting person is the Executive Secretary at the Secretariat in Iceland. He works closely
with its treasurer who is currently based in New Zealand and the finance committee chair who is currently
based in Seattle (USA). The Audit committee reviews the books on an annual basis. The audit of the IGA
is carried out by Franchi & Sbrana in Italy, according to Italian Law. Formal responsibility for
preparation of budget is that of the chairman of the finance committee, with inputs for budget proposal
from sub-committees and board members.

Financial Management Arrangements

38.      The IGA subproject will have a separate grant account with the Bank, and will be responsible for
assuring that it establishes and maintains financial management arrangements that are acceptable to the
Bank, including (i) adequate accounting systems and control procedures; (ii) funds flow mechanisms
including timely disbursements to its suppliers; and (iii) appropriate arrangements for regular financial
audits. These responsibilities will be specified in grant documents. IGA as recipient will be evaluated as
to its compliance with Bank financial management standards at the preparation and launching stages, as
well as on supervision missions during grant implementation.

Staffing Arrangements

39.      The day to day activities of the project will be carried out by the Executive Secretary of the IGA
secretariat. In addition, an implementation specialist segregating functions of accountant/procurement
specialist will be recruited to manage procurement and disbursement of the project funds. He/she will
receive adequate training in procurement, FM, and disbursement rules and regulations of the World Bank.

Financial Reporting and Monitoring

40.      IGA prepares reports on three levels relative to finances. These include the Treasurer's Report, the
Secretariat Report and the Audit Committee Report. It is the responsibility of the Finance Committee
Chair and the Treasurer to come up with the budget for the coming year. The Secretariat tracks all income
and expenditures and prepares an Operating Statement covering all expenses and revenue, an IGA
Revenue and Expense Summary and a Balance Sheet. The Treasurer prepares a report comparing budget
vs. income and expenditures. The Audit committee is responsible for the Audit Report which is prepared
by an outside firm and verified by the Audit Committee.

41.      Reports are prepared for IGA Board meetings on a semiannual basis with the Audit done on a
yearly basis.

42.      For project monitoring purposes, financial monitoring reports will be prepared quarterly detailing
all revenue and expenses related to the Grant for the WB and a semi annual report for the IGA board of
directors. The special GeoFund account will be audited yearly in conjunction with the audit of other IGA
financials.

43.      IGA will maintain accounts of the project and ensure appropriate accounting of the funds
provided. IGA will be responsible for preparing interim un-audited financial reports (IFRs) (previously
known as Financial Monitoring Report (FMRs)) on a quarterly basis. The IFRs to be finalized prior to
negotiation will include:

       Brief progress report of the grant

       Project sources and uses of funds

       Uses of funds by project activity

       Special account statement

       Procurement reporting

       Statement of grant balance

44.      The first IFR will be furnished to the Bank not later than 45 days after the end of the first quarter
after the Effective Date, and will cover the period from the Effective Date to the end of the quarter.

Information Systems

45.      IGA uses software package called TOK a product of the Icelandic company Ax hugbunadarhus
(http://www.ax.is).



                                                   106

46.     For the project purposes the IGA will use TOK to gather the data on the use of GEF funds
(coming through the special account, direct payments etc) and counterpart funds which will not be
recorded in the books of IGA. In addition IGA will use Excel spread sheet to keep track of grants issued
and establish an accounting system that is capable of recording and reporting flow of funds and tracking
of expenditures of the grant facility as noted in the FM improvement action plan.

Financial Audits

47.     Audits are required annually by auditors acceptable to the Bank. The selection and appointment
of the external auditor and audit TOR agreed upon during negotiation will be in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Auditing of project activities financed by the World Bank will be financed by IGA and
handled during the annual external audit of the IGA. The auditor will have direct access to the files and
records of the projects and is based in Iceland. An audit report prepared in accordance with Bank
guidelines will be required to be submitted to the Bank six months following the end of the recipient's
fiscal year-end. In addition to the audit report, the auditors will be expected to prepare management letters
giving observations and comments, and providing recommendations for improvements in accounting
records, systems, controls and compliance with financial covenants in the Grant Agreement.

Internal Controls and Procedure

48.     Minimum internal controls should be available prior to flow of funds. Controls over grant funds
will be especially important, as the grant would represent a significant increase in the scope of activities
of the IGA. In addition, there are currently no proper control procedures on the management of GEF's
grant fund. Accordingly, internal control will be required through management supervision, clear
separation of duties, and proper documentation. A financial management manual outlines key controls,
policies and procedures for the management of GEF grant funds should be finalized, acceptable to the
Bank, prior to effectiveness of the grant fund.

49.     The Board of Directors of IGA will sign the work program between IGA and the World Bank.
Approval for contracts between IGA and the recipients will be given by the Executive Committee of IGA.
Technical leads for every activity will monitor and supervise the product as well approve payments.
Payments up to the amount of US$5,000 will be authorized by the Executive Secretary of IGA and issued
by the Accountant officer. Contracts above US$5,000 need further authorization from the IGA Board of
Directors. Regular and accurate bank reconciliations will be done by the Secretary for the overall IGA
accounts and by the Accounts officer for the project component.

50.     The Executive Secretary works closely with IGA's treasurer in New Zealand and the Finance
Committee chair in USA. The roles of IGA's treasurer include "...shall have the custody of the
Association's funds and shall be responsible for managing these funds in a judicious manner. With the
assistance of the Executive Director he shall keep full and accurate accounts of receipts and
disbursements, and shall deposit all monies and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit of the
Association in such depositories as may be approved by the Board of Directors."

51.     IGA's Audit committee reviews the books on an annual basis. The role and composition of the
Audit Committee include "...shall be responsible for reviewing and controlling all financial and
administration matters and inspecting the relative documents and the account books of the Association.
The Audit Committee shall consist of at least five members, at least one of whom shall not be a member
of the Board."




                                                    107

Flow of funds

52.     The IBRD would make funds available to IGA under the Letter of Agreement, governing the
terms and conditions of the GEF Grant and specifying the project. Project funds will flow from the Bank,
via a single special account at Sparisjodur Reykiavikun Og Nagrennis (SPRON) Bank in Reykiavik,
Iceland. They will be replenished on the basis of Statement of Expenses (SOEs) or direct payments.




Disbursement Arrangements

53.     The project is expected to be implemented over a period of 2.5 years, plus six months for the
completion of accounts and the submission of withdrawal applications.

54.     Due to the prolonged project preparation and already scheduled TA activities such as
conferences, the Bank has agreed to apply retroactive financing up to 10 percent of the grant amount,
thus, up to an amount of US$81,000 for expenditures for consultants' services, training and operational
costs. Procurement will be conducted according to the Bank guidelines. Retroactive financing may be
used for payments made for expenditures incurred after July 1, 2006 and prior to the date of signing of the
Letter of Agreement.

55.     Bank funds will be disbursed under the Bank's traditional procedures of SOEs. Supporting
documentation for SOEs, including completion reports and certificates, will be retained by IGA and made
available to the Bank during project supervision. Disbursements for expenditures above the SOE
thresholds will be made against presentation of full documentation relating to those expenditures.

56.     To facilitate timely project implementation, IGA will establish, maintain and operate a single
Special Account in US$ under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Withdrawal applications for
the replenishments of the SA will be sent to the Bank quarterly regardless of the activity during the period
or size of the special account. Replenishment applications must include reconciled, detailed bank
statements as well as other appropriate documents (e.g. SOE or source documentation). The bank
statement must indicate both the opening and closing balance of the special account for the period
covered by the expenditures claimed, and likewise, indicate all transactions and activity on the account


                                                  108

during the period. The reconciliation statement must also explain any discrepancies (surplus or shortage
of funds) and the status of any previously deducted expenditures.

57.      The project implementation progress reports will be monitored in detail. IFRs/FMRs will be
reviewed on a regular basis by FM and any issues arising will be followed up promptly. Audited financial
reports of the project will be reviewed and identified issues followed up.

58.      Conditions of Effectiveness:

     a) Opening of a special account

     b) Establishment of satisfactory financial management arrangements acceptable to the Bank

59.      An initial deposit of US$81,000 of the grant amount into the Special Account will be made since
up-front investments are needed set up a functional financial management within IGA that complies with
World Bank rules and regulations and a number of activities will start immediately after project
effectiveness.

Procurement Arrangements

Procurement Assessment of IGA

60.      IGA will be the primary recipient of the GEF grants and will coordinate the implementation of
the overall project. The primary reasons for selecting IGA as implementing agency were the following:
(i) it understands issues related to geothermal energy development, and (ii) it works globally on
geothermal issues and can therefore draw on its cooperation with local organizations, experts, and
agencies in the field of geothermal energy.

61.      IGA will be responsible for providing regional-, country based-, and cross-cutting support to the
Program. The procurement of Consultants services to be conducted by IGA shall follow the Bank's
Consultants guidelines. This will include hiring of Individual Consultants in accordance with section V,
including paragraph 5.2 and 5.34. All TORs will be prior reviewed by the Bank. In this regard, many of
the individual consultants would be individuals who are employed at universities and other research
centers. In accordance with Consultants guidelines paragraph 1.11 (c) "services of Government ­ owned
universities or research centers in the Borrower's country are of unique and exceptional nature, and their
participation is critical to project implementation, the Bank may agree on hiring those institutions on a
case-by-case basis. On the same basis, university professors or scientists from research institutes can be
contracted individually under Bank financing." In the context of this operation there is no any particular



                                                   109

impediment to the engagement of such individuals, but such engagement should further be compliant with
the provisions of the memorandum of August 19, 1999 that had been issued before "new" 2004
Consultant Guidelines" were issued. This memorandum expands on the rationale for this procedure.

62.     The Bank undertook a procurement assessment of IGA during IGA's representatives' visit to the
World Bank in February 2006 and evaluated their procurement capacities, types of proposed procurement
packages to be handled by IGA and whether there is a need to hire an individual consultant that will be
paid from project funds to support the project implementation. An individual will be recruited to manage
procurement and disbursement of the project funds. The procurement procedures followed by IGA are in
general compliant with international practice but World Bank procedures will be used in project activities.
The assessment findings, recommendation and specific agreements on the handling of procurement have
been discussed.

63.     IGA in general has followed procurement procedures that are compliant with the World Bank's
rules and procedures.

64.     The Secretariat will be charged by the Board of Directors of the IGA to carry out all
procurements for the tasks as identified. Members of the IGA Board will serve as evaluators of proposals
and in the selection of consultants. For specific proposals the Board may invite outside experts to assist
the Board in such evaluations. Consultants so selected will enter into contracts with the IGA through the
Secretariat. The IGA Board will appoint a technical supervisor to each project whose duties will be to
verify the adequacy of the work being performed and to be in regular contact with the consultant(s) and
the Secretariat. All financial transactions will be carried out by the Secretariat and payments will only be
made upon the approval of the technical supervisor.

65.     Members of the IGA Board and Secretariat will make such arrangements as are required in order
to carry out the assignments of the projects within the participating countries. Where applicable the IGA
will use the services of one of its affiliates to the extent possible.

consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Guidelines.

70.     Consulting services for function (2) will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Consultants'
Guidelines if further World Bank funding is involved at the country level.

Others

71.     The procurement procedures and Standard Bidding Documents to be used for each procurement
method shall be presented in the Operations Manual prepared for all projects which will include
procurement section describing procurement arrangements where applicable.

Procurement Plan for consulting services

72.     IGA has established a detailed procurement plan for all activities implemented by IGA itself. This
procurement plan is derived from the table of activities. IGA will update this Procurement Plan annually
or as needed throughout the duration of the project. It will be submitted to the Bank for approval.

    a) List of consulting assignments has been established as follows:

         Annex 20: GeoFund Subproject for Hungary: MOL Geothermal Power Pilot Project

  EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA: GEOTHERMAL ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                                                (GEOFUND)

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1.          Country and sector issues

1.       Hungary is well known as a country of favorable conditions in terms of geothermal resources
since most measured geothermal gradients are higher than the worldwide average. According to the
results of numerous published geothermal assessments, Hungary has the largest underground thermal
water reserves and geothermal energy potential of low and medium enthalpy in Europe. The measured
geothermal resource temperatures in Hungary range from 10°C to 254°C. While the utilization of
geothermal energy in Hungary is significant, on a worldwide average it remains relatively low compared
to the resource base. This is largely due to the typical barriers as learned from numerous lessons through
Bank involvement in geothermal projects: high upfront investment requirement and geological risks
associated with drilling.

2.       The CX/2001 Electricity Act orders mandatory purchase of renewable electricity, at prices set by
subsequent decrees of the Ministry of Economy. This price, following the latest revision in October 8,
2005, is currently 22.46 HUF/kWh (10.8 US cents/kWh).

3.       A comprehensive renewable energy law is currently under preparation. It is expected that the new
law will introduce, among others, differentiated preferential pricing for different renewable energy types.

2.          Rationale for Bank involvement

4.       The value added of the Bank's assistance for this project is the covering of the geological risk
associated with drilling. Without this guarantee, which is unique on the market, the profitability of the
project is not attractive enough for the project developer to undertake the project. Neither conventional
type lending, nor straight grants suit the needs of this kind of operation. While loans are available from
various commercial sources and will be part of the financing package, they do not improve the risk
adjusted IRR. Straight grants on a scale that would push the project above the hurdle rate are not
justifiable for private investors.

3.          Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

5.       Hungary targets to increase the share of primary energy utilization of renewables to 5-6 percent
from the present level of 3.4 percent by 2010, in addition to the pursuance of such European Union
priorities as security of supply, energy efficiency, economic efficiency, serving national interests, and
environmental protection. The project directly contributes to these objectives as it increases the share of
renewable electricity in the country's grid mix.

6.       The proposed Project is consistent with the Framework for World Bank Support to the European
Union (EU) New Member Countries of Central and Eastern Europe (SecM2004-0283 dated May 28,
2004). In supporting the development of renewable energy, the project is in line with the role envisaged
for the World Bank including support for global issues such as environmental protection.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1.          Financing instrument

7.       The financing instrument is a grant which would disburse if the risks insured under the
Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) window of the GeoFund program occur. Disbursement of the grant, in



                                                   114

essence, is contingent on geological parameters not reaching the expected values as stipulated in the grant
agreement.

2.          Project development objective and key indicators

8.       The project's development objective is to increase the share of renewable electricity in the
country's grid mix.

9.       The output of the project will be a geothermal power plant that will generate from 1.6 to 3
megawatts of electricity. In accordance with the CX/2001 Electricity Act, the generated electricity will
be purchased as a mandatory requirement and fed into the national grid. If the testing results do not reach
the expected geothermal yields enabling power generation, the project will be converted into a direct heat
supplying facility, or in the worst case scenario, will be abandoned completely.

3.          Project components

10.      The project consists of the provision of a Geological Risk Insurance (GRI) to cover the short-term
geological risk associated with the drilling and testing activities to support the development of a
geothermal power pilot project to be undertaken by the consortium led by MOL.

Project background

11.      MOL, Hungarian Oil and Gas Company, Plc. (MOL) ­ the project developer ­has embarked
recently to assess the technical and economic viability of developing medium enthalpy geothermal power
plants (i.e., geothermal fluids in the temperature range of 140°C to 180°C) using existing shut-in, non-
productive, hydrocarbon wells. Within Hungary there are more than 8,000 hydrocarbon wells, the
majority of which are owned by MOL, and geothermal production and injection wells can be constructed
from these non-productive hydrocarbon wells.

12.      The planned project site is north of the village of Iklódbördöce, in the county of Zala, in South-
west Hungary with three existing hydrocarbon exploration wells. A fourth production well will be drilled
here. The planned power plant will be connected to the regional system of North Transdanubian Electric
Service Company. Total estimated project costs are HUF 3,900 million (US$ 18.6 million).

13.      The underlying geothermal power pilot project which will be supported by GRI will include well
completion or reconstruction into geothermal production and injection wells, new well drilling, pipelines
between wells and the power plant, injection pumps, the power plant, and connection to the grid. All of
the geothermal fluids will be injected into the reservoir to guarantee the renewable nature of the energy
source.

Provision of GRI

14.      The proposed GeoFund subproject will provide geological risk insurance (GRI) to a test operation
for about nine months on a doublet converted from two existing hydrocarbon wells. This test operation
consists of production and re-injection to establish long-term hydrological conditions. The project
developer will proceed to the implementation phase on the basis of the evaluation of the results of the test
operation phase.

Parameters for GRI

15.      Due to the existence of reliable information about the reservoir, all key parameters (yield,
temperature, quality) can be estimated with relatively high probability. Based on the MOL's projection,
the project will achieve an economic break-even if it produces an adequate volume of geothermal energy.
The volume of hot water produced (flow rate) will determine the success or failure of the project. The
proposed GRI will have to determine the exact volumetric parameters, the loss and residual revenue in
case of a total as well as partial failure.




                                                   115

        (1) Under preliminary assumptions, if the flow rate coming out of the doublet yields higher than
        2,100 cubic meters per day, the MOL consortium will proceed with building an electricity
        generation plant by completing another doublet to make the entire flow rate volume about 4,200
        plus which will produce more than 1.6 MW of power. This will represent full success for the
        purpose of GRI.

        (2) If the measured flow rate is lower than 2,100 cubic meters per day, the MOL consortium may
        abandon the construction of the power generation facility, and instead directly sell thermal heat to
        local users such as green house heating, tile factory heating, etc. There will be no assurance that
        the heat will be purchased by the local users because of the price competition with the natural gas
        price. It was indicated by potential local heat users that they will be only interested to buy
        geothermal heat when the heat price is less than 60 percent of the gas price. This will represent a
        partial success/failure for the purpose of GRI. The direct heat sale is considered as a fall back
        option to recover the investment.

        (3) If the measured flow rate is below 1,200 cubic meters per day, the MOL consortium will
        completely abandon the geothermal project in any form in the region. This will represent a total
        failure for the purpose of GRI.

Payout under GRI

        (1) No amount of GRI will be paid in the event of full success, i.e. the measured flow rate data is
        higher than 2,100 cubic meters per day.

        (2) In between these two thresholds, i.e. lower than 2,100 cubic meters per day but higher than
        1,200 cubic meters per day, GRI payment will be prorated based on the measured flow rate
        between the maximum and minimum parameters.

        (3) The maximum amount of GRI will be paid in the event of total failure, i.e. the measured flow
        rate data is lower than the minimum threshold (below 1,200 cubic meters per day). .

Other GRI terms

        Maximum payout amount: Up to 85 percent of the eligible testing and drilling expenses incurred
        (Insured Amount). The estimated total cost of testing and drilling is US$4.3 million. The Insured
        Amount will be determined by deducting ineligible cost items (e.g. VAT, contingent cost, etc.)
        from the total cost. It is estimated that the maximum payout amount will be no more than
        US$3.72 million.

        Risk fee: 3 percent on the Insured Amount.

        Processing fee:US$10,000.

        Other detailed terms are defined in the Grant Agreement.

4.         Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

Project

16.     The Pannonian Basin is one of the hot spots due to a thin crust with the geothermal gradient
reaching as high as 58.8 C/km in some areas. Use of geothermal energy in Hungary is predominantly for
balneological purposes, including a large portion of space heating and hothouse agriculture. Hungary uses
geothermal water for 61 medicinal baths, 350 public baths, and 1,200 swimming pools. Agriculture has an
installed capacity of 120.43 MWt; district heating, sanitary hot water, and industrial applications 58.7
MWt; and bathing and balneology 187.3 MWt for a total of 366.4 MWt.

17.     While there is a wealth of experience with geothermal resource applications in Hungary for the
project developer to build on, there remain such technical issues to be resolved as problems with scaling
and re-injection, the latter mostly for technical reasons of reservoir permeability. In addition, geothermal


                                                    116

energy has been utilized for balneologic and heating purposes only so far in Hungary, not for electricity
production. Re-injection problems associated with reservoir permeability are typical to reservoirs in
sandstone layers. This project exploits a karst reservoir. International experience is tapped for the
implementation of the technology that uses geothermal energy for electricity generation. One of the
partners in the consortium is the Iceland-based Enex, a company recognized worldwide for its expertise in
geothermal applications. Enex is a world leader in comprehensive and integrated utilization of geothermal
energy.

GRI

18.      There are only a few existing cases of an insurance/compensation scheme applied for geological
risk in geothermal energy development projects. All the existing schemes such as those in France,
Iceland, the U.S., etc. were funded by public resources as loss compensation schemes. Among those, the
French Geothermal Guarantee Fund has been most actively used since the 1980s, and has had a relatively
good performance in terms of the failure rate. GRI is broadly designed in line with the French model
under which two geothermal parameters, temperature and flow rate were used to measure the
success/failure thresholds. There is no meaningful scheme applied in private risk insurance market.

19.      The proposed GRI is the first application under the GeoFund program. There is a risk of quickly
depleting the GRI resources in the event of a the high failure rate. However, such risk would not arise in
the short-run because only a few GRI (Hungary and Russia) will be expected to be issued during the
Start-Up Phase and each GRI carries a short expiration period (6-9 months), thereby making performance
monitoring relatively easy. If the failure rate is considered excessive, selection criteria could be tightened
during the implementation period.

5.          Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Project

20.      Given the resource base (medium enthalpy geothermal reservoir) and the targeted output to reach
the project's development objective (a geothermal power plant that will generate from 1.6 to 3 megawatts
of electricity) project alternatives are basically reduced to alternatives in siting. Within Hungary there are
more than 8,000 hydrocarbon wells, the majority of which are owned by MOL. From shut-in hydrocarbon
wells, well drilling and cost information, as well as potential reservoir data, are available in addition to
information from flow test operations, including temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. MOL personnel
have conducted geological, hydro-geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys and studies to
identify and quantify geothermal resources in Hungary. Geological and hydro-geological surveys and
studies have involved mapping hot springs or other surface thermal manifestations and the identification
of favorable geological structures. These data are used to recommend where production wells can be
drilled with the highest probability of encountering a favorable geological structure. MOL personnel have
also conducted geophysical surveys to assist in the determination of the shape, size, depth and other
important characteristics of the deep geological structures that may contain the potential economic
geothermal reservoir. The eventual selection of the wells for this project has been a result of multi-phase
short listing, on the basis of the above surveys and studies.

GRI

21.      There is no alternative support considered for the subproject. Hungary (and MOL) is not eligible
for support under the GeoFund DIF window. MOL, the project sponsor has specifically requested GRI
support.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

Project implementation period: November 23, 2006 to August 31, 2007
Expected effectiveness date:       November 20, 2006
Expected closing date:             October 30, 2007

1.         Partnership arrangements

The feasibility study for the project was funded by the United States Trade and Development Agency
(USTDA) in an amount of US$167,000. Consultants were competitively selected to conduct the study.

2.         Institutional and implementation arrangements

22.      The project will be implemented by the MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas Company, Plc. (MOL),
operating together with Enex Iceland (Enex) and Vulcan Kft. These three companies have set up a
consortium led by MOL, which is the leading integrated oil and gas group in Central and Eastern Europe
and the largest company in Hungary by sales revenues. The consortium is operated under an operating
agreement with MOL as a commercial lead. Enex mainly provides the technical service for geothermal
power generation operation based on its long experience in geothermal power business in Iceland. Vulcan
Kft, the local subsidiary vehicle of an Australian energy investment company of Hecules Energy Pty Ltd.
plays a relatively passive role as an investment company for energy projects.

23.      The core activities of MOL include:

         exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and gas products

         refining, transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil products in both retail and wholesale
         markets

         import, transportation, storage and wholesale trading of natural gas and other gas products

         the production and sale of olefins and polyolefins.

MOL is the market leader in each of its core activities in Hungary and Slovakia.

3.         Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

24.      Bank involvement is limited to the exploratory phase of the project. The outcome of the test
operation will determine the payment by GEF: (full payout ­ up to 85 percent of eligible losses; partial
payout ­ less than 85 percent of eligible losses, or no payout). The major direct parameter to calculate the
payout ratio will be flow rate of the doublet that will be subject to test operation. Measurement of the
flow rate is of paramount importance for both the project developer and for the Bank, as the results will
serve as inputs to the execution of the grant agreement between the parties. In this regard the grant
agreement contains provisions. Even without contracting such risk insurance, however, this is part of the
project developer's routine monitoring exercises and poses no special challenge in terms of capacity. The
costs are integrated into project costs.

4.         Sustainability

25.      The sustainability of the project's objectives basically depends on two factors: one technical and
one policy. Long-term operation of the power plant relies on the ability to exploit geothermal water from
a reservoir and on the ability to re-inject the geothermal fluid to the same reservoir for 25 years. In order
to obtain all possible information on the aquifer, the project developer will carry out a test operation for 3



                                                    118

months on a doublet converted from two existing hydrocarbon wells to establish long-term hydrological
conditions.

26.       Objectives of the test operation:

          To prove the existence of the thermal water flow required for establishing the power plant

          To identify the thermal water parameters which can be calculated on the long term, such as: flow,
          wellhead temperature, wellhead pressure, and the chemical parameters of the fluid

          To prove the good technical condition of the wells

          To prove that 100 percent of the produced thermal water can be re-injected over the long run

27.       Long-term economic viability of the project builds on the assumption that the Government
continues its supportive approach to renewable energy development. The Hungarian Electricity Act
(2001/CX.), which entered into force on the 1st of January, 2002 obliges the purchase of power from
renewable energy generators at prices that are established by periodic decrees until 2010. The latest ­ and
current ­ decree sets the prices of 26.12 HUF/kWh (peak), 23.00 HUF/kWh (valley) and 9.38 HUF/kWh
(deep valley) for all renewable energies that corresponds to a weighted average of 22.46 HUF/kWh. This
is a continuous increase over the past years with further increases expected, in line with the requirements
of the EU.

28.       Furthermore, the renewable energy law currently under preparation is expected to provide
additional preferential support to geothermal energy as it is recognized that this type of renewable energy
is considerably underutilized in Hungary.

5.           Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

29.       It is the geological risk through which the GEF is involved in the project. In case of a loss
incurred by the project developer due to lower than expected reservoir parameters, the GEF pays a certain
percentage of this loss through the partial guarantee window of the umbrella GeoFund project. As a
measure to reduce exposure of GEF to risks associated with moral hazard, the GeoFund guarantee
instrument has been designed to provide partial coverage. The calculation of the payout ratio is based on,
among other things, analysis performed during the preparatory phase of the project.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.          Economic and financial analyses

30.      Economic analysis. The generic economic model presented in Annex 16 illustrated the
calculation of incremental costs and the EIRR for a project in which geothermal heat was used to supply a
district heating system. The MOL project is more complex and provides both electricity and heat to be
supplied to a few large users. The annual MOL project outputs are approximately 75 percent in the form
of heat and 25 percent in the form of electricity. For purposes of the incremental cost analysis provided
here, it is assumed that absent this project, the electricity produced would come from a new grid power
plant that would come on line in 2009 and that the heat produced would come from new gas-fired heat-
only boilers. The new grid power plant is represented as a gas-fired combined cycle unit. A detailed
analysis of the grid expansion plans may yield somewhat different assumptions but this approach should
yield reasonable incremental cost results for the purposes of this PAD.

31.      Table 1 summarizes the model inputs including comments that explain the basis or source for
each parameter. The inputs shown here pertain to the highest expected yield of the geothermal well and
thus represent the most optimistic outlook from a production perspective. They also assume that MOL

will be successful in connecting the large heat loads that are being pursued even though those
arrangements have not as yet been secured by contract. Again, this provides an optimistic assessment.

32.     Since both the baseline electric and heat supplies will come from gas-fired technologies, it is
obvious that the economic value of natural gas will have a significant impact on the economics of the
proposed geothermal project. The relevant economic value for natural gas is the incremental cost from
the marginal source. Hungary has some domestic gas resources but the dominant supply is from Russia
with the border price historically indexed to world oil prices. The volatility of world oil prices in recent
years adds a significant risk element to projects that displace gas utilization. The World Bank recently
worked very closely with a major regional power supplier (Pannon Power) on a gas and biomass power
project that included detailed economic analyses that were also heavily influenced by gas price
projections. Natural gas tariffs remain distorted with large consumers heavily subsidizing residential
users on a cost of service basis. However, the Pannon Power project included a forecast of free market
prices with capacity and energy components separately identified. The energy component of that price
forecast should be a reasonable proxy for the border price of gas assuming that existing delivery and
storage capacity remains sufficient. The Pannon Power forecast was tied to a certain expectation
regarding oil prices. Subsequently, oil prices have increased dramatically and are substantially above the
Pannon outlook from 2003. To arrive at a reasonable forecast of economic values for 2009, the Pannon
forecast has been adjusted to reflect the 2006 USDOE forecast of world oil prices. The result of these
calculations suggests an economic value in the range of US$250/TCM of gas for 2009. To remain
conservative, no real increases are assumed after 2009. Of course, the 2009 forecast is subject to
substantial uncertainty. The economic value could plausibly vary within a range of 20 percent which
would suggest 2009 values ranging from US$200 to US$300 per TCM. The cases that have been
considered in the incremental cost calculations include US$200, US$225 and US$250 per TCM. The
specific scenario illustrated below assumes an economic value of US$225/TCM. The gas value is by far
the most critical input parameter in the economic analysis of the project. The fact that this input is subject
to substantial, and irreducible uncertainty emphasizes the risk of the project both from a social and a
private investment perspective.

33.     The remaining inputs are largely self-explanatory and conventional except for the environmental
damage parameters. As previously indicated, the GeoFund intends to provide default environmental
damage coefficients that can be applied by country for projects applying for funding. Project proponents
will be allowed to provide their own analyses if they choose not to use the GeoFund default options. For
more detailed project applications, the EXTERNE model will most likely be the source of the GeoFund
coefficients. For the illustrative analysis of the MOL project, the damage coefficients and emission rates
per unit of fuel input have been taken from Environmental Costs of Electricity by Pace University Center
for Environmental Legal Studies (Table 1, Page 362). The coefficients from this 1990 study have been
updated to 2006 price levels in US$ and then adjusted by the relative Gross National Income (GNI) per
capita for Hungary vs. the US in 2004. This provides the relevant damage coefficients for NOx and for
particulates. SO2 is not a factor since the avoided fuels are all natural gas. CO2 has been valued at
US$6.00 per MT based on the current willingness to pay of some carbon funds that are administered by
the carbon finance business of the World Bank.

34.     An economic discount rate in the range of 10 percent to 12 percent is normally applied for World
Bank ­ financed projects. In this case, 10 percent has been applied for the MOL project illustration.

35.     The economic analysis of the MOL project is summarized for select years in Table 2. The period
of analysis is from 2006 through 2028 which provides for a three year project development period
followed by twenty years of operation. The operation period is believed to be a conservative estimate of
likely capability. All costs have been expressed in Hungarian Forint (HUF) using 2006 price levels.
Conversions of HUF to US$ have been made at the exchange rate of 205 HUF/US$. Annual production
of heat and net electricity have been based on the maximum flow rate of 8,000 cubic meters per day.
Annual O&M costs for the proposed project have been estimated by MOL based on 2.0 percent of the
capital cost. The 2006 present value of the proposed project costs is 4.064 billion HUF.

36.          Baseline supply of proposed project outputs has been costed based on heat supply from new gas-
fired heat-only boilers (HOBS) and electric supply from new gas-fired combined cycle (CC) power
plants. The costing parameters for the gas HOBS are generic estimates. The CC plant parameters are
from the 2006 Annual Energy Outlook by USDOE. The present value of baseline costs is 3.672 billion
HUF without local environmental costs or 3.744 billion HUF including the costs from NOx and
particulate emissions. Incremental costs are then 4.064 ­ 3.744 = .641 BHUF or US$1.562 MUSD. The
unit abatement cost is an attractive US$2.78 per MT of CO2 compared to a willingness to pay value of
US$6.00 per MT.

37.          The sensitivity of the key outputs to the dominant inputs (gas value and flow rates) is illustrated
in Figure 1. Incremental costs can range from US$4.0 million to zero over the range of anticipated flow
rates and gas values. For a gas value of US$225/TCM, incremental costs vary from US$2.5 to US$1.6
million. For the mid range of flows (6,000 CUM/d) the incremental costs vary from US$0.5 to US$3.6
million. Unit abatement costs are always below the criterion figure of US$6.00 for all cases with gas
prices above US$200/TCM and for the maximum flow case when the gas value equals US$200/TCM.

EIRRs are all above 10 percent when the gas value equals US$250/TCM and are between 9.0 and 10.0
percent for all cases with gas valued at US$225/TCM.

38.     The overall project economics based on EIRR are marginal with the mid range gas value but
acceptable with the high gas value. The EIRRs are quite stable across the range of possible flow values.
On these grounds, the project would normally be considered marginally acceptable by World Bank
standards. As a carbon reduction project, the results are much stronger. The vast majority of the gas
value ­ flow rate pairs that are anticipated would result in unit abatement costs that are well below the
US$6.00/MT hurdle price. Complete determination of the support that should be provided to the Project
by the GeoFund would require a systematic financial quantification of the barriers to this investment.


                                                                                                124

However, the middle gas value provides a useful range of values to consider. The middle gas value
coupled with the middle flow figure suggests that a figure of US$2.1 million would not be unreasonable
for this project. Values within 20 percent of that figure would seem plausible if supported by a clear
analysis of financial barriers.

39.         For GEF purposes, the preparation of the project has included the incremental cost analysis
shown above. This analysis provides a baseline and the incremental cost of achieving global benefits by
using geothermal energy as a renewable energy source.

40.         To assure the proposed geothermal exploration venture is technically sound and commercially
viable, a technical and financial due diligence review was conducted by an expert consultant during the
appraisal process.

42.         The project will come to a decision point when the results of the test operation are evaluated. In
case of satisfactory parameters, the consortium members will form a company for the further
implementation of the project and the establishment of a geothermal power plant. In case of unsatisfactory
test results, eligible Y2006 expenditures will be declared a loss and compensation will be paid by the
GEF.

43.         Operational cost estimates: operational costs have been estimated on the basis of reference data
from the Husavik (Iceland) geothermal power plant. This is yearly 1.5-2 percent of capital costs. With
planned commission at the second quarter of 2008, this is HUF 28-37 million in 2008 and HUF 56-74
million yearly afterwards.

2.            Technical

45.       Several proven technologies are available and are used worldwide to produce electrical energy
from geothermal resources. Medium enthalpy projects, such as the one proposed for development in
Hungary, use binary cycle technologies, which are fueled by moderate temperature fluids (i.e., 105°C to
180°C) from geothermal reservoirs.

46.       In binary cycle power plants, hot geothermal fluids are passed through one side of a heat
exchanger to heat a working fluid on the other side of the heat exchanger. The working fluid, usually an
organic compound with a low boiling point such as iso-butane or iso-pentane, is vaporized and passed
through a turbine to generate electricity. The geothermal fluid that has passed through the heat exchanger
may be used in a direct use application such as an industrial or agricultural process if the direct use
facility is near enough to the power plant and economically feasible.

47.       The turbine-generators and work areas of the power plant are housed in a simple steel building,
with cooling towers, piping and separators located on a small footprint site of only a few hectares.
Production and injection wells are situated within a radius of not more than one kilometer from the power
plant. Insulated pipelines from the production wells to the inlet to the turbines carry geothermal fluids.
The production and injection pipelines can bridge over or pass under roads as well as allow, for example,
farming activities to continue. The power project is then interconnected to the regional grid.

3.            Fiduciary

48.       This is a geological risk insurance with general terms as per those of the partial risk insurance
facility under the GeoFund. Disbursement is contingent on project parameters not reaching expected
values, as stipulated in the Grant Agreement. In case of a loss incurred by the project developer due to
lower than expected reservoir parameters, the GEF will pay a certain percentage of this loss through the


                                                    127

partial guarantee window of the umbrella GeoFund. The GRI will be managed by the GEF Trust Fund
Unit in the Bank and no funds will flow to the grant recipient unless the risks for which the GRI is
provided occurs, in which case only the amount agreed in advance will be paid to developer directly.
Accordingly no fiduciary assessment is necessary for this project. From financial management
perspective, this activity is considered low risk.

49.      The project developer is a leading integrated oil and gas group in Central and Eastern Europe and
the largest company in Hungary by sales revenues. MOL is a market leader in each of its core activities in
Hungary and Slovakia. MOL shares are listed on the Budapest, Luxembourg and Warsaw Stock
Exchanges and traded on the International Order Book of the London Stock Exchange.

Financial Reporting and Monitoring of Drilling Activities

50.      For project monitoring purposes, a progress report on the drilling activities will be prepared by
MOL quarterly and furnished to the Bank not later than one month after the period. The progress report
will include a detailed time table for Exploration Activities and corresponding statement of expenses.

51.      The progress report is required under the Grant Agreement that describes the proposed testing,
drilling, and exploration activities (the "Exploration Activities") and the estimated costs and expenses for
each itemized activities to determine the expenses (the "Insurable Expenses") to be covered by the GRI.

52.      Furthermore it defines the parameters of success, failure and partial failure and the methodology
to calculate the compensation amount of GRI.

53.      At the end of the project (insurance period of the drilling) the last quarterly report will be
furnished to the Bank in lieu of the Recipient's Completion Report not later than 1 month after the closing
date. A Verification Report prepared by an independent entity will be furnished to the Bank before the
Closing Date of the Grant Agreement. The Verification report has to include an assessment of geothermal
parameters by an independent entity satisfactory to the World Bank, an audited reports of the Eligible
Expenses actually spent, and records of the Exploration Activities actually performed by the Beneficiary
or its contractors.

Flow of funds

54.      The World Bank would make funds available to MOL in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Grant Agreement. Funds will be disbursed from the Bank directly to the project
beneficiary on the basis of the Verification Report.

55.      Fees (Premium and Processing) will be paid by the beneficiary to the Bank in accordance with the
Grant Agreement.

Disbursement Arrangements

56.      The project is expected to be implemented over a period of about nine months, including the
completion of accounts and the submission of the Verification Report.


                                                   128

57.     The amount of GEF Grant funds to be disbursed will be determined in accordance with the Grant
Agreement based on the claim laid down in the Verification Report. GEF Grant funds will be disbursed
only in one installment within 30 days of the submission of the Verification Report. There are no special
forms for initial filing of a claim under the GeoFund; therefore an EM, letter, or memorandum outlining
details of loss will be sufficient.

58.     The Maximum compensation amount will be adjusted based on the eligible insurable expenses
actually spent as reported in the Verification Report. If the project is successful, no payments will be
made.

59.     Disbursement will take place in accordance with the Bank's Disbursement Guidelines with the
Verification Report as supporting documentation.

4.          Social

This is a small pilot project with an expected electric capacity of not more than 2-5 MW. No social issues
are foreseen.

5.          Environment

60.     Given the small scale nature of the project no significant environmental issues are involved, with
negative impacts limited to the surroundings of the project site. These impacts are summarized below on
the basis of the environmental impact assessment.

A. Construction works prior to test operation (well cleaning, bottom perforation, surface link)

        Soil: Land will be occupied (some 1 hectare radius around well) during construction works at the
        well sites. Pressure will be on soil during pipeline construction (10 m strip along pipeline).

        Sub-surface water: Local karst water level will temporarily change (200 m around well) to
        insignificant extent.

        Air: Limited CO2 and steam emissions (650 m around well) will occur.

        Noise: Ground works will pose noise pollution (100-130 m around facilities); the test operation
        output "whistle" can be heard (400-1200 m around facilities) for a short period.

B. Test operation (3-5 months)

        No significant environmental impacts are expected during this phase.

C. Power plant construction

        Soil: Pressure will be on soil during pipeline construction (10 m strip along pipeline); Land use
        change will occur (some 1 hectare radius around the power plant) once the power plant is
        constructed.

        Noise: Ground works will pose noise pollution (10 m around facilities)

D. Power plant operation

        Sub-surface water: Local karst water level change (300-1000 m around well) to insignificant
        extent; significant layer temperature change (500-600 m around well)

61.     In addition to hazardous and non-hazardous waste that will be produced during the construction
works, sludge, as a by product of well cleaning and drilling will be produced. Disposal of all of these
elements is performed by the project developer routinely in accordance with the relevant regulations. The
treatment of hazardous wastes is regulated in Hungary by the 98/2001 (VI. 15.) Government decree and
by the 16/2001 (VII. 18) decree of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Hungary is a signatory to
the Basel Convention on Hazardous Wastes since 1990.



                                                  129

62.      Of all the expected environmental impacts, only the layer temperature change that occurs during
production due to the re-injection of cooled geothermal fluid is of significance. This layer temperature
change, however, is not expected to lead to decrease in the temperature of the reservoir during the 25
years lifetime of the project.

63.      The positive environmental impact of the project is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions on
a national level.

64.      The Bank considered whether OP7.50 should be triggered given the use of groundwater in
somewhat close proximity to the border with Slovenia and Croatia. After a review of the geological,
hydrologic and engineering aspects of the operation and site, OP7.50 was deemed not to be applicable.
Key supporting factors are:

         (i) groundwaters targeted for exploitation are not suitable for drinking water, being relatively high
         in salt content, over 100 degrees Celsius in temperature and under high pressure. Furthermore the
         "closed loop" project design, where fluids are reinjected (after some latent heat extraction) within
         the same producing horizon will maintain the resource in a sustainable fashion. Project impacts
         will be highly localized and controlled (within 1-2 kilometers of the wells) and 10 kilometers or
         more from the nearest international boundary. Thus, the project will have no transboundary
         impacts.

         (ii) while it is possible that rock formations similar to those being tapped by the geothermal
         demonstration project might extend into Slovenia and Croatia (albeit at depth of 4 kilometers or
         more), we do not have any information that suggests these formations are contiguous with any
         recognized fresh drinking water supply aquifer shared between Hungary and its neighbors. In
         fact, the list of shared aquifers in Europe prepared by the UN/ECE and UNESCO does not
         include this aquifer.

65.      Apart from OP 7.50 matters, the Hungarian licensing and Bank EA screening and review process
suggests there is no measurable risk to any existing or potential use of geothermal waters for
recreational/spa or energy extraction in nearby countries"

specific and reversible. The project developer has already completed the EA process in accordance with
national/EU requirements and has obtained the environmental license.

67.     The environmental assessment process is governed by the 20/2001. (II.14.) Government decree
(the Decree) in Hungary17. The licensing authority that issues the environmental license and that decides
on the EA category of the project on the basis of the Decree's classification table (and on the basis of
further relevant information) is the Regional Environmental, Nature Protection and Water Inspectorate.

68.     Project types according to their likely categorization are listed in annexes A and B to the Decree.
According to the decision of the licensing authority the MOL project falls under EA category B. The
relevant specifics in annex B are as follows:

    a) Utilization of sub-surface (thermal karst) waters: production from one resource, or resource group
        not less than 1,000 m3/day but not more than 5 million m3/year.
    b) Re-injection into sub-surface waters: less than 3 million m3/year.

69.     Disclosure of project safeguards related documentation has taken place in accordance with the
Decree. . The disclosure package has been sent to the affected municipalities of Iklódbörd ce and

Background to IFC Involvement with the Global Environment Facility

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was established in 1994 to assist in the protection of the global
environment and to promote environmentally sound and sustainable economic development. GEF and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) executed an agreement on July 1, 1994
pursuant to which IBRD became an Implementing Agency for GEF, with the capacity to administer GEF
funds for pursuing projects in keeping with the objectives of GEF. On May 31st, 1996, IBRD and
International Finance Corporation (IFC) entered into an arrangement for the administration and
management by IFC, of funds to be made available by IBRD from the GEF Trust Fund, for the financing
of activities related to the GEF (hereafter called the 1996 Arrangement).

Pursuant to the 1996 Arrangement, GEF funded projects administered by IFC can be approved,
administered and disbursed in accordance with IFC's rules and procedures, taking into account the
specific requirements approved by the GEF Council for such projects. All of IFC's GEF funded projects
are administered under the said 1996 Arrangement.

Project Background

IBRD, as an Implementing Agency for GEF, has GEF Council approval for US$25 million of funding for
the Geothermal Energy Development Program (The GeoFund). This project aims at developing
geothermal energy resources in countries of Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia (the Region).
The GeoFund will undertake to provide:
    (a) Support to Governments in policy improvements and removal of barriers against the use of
        renewable energy resources in general, and geothermal energy in particular,
    (b) Capacity building for geothermal energy development in the countries targeted,
    (c) Impetus to the use of geothermal energy through the further development of these resources, and
    (d) Development of a balanced portfolio of geothermal energy projects in the region, applying
        different geothermal technologies.

71.     Using the 1996 Arrangement as the basis for cooperation, IBRD and IFC will work as partners on
GeoFund. Each agency has its own area of expertise, and by combining these under a single initiative,
the GeoFund seeks to comprehensively address issues that hold back the development of geothermal
resources, and promote the development of projects in this area. This will involve the provision of


                                                    132

technical assistance for: (i) Capacity building to remove knowledge barriers; (ii) Policy reviews and
amendments, and (iii) Project preparation as well as financial assistance to facilitate access to additional
commercial financing on reasonable terms.

Proposed Role of Agencies

72.      The GeoFund will be implemented in a series of individual subprojects in participating ECA
countries during a period of eight (8) years. While GEF Council and CEO approval will be/has been
obtained for the GeoFund, individual project Grant Agreements will not go to the GEF Secretariat for
approval, but rather will be decided based on the rules of the agency in question (IFC or WB) that is
implementing the said project. IFC will focus on projects which are either in the private sector, or are
likely to lead to investments by private sector entities. Another area of focus is on projects that will be
developed with the municipal sector. Preliminary discussions with IFC's Municipal Department has
indicated an interest in such projects.
73.
74.      To assure high quality and the achievement of defined project goals, the GeoFund will be
implemented on a project by project basis in a two phased approach. Each phase involves a number of
projects and countries. This phased approach allows for adjustments and refining of the specifications of
its instruments, according to the experience gained during project implementation, and changing market
conditions. We believe that not only will this approach enhance project results, but it will also maximize
the impact of the utilized funds.
75.
The Start -up phase will be covered by US$11.5 million, and in the second phase a new set of projects
will be developed and implemented as they become ready. Lessons learned during the start-up phase will
be integrated into project design and implementation.

76.      The list of likely projects is given in Table 1 at page 16. The disbursement levels shown are only
indicative. Actual disbursements will depend on a thorough review of the projects by the responsible
agency. It is proposed that IFC's focus be on Russia, Armenia and Turkey, though new geographies and
projects could be added based on the experience gained, and market conditions. The experience gained
during the project phase will inform the process for the second phase.
77.
78.      Three principal instruments of the GeoFund will be:
79.
         A Technical Assistance Window, to address barriers that retard the use of renewable energy
         resources and geothermal energy. It will also help set up or systematize geothermal databases,
         will contribute to dissemination of geothermal knowledge and know-how, and will help to
         identify and prepare/implement geothermal projects.

         An Investment Funding Window that would provide low cost loans, contingent and straight
         grants, covering part of the project cost through monetization of external benefits.

         A Geological Risk Insurance Window to partially insure project developers/investors against the
         short-term and medium-term geological risks.

It is proposed that a joint GeoFund Coordination Team (GCT) be set up, consisting of members from
IBRD and IFC. From IFC side, two IFC representatives would be a part of the GCT; one of whom will
be the Task Manager for the projects allocated to IFC. This team will meet periodically, and review input
received from consultants on a pipeline of geothermal projects in the Region. This team will (a) sift
through the data provided; (b) identify a shortlist of subprojects recommended for further implementation;
(c) propose the respective agency responsible for implementation; (d) discuss at appropriate intervals
during GeoFund implementation, the lessons learned, and appropriate modifications to the process in light
of experience gained; and (e) report, as required, to the GEF Council and Secretariat. If there are


                                                    133

significant modifications in the program design that need GEF endorsement, these will be made either
jointly by IBRD and IFC, or by IBRD alone, but with consultation and input from IFC. No changes will
be made to the arrangement that adversely affect IFC, without the explicit approval of the IFC members
on GCT.

IFC Participation and Role/s

The GCT is an advisory body, which provides the agencies with an initial screen of the subprojects, and
facilitates the sharing of experiences and expertise. It is not a legal entity, and its function is to make
recommendations to the agencies with respect to subproject implementation.

IFC sees its role primarily in the development of those subprojects where there is a significant possibility
of private sector participation, or where the instruments used are particularly suitable for IFC's
implementation. It would therefore be essential that the IFC members sitting on the GCT agree to the
allocation of a particular subproject to IFC for implementation, prior to the next step being taken.

When a particular project is allocated by GCT to IFC, per the 1996 Arrangement, IFC will follow its own
processes and project cycle for the implementation of the said subproject. The flowchart below (A)
outlines what such a project cycle will be. Please note that the yellow boxes show the role of GCT, and
all the white boxes refer to IFC processes.

As noted in the chart, project identification and early review of subprojects are done through GCT. This
fits into the IFC project cycle, and the non-IFC members as well as the consultants are experts who help
IFC arrive at the appropriate shortlist for recommendation to IFC Management. As the next step, IFC's
Task Manager for the initiative conducts a more detailed due diligence and appraisal of the said
subproject using its internal processes and expertise. He/she may also use consultants hired under the
GeoFund to provide further input on the projects and/or use IFC staff/consultants as deemed appropriate.

The Task Manager will then convene an Investment Review meeting with the Investment Review
Committee (IRC) (similar to PVMTI) consisting of IFC members, and one member from IBRD. The
suggested IBRD member is the IBRD Task Manager for the GeoFund, or his designee. The constitution
of the IRC will be shaped by the recommendations of the COSO review, which appear to favor a cross-
functional review. More details on this will be provided upon further consultation.

Results of the detailed appraisal/due diligence will be presented to the IRC, irrespective of the
recommendation. In cases where the project is viewed favorably by the IRC, the subproject proceeds to
the next step in Flowchart A, i.e. negotiations with the counter-party/ies, to insure that there is agreement
on the broad terms. In cases where the IRC returns a negative recommendation, the process outlined in
Flowchart B is followed i.e. a format rejection letter is sent to GCT. There can also be situations where
there are some caveats around the approval provided by the IRC. These caveats must be complied with,
prior to proceeding to the next stage. In all cases, GCT will be informed of the decision taken at the IRC.

If the subproject is proceeding to the next step, a formal approval memo with the recommendation of the
IRC is prepared, and the same must be ratified by the Manager of the Environment Finance Group (as
designee of the CES Director). Reference will be made to this GeoFund Management approval memo,
duly approved by the CES Department Director, and to the IRC recommendation. Based on the authority
vested in the Manager for approval of subprojects, the subproject will be approved, and IFC's Task
Manager will proceed with negotiating the project contract/s, and implementing the project.

Regular reporting by IFC on subproject progress to GCT will occur as part of the agenda on the regular
meetings. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) practices will be discussed with IFC's internal team and


                                                   134

can also be discussed at the GCT meetings. More information on these practices will be made available,
based on recommendations of the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) review. However, the
processes to be followed, will be those of IFC, and will be in line with similar practice for other GEF
initiatives.

Other IFC Roles

Aside from IFC's role as the execution agency for certain subprojects, IFC's Task Manager and one
additional member will be active participants in GCT. As part of GCT, they will opine on the projects
that are to be executed by agencies other than IFC. Flowchart C lays out the processes that will be
followed if IBRD is implementing a particular subproject. The point to note is that the processes
followed post the recommendation from GCT will be those of the agency implementing the project.
