Program (Geofund) Project for Europe and Central Asia\n            systematically promotes the use of geothermal energy by\n            removing barriers and reducing the global emissions of\n            greenhouse gases. This safeguards section of the operational\n            manual assesses negative environmental impacts and lists\n            suggestions for mitigating them. Among the risks considered\n            are these: The land requirement will lead to vegetal loss\n            soil, soil erosion, landslides, ad land ownership issues.\n            These could be mitigated by using single drill pads (several\n            wells), revegetating, and providing adequate land\n            compensation. Taking water for drilling may lead to local\n            watershed impacts, and damming and diverting local streams.\n            These effects could be alleviated by taking water from\n            streams with high flow rates, coinciding drilling with the\n            rainy season, building temporary reservoirs, and liaising\n            with local farmers to consider their usage. Taking water\n            from reservoirs may result in hydrothermal eruptions,\n            lowering of the water table, an increase in the steam zone,\n            and saline intrusion. To offset these effects, avoid areas\n            where there's a propensity for hydrothermal eruptions\n            and carefully manage resources. To prevent effects from\n            waste disposal into streams and waterways, treat effluent\n            and remove undesired constituents, reinject all waste\n            fluids, use a cascaded approach towards waste fluids, and\n            dilute brine. Also when reinjecting, plan carefully and\n            monitor flow patterns before re-injecting. Minimize air\n            emissions by scrubbing hydrogen disulfide and treating other\n            non-condensable gases. Reduce nose with mufflers and silencers."}, "docdt": "2006-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
