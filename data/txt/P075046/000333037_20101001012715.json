(GeoFund) Project for Europe and Central\n            Asia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            geothermal development is a risky business, with only about\n            a 30 percent success rate. Given the risk adverse nature of\n            investors and of Bank management, a renewable energy project\n            with a certain portion of the grant designated for\n            geothermal development might have resulted in a more robust\n            pipeline of subprojects and have been more successful in\n            meeting the Global Environment Objective (GEO). Given that\n            pipeline development is critical to the success of a\n            regional program, it should be pursued as early as possible\n            during project preparation. Close cooperation between\n            regions on similar innovative geothermal development\n            programs resulted in synergy and efficiencies in terms of\n            knowledge and product innovation. Sector specific\n            region-wide programs like the GeoFund program, solely\n            supported by Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources,\n            tend to lack country unit ownership and linkages to country\n            based programs."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
