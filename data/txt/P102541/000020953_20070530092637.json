phase\n            of a medium-term reform agenda. The credit attempts to\n            address systemic governance issues in order to raise the\n            quality and cost-effectiveness of service delivery, and\n            improve equity of access to secondary education. The reform\n            agenda focuses on: 1) Accountability and systemic\n            improvement. Reforms in these areas include rigorous\n            enforcement of the criteria governing the establishment of\n            institutions, and implementation of institutional mechanisms\n            to link school subventions to objective measures of school\n            performance; 2) Equity, through which demand-side\n            interventions to encourage rural girls to attend secondary\n            school are continuing; 3) Administration/capacity Building,\n            in which MoE's planning and policy-making capacity is\n            being strengthened with adequate institutional mechanism for\n            oversight of a number of implementation measures, and\n            greater implementation responsibility is being devolved to\n            lower levels; 4) Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination,\n            whereby MoE is placing significantly greater emphasis on\n            program evaluation and monitoring to guide policy and\n            planning; 5) Teachers ' Quality, through which an\n            autonomous Non-Government Teacher Registration and\n            Certification Authority has been established, and which now\n            develops a roster of pre-qualified and certified individuals\n            eligible to be hired as teachers by the School Management\n            Committees (SMCs) and Governing Bodies (GBs); and 6)\n            Textbook Production and Curriculum Development to open up\n            textbook production to competition."}, "docdt": "2007-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
