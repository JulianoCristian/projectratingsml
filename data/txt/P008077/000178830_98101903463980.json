The project consists of three\n            components. The first component is the construction of the\n            Port of Spain \"B\" thermal power station - a\n            semi-outdoor type, with a steel framed structure covered\n            with a light weight insulated cladding to house the\n            turboalternator sets and control equipment. The second, the\n            construction of a pipeline to supply natural gas, will be\n            about 41 miles in length and will bring gas from oil fields\n            at Penal to the Port of Spain area. The third, the expansion\n            of transmission and distribution facilities of the Trinidad\n            and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&TEC), will be\n            reinforced to take care of increasing loads and will also be\n            extended to supply new areas."}, "docdt": "1961-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
