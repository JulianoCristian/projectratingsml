Sao Paulo\n            Railway (FEPASA) Railway Rehabilitation Project in Brazil.\n            Bank performance on the whole was satisfactory, especially\n            during project preparation and supervision during the second\n            half of the project period. Borrower performance started\n            well with good project preparation in close collaboration\n            with the Bank, but was unsatisfactory during project\n            implementation. Despite the real achievements of the project\n            the delays and difficulties experienced during\n            implementation lead to a rating of the outcome as a whole as\n            (marginally) unsatisfactory. Any Bank support for future\n            operations of this kind should be based on a realistic\n            assessment of the macro-economic and political risks. The\n            main lessons for future projects are that: (i) although\n            there were major shortfalls in the implementation of the\n            project, the experience was not altogether negative; (ii)\n            The FEPASA Rehabilitation Project enabled useful investments\n            to be made which arrested the deterioration of the\n            railway's infrastructure and rolling stock; (iii) a\n            major restructuring of the railway, including substantial\n            participation of the private sector, now appears possible\n            and essential to bring about the creation of a commercially\n            viable entity and to reduce government subsidies; (iv) the\n            unreserved support and continued commitment of the\n            Government is a prerequisite for the success of the\n            restructuring effort; (v) railway restructuring is a\n            time-consuming and contentious process, and (vi) future Bank\n            railway lending, if any, should be confined to the support\n            of deregulation, restructuring and privatization of the\n            railway system."}, "docdt": "1996-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
