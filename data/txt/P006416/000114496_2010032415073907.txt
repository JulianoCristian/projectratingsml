SCHEDULE 4
Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I:
Procurement of Goods
 
Part A:
International Competitive Bidding
 
Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and civil works shall be  procured 
under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth 
in Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA 
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines).
Part B:
Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
 
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A of this Schedule, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a  margin of 
preference in accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions:
1.
All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly  indicate any 
preference which would be granted, the information required to establish the 
eligiblity of a bid for such preference and the following  methods and stages that 
will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
2.
After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 
groups:
(1)
Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder shall 
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank  that such goods 
contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the 
complete goods.
(2)
Group B: bids offering any other goods.
 
3.
In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and other imports taxes levied in connection with the importation, and 
sales and similar taxes levied in  connection with the sale or delivery, pursuant to 
the bids, of the goods.  Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared with each 
other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it 
shall be selected for the award.
4.
If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding: (i) to  the c.i.f. bid price of goods to be 
imported in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the amount of 
customs duties and other imports taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay 
for the importation of the goods offered in such group B bid; or (B) 15% of the c.i.f. 
bid price of such goods, and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied 
domestically offered in each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of:  (A) the 
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which would be  levied on the goods 
offered in such group B if they originated from the  same foreign country as the bid 
Page  16
included in group B which enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import taxes, or 
(B) 15% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods. If, as a result of this comparison, 
the bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the 
lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, shall be 
selected for the award.
Part C:
Other Procurement Procedures
 
(a)
Civil works estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $3,000,000, and 
(b) goods estimated to cost the equivalent of $400,000 or less up to an aggregate not 
to exceed $5,000,000 equivalent, may be procured  under contracts awarded on the basis 
of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in accordance with procedures satisfactory 
to the Bank; provided, however, that in case the disbursement percentage for Category 
2 of the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement is reduced, the 
aggregate limit of $5,000,000 equivalent shall be deemed applicable to the amounts 
actually disbursed from the Loan Account in respect of goods procured under this Part 
C rather than to the aggregate of the contracts awarded in respect of such goods.
Part D:
Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
 
(a)
With respect to each contract for civil works estimated to cost the 
equivalent of $2,000,000 or more, and contracts for goods estimated to cost the 
equivalent of $250,000 or more, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of 
Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where  payments for such contract are to be 
made out of the Special Account, such  procedures shall be modified to ensure that the 
two conformed copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to 
said paragraph 2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first 
payment  out of the Special Account in respect of such contract.
(b)
With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, 
the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall 
apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of CESA or FESA, as the 
case may be, such procedures shall be modified  to ensure that the two conformed 
copies of the contract together with the  other information required to be furnished 
to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as part of the 
evidence to be furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 to the Loan Agreement.
(c)
The provisions of the preceding subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply 
to contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan 
Account on the basis of statements of expenditures. Such contracts shall be retained 
in accordance with Section 5.01 (c) (ii) of this Agreement.
3.
The figure of 20% is hereby specified for purposes of paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 
to the Guidelines.
Section II:
Employment of Consultants
 
In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out of the Project, the Borrower 
shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of 
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank and  the Borrower. Such consultants shall 
be selected in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on 
the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by

and $1,500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and  deposited in the CESA and 
FESA, respectively, pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of the CESA or FESA, as 
the case may be, shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance 
with the provisions of this Schedule. The Account  Bank shall authorize withdrawals 
from the CESA or FESA, as the case may be,  on the basis of the evidence that the Bank 
shall have reasonably determined and provided that: (i) in the case of CESA, payment 
of the corresponding eligible expenditures has been made out of the Project Account; 
or (ii) funds for such payment are readily available in the Project Account. For each 
such withdrawal so authorized, the Account Bank shall debit or cause to be debited 
CESA or FESA, as the case may be, with the dollar equivalent of  the amount of the 
eligible expenditures in question in cruzados, in the case of FESA, or with the actual 
dollar amount or  the dollar equivalent of the eligible expenditures in currencies 
other than  dollars or cruzados, in the
case of FESA.
3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that CESA or  FESA, as 
the case may be, has been duly opened, withdrawals of the   corresponding Authorized 
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish CESA or FESA, as the case may be, 
may be made as follows:
(a)
On the basis of a request or requests by the Borrower for a deposit or 
deposits which add up to the aggregate amount of the Authorized  Allocation, the Bank 
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the  Loan Account and deposit in CESA 
or FESA, as the case may be, such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have 
requested.
(b)
The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for replenishment of CESA 
Page  19
or FESA, as the case may be, at such intervals as the Bank shall  specify. On the 
basis of such requests, the Bank shall withdraw from the  Loan Account and deposit 
into CESA and FESA, such amounts as shall be required to replenish CESA and FESA, 
respectively, with amounts not  exceeding the amount of payments made out of CESA or 
FESA, as the case may be, for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be 
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, 
and in  the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by the 
evidence supporting the request for such deposit furnished pursuant to  paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule.
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of CESA or FESA for which the Borrower 
requests replenishment pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of this Schedule, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank, prior to or at the time  of such request, such documents 
and other evidence as the Bank shall  reasonably request, showing that such payment 
was made for eligible expenditures.
5.
(a)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank 
may deny any request for further deposits into CESA or FESA when either of the 
following situations arises:
(i)
the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals should 
be made by 
the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance 
with the provisions 
of Article V of the General Conditions and 
paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of 
this Agreement; or
 
(ii)
the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible 
Categories, 
minus the amount of any outstanding special commitment 
entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the 
General Conditions with respect to the 
Project, shall be equal to the 
equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation.
 
(b)
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories the Project shall follow such 
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to  the Borrower. Such further 
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the  extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in CESA or FESA, as the case may 
be, as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
CESA or FESA: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any amount not  eligible pursuant 
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule, or (ii) was not justified  by the evidence furnished 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice 
from the Bank, deposit into CESA or FESA, as the case may be, (or, if the  Bank shall 
so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the 
portion thereof not so eligible or justified. No further deposit by the Bank into CESA 
or FESA, as the case may be, shall be made until the Borrower has made such deposit or 
refund.
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in CESA or FESA will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from  the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account and immediate 
cancellation.
