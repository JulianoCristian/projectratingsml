The action program includes measures for an\n            organizational and financial restructuring of FEPASA, the\n            rationalization of railway operations and improved corporate\n            and business planning.  It further includes appropriate\n            tariffs and effective marketing and cost-control, upgraded\n            operations and maintenance management systems, and effective\n            personnel management and training.  The investment component\n            essentially includes the rehabilitation and improvement of\n            the most critical line sections, yards, telecommunication\n            systems, rolling stock and workshops, and track maintenance\n            and intermodal facilities.
