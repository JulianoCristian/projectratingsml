                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the discussions of parallel missions of both the original eGhana Project and GIFMIS (Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System) component
                         carried out in May 2014. The GIFMIS component was conducted together with DiFD, the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA), and the Delegation of the
                         European Union (EU). The task teams reviewed implementation progress to date against targets under the Project Appraisal Document and Additional Financing Project Paper;
                         assessed project management, institutional, fiduciary and Monitoring and Evaluation arrangements; and discussed innovative ways to begin communicating project results.

                         [Original eGhana Project]
                         Implementation progress and the likelihood of achieving the developmental objectives of the eGhana Project continue to be is Satisfactory. Disbursement rate is also improving
                         continuously. As of June 25 2014, it stands at 95% for the original eGhana project and 76% for the additional financing component. The remaining balance is 100% committed.

                         Almost all the key performance indicators under the original eGhana project have already been achieved with some of the project-end target values achieved far beyond the target
                         values (e.g. decrease in bandwidth price, number of people trained, job creation in the ITES sector, % increase in ITES contribution to GDP, etc.). There has been significant
                         progress on project implementation since the last supervision mission, including the completion of operational acceptance of the automation of the Ghana Revenue Authority and
                         Register General's Department; training for BPO agents; and advancement in the incubation program development: and the construction of BPO center and Regional Innovation
                         Centers.

                         [GFMIS component - Component 4]
                         Implementation progress and the likelihood of achieving the developmental objectives of the GIFMIS component is also rated Satisfactory. At present, all consolidated fund related
                         expenditures ( 66% of the appropriated budget) are being executed through the system, and ex-ante commitment control for the consolidated fund expenditure has been instituted
                         through GIFMIS. Network connectivity has been extended to an additional 72 pending units, and it enabled them to process transactions on-site. EFT has been rolled out across all
                         Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MMDAs), which enables them to make Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) direct transactions against the appropriate Treasury Single Account
                         (TSA) sub account. The payroll system has been upgraded from Oracle version 11 to version 12, and is live for all GoG employees (except Ghana Education Service). This is
                         significant progress as the payroll data management was a major issue when the GIFMIS component started.

                         Following the official request from the Government of Ghana (GoG) dated on February 17, 2014, the project was restructured to extend the project closing date for 6 months from
                         June 30, 2014, to enable completion of a few but critical subcomponents of the project to enhance achievement of PDOs. The new project closing date is December 31, 2014. This
                         restructuring also facilitated a reallocation of funds to accommodate technical assistance and operational costs.
