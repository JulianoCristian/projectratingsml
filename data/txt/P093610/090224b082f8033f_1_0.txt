1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      At the time of appraisal, Ghana had just emerged from an economic crisis and was
beginning to register an impressive growth rate of 5.8 percent compared to a twenty year average
of 4.4 percent. The Government of Ghana (GoG) understood the urgent need to diversify its
sources of growth in order to sustain this growth, as well as reach its goal of middle income status
by 2015. The Government’s Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II 2006-2009)
identified three strategic sectors that could transform the country, improve its competitiveness, and
further expand its economic base. These included Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT)-related services, agri–processing and tourism. ICT was targeted to also improve the
government’s own operations and service delivery and make them more transparent, accountable
and efficient.

2.      To support this new growth agenda, the GoG adopted the Ghana ICT for Accelerated
Development (ICT4AD) Policy as well as a pro-investment National Telecommunications Policy,
and prepared laws to strengthen the regulatory body and environment, all of which were intended
to make the telecommunications sector more competitive and provide a foundation for a robust
knowledge economy. These initiatives faced several important constraints to its ICT-based
development strategy: i) while the country was one of the few on the continent at the time to have
access to a submarine cable, the cost of international connectivity was still high, and quality low,
owing in large part to monopolistic practices of operators, ii) the legal and regulatory framework
was still inadequate to provide confidence for private sector investment in national backbone
infrastructure; iii) the country lacked the requisite human and physical infrastructure to promote
ICT/Information Technology Enabled Service (ITES) sector growth which could in turn generate
employment, and iv) the Government itself lacked the technical skills, standards and infrastructure
to drive the ICT4AD agenda.

Rationale for Bank involvement
3.        Prior to the eGhana Project, the World Bank had provided significant technical assistance
to reform the telecommunications sector in Ghana including support to: (i) privatize the incumbent
operator and introduce competition into the fixed market; (ii) create the Regulatory Authority; and
(iii) streamline the licensing framework/validate licenses of operators. The Bank had also worked
with GoG to undertake extensive analysis of the telecommunications and ICT sector potential, and
identified remaining binding constraints to leveraging ICTs and ITES as potent sources of
sustainable growth and transformational service delivery in Ghana. At the time of appraisal, the
Bank had also acquired experience with similar support to telecommunications sector reform and
in leveraging ICT for development in over 80 countries, including more than 30 countries in Africa.

4.     The Bank’s experience and analytical work had confirmed the important link between ICT
and growth, estimated between 0.3 to 3.2 percentage points of GDP growth for every 10 percent
increase in broadband access. Ghana itself had experienced a 50 percent growth in customs
revenue generation within 18 months of automating its customs processes, and the telecom sector
was already contributing about 5 percent of GDP, up from 1.8 percent in less than 5 years. The
eGhana project responded to the Government’s request for support in implementing its agenda for
ICT-led growth. This project was based on sound analytical work and the Bank’s experience in
                                                 1
Ghana and elsewhere (including the eLanka ICT development project in Sri Lanka). The project
also took into account the evidence of ICT’s potential impact for transformation of the way
Government does business, and the way citizens live, work, do business and engage with
government. It was also important for the Government that Bank was able to help mobilize
specialized skills, particularly from the private sector, to design and implement effective policies
and programs for assisting countries to make the transition to an information-based economy.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
5.     The objective of the Project was “to assist the Recipient to generate growth and
employment by leveraging ICT and public-private partnerships to i) develop the IT Enabled
Services (ITES) industry, and ii) contribute to improved efficiency and transparency of selected
government functions through e-government applications.”

6.       The Government and IDA agreed to measure the project performance at the outcome level
against the key performance indicators including :
      i.      Increased employment in the ICT/ITES sector
      ii.     Contribution to GDP from ITES sector
      iii.    Increased involvement of the private sector through Public Private Partnership
              (PPPs)
      iv.     Effective and transparent e-government services through indicators measuring the
              degree of automation

7.     The key performance indicators at the PDO and intermediate outcome levels, both original
and revised, are detailed in Section F of the data sheet.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
8.      The PDO remained appropriate and did not need to be changed when a new Government
Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) component was added (with
additional financing in 2010, because it was also e-government application which supported the
PDO of improved efficiency and transparency in government functions. A number of PDO
indicators were added to reflect the new GIFMIS component. Some of the indicator targets of the
original PDO indicators were revised to reflect additional financing of existing components.

9.      Revised targets included a 22 percent downward revision of the increase in export led
revenues generated by ICT/ITES industry from US$90 million to US$70 million to reflect the
reality of the financial crisis in 2009 that reduced Ghana’s export opportunities. This was in
contrast to the domestic ICT sector expansion which reflected the still strong domestic demand for
ICT services, including a rapid expansion of cell phone and internet users 1. This expansion was
reflected in a 26 percent upward revision of the new employment target.




1
  Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR) for mobile cell phone subscribers (2005-2009) was 38%. CAGR for
Internet users (2005-2009) was 25% (Source: ITU).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.      The main beneficiaries fall into three categories (a) the people of Ghana who are using e-
government applications implemented under the project; (b) government agencies, and their
employees, given the use of applications to improve government efficiency; and (c) stakeholders
in the ICT sector of Ghana, including the private sector and entrepreneurs. In the private ICT
sector beneficiaries include those who are employed in the ICT/ITES sector. In particular female
workers benefit because of the project’s emphasis on maintaining a high percentage of female ICT
employees. Other private sector beneficiaries include businesses seeking opportunities to launch
offshoring activities, and new entrepreneurs needing training and business contacts to advance
their business initiatives. Consumers of government services benefit from easier processing of
official documents such as birth and death certificates, registration of businesses and filing of tax
returns. Government benefits from efficiency gains of well-planned systems that have well
defined standards and are interoperable. Beneficiary institutions include the Ministry of
Communications (MoC), the National Communications Authority (NCA), Ghana Revenue
Authority (GRA) and Registrar General’s Department (RGD) many of whose employees will have
less paperwork to process and will be able to focus on other tasks. The Ministry of Finance (MoF)
and Controller and Accountant General Department (CAGD) employees will find it easier to do
their jobs through automation of the national budget with linkages to the Ministries, Departments,
and Agencies (MDAs). More generally, the improved legal and regulatory framework will
facilitate private sector participation, promote competition, and benefit the broader economy
through competitive prices, diversified and enhanced growth.

1.6 Revised Components
12.     On May 27, 2010 the Bank approved additional financing (AF) for the project of US$44.7
million, more than doubling the overall size of the project and extending the project closing date
from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2014. A total of US$ 28.44 million (IDA) went to support a
GIFMIS component while the remaining U$$16.26 million addressed financing gaps in the
original project. The Rockefeller Foundation provided US$3.8 million in addition to top up
financing of the BPO center. The AF also included funding from development partners – United
Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA) and the European Union (EU) - to support the GIFMIS component which was
included as component 4 and focused on the following activities:

Component 4: Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS)
(IDA US$28.44m; DFID: US$15.05m, DANIDA: US$4.82m and EU: US$12.27m, Total
Development Partners Additional Financing: US$32.14m)
A.    Establishment of modern technical infrastructure for ICT-based public financial
management information systems across the government connecting the treasuries and Ministries,
Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) and the Metropolitan, Municipal, District Assemblies
(MMDAs) at the central, regional and district levels.

B.      Establishment of a public financial management business processes and control systems,
including: (a) budget planning tools to support effective macroeconomic control of budget; (b)
review and upgrading of public financial management regulations, rules and business processes;
(c) introduction of treasury and cash management systems, including a treasury single account;
and (d) strengthening of the internal financial management of MDAs.

C.    Provision of technical advisory services to strengthen the capacity for day-to-day
management of this Component 4 of the Project.

13.      There were also a number of changes to other components as part of the Additional
Financing:
    (i)     Component 1 – Reallocation of finance for transaction advisory to support two telecom
            privatization transactions (US$2.25 million) as GoG decided to use its own funds and
            accelerate the process.
    (ii)    Component 1: US$1.2 million added to finance Regional Innovation Centers (RICs)
            in all 10 Regional capitals to disseminate e-government services.

                                                5
    (iii)    Component 2: US$5.14 million added to finance i) capacity building at selected
             universities to deliver IT management and software development courses; 2 ii)
             establishing a quality assurance program for Ghana IT companies; 3 and iii)
             establishment of a Business Process Offshoring (BPO) Center to provide reliable
             communications and physical infrastructure to attract ITES investors to Ghana
    (iv)     Component 3: US$ 2.5 million reallocated from financing of pilot Government-wide
             network. During Mid-Term Review, Bank was informed that a larger funding of at
             least US$ 30m had become available from the Chinese government which could
             develop a more comprehensive network to all 170 districts, municipalities and
             metropolitan areas in the country as well as provide a dedicated data center. Bank
             agreed to limit its involvement to technical specifications which had already been
             prepared.
    (v)      Component 3: US$11.4 million additional financing to support additional e-
             Government applications including e-procurement and e-justice. 4

1.7 Other significant changes
14.     There was a second restructuring of the project on June 30, 2014 for the purpose of giving
additional time to complete the University Connectivity Program, the incubation center at Kumasi,
RICs and BPO construction, as well as the GIFMIS rollout to all 250 Spending Units (SUs),
training of 3,000 officers on the new budget software and completion of the viable interface
between the revenue systems and the GIFMIS. The closing date was therefore extended by six
months from June 30, 2014 to December 30, 2014.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
15.     Soundness of the background analysis. The eGhana project represented a pioneering design
for ICT projects that is being replicated in a number of African countries. The project benefited
from extensive analysis and information including from: i) World Bank Group’s experience in
telecommunication sector reforms and its impact on sector growth in other countries, ii) a 2005
Doing Business Report which highlighted the strong link between government transparency and
accountability and economic growth, iii) An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) report on Ghana
which highlighted the relatively low success of public reform projects due to weak capacity, iv)
Infodev funded consultancy (Hewitt) report which identified all the key bottlenecks and success
factors for creating an ITES Sector in Ghana, and iv) a detailed feasibility study which assessed
public private partnership (PPP) options for e-government Activities in Ghana.

16.     This analysis led to the eGhana project design with three mutually reinforcing and
interrelated components to (i) creating an overall enabling environment with emphasis on
improving the legal and regulatory framework for the IT /ICT sector and addressing infrastructure


2
  Subsequently, the Bank and GoG teams capitalized on an offer from Google to provide this capacity in
collaboration with the Bank.
3
  The two teams agreed that international quality assurance standards were dynamic and readily available at minimal
or no cost and therefore there was no need to invest limited resources.
4
  Note, by the end of project these two applications were funded by the follow up eTransform project because of a
funding gap.
                                                        6
gaps; (ii) Promoting ICT/ITES investment to create new job opportunities; and (iii) stimulating
demand for better public services and use of ICT to improve efficiency, transparency and
accountability in frontline Government Agencies. The Bank’s earlier analysis had also confirmed
that a combined program of ITES sector development and Government Transformation through
ICT, especially through PPPs, was mutually beneficial to an ICT-led growth strategy. The latter
would expand opportunities for the private sector and help overcome a lack of relevant skills in
government, and the ITES sector could benefit from work related to the automation processes.
The project supported the ITES Secretariat under the MoC specifically to promote the IT industry
by ensuring an appropriate environment for IT development, consistency and take-up of ITES
training nationally, implementing eGhana activities and helping ICT small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) gain access to markets. Similar support was provided to a National IT Agency (NITA) to
coordinate all government IT procurements, standards and capacity building.

17.     The GIFMIS component benefited from lessons of previous Bank attempts to improve IT
in government. The 2003 Budget Public Expenditure Management (BPEM) project, for example,
revealed weaknesses in government capacity to take on e-government without a technically
experienced private partner. In the case of GIFMIS, the GoG still took the lead, partly over
concerns of security of information, but used the private sector to develop the software for budget
execution. As with the eGhana components, capacity and commitment concerns were recognized
and were addressed mainly through a comprehensive training program in relevant units in the
MDAs and MoF and Attorney General’s Department. The GoG now has 12 Oracle Certified
experts who are civil servants supporting the system roll out. This investment in training has
resulted in savings which would otherwise have been used for hiring external experts.

18.      The GIFMIS component was prepared in response to a high priority government request
to upgrade PFM at the MoF. The activities were fundamentally related to the original eGhana
project 5 and fit well into the second part of the existing PDO. At the same, time GIFMIS was set
up to operate as a separate project with its own project implementation unit (PIU) under the
Ministry of Finance, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework. By adding GIFMIS to
the existing project rather than creating a new standalone project, the processing time for GIFMIS
was approximately 12 months less, and the GoG’s urgent priority was met.

2.2 Implementation 6
19.    The project implemented well for most of its long life (FY2007-2015) and adapted to
changing circumstances. The project required two extensions totaling two years and nine months,
which was reasonable given the doubling of the project’s resources and the addition of a major
component in the middle of project implementation. Because of the complexity and ambitiousness
of the project as well as the rapidly evolving ICT environment, implementation required a
substantial amount of supervision (costing about US$1.5 million in Bank budget during its eight-


5
  The original project was called the “eGhana project”. When GIFMIS was added, a separate implementation
structure was set up, along with a separate M&E framework as well as separate supervision teams. Thus the two
sets of activities are sometimes referred to separately as eGhana and GIFMIS. However, the overall project is
referred to as the “eGhana project.”
6
  The ICR mission was conducted just prior to project close (December 2014). Information on project activities is
updated to the date of the ICR.

                                                         7
year life). The project was never at risk. The MoC made good use of PIU experts in developing
and updating the legal framework for ICT, as well as for other procurements. Physically locating
the PIU at the MoC facilitated implementation.

Implementation Factors
20.     Provision of ICT technical expertise. In addition to the ITES secretariat, the project
provided expertise in the form of the Ghana ICT Directorate (which was endorsed by Parliament
and renamed the National Information Technology Agency, NITA). This technical expertise
combined international and local experts to support the MoC in preparing terms of reference
(TORs) and technical specifications for bidding documents for all activities including establishing
the legal framework.

21.     Extensive consultations during Implementation. The project engaged extensively with local
and international stakeholders, particularly in reviews of draft policies, legislation and regulatory
instruments during implementation. This consultative process supported by technical assistance
and steady Bank supervision helped achieve a broad range of legislation within an impressive time
period. Eight key laws and three regulations were prepared and approved instead of the targeted
four (see details in Annex 10). Consultations, while valuable, also had a downside, which was the
prolonged implementation of some activities.

22.   Matching grants for Incubation Centers. There was need to scale down the matching grants
subcomponent as a result of poor response to the tender process to select Incubation centers. It
became clear that only one university could be selected to host an incubation center (the Kwame
Nkrumah University for Science and Technology—KNUST—at Kumasi).

23.     Adapting to changing technology trends. The rapidly changing technology trends meant
the team and government had to be highly responsive in order to capitalize on opportunities and
avoid redundant expenditures. This was the case for at least two of the activities under component
2. The universities were able to negotiate with Google and other private service providers to
provide some content and applications so the Bank and Government decided to focus on the
connectivity for the universities where there were gaps. Similarly, emerging cloud technologies
made it cheaper to test software without the expensive investments in establishing a quality
assurance program and therefore a decision made to refocus more on general capacity building.

24.    Use of PPPs. The deployment of PPPs in e-government was a major strategic decision,
which, after some complications, paid off. The type of PPP proposed for the project was similar
to a deferred payment arrangement with an interest rate assigned to the deferred period and
deferred amount, but with all the risks associated with originating such deferred payments
supported ultimately by the private partner. The PPP also had some unanticipated risks, including
contractual issues, repayment structures, the impact of ongoing reforms, and external factors.
Additional information about the PPP contract and associated risks are in Annex 12.

Mid-Term Review and Additional Financing
25.    After a new government came to power in 2010, it became a priority to proactively manage
Government expenditures (e-applications under eGhana focused largely on revenue generation).
The existing eGhana project offered a vehicle for the Government and the Bank to fast track
preparation to respond to GoG’s high priority to use GIFMIS to move away from inefficient paper-
                                                 8
based budget systems by automating the process and connecting MDAs. This was one of the major
accomplishments of the project. GIFMIS added several major functions: treasury, budget
formulation and execution, financial reporting and more transparent use of funds. GIFMIS used a
different governance structure from the original eGhana project, i.e., the MoF and the CAGD,
rather than MoC/NITA. One of the success factors in implementing GIFMIS (as well as eGhana)
was the recognition of requirements for successful change management. These requirements were
met through workshops and other training for staff, and reliable support to MDAs. Provision of
this training was a direct result of lessons from the previous, unsuccessful BPEM project. It was
also important to project success that the new applications were implemented by relatively younger
people (mostly university graduates) who find it easier to adapt to change. Another important
factor for improved implementation was that at the mid-term the Bank TTL for the project moved
to Accra which facilitated day-to-day implementation, particularly with respect to procurement.

26.     A Business Process Offshoring (BPO) center development activity was added at the mid-
term in response to the GoG’s priority to provide office space and connectivity to address the
dearth of affordable grade A facilities for IT and BPO companies. The Hewitt report highlighted
the importance of addressing this challenge in order to attract both local and international IT/ITES
companies. The plan for the BPO center was for 12 public warehouses (90 x 15 meters) to be
refurbished to comprise a state of the art mini ICT Park at a cost of US$8.8 million. The Bank
partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation to finance this activity, with latter contributing US$3.8
million grant to the GoG.

27.      The project restructuring extended the closing date to allow more time for a number of
activities, including the construction of the BPO center and several RICs. While progress was
made on both, they were not completed before the extended closing date. The BPO center is
currently at about 75 percent completed while the all 10 RICs have been completed (2 after project
closed) and awaiting content through the follow-on eTransform project.

28.    Additional Funding Partners. Three Development Partners committed US$32.14 million
in additional project funding, all for the GIFMIS component through a pooled funding. This
represented about half of the GIFMIS funding, with IDA providing the other half. The pooled
funding arrangement had difficulties because there were multiple reporting requirements from the
partners, which created burdens for the PIU and the GoG. Counterparts suggested that
development partners need to find a way to allow these multi-donor operations prepare a
consolidated report that satisfies all donors. The Rockefeller Foundation also provided a US$3.8
million grant to complement World Bank funding for the BPO center which has worked smoothly
without any significant issues.

29.    At the end of the project 91 percent of all funds were disbursed. Within this percentage
there was a significant shifting of resources between components, mainly from component 2 to
component 1, as described in section 1.6 (also see Annex 4 for exact component totals).


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
30.    The overall M&E of the project was good. The results framework was relevant to
measuring the PDO. The units of measurement of a few of the indicators could have been more
appropriately defined, i.e., better matching of units of measurement for baselines, targets and

                                                 9
indicators. Progress in the project was closely tracked as progress reports were regular and detailed
for both eGhana and GIFMIS. The two borrower ICRs, particularly from eGhana, but also from
GIFMIS (see Borrower’s ICRs-condensed version-Annex 7) were thoughtful and comprehensive.
This additional M&E reporting supplemented the results framework making it possible to
adequately measure the PDO.

31.      Design. The indicators matched the PDO’s main aims of employment and growth in ICT
(e.g., growth in ITES employment and ITES contribution to GDP). Generally, indicators were well
defined; relevant data collection methods, data sources and reporting mechanisms were clearly
specified. In a number cases of the indicators, baselines targets and actuals were of different units.
For example, the indicator “percent growth in positions held by women in ICT/ITES private sector
in i) non-managerial and ii) non-managerial level,” had a number of employees in managerial and
non-managerial positions for a baseline, a percentage for a target and percentage share of total
positions for an actual. In these isolated cases, the ICR team had to re-examine the data with the
PIU to determine actual results. On the positive side the relevant data for the indicators was
maintained, and it was possible to clarify the data issues in these instances. Most of the indicators
did not have issues and contributed to assessment of the PDO.

32.     Implementation and Utilization. Strong efforts were made to update and supplement the
results framework. The MoC hired an international consultant to develop the methodology for
satisfaction surveys and set up data collection and survey rollout. The additional financing paper
contained a detailed review of the framework along with the new indicators that were required for
the GIFMIS component. Project reporting was detailed and was crucial to project management,
as well as to help the Bank be more effective in supervision. The regular project progress reports
eGhana and GIFMIS allowed both PIUs and the Bank to target efforts in implementation. For
example, the M&E outputs helped the GoG determine areas, particularly on the eGhana side,
where the additional financing would be most effective in scaling up activities, such as in e-
government activities.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial Management (FM) and Audit
33.     The last detailed FM review rated FM performance as satisfactory (which was the case
throughout the project) and risk as moderate. The project consistently complied with the financial
covenants for submission of quarterly reports and audit reports. The FM of the project also
effectively managed the transition of several ongoing contracts to the follow-up eTransform
project, including meeting the requirements that outstanding payments under eGhana could be
transferred to eTransform. Some ineligible expenditures were identified through audit. These
expenditures were resolved with a reimbursement to the project account (Annex 8 provides
additional details). The PIU carried out its required reporting in a timely manner throughout the
project including seven annual reports, eight annual work plans, budgets and procurement plans
as well as audit reports. Audits were in full compliance.

Procurement
34.    All procurements were from approved procurement plans which were regularly updated
when a procurement milestone was reached. A Post Procurement Review (PPR) was carried out
in April 2014 and gave the project a risk rating of moderate, while Contract Administration and
performance was rated substantial because of a number of delays in contract execution.

                                                 10
35.     The procurement experience of the eGhana project produced an unintended benefit: The
GoG used Bank procurement rules on which to base the national procurement law. Two to four
years was standard for new legislation, but by working with stakeholders from the beginning
helped speed up the process. Efforts to get the decision-makers’ buy-in early on, partly through
involvement in a study tour, helped to get better cooperation for approvals One other benefit on
the procurement side was the innovation in PPP contracting including the buy-own-transfer (BOT)
approach to the tax information system. Structuring the contract in that way linked contractor
compensation to performance by making it contingent on successful tax collection (which
increased from 0 percent of total tax collection in 2012 to 61.7 percent by 2015). This experience
led to the Bank developing special procurement rules for PPP contracts.

Safeguards
36.     The MoC initiated the construction of 10 Regional Innovative Centers (RICs) for
disseminating e-government applications, and the refurbishment of government facilities to be
used for Business Process Offshoring (BPO). The Innovation Centers are aimed at facilitating
information flow towards the social and economic development of the beneficiary areas in which
the facilities are to be provided. In both cases, the Government used sites and infrastructure which
are Government-owned. The types of works undertaken in both cases may have direct and indirect
environmental and social impacts in the affected areas and therefore triggered the World Bank
policy on environmental assessment OP 4.01and O.P 4.12 which required that the project prepares
an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) to address potential impacts. The ESMF was disclosed at the Infoshop and in country prior
to negotiation. In addition, for the RICs and BPO Center an Abbreviated. Resettlement Action
Plan (ARAP) was prepared, approved by the Bank, and properly disclosed.

37.    An environmental safeguard issue emerged concerning a gas facility being placed at the
BPO center during the rehabilitation work. This is expected to be removed before the BPO center
is formally launched.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38.     The preparation of the eTransform project overlapped the last year of eGhana
implementation and supports the next stage for a number of eGhana initiatives. Specifically,
eTransform follows up further with: i) the enabling environment for electronic government and
business, including innovation centers and capacity building for regulatory institutions; and ii)
scaling up of ICT applications to improve services in priority sectors. The eTransform project has
met the financing gap for a number of activities inaugurated under eGhana, including e-
procurement, e-justice, e-parliament and e-immigration. MoC continues to be the lead GoG
agency for the project and there is some continuity in the PIU as well. The Public Financial
Management (PFM) reform project was approved in May 2015 to follow up GIFMIS achievement
and continue to support PFM reform in Ghana. The PDO of the project is to improve the budget
management, financial control and reporting of the Government of Ghana. The project will
contribute to enhancing fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources and service delivery
efficiency, through strengthened systems and procedures and targeted capacity building. Both
eTransform project and PFM reform project are schedule to close on June 30, 2019.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Overall Relevance Rating: High
39.     Objectives. Substantial. The objectives reflected the reality that ICT could be a game
changer to Ghana’s efforts to reach middle income status. The GoG demonstrated its leadership
through its ICT4AD strategy, which the eGhana project followed. The objectives of the project
continue to be relevant to the country priorities and the Country Partnership Strategy (FY13-FY16),
in particular to the pillars to improve public institutions and to foster competitiveness and
employment. The PDO was also appropriately articulated to accommodate the large, new GIFMIS
component. Thus it was not necessary to revise the PDO despite the large infusion of resources
and new activities.

40.     Design. High. The activities of the eGhana and GIFMIS components were pre-requisites
for bringing the country’s ICT capacity in line with that of a middle income country (MIC). The
project contained the core elements for ICT projects in MICs: establishing the legal framework,
enabling local IT/ICT industries through training and technical and physical infrastructure
investments and government support. The legal framework, the enabling environment for IT/ICT
and expansion of government service delivery continue to be priorities in the follow-up
eTransform Ghana project.

41.     Implementation. High. There were appropriate adjustments during implementation
which kept the relevance of the project high throughout. For example there was no longer a need
to provide funds for telecommunications privatization because the funds became available from
another source. Likewise, IDA funds were no longer needed to build the Government-wide
Network, because funding became available from another source. Scaling up other eGhana
activities and adding the GIFMIS component during implementation improved implementation
relevance by meeting newly identified GoG priorities.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory
42.    PDO: To assist the Recipient to generate growth and employment by leveraging
information and communication technologies and public-private partnerships to i) develop the
information technology enabled services industry, and ii) contribute to improved efficiency and
transparency of selected government functions through electronic government applications.

43.      The evidence for the achievement of the PDO needs to show i) increased IT sector growth
and employment through development of the ITES industry; ii) improved efficiency of selected
government functions; and iii) improved transparency of selected government functions. There is
sufficient combined evidence from the results framework and additional M&E data to support a
satisfactory rating for achievement of the PDO. Note that the ICR for this operation does not use
a split rating for the PDO. This decision is based primarily on the fact that the PDO remained the
same throughout the project. In addition, only one indicator target was revised downward and the
ICR does not rely on this indicator for the outcome rating. In most cases, the project exceeded
indicator targets, reflecting, among other factors, the increased financing on the eGhana side. New
indicators were established when the new GIFMIS component was approved and they are
evaluated from that point onward.
                                                  12
Growth and Employment through the Development of the ITES Industry

44.     The results framework measured the generation of growth and employment through the
development of IT enabled services. One of the most important indicators for the eGhana project
was the growth in ICT/ITES employment to a total of 8,700 jobs which exceeded the target that
had been revised upward to 7,000 jobs. An additional 10,000 jobs are expected to be generated
following completion of the BPO center. The ITES contribution to GDP of 2.44 percent exceeded
the target of 1.5 percent (baseline was 0.5 percent) providing evidence for achieving the PDO
growth objective. Thus, in 8 years the ITES sector increased its contribution to GDP five-fold.
The revised target for contribution to exports was also achieved.

45.     Perhaps the most important achievement measured by intermediate indicators is the drop
in the cost of bandwidth for a full circuit E1 line (between Accra and Portugal) from US$10,000
(pre-project 2005 for non-Ghana Internet Service Providers Association (GISPA) members) to less
than US$1,200 for all internet and data service providers. This achievement removed a major cost
constraint to IT development and use of ICT to generate economic and social activities.

46.     The intermediate indicators also tell an overall positive story of IT industry satisfaction
with government support and promoting public-private partnerships (a key part of the PDO). The
indicator “increase in ICT/ITES industry satisfaction with GoG’s support,” met its target (81.4
percent vs. 80 percent target), which suggests general satisfaction, but it was not possible to
establish a baseline for the revised indicator. The targeted level of PPP investment was met
(US$60 million). The downward revision (from $67 million) simply reflected the actual contract
for the PPP for the targeted five e-government applications. The PDO indicator of implementing
PPPs for five government IT applications was met. The promotion of the private sector was
indicated also by the fact that several International ITES/BPO companies have located in Ghana
through the investment promotion efforts of the ITES Secretariat and its International Consultants.
These companies include Teletech, Tech Mahindra, Comviva, QAI.

47.     Creation of Enabling Environment. Establishment of the legal framework was a pre-
requisite for the development of telecommunications and IT sectors in Ghana, and, therefore,
growth and employment in the sector. Table 1 provides a list of legislative accomplishments under
the project. The results framework measured only the number of laws and regulations, which did
not capture the significance of the legislation. For example, the revised Telecom Act opened up
the sector to further competition – the number of mobile operators increased from 4-6 during
project period. The competitive environment was further strengthened with the Mobile Number
Portability Regulations and Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) registrations which improved user
confidence and choices. The Electronic Transactions Act was also the first of its kind to govern
electronic transactions and covered all electronic transactions and made them binding, while also
establishing a level of security for data. It also established electronic certificates. Annexes 2
(Outputs by Component) and 10 (Detailed Description of Legislation Supported by the Project)
provide additional evidence of achievement of objectives. These accomplishments have resulted
in Ghana being ranked very competitively on key Global competitiveness reports including
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which ranked it highest among African countries
in mobile broadband (2012), and A.T. Kearney’s Global Services Destination, 2014, which ranked
Ghana 29th out of the top 50 countries and number 1 among the three Sub-Saharan African
                                                13
countries 7 that were included in the study. This progress is reflected in the PDO indicator the
survey on the impact on the IT/ITES sector from World Bank technical assistance (TA), which
witnessed a large increase over the baseline (from 3.0 to 4.41 out of 5.0), representing substantial
achievement.

                 Table 1: Laws and Regulations Developed under the eGhana Project
    No.                                       Legislation
    1.    The National Communications Act, 2008 (Act 769 (Revision of the existing National
          Communications Act, 1996)
    2.    Electronic Communications Act, 2008
    3.    National Information Technology Act, 2008
    4.    Electronic Transactions Act, 2008
    5.    Electronic Communications Amendment Act, 2009
    6.    Companies Amendment Act
    7.    Electronic Transactions Amendment Act, 2012

    9.    Electronic Communications Regulations, 2011
    10.   Mobile Number Portability Regulations, 2011
    11.   Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Registration Regulations, 2011

48.      One shortcoming on the development of ITES was that the establishment of the Regional
Innovation Centers (RICs) and the Business Process Offshoring facilities were both delayed and
did not meet their targets during project implementation. Currently, all 10 targeted RICs have been
built. It is not confirmed whether they have begun delivering content as called for in the indicator,
but support for RICS activity continues under the eTransform project. The BPO facilities were
still under construction at project close. At this writing, these facilities are at about 75 percent
completion. When fully established the RICs will support IT companies and start-ups to provide
services throughout the country. The BPO facility also will support local and international
IT/ITES companies and help Ghana move into innovative areas which create employment in an
economy where there is still an excess of labor.

Efficiency and Transparency of Government Services

49.     The efficiency of government services was measured in part through the increase over the
baseline in satisfaction of users with government services taken up for electronic delivery (68
percent target, 76 percent actual). Prior to the automation of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA),
tax payers were subjected to manual systems of multiple tax agencies and offices, with files often
getting lost, tax assessments done subjectively, and a number of businesses able to evade taxes.
The streamlined automated process provides a shared platform with real time data, and a link
between Business Registration and Revenue Authorities through a unique tax identification
number (TIN). The business registration process in the Registrar General’s Department (RGD)
became more streamlined. The RGD portal now offers online registration transactions including:

  Ghana ranked 29th, Senegal ranked 40th, and South Africa ranked 47th. Full report is available from A.T Kearney’s
website: https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/5082922/A+Wealth+of+Choices.pdf/61c80111-41b2-4411-
ad1e-db4a3d6d5f0d
                                                        14
business/company registration, marriage registration, estate administration, e-payments, online
booking of marriage, and scheduling of appointments with officers of the department. The RGD
Portal is fully integrated with GRA e-tax portal. The institution of online business transactions
helped reduce processing time from several weeks to only 3-5 days which is further evidence of
improved efficiency of government functions.

50.     Other e-services completed include those for passports, driver’s license, birth and death
certificates, and marriage licenses followed in early 2015. Increasingly, citizens can apply for
services from the comfort of their homes. There are also centers where people can go if they do
not have computer access, and can still gain efficiencies of not having to go to a government office
and wait in line to be served. While these benefits have not yet been quantified under the project,
there is significant testimonial evidence reported during the ICR field mission to confirm that
reduced commute time and decreased transportation costs lead to higher labor productivity. This
efficiency of public service delivery increased significantly following the launch of the online
payment system which became operational shortly before project close. Figure 1 illustrates the
before and after automation situations.


                              Figure 1. Before and After Automation




51.      For the GIFMIS component, the indicator measuring commitment control was the most
important PDO indicator of efficiency and transparency and it was met as all 33 Ministries became
connected to the central budget for the first time. The 10 regional treasuries were also connected
which went beyond the original anticipated achievement. By connecting the Ministries and
regional treasuries and spending units, the project improved the efficiency of government functions,
in this case planning the national budget. The indicator for total manpower trained was exceeded
(6,018 target, 12,771 achieved). Having an adequately trained staff for GIFMIS contributed to
                                                15
greater efficiency and transparency and helped the project avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor, the
BPEMS project. The other two indicators were production of systems-based quarterly GoG
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compliant reports and Production of International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS)-compliant GoG annual financial statements by Controller
and Accountant General Department (CAGD) for the Consolidated Fund Account (CFA), both
indicators of efficiency and transparency, have seen significant progress, but have only partially
been achieved.

52.     Though the revenue and expenditure sides of the budget are not yet linked, substantial
efficiencies were gained. It is far easier now for the MDAs to communicate expenditure updates
and provide information to the MoF and the CAGD. All transactions from Regional to Central
levels are automated, whereas before Regions had to prepare paper invoices and bring them to
CAGD. The first budget under GIFMIS went to Parliament at the end of 2014.

53.     The intermediate indicator evidence for the achievement of improved efficiency and
transparency of selected government functions through electronic government applications is
substantial. Within government, MoC’s support to GoG’s ICT system and services was well-
received. The “percent increase of MDAs expressing satisfaction with the level of coordination
and management by MoC” reached its target of 75 percent (actual achievement of 77.8 percent).
Government net uptime reached 99.54 percent, which exceeded the target of 98.7 percent. All
applications developed under eGhana meet interoperability standards and adhere to the IT
architecture, prepared under the project to support efficient and transparent applications. The
project also ensured efficiency and transparency by ensuring that Chief Information Officers
(CIOs-100 target vs. 856 actual) and other relevant technical staff (100 target vs. 2,623 actual)
were trained in the use of e-government applications.

54.     Transparency was improved by the substantial increase in automated business registrations
(87,900) and taxpayer identification number (TIN) registrations (425,305), which indicated that
the e-government registration application was functioning. The TINs were particularly important
to improving transparency because individuals would now be identified by a unique number and
transactions would be associated with that number. This new process thereby increases visibility
to the public and reduces opportunities for corruption. It also makes it easier to avoid and to correct
mistakes that were more common in the paper-based system. TINs have improved GRA’s
operational efficiency significantly in defining and calculating the correct tax obligations of tax
payers. The use of TIN improved the quality of business data remarkably at RGD as well, as TINs
can uniquely identify each employee of a company. All data changes are updated in real time, and
the Business Certificates are electronically generated in a centralized printer. Another indicator,
the percentage increase in the ratio of electronic to manual transactions between government and
recipients across several e-government applications (population with access to ICT), indirectly
measured efficiency and transparency measuring the level of penetration of automation in key
government services. The overall average was 70 percent (of electronic transactions), which
exceeded the 50 percent target. Within this 70 percent average was varying progress in automation,
with business registrations reaching 100 percent, while the electronic transaction rate had reached
60 percent for marriage and estates and 50 percent for GRA. Thus, the progress toward improved
transparency and efficiency is substantial.



                                                 16
55.     As GIFMIS was launched at the first restructuring (additional financing), its intermediate
indicators were also established at restructuring. The main indicator, which MDAs are preparing
budgets on an Oracle platform (Hyperion), was achieved which is related to another indicator,
treasury sites are connected to GIFMIS (a PDO indicator). In addition, internal audit staff training
was completed for Computer Aided Audit Techniques (CAATs). This training contributed to
transparent government functions by building capacity of audit staff. Targets were not met for the
elimination of domestic payments arrears (<1 percent of GDP target vs. 2.2 percent actual, though
an improvement from a baseline of 4 percent of GDP). Elimination of domestic payments arrears,
however, is beyond the scope of the project and is not relevant to the PDO, nor sufficiently linked
to GIFMIS activities. The target for “Budget ceilings linked to outer year forecasts for MDA
spending (percent of total budget)” was not met (20 percent achieved out of a target of 100 percent),
and it is an expected result, albeit indirect, of GIFMIS. The indicators for the cumulative MDAs
that implement annual program, subprogram and activity classifications was exceeded (target of
92, 283-actual). The completion of the review and update of the FM legislative and operational
framework was partially achieved as the review was completed, but the legislative framework has
not yet been updated. On the latter, the IMF is providing support for the legislative update.

56.     The combined evidence from the results framework and other evidence supports a
satisfactory rating for achievement of the PDO.


3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
57.    The efficiency in carrying out project activities was substantial because the costs of
achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with the benefits achieved and norms.
The ICR does not calculate an economic rate of return, but Annex 3 assesses certain benefits that
can be quantified, including socioeconomic benefits that were identified in the PAD. This section
examines efficiency from the standpoints of project implementation and from efficiencies created
by project activities.

Efficiency of project implementation

58.     The contracts for the e-government applications complied with Bank competitive
procurement requirements to ensure both reasonable cost and technical quality. There is no hard
data with which to make unit cost comparisons as the e-government applications were tailored to
the specific needs of the GoG. Overall, the project implemented in a timely fashion. For example,
a 100 percent increase in the project’s IDA resources (increasing from US$38.53 million to
US$76.75 million-actual) required extensions of the project date of a total of two years and nine
months, representing about a 50 percent increase in the life of the project. In addition, the activities
of the project demonstrated good value for money. The main contract for PPPs for all five major
applications, for example, were implemented with IDA contributing US$20 million out of a US$60
million contract and the private sector contributing the remaining funds. This investment is also
producing major benefits in tax administration, business registration and licensing. 8 Revenues
collected through the new Total Revenue Integrated Processing System (TRIPS) , a product of the


8
  EGhana components 1, 2 and 3 accounted for US$50.43 million of the IDA funds, with GIFMIS accounting for
the other US$26.32 million (total of US$76.75 million IDA).
                                                     17
egovernment PPP, now accounts for 61.7 percent of total tax receipts (from a baseline of zero),
which is a substantial improvement in the efficiency of collecting taxes. The Virginia (United
States) tax reform process (VATAX) which was instrumental in providing a model to help design
the automation of revenue agencies in Ghana, has been extremely successful. An investment of
US$123 million through a PPP contract, resulted in over US$300 million in previously uncollected
taxes and additional revenues of over US$72 million annually.

59.    The project also created value for money by emphasizing relatively low-cost staff training
in the project. More than 16,000 people were trained in the project including 12,771 under
GIFMIS, plus internal audit staff for CAAT techniques, and 2,623 technical staff under eGhana
and 856 CIOs). This was a cost effective way to ensure commitment to the project and successful
implementation, thus avoiding the pitfalls of earlier projects (such as BPEMS).

60.     The efficiency rating is lowered from a high rating because completion of some activities
were delayed beyond project close including the construction of the RICs (now completed) and
the BPOs (75 percent complete). Also, the formal launch of online payments for licenses and
registrations took place after project close in April 2015 (the test launch of online payments
occurred before project close).

Efficiencies created by project activities

61.     Section 3.2 assesses efficiencies created by project activities as one of the core objectives
of the project. i.e., to improve efficiency through the application of ICT in government functions.
In summary, replacing paper-based government functions improves efficiency for both the
government and its customers. On the government side, employees will not have to maintain large
paper files, nor transport them up the chain to the central level. On the consumer side, individuals
and businesses will be able to complete registering and licensing on line and, more recently, pay
for the service if they have access to computers and have credit cards. To date, for example, over
400,000 persons have tax identification numbers (TINs) who did not before and with this new
capability, they can file their taxes on line, saving hours of time having to file taxes in person. The
use of TINs has played an important role in improving efficiency of government operations at a
reasonable cost. The GIFMIS outputs contribute to efficiency through more timely and accurate
budget data. They also help improve financial management and control, and are expected to reduce
corruption through greater transparency. Sector reporting and service delivery are also facilitated
through more efficient and transparent expenditure management.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
62.    With relevance of rated high, achievement of the PDO substantial and efficiency
substantial, the overall outcome rating is satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
63.     The increase in employment in ICT is an indicator of improved distribution as most of the
new employment was of unemployed graduates. Gender aspects are also promoted through the
active promotion of female employment in ICT, including women in managerial roles, and the
progress was proactively tracked in the results framework. The Rockefeller Foundation, the
                                                  18
development partner with the Bank for the BPO center, specifically targeted women and youth
from disadvantaged communities. This was the reason for revising the corresponding PDO
indicator upward.

64.     There was some concern with the automation of government services that government jobs
would be lost because of the elimination of the paper-based system. This potential job
displacement has not occurred. Instead, the effect is that staff have been able to do their jobs more
productively. As noted previously, there has been a substantial net job gain with 6,500 additional
jobs recorded during the project life.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
65.     The eGhana project helped establish an ICT architecture and interoperability framework to
support improved government efficiency and transparency in government services. The key
legislation supported by the project helped create an enabling environment and institutional
framework for electronic applications. The legislation includes revisions to the National
Communications Authority (NCA) (2008), Electronic Communications Act (2008), the National
Information Technology Act (2008), the Electronic Transactions Act (2008), the Data Protection
Act (2012) and the Electronic Communications Regulations (2011). The latter two acts also
provide for commissions to provide oversight. The project supported institutional change further
through development of strategic plans for the regulatory authority, as well as large training
programs for both eGhana and GIFMIS, training more than 16,000 staff. The successful launches
of egovernment applications confirm the success of the legislation and complementary training as
well as the PPP used to develop the applications.

66.   The eTransform project is following up these initiatives by putting in place the
commissions and other structures to address remaining gaps and continuing support to the NCA.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
67.       A number of unanticipated positive impacts have been identified:
      •   Using Bank procurement procedures as a basis for Ghana’s new national procurement law.
      •   The good implementation experience of the eGhana project created an encouraging
          environment for the GoG to launch GIFMIS activities which were not envisioned at
          appraisal.
      •   Leverage of additional resources from development partners (US$32.14 million plus
          US$3.8 million from the Rockefeller Foundation) which allowed the project to have greater
          impact through the GIFMIS component and to allow scarce IDA funds to be used for other
          eGhana activities.
      •   Automation of selected institutions also led to digitization of public records which in turn
          provided business and job opportunities
      •   The technical specialists hired under the project for both e-Govt and ITES have become
          key resources for the sub-region. A number of countries including Benin, Burkina Faso,
          Liberia, Malawi, Sierra Leone, have all visited Ghana on knowledge exchange programs
          to draw lessons from Ghana’s experience in setting up e-government systems and
          institutions. The legal specialist in the PIU who supported the development of the Data
          Protection Act (passed November 18, 2014) is also setting up the regulatory institution for
          that Act, the Data Protection Commission. This demonstrates that the project expertise used
          in developing the legal framework will continue through to its implementation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
68.       Not applicable because this is a Core ICR.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
69.     The legislative gains in the IT sector are gradually becoming engrained in the ICT sector.
The institutional framework is developing and is benefiting from a strong GoG commitment. For
e-government applications, the automation of GoG functions including the GoG budget is highly
unlikely to revert to the previous paper-based system. Staff have been involved in the design of
the applications, have been trained and are gaining experience with the automated processes, which
are expected to expand in the coming years. Likewise, citizens are getting used to the new e-
services and the risk of reversal declines with time. The next step is to connect the revenue and
expenditure sides of the GoG budget, and use the automated platform for cash management, which
is planned under the new GIFMIS project, which will reduce the risk to development outcome.
The eTransform project continues support and enlarges the gains under eGhana in key areas. PPPs
support sustainability because they provide capital to pay for system expansion, maintenance and
upgrade and technical capacity to operate and run the applications. One area where there are still
some questions is the sustainability of Regional Innovation Centers (RICs) and the BPO center,
and Kumasi Business Incubator (KBI), all of which need more time to establish a track record.
Though they may be conceptually sound (as maintained, for example, in the feasibility study for
the BPO center) their value to the ITES industry has not been demonstrated.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
70.     The Bank applied its experience of preparing ICT projects in other countries, including
infoDev experiences with ITES and the eLanka project, taking into account the lessons learned
particularly with respect to consultation and ownership, and worked closely with GoG to develop
an innovative model for ICT that addressed the main constraints to the sector. The PDO was
appropriate, and monitoring indicators, both within and outside the results framework, were
tracked to measure its achievement. The consultative approach was particularly effective in
establishing the legal framework for ICT and for charting the course for further development of
the legal framework and implementation of e-government applications. The Bank also helped
ensure that the right mix of international experience and technical expertise would be available to
support the ICT sector and emphasized training to ensure commitment and successful
implementation. Not all of the project activities were implemented as designed at the original
project approval, but the project remained relevant because of flexibility of the Bank team. One
area where the Bank could have been more careful was in ensuring that the results framework was
more precise in its definitions of indicators, measurement units, baselines and targets.


                                                 20
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
71.      The Bank supervised the project closely and after the mid-term review and the expansion
of the project scale and scope, located the supervision team in Accra. The relocation of the
supervision to Accra helped accelerate implementation during a challenging time for the project,
in particular after the global crisis and during the contracting for the Public Private Partnership
(PPP). The Bank experience in ICT projects was applied successfully during supervision, in
particular, by adding expertise at key junctures to support implementation, not only to the
development of the legal framework, but also to ensure that the PPP contract would be successful.
Originally, the PPPs were to be awarded under five separate contracts (one for each application),
but the GoG decided to have the applications under one contract as part of reform process which
merged four different tax/revenue agencies into one Ghana Revenue Authority. The Bank
facilitated this by helping the GoG to rework the contractual processes. Implementation issues
were greatly facilitated by the fact that there was continuity of TTL leadership for the entire life
of the project. This was a critical success factor in navigating through the many changes in the
project.

72.     The addition of the GIFMIS component was a key decision point where Bank management
took advantage of the fact that there was an ongoing ICT project, eGhana, which could shorten
processing time by launching the new GIFMIS component as an additional financing (rather than
as a standalone project). This decision was appropriate as it saved an estimated 12 months of
processing time. The Bank managed the separate implementation arrangements and management
structure through dual supervision missions. The cost of separate supervision missions was no
higher than would have been the case had GIFMIS been launched as a separate project. Rather,
resources were saved in the preparation because of its shorter duration. In addition, the team was
able to leverage more than US$30 million for the GIFMIS component from other development
partners.

73.     As part of the additional financing, the Bank also provided US$16.26 million of additional
resources for the eGhana components 1, 2 and 3 through additional financing which made it
possible to build the RICs, the BPO center, prepare the technical specifications for new e-
government applications (e-procurement and e-justice), which further promoted the ICT sector and
was a bridge to the follow-on eTransform project. Also the achievement from GIFMIS (component
4) led to a new scaling-up project (Public Financial Management Reform project). In all, the Bank
showed flexibility to change project activities and add major infusions of resources in key areas to
accelerate ICT development.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
74.     With quality at entry rated satisfactory, supervision rated highly satisfactory, and outcome
satisfactory, the overall Bank performance rating is satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
75.    The GoG was a strong partner in the project, had a clear sense of the role that it wanted
ICT to play in the economy, and how it would be promoted. At several junctures, the GoG initiated
major changes to the project design, including the addition of GIFMIS to automate the national
                                                21
budget, and the freeing up of resources from telecom privatization and matching grants sub-
components to use for other activities. The GoG was also deft at adjusting to additional funds that
became available through IDA and other donors involved in GIFMIS, and for the BPO center
(Rockefeller Foundation).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
76.     The implementing agencies were the MoC, MoF and CAGD. All performed well in
helping design their respective components and were proactive in making course corrections and
dealing with day-to-day implementation issues. Regarding the MoC’s PIU, capacity improved
over the course of the project, particularly the capacity of staff to prepare terms of reference and
procurement documentation. The eGhana PIU managed 95 contracts and annual work plans and
budgets were approved routinely. The PIU also carried out its required reporting in a timely
manner throughout the project including seven annual reports, eight annual work plans, budgets
and procurement plans as well as audit reports. Another indication of satisfactory performance is
that key members of the eGhana PIU not only remained throughout the project, but have been
carried over to manage the e-Transform project, which also has ensured a smooth transition to the
new project.

77.     The PIU for GIFMIS, located at the MoF, also implemented well and supported the
connection of 33 Ministries and 10 Regional Treasuries. The PIU oversaw a training program that
benefited 12,771 staff. There was regular and detailed monitoring of project inputs and outputs
and reports were received in a timely manner. There was a concern by one of the development
partners that there were a number of ineligible expenditures. This issue resulted in prolonged
discussions with the PIU maintaining that it had followed GoG procedures, as indicated in the final
Internal Audit Report. The matter was resolved and GoG refunded ineligible expenditures to the
pooled account. The amount of GHS 5,222,303.79 was largely related to hiring of venue for
capacity building, and represented about 3 percent of the total project cost. Details of this issue
and development partner comments are presented in Annex 8.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
78.     The GoG and Implementing Agencies’ performance were both satisfactory and therefore
overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
79.     Funding of activities to improve the enabling environment is not usually a big sell but
can have an enormous impact that goes beyond PDO. For example, Ghana already had
international connectivity through the SAT-3/WASC submarine cable system when the eGhana
project was launched. But the prevailing monopolistic pricing of the submarine cable by the then
incumbent telecom company, Ghana Telecom, translated into high prices for internet and
international telephony for consumers, and also for potential ITES-BPO businesses who also had
to deal with poor quality of service. The challenges for the GoG were to bring the cost of
bandwidth down, to improve the quality of telecommunications service delivery, and to make this
connectivity deliver higher quality services to more people. To address the monopoly issue, the
project collaborated with the NCA on regulation of the landing and access to the International
Submarine Cable Gateway. To address the urgent need for improved quality of service and
reduced prices, the ITES Secretariat, in collaboration with the World Bank also negotiated with
                                                22
Ghana Telecom to develop service level agreements and lower costs to internet service providers
and potential BPO operators from $10,000 for a full circuit to the UK/US to $5,000. This was
subsequently reduced further to $1,200. The individual activities under component 1 (enabling
environment) represent a good list of the main constraints to ICT development in Ghana that the
project sought to address.

80.     Because of the fast moving nature of technology and other external factors, it is
important to maintain some flexibility to be responsive to clients. The Matching Grants and
Funds Manager, for example, quickly became less relevant when only one incubation center was
eligible. The same was true for content development for schools when Google and other
technology firms collaborated to provide content. Other examples include consolidating 5 e-
government applications to one in response to Government reform changes, increasing the
estimated Government contribution in the eGovernment PPP of U$10 million to US$20 million in
response to market dynamics, and structuring other e-government applications such as GIFMIS,
while mitigating risks in response to Government request to ensure security of information.

81.    The PPP model can be challenging to implement, but it provides strong incentives for
the contractor to deliver good value. In the case of the e-government applications, the PPP
contract was structured so that the contractor’s compensation was based on performance. Since
reimbursement was key, the private partner would have the motivation to come forward with the
optimum design of the system that will provide for additional efficiencies and revenues.

82.     Bank processes such as procurement and project approval are often too slow to keep
up with a rapidly developing IT sector. It was challenging for the eGhana project to keep pace
with the constant need to retrofit the project to accommodate the Government’s changing needs.
In one case, the project had envisioned 12 pilots for a GRA e-government application for 11 sites,
but the GoG, recognizing the length of time to carry out a pilot, was eager to just cover more GRA
offices (total 63 offices). Similarly, the privatization of the incumbent telecoms became an urgent
political issue, and the government decided to use its own funds for transaction advisers for fear
of delay by the World Bank.

83.     Embedding consultants in the PIU ensure appropriate expertise, but may also cause
resentment from lower paid government staff working alongside them. The resentment
stemming from the large differences in salaries sometimes led to slower processing of procurement.
The project originally intended to finance the incremental cost of about 15 key civil service and 9
public service personnel subject to receipt of letter from the MoF requesting such financing,
confirming the formal government policy on such funding, and confirming commitment to fully
absorb those costs at the end of the project in order to ensure the sustainability of the project’s
accomplishments. During implementation, the Government was unwilling to provide information,
and as such the incremental cost was never paid.

84.     There is a positive impact of having TTLs based in the field. The fact that the two TTLs
were based in the field resulted in close engagement and supervision of this relatively complicated
project.

Highlights of Project Outputs

Component 1: Enabling Environment

Development of e-legislation and Broadcasting legislation. The project developed relevant
policies, laws and regulations to facilitate the development and growth of ICT in Ghana. Following
the adoption of an ICT-led socio-economic policy and framework for Accelerated Development
(ICT4AD) and the National Telecom Policy (in 2003 and 2005 respectively), there was the need
to create an open, trustworthy, transparent and non-discriminatory climate for the ICT sector which
included the development of an enabling legal and regulatory environment. Subsequently, the
Government, through the eGhana Project of the Ministry of Communications, pursued the
development of various e-legislationto increase the competitiveness of Ghana’s e-economy in line
with global best practice.

At inception, the eGhana project intended to develop four (4) laws and regulations for the sector.
At project closure, the target was exceeded by more than three times. In all, (8) laws and three (3)
regulations were developed under the auspices of eGhana project as follows:

   •   The National Communications Act, 2008 (ACT 769) (This law revised the existing then
       National Communications Act, 1996 (Act 524).
                                           29
   •   Electronic Communications Act, 2008 (ACT 775)
   •   National Information Technology Act, 2008 (ACT 771)
   •   Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 (ACT 772)
   •   Electronic Communications Amendment Act, 2009 (ACT 786)
   •   Companies Amendment, Act (ACT 835)
   •   Electronic Transactions Amendment Act, 2012 (Act 838)
   •   Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843)
   •   Electronic Communications Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1991)
   •   Mobile Number Portability Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1994)
   •   Subscriber Identity Module Registration Regulations, 2011 (L.I 2006)

ITES Secretariat and NITA established and functioning. This legislation provides the
statutory/legal foundation and mandate required for the existence of appropriate regulatory
institutions. The legislation has also defined the regulatory institutions, their mandate, funding,
staffing and reporting regimes as well as set out other laws and principles that are governing the
ICT industry in Ghana. Details of this legislation are provided in Annex 10.

Postal Policy developed. The policy covers eleven key areas and annexes with key performance
indicators and targets. The broad areas covered are as follows:

   •   Rationale for establishing a postal sector policy
   •   Vision and Mission statements and objectives for the postal sector
   •   Universal postal services definition
   •   Other postal services outlined
   •   Quality of service and standards
   •   Convergence with other sectors and services
   •   Regulation of the postal market
   •   Role of the government
   •   Role of the postal regulator
   •   Role of the postal operators, and
   •   Rights and obligations of the consumers

The Postal Policy aims at maintaining a level of universal service at a reasonable cost that meets
regional standards, increasing competition and progressive market liberalization and increasing
market performance: improve postal market production, revenues, and quality, security,
innovation, and investment levels

ITES/BPO Policy developed. The BPO Policy focuses on the models and frameworks of policies
required to strengthen and improve the BPO-ITES Industry in Ghana. Key recommendations have
been made in the areas of Talent Development, Quality Infrastructure and Cost Competitiveness.

NCA strategic plan developed. The project funded the Analysis Mason firm’s contribution to
the NCA strategic plan. The firm provided 27 recommendations for the short, medium and long
term plans.


                                                30
10 Regional Innovation Centers constructed. Additional financing to establish innovation
centres in each of the 10 regions of the country to encourage the use of ICTs in the regions. The
program consisted of nine regional centres (minus Greater Accra) and included construction of
building infrastructure, fitted with requisite LAN connectivity in nine the regions. For the Greater
Accra Region, a pre-existing building at the College of Health and allied Sciences was re-designed
and provided with requisite ICT equipment for use by the community. At project closure, nine (9)
out of the programmed 10 Innovation centres had been completed. The 10th RIC was competed
post closure.

Component 2: Support to ICT/ITES Industry

ICT Industry Association established and functioning. This component was aimed at
supporting GoG in designing and implementing a comprehensive strategy to harness the potential
of ICT/ITES for creating jobs and increasing investment in the sector. The component consisted
of three sub-components: (i) development of HR capacity in ITES, (to address People talent
sourcing driver) (ii) investment promotion, (to address external environment driver and (iii)
support to ITES industry (to address incumbent and cluster driver). Under the eGhana Project, the
ITESGH Secretariat was established to implement the objectives of Component II of the project.
In order to achieve the underlining objective of the ITESGH Secretariat, three (3) units were
established to aggressively target the identified drivers and implement interventions that will make
Ghana a destination of choice for the ITES/BPO industry.

ITES Skills set standards, training curriculum developed. The project developed ITES skills,
set standards and curriculum for the BPO-ITES industry in an effort to realize its talent potential,
and identify skill gaps in the BPO-ITES industry. The BPO-ITES Curriculum was designed on
the framework of Global Skill Set Standards. The curriculum also addressed the niche areas and
market segments identified in the Hewitt Competitiveness Study Report 2006. The BPO-ITES
Curriculum for Ghana includes the design for a high priority basic employability training necessary
for working in the BPO-ITES sector in Ghana. With basic employability as a pre-requisite, the
curriculum focuses on the following 6 niche areas for Ghana:
                                                31
   • Customer Interaction
   • Data Entry and processing
   • IT Technical Support
   • Data Conversion
   • Finance and Accounting
   • Medical Transcription
The ITES Skills set and curriculum were subsequently adopted by the Governing Council of the
ITES/BPO to provide standardization in the country by the ICT training institutions.

Training content developed for ITES/BPO industry. The Ghana Technology University
College (GTUC) was selected through a competitive process to develop training content and train
500 BPO Agents in the identified niche areas. In order to elicit participation in the training
programme, advertisements were placed in the national dailies. A rigorous selection process,
involving selection interview among others, was employed as part of the trainees’ selection
process.

500 BPO Agents trained. In all, 532 Agents were trained, exceeding the BPO Agents training
target by 6.4 percent. 427 trainees took the BCI certification exams, with 361 passing the BCI
certification exams and awarded certificates of merit.

25 companies incubated. Initially the project intended to “incubate” 30 businesses through a
business incubator program. The implementation of the business incubation program experienced
delays largely as a result of initial lack of understanding on the procurement packaging that should
be adopted for successful business incubation in Ghana. Subsequent to several reviews of relevant
procurement documents by the Bank, a contract was signed with the Kwame Nkrumah University
of Science and Technology in December 2013 to implement the incubator program. The
incubation centre was fully refurbished and 25 company teams/tenants are at the facility and are
currently at various stages of product development. Each company team has on the average three
(3) persons. Annex 11 provides a summary of the new businesses being incubated.

Development of BPO center. At additional financing it was decided to establish a BPO centre
that would provide Grade A real estate infrastructure for BPO companies to enhance job creation
in the ITES-BPO space. This objective involved the refurbishment of PWD warehouses in Accra
which consist of 12 structures, each of which measures 750 m2 (50m x 15m). In addition a one-
storey office building with 24 rooms to serve as common service area was to be constructed. The
refurbishment include an upgrade on existing facilities and the installation of technical equipment
to suit the required use including (i) plug and play office infrastructure, (ii) shared facilities, (iii)
custom built office infrastructure, (iv) ancillary infrastructure (e.g. roads, power, water/sewerage
and IT connectivity), and (v) renovation of physical facilities.

Investment Promotion events organized. The investment promotion activity under the ITES
Secretariat was aimed at attracting and retaining investors in Ghana through developing and
implementing an integrated and effective investment promotion strategy to market Ghana as an
ITES and BPO destination in collaboration with the ITES/BPO industry association, Ghana
Association of Software and IT Services Companies (GASSCOM). The Ghana Free Zone Board
and the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) have been promoting foreign direct
                                              32
investment (FDI) in Ghana. Until this unit was formed there was no single agency entrusted with
promotion of all types of FDI within the ITES-BPO sector. In order to ensure that GoG’s
commitment to market reforms have greater credibility and visibility in the international and
national business community, it was proposed that the unit undertake promotional activities to
attract demand for the ITES industry in Ghana are centralized under the ITES Division, working
in association with GIPC, GFZB and GASSCOM. In pursuit of this, Avasant of USA was engaged
as the Resident Investment and Management consultant in 2009 for a period of two years to assist
the secretariat to brand and package Ghana as the preferred destination for ITES/BPO investors in
Africa.

Component 3: e-Government applications and Intra-government Communications

Enterprise Architecture and Interoperability framework developed and operational. It was
programmed at project inception to develop The Ghana Government’s Enterprise Architecture
(GGEA) and e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF). This deliverable was realized as
early as the third year of project implementation. The Ghana Government’s Enterprise
Architecture (GGEA establishes a framework/ methodology in the use of Information Technology
to run Government business. This framework helps the MDAs to define their business, the
information necessary to operate the business, the technologies necessary to support the business
operations, and the transitional processes necessary for implementing new technologies in
response to the changing business needs. The GGEA helps in interagency and intergovernmental
data collection and management, to improve data sharing capabilities and reduce costs of acquiring
and managing data. The following documentation was produced under the GGEA:

   •   Implementation Plan
   •   Assessment Methodology
   •   Implementation Guide
   •   Monitoring & Evaluation
   •   Training Manual

A government-wide network connecting key MDAs established and functioning. The project
developed a Government wide Network (GovNet), which is a communication Infrastructure aimed
at connecting all government agencies onto a single shared and secured communication platform
to promote eGovernance, enhance productivity within government and foster transparency in
governance. The GovNet was to employ different technologies including radio and fiber to connect
these government agencies round the country. The eGhana project developed the concept and plan
for the GovNet with a smaller scope (Metro Network in Accra and Tema). Subsequently, the
government changed the scope to be nationwide with a phased approach deployment and sourced
additional funding from the Chinese government for the expanded scope. This project was
therefore built on the blueprint developed by the eGhana Project.
The GovNet has been deployed to all regional capitals and 15 districts across the country. This has
resulted in over 300 government organizations in the country connected together and sharing
information. The GovNet is the communication infrastructure providing connectivity to critical
government applications such as the GIFMIS, GRA and RGD tax and business registration
platform.


                                                33
Portal infrastructure (consisting of data center, payment gateway, security and
authentication systems) developed. The Ghana E-Payment Platform (GEPP) is a feature-rich
payment processing and e-Commerce solution which is integrated with the Governments eServices
Portal. The solution is installed on NITA’s Data Center infrastructure. It is highly scalable to meet
the expected high usage. The eServices Portal has been integrated with the Government e-Payment
Platform for collection of revenue online for 11 Agencies. The platform allows online payment
via VISA Credit/Debit Card, MasterCard Credit/Debit, e-Transact Card, Airtel Mobile Money,
MTN Mobile and Cash and Cheque payments. The payments received by the Government online
services (eServices) Portal, is for Government services, licenses, taxes, fee payments, fixed fees,
tangible goods, services payments, ad-hoc services etc. The Agencies participating on the
eServices Portal include MFA-Passport offices, DVLA, AMA, FDB, GTA, NCA, GHS-CID,
Mineral’s Commission, NIA and BDR. GEPP is also providing online payment support for
services on the GRA and RGD portal.

Identified government applications operational (notably for Registrar General’s
Department and Ghana Revenue Authority). The project supported the development of a
number e-government software applications:

   •   Application Software for GRA-- Total Revenue Integrated Processing System (TRIPS)
       – Integrated Tax Administration Software Modules (Tax Registration, Returns Processing,
       Exemptions, Tax Payer Accounting, Refunds, Case Management, Collections, Revenue
       Accounting, Enforcement and Compliance, Risk Analysis, Management Audit & Visit,
       MIS Reports)
   •   Citizen Service Portal--Tax--Online services portal with services including Taxpayer
       Registration , Taxpayer Assessments, Taxpayer Collections, Gift tax and capital gains
       declaration, Tax Refund approvals by Tax Audit, Tax filing
   •   Application Software for RGD--GEREG – Application for RGD Modules including
       Business Registration, Business Registration Renewal, Business Re-registration, Name

   •   Citizen Service Portal—Non Tax--System Requirement Specifications produced for
       Business Registration, Business name search, Business name reservation, Business
       Registration Renewal, Business Re-registration, and Request for Change of Business
       particulars.
   •   Shared Service Tools - Portal, Email and SMS Notification, Appointment and Scheduling,
       Live Chat Service
   •   Integration with Government Electronic Payment Platform. The GRA and RGD
       Citizen Portals have been integrated with the Government e-Payment Platform for
       collection of revenue online for GRA and RGD. The platform allows online payment via
       VISA Credit/Debit Card, MasterCard Credit/Debit, e-Transact Card, Airtel Mobile Money,
       MTN Mobile and Cash and Cheque payments.
                                              34
Capacities of senior civil servants, technical staff of MDAs, Legislators and Judicial Officers
strengthened in e-government. The e-Leadership Capacity Building Programme was geared to
develop the attitude, skills and knowledge (ASK) of top public servants towards a more ICT-
friendly orientation, to prepare the environment for the positive reception of e-Government
initiatives in the pipeline. The expected strategic outcome will be an improvement in productivity
in government administration and an enhancement of service delivery. It is expected that this
initiative will lead to better interaction and coordination of work among Ministries, Departments,
and Agencies (MDAs), and between government and citizens, and government and private
businesses.

Component 4: Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System

System establishment and Rollout

Chart of Accounts. In July 2011, the new GFS compliant Chart of Accounts was finalized and
used as the basis of an extensive training program for MDAs and MMDAs across the country. The
Chart of Accounts was to be published with the Budget estimates for 2012, and distributed to all
MDAs and MMDAs at the beginning of December 2012. MoF prepared the 2012 budget in
ACTIVATE using the new harmonized CoA (COFOG /GFS Functions and Economic Object
segments in addition to other local segments) as approved by CAGD.

The definition of the structure of the chart of accounts and the correct codification of the impersonal
and personal accounts in the general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable sub ledgers is
the foundation of the accounting system and therefore the cornerstone of the Ghana Integrated
Financial Management Information System. The CoA was updated for 2014 fiscal year. The 2013,
2014 and 2015 approved budgets were prepared based on the new COA and loaded on the GIFMIS.

Wide Area Network: A combination of technologies have been applied in extending WAN to
MDAs, including fiber optic cables, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology, and Radio. Due to
urgent need to address specific network constraints of selected MDAs in Accra under the Project,
two contracts were awarded for the procurement and installation of equipment for network
expansion in the selected MDAs. As of December 2014, 192 out of the 230 identified SUs in Accra
had been connected (83%). To facilitate transaction processing for MDAs without network
connectivity to the system, 32 Transaction Processing Centers (TPC) were set up across the
country (22 in Accra and 11 in regional capitals).

Bringing IGF on board GIFMIS (Ex-post and Ex-ante): Substantial progress has been made.
The two pilot MDAs – MoH and MoE (together with their Departments & Agencies across the
country) have been trained to capture their Internally Generated Funds (IGFs) on GIFMIS on ex-
post basis and have gone live. EPA was also piloted on ex- ante basis. Sensitization and training
programs have been organized for key staff of EPA with 70 staff attending from EPA. EPA since
June 2014 has been capturing their transactions on GIFMIS on ex-ante basis. There are about 1090
transactions on the system, 503 revenue items and 587 expenditure items.

Bringing Donor Funds on board GIFMIS: Ministries of Communication, Finance, Food &
Agriculture, and Energy have been selected as pilots to implement the inclusion of donor funds
                                                  35
on ex-ante basis, initial meetings were held with the pilot MDAs to understand the operations
of the donor funds, and follow-up meetings were also held with the pilot MDAs to agree on
their business processes through a checklist developed by the Team. A sensitization workshop
was held in April 2014 followed by training for the key users. Go-live for the 4 pilot MDAs
scheduled for April 23 2014 could not take place due to financial constraints.

Rollout to MDAs. The full GIFMIS peer-to-peer (P2P) functionality was rolled out in a phased
manner in 5 rollout tranches as given below after a successful pilot at the CAGD and MoF. Over
200 spending units were targeted in Accra.
    - Pilot Sites CAGD and MoF:                      Go live date 1st June 2012
    - Tranche one: Four MDAs Headquarters            (from 11th June, 2012)
    - Tranche two: 114 MDAs in Accra                 (from 3rd Sept. 2012)
    - Tranche three: the rest of MDAs in Accra (from 24th Sept. 2012)
    - Tranche four: Regional Deployment –            December 31, 2012
    - Tranche five: Phased MMDA deployment (subject to MMDA study underway)

By the end of December 2012, the system had been deployed to all Ministry Headquarters,
Regional MDAs and the 10 Regional Treasuries for consolidated fund only:

 The break-down of roll-out is given below:

Payroll and HRMIS

Payroll Upgrade: Upgrades of software and hardware have been made and the latest version of
the Oracle Payroll has been implemented and integrated with the Oracle Financials. The
Functional upgrade was implemented in July 2012. The functionalities were reviewed and
improved by de-customizing the payroll in areas in which standard functionality is available in the
new release. Technical upgrade of payroll/IPPD2 from Oracle version 11 to 12 was implemented
from July 2013 to make payroll consistent with Oracle Financials/GIFMIS Release 12. The
migration of Integrated Financials/Payroll was completed and moved onto the RAC environment
in September, 2014.

HRMIS : The Public Service Commission engaged a Consultant to implement phase 1 of the two
phased Oracle HRMIS to support position management, employee profile management and
employee cost management. An estimated total of 439,982 staff from 9 Agencies were to be
included in the HRMIS Phase 1. The contract commenced in November 2013 for completion by
September 2014. However, since March 2014, progress with implementation of the assignment
                                            36
has been impeded by the delay in the delivery of the single merged (payroll and Financials)
instance to PSC- an instance which contains: (a) both payroll and financials , (b) Properly aligned
organizations for the pilot MDAs , (c) Staff correctly aligned to their organizations , (d) Updated
jobs for all the pilot MDAs. It is expected that PSC will be given the Single Merged Final and
Updated Instance for the 9 Pilot agencies soonest to enable them Go-live by 15th May, 2015

Budgetary Reform

Budget reform comprises a range of activities aimed at fully using GIFMIS functionality to
allocate and control resources. These budget activities when implemented will address the long-
standing issues that have made the budget unrealistic and have been the major contributor to
prolonged delays in release of funds during budget implementation.

Programme Based Budgeting is a major reform underway in budgetary management which will
see MoF transition from the long-standing system of Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) to a new
system of Programme Based Budgeting (PBB). A key feature of PBB is that it organizes the budget
and service delivery around main result areas in terms of service delivery. In terms of the approved
budget, PBB provides a mechanism for the organization of allocations of expenditure approved by
Parliament in terms of the desired results. Hence the allocations to programs in the budget should
be a reflection of the priorities established at the political level attached to the provision and
enhancement of the various services provided by the public sector.

Cash Management

The primary objectives of cash management is the reduction of public sector borrowing costs and
improving the predictability of expenditure commitments and timely liquidation of obligations.
Establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA), transparently embodying all government
funds including Internally Generated Funds (IGFs) through an IT system is key to the attainment
of the cash management objective.

Actions taken on the implementation of TSA include the following.
        - 6255 bank accounts were identified at BoG out of which 1,500 dormant ones were
            closed.
        - 410 of the remaining 4755 have been earmarked for the TSA whilst consultations are
            currently ongoing between CAGD and MDAs to rationalize the remaining4345 bank
            accounts.
A cash management working group has been established, jointly chaired by the Director of Budget
and CAG, with members drawn from MoF, CAGD, GRA, and BoG. The Working Committee
meets weekly and manages monthly budget releases and domestic borrowing requirements. It
reports to a Cash Management Committee chaired by the Minister of Finance, with the CAG, the
Governor of the BoG, and the Commissioner-General of GRA as members. The Committee meets
monthly. Current operations of the cash management working group are hampered by the
unreliability of cash forecasting, and changes made to claims on the resource envelope during the
year. Loan Agreement signed with BOG

Financial Reporting


                                                37
A Consultant was engaged in April 2013 to develop and implement a road map for adoption of
IPSAS. Development of a roadmap for implementation of IPSAS by the CAGD was delayed until
November 2014. Implementation of IPSAS by the CAGD has been delayed largely because
policies on IGFs and donor funds are yet to be finalized. The CAG has initiated discussions with
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ghana (ICAG) to collaborate in the orderly
implementation of IPSAS.

Key issues outstanding include
   - Complying with Cash Basis standards (with inclusion of 3rd party transactions, definition
       of entity, and consolidation), while transitioning to full accrual basis
   - Production of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) compliant GOG
       annual financial statements by CAG

MDA and MMDA and Capacity Development

Training was initially conducted on ad hoc basis, until a Consultant was engaged in October 2011
to develop GIFMIS Training Strategy and Plan. The strategy of the GIFMIS training programme,
as proposed by the Consultant, was to stratify the training population into logical groups, identify
the specific training needs of each group and develop relevant training programmes to address the
identified needs. End users were expected to immediately apply what they learn to their specific
job responsibilities. Each audience was to receive an individual curriculum and training course
materials that support the business processes in which they work as well as an overview of where
transactions fit into the larger picture with the newly developed processes. Training plan was
updated in 2013 to include PBB and HRMIS.

The following key training programs were delivered

   •   2012 :
          - Oracle University Training

           - A number of knowledge transfer schemes in place where TAs are required to
             transfer knowledge to local teams at the functional and technical fronts. (i.e OCS,
             QA, CM, F&A, M&E, Communication, BCP strategy training, etc.)
           - Pre hands-on training Sensitization workshop held for 550 internal Auditors.

Project Management

Project Secretariat was established in 2009 as a condition for effectiveness of the Project
Executive Steering Committee was also inaugurated in 2009 The Project Directorate was created
in 2010, headed by a Project Director and initially supported by 5 (out of 8 proposed) specialist
teams to manage the overall coordination of implementation. Back-office Team, responsible for
procurements and financial management of project funds, was established in 2010.
Consultants were recruited to provide technical assistance in the fields of Procurement, Cash
Management, Finance & Accounting, Communication, MMDA study, HRMIS/Payroll, M&E,
Quality Assurance and Training. By 2012, Two Deputy Project Directors (one for GIFMIS and
the other for Budget Reforms) were appointed to assist the Project Director. The other operational
end of the project implementation consists of: Functional Managers, Super Users (GIST), the Train
the Trainers Team, and the Oracle Functional and Technical in-house experts, Project Advocates
and Implementation Coordinators

The institutional arrangement was further refined in 2013 as follows:
   -        Project Director –GIFMIS
   -        Deputy Project Director –GIFMIS
   -        Project Director- Budget Reforms
   -        Project Director - HRMIS

                                   Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.          The original eGhana PAD identified potential economic, financial, and social benefits
of the project were examined including: (i) a broad range of social benefits from employment,
governance and women participation; (ii) higher economic returns from a strong ITES-BPO
industry and increased productivity from use of ICT products and services for government,
businesses and citizens, and (iii) greater fiscal returns due to new sources of revenue. For
GIFMIS component, the additional financing paper did not provide a detailed economic analysis.
GIFMIS was expected to improve transparency and efficiency of selected government functions.

2.          Annex 9 in the PAD observed that a large portion of the benefits gained from the
project would be of a socioeconomic nature, and acknowledged that these benefits cannot be
fully quantified. The PAD presented several projections of the project results using historical
data, instead of traditional economic and financial analysis (e.g. Cost-Benefit Analysis). These
projections were only partially attributable to the project. Neither economic rate of return nor
financial rate of return were calculated in the PAD.

3.         By the time the ICR, several approaches have been undertaken internationally to
measure the impacts of e-government interventions (e.g. system automation by ICT, e-services),
but a common approach has not yet been developed 9. Thus ICR reviews the initial projections
and evaluate the project achievement.

(i) Broad range of social benefits from employment, governance and women participation
4.          Annex 9 in the PAD projected the ITES-BPO sector growth in Ghana along with
historical employment data. Annex Table he following table shows the comparison of the
actuals against projection. Although Ghana experienced economic downturn after the global
economic crisis (“Lehman Shock” in 2008), the ITES-BPO sector employment reached 8700 in
2014, which was beyond the project-end target of 6,714 people. In terms of female employment
in ITES-BPO sector, 54.3 percent of incremental jobs in ITES-BPO sector were held by women.
This percentage would have been higher had the BPO center become operational because this
center targeted a high percentage of female employment.

from use of ICT products and services for government, businesses and citizens
5.         The PAD’s ITES-BPO sector revenue forecast was based on the empirical data from
the BPO sector in India. This projection was optimistic as external factors (stability of local
currency, global economic trends, etc.) were not fully anticipated. For example, the global
economic crisis since 2008 reduced demand for outsourced labor and affected the ITES-BPO
sector in Ghana. Despite the crisis, the targets for PDO indicators measuring performance of the
ITES-BPO sector (PDO indicators 3. and 4. see details in the ICR datasheet page iii) were met.

6.         In terms of the productivity measurement for the use of ICT in government, business
and citizens, the project supported the setting up of IT architecture and interoperability standards
for government applications and networks, and developed key e-government services. These
constituted the foundation for IT development. One key achievement for the e-government
applications was the automation of the tax system for the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA).
Although additional tax data are needed to measure the precise revenue effect of the project, the
GRA is already reporting positive effects of automating tax administration, as Annex Table 3.2
shows.

(iii) Greater fiscal returns due to new source of revenue
8.          Annex 9 in the PAD stated that the project envisioned new tax revenues from the
ITES-BPO sector from three potential sources: (a) new tax revenues (e.g. value-added tax on
sale of goods and services by ITES-BPO firms, individual tax on earning of employees of ITES-
BPO firms, corporate tax on earning of ITES-BPOT firms) and (b) new export revenues.

9.          New tax revenues generated from ITES-BPO firms is difficult to measure due to lack
of baseline data as well as detailed financial information. In terms of new export revenues, the
project tracked a PDO indicator to measure the export led revenues by ITES-BPO sector (PDO
indicator 4. see details in the ICR datasheet page iii), and successfully achieved the target.

10.      Benefits from the GIFMIS component are wide ranging and include all of the central
elements for the expenditure side of the budget: i) System Establishment and Rollout; ii) Payroll
and HRMIS; iii) Budgetary Reform; iv) Cash Management; v) Financial Reporting; vi)
connections for MDA and MMDA; and vii) Capacity Development. These elements allow the
government to improve macro-fiscal discipline and management because of more timely and
accurate budget data. They also help improve financial management and control, and reduce
corruption through greater transparency. Sector reporting and service delivery are also
facilitated through more efficient and transparent expenditure management.

11.         In summary, the project interventions have already demonstrated significant positive
effects and changes on the ground. Additional data will be needed to assess longer term
efficiency and transparency effects more fully.

2.0.   RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION:

2.1.     Relevance of Project Design:
It is evident that the design objectives of the eGhana Project remain consistent with the needs and
priorities of the Government of Ghana. This is manifested by the focus on ICT sector development
in the various Policy documents of the Government of Ghana namely, the Ghana Shared Growth
and Development Agenda (GSGDA), and the ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) policy
of the Government of Ghana.
Some of the key objectives outlined for implementation in the GSGDA, relevant to the design of
the eGhana Project are: to ensure that modern information and communication technologies are
available and utilised at all levels of society; promote rapid development and deployment of the
national ICT infrastructure; strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework for managing
the ICT sector and promote the use of ICT in all sectors of the economy;
These policy objectives are to be achieved through the following strategies, which are expressed
in most of the intervention measures of the eGhana Project as follows:

       GSGDA strategy                                   Relevant eGhana intervention measure

In addition, the eGhana Project addresses aspects of seven (7) out of the 14 pillars of the Ghana
ICT for Accelerated Development Policy. The specific strategies, which have been identified
under the relevant pillars of the ICT4AD Policy by the Government of Ghana which are consistent
with the strategies espoused in the design and implementation of the eGhana Project are as follows:

       development of the national information and        project
       communication infrastructure


All in all, eGhana strategies continue to tie in very well with Government’s development agenda
with respect to the ICT sector.

2.2.    Assessment of Project Design in relation to intended outputs/outcomes
An assessment of the project design in relation to the intended outputs/outcomes has been
carried out using the theory of change approach. An analysis of the theory of change of the
eGhana Project reveals that the design was strong and capable of attaining the objectives set
out at appraisal.
The theory of change of the eGhana Project is anchored on three (3) theories and is
summarised as follows:
Theory 1: If technical assistance is provided to key government agencies and institutions, (i.e.
NCA, NITA, ITES, PCSRC,) appropriate ICT-sector regulatory and institutional frameworks
would be established/strengthened and functioning. This would result in ICT industry satisfaction
                                               54
with the environment for ICT/ITES investments which would subsequently contribute to improved
economic growth.

Theory 2: If support is provided to ICT/ITES companies through human resource development,
ITES investment promotion, the development of Grade “A” real estate for ITES BPO activities,
the provision of incubation services, and establishment and strengthening of the IT industry
Association, Ghana would emerge as a preferred destination for ITES/BPO activities with a
resultant expansion in ICT/ITES businesses in the country. These would subsequently result in
increased job creation in ICT/ITES businesses, increased ICT/ITES revenue generation and
increased contribution of ITES to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). All these would in turn
contribute to improved economic growth.

Theory 3: If e-Government is promoted through the establishment of IT architecture and
interoperability standards, GovNet establishment, shared portal infrastructure development,
training of public servants in e-government and roll-out of e-government applications, there would
be (a) disciplined development of e-government applications and networks for government
transformation (b) improved ability of databases to talk to each other (c) improved documentation
of information on taxpayers and increased tax revenues.
The attainment of these results would result in improved efficiency, accountability and
transparency in government and would subsequently contribute to improved economic growth.


2.3.     Assessment of Responsiveness of Bank’s Implementation Assistance to changing needs.
The evidence suggests that the Bank, as part of its implementation assistance, was very responsive
to the changing needs of the Government of Ghana. This is expressed through the Bank’s
willingness and subsequent approval for (a) upward adjustment of Bank’s contribution to the PPP
for automation of revenue agencies from US$10M to US$20M; (b) implementation of an
integrated e-immigration system (c) development of 10 regional innovation centres; (d)
refurbishment of PWD warehouses in Accra into a Business Process Outsourcing Centre and (e)
implementation of an eParliament system,(f) removal of privatisation of Ghana Telecom from the
list of eGhana interventions upon Government of Ghana request.

2.3.1. Upward adjustment of Bank’s contribution to PPP for Automation of revenue agencies and
Registrar General’s Department: It was programmed at project inception to allocate US$10M of
IDA funds as Government of Ghana contribution, towards the PPP arrangement for automation of
revenue agencies and Registrar General’s Department. However, prospective bidders indicated
that given the scope of the assignment, and financial outlay required for the successful
implementation of the system, it was necessary for Government of Ghana to increase the public
sector contribution to make the project attractive to the private sector. Subsequently, Government
of Ghana requested the Bank to make an upward adjustment to the public sector contribution from
US$10M to US$20M which was agreed upon, thus reducing the financial risks to the private sector.
The eventual bid price for the PPP for the automation of the revenue agencies and Registrar
General’s Department was about US$60M.

2.3.2. Inclusion of e-immigration implementation as part of eGhana Intervention measures.

                                               55
At project inception, e-immigration implementation was not part of the priorities identified by the
Government of Ghana for implementation. However, in line with emerging trends to manage the
growth of visitor numbers in a cost-effective way through the use of cutting edge technology and
to deliver a level of service consistent with the expectation of today's travellers, the Government
of Ghana requested the Bank to provide additional funding for the deployment of an Integrated e-
immigration system, capable of regulating entry into and exit from Ghana. The Bank responded
favourably to the changing needs of the Government of Ghana and approved funds through an
additional financing agreement for the Government in October 2010.

2.3.3. Inclusion of development of 10 Regional Innovation centres as part of eGhana intervention
measures: Even though the development of Regional Innovation Centres was not part of measures
outlined at project inception for implementation, Government of Ghana, in its quest to fulfil the
critical objective of ensuring that modern information and communication technologies are
available and utilised at all levels of society as outlined in the GSGDA document, requested the
Bank to make available funds for the development of 10 Regional Innovation centres (one per
region). This request was approved by the Bank through an additional financing arrangement in
October 2010. This is a further manifestation of Bank’s positive responsiveness to changing needs
of the Government.

2.3.4. Inclusion of refurbishment of PWD warehouses in Accra into a BPO centre as part of eGhana
intervention measures.
Three (3) years into the implementation of the eGhana project, the Government of Ghana identified
the need to provide Grade ‘A’ buildings for use as a BPO Center to accelerate Government’s action
in fostering the growth of the ICT sector, to promote the private sector’s role in ITES/BPO
entrepreneurship, and above all increase employment in the country. Government of Ghana
subsequently made a request to the Bank to make available additional funds for the development
of the BPO Centre. This changing need was approved by the Bank as part of additional financing
agreement of US$5M in October 2010.

2.3.5. Inclusion of implementation of eparliament as part of eGhana intervention measures
Even though automation of key business functions of parliament was not part of eGhana
intervention measures at project inception, the Government of Ghana made a case for the
automation key legislative processes that would lead to speedy and paperless flow of information.
Subsequently, the Bank made available additional funds, through an additional financing
agreement, for the design of an eparliament system that would support the following key business
functions of parliament:
           a) The legislative process;
           b) The parliamentary calendar;
           c) The agenda process;
           d) Chamber operations;
           e) Committee proceedings;
           f) The Hansard;
           g) Archiving;
           h) Distribution / Publishing;
           i) The work of the Table Office;
           j) The public web portal.


                                                56
2.3.6. Removal of privatisation of Ghana Telecom from the list of eGhana interventions upon
Government of Ghana request: At project inception, amount of US$4.5M was allocated to enable
the Government of Ghana to procure the services of a Transaction Advisor for privatisation of
Ghana Telecom. Subsequently however, Government of Ghana indicated its preparedness to use
GoG funds instead of Bank funds for the privatisation effort. The Bank accepted the changing
focus of government and reallocated the funds to support the upward adjustment of the public
sector contribution to the PPP for automation of revenue agencies and Registrar General’s
Department.


2.4.    Assessment of Critical Risks and Mitigating Measures
At project inception the critical risks that could prevent the achievement of project objectives were
identified. An assessment of the risks so identified at project closure reveals that relevant
mitigation measures were adopted during implementation to ensure that these risks did not derail
project implementation objectives.
The various risks identified and the corresponding mitigation measures adopted are as follows:
 Risks                                    Mitigation Measures Adopted
 Institutional Capacity of MoC to MoC put in place a project team which carried out the day to
 project manage and coordinate across day implementation of project activities for the entire duration
 Ministries / agencies involved;         of the project. Relevant technical staff from NITA and ITES
                                         Division were also supported under the project
 Government readiness to (i) engage in GoG demonstrated commitment to the PPP process through
 PPPs and (ii) outsource provision of the engagement of Consultant to design the PPP for
 services to private sector              automation of Revenue Agencies and Registrar General’s
                                         Department and subsequently implemented the automation
                                         programme on PPP basis.
 Resistance of public sector employees A Reform Implementation Committee was established at the
 to simplification of administrative Ghana Revenue Authority to create awareness and train staff
 processes     (through     e-government on change management processes to help dispel apprehensions
 applications)                           in the minds of public sector employees.
 Failure of re-engineering government Consultancy support was provided for re-engineering, use of
 service delivery (e-govt. applications) PPP with incentivized private sector player. The result is the
 within relevant GoG agencies            implementation of the PPP for revenue agencies and RGD.
 Limited enabling environment for Continuous engagement with ICT sector players resulted in the
 electronic and mobile transactions      enactment of 11 Acts and regulations to ensure the creation of
                                         a positive environment for ICT investments.
 Overestimated Business Process A detailed competitiveness / opportunities study has been
 Offshoring opportunity for Ghana        carried out per Hewitt Report of 2006. Rigorous investment
                                         promotion activities were carried out in the course of project
                                         implementation to showcase Ghana’s value proposition to the
                                         outside world. An ICT Park has been constructed under the
                                         MSME Project and a BPO Centre is being constructed under
                                         the eGhana Project to meet the real estate requirements of the
                                         ITES/BPO industry.
 Inadequate business environment to ITES BPO Policy and relevant ICT legislations have been
 attract BPO-ITES investors              developed under the auspices of the eGhana Project.


2.5.     Assessment of Environmental Impact

                                                  57
          The Environmental category assessed for the eGhana project is C. There were no major
environmental issues associated with the eGhana project which is an ICT and e-applications
project and focuses on institution-building activities including computerization and IT enabled
management systems to facilitate public sector reform and policy, regulatory changes to promote
development of a ICT industry.

          The introduction of BPO Centre construction at additional financing however required
the conduct of Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP). Further to the conduct of the ARAP,
four companies which were using the PWD warehouses for various businesses, under tenancy
agreement terms with the Public Works Department (PWD) prior to its conversion to a BPO centre,
were paid requisite compensation by the Government of Ghana in lieu of investments made in the
said property in the sum of Five Hundred and Thirty thousand, one hundred and ninety nine Ghana
cedis and ninety six pesewas (GHS 530, 199.96).The breakdown is as follows:
          Table 1: Compensation Payments to Tenants of BPO Centre

                                                                    of delayed payment.

 Total                   530,199.96              366,521.64


It is worth noting that one of the claimants (Britania) refused to take the compensation payments
on grounds that the period between valuation and payment of compensation was too long and
hence demanded an upward adjustment of the compensation payments. MoC is in discussion with
the claimant to resolve the issue.

At the time of project closure a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) station had been located near the
BPO centre after Public Works Department leased out portions of land to the entrepreneur for the
purpose. Ministry of Communications raised objection to the siting of the LPG station and
requested the business enterprise to be re-located. The matter was yet to be resolved by the court
as at project closure.

2.6.    Compliance with fiduciary, safeguard and legal covenants
The fiduciary, safeguard and legal covenants which the project is expected to comply with are: (a)
Recruitment of staff for designated positions with a Project Coordinator responsible for day-to-
day coordination (b) Appointment and maintenance of Matching Grants Manager (c) Adoption of
a Project Implementation manual (d) Preparation and submission of project reports (e) Conduct of
financial and procurement audited (f) Opening of project accounts.
So far compliance with all the conditions of the Financing agreement is satisfactory with the
exception of the establishment of a functioning Private Sector Oversight Committee.
The status of compliance with loan conditions is shown in Table 4.

                                               GoG Counterpart fund accounts have been
                                               opened at Bank of Ghana, Accra.


3.0. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
3.1 .Description of the Unit responsible for implementation:
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which was based in Accra, was responsible for coordinating
the project on a day- to- day basis, with direct reporting responsibility to the Hon. Minister of
Communications through the Chief Director. The PCU was headed by a Project Coordinator and
assisted by an M&E Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, Legal Specialist. The Accountant of the
Ministry of Communications provided financial management support. There were also four (4)
technical experts recruited for ITES Division to implement the Support to ICT-ITES component
and additional four (4) technical experts plus three (3) project officers for NITA to implement the
e-government applications and intra-governmental communications component.
Staff turnover was minimal. With the exception of the first Director of ITES, the first Director
General of NITA, the ICT Policy Specialist and the Deputy Director Human Resource for ITES
Division who did not renew their contracts at various times, all other staff remained at post during
the entire duration of the project. The first two were duly replaced by the Ministry of
Communications whilst the last two were not replaced as the Ministry did not deem it necessary
to do so.
The institutional arrangements which were put in place at project appraisal worked quite
successfully for the project. The PCU demonstrated adequate capacity to manage the project
efficiently as manifested in the achievement of targeted results at project closure.


                                                59
At the field level, the project implementing team worked very closely with the various
implementing agencies notably the National Communications Authority, Ghana Revenue
Authority, the Registrar General’s Department, Public Procurement Authority, Ghana Immigration
Service, the Judicial Service of Ghana, Ghana Postal and Courier Services Regulatory Commission
and ICT Industry Association (GASSCOM). The process of continuous dialogue and engagement
had resulted in better cooperation and improved performance from these collaborating institutions
over time.

3.2    Description of the Unit responsible for monitoring: The M&E Coordinator of the project
spearheaded the monitoring and evaluation efforts of the project. The levels of monitoring under
the eGhana Project are a) at the Institutional level (eg. GRA, RGD, NCA, NITA, ITES) and (b) at
the Project Management Unit level. Roles and responsibilities of the various actors of the
monitoring process were clearly spelt out in the M&E framework document and discussed to
ensure consensus and ownership of the M&E process ‘

3.3.    Operational Performance of the Project Management Unit: The Project Coordination Unit
was responsible for the co-ordination of activities of participating Implementing Agencies based
on annual work plans prepared.
Project planning: The project management team prepared eight (8) annual work plans and budgets
as well as procurement plans, for the years 2007 to 2014 for Bank review and approval. The
workplans detailed activities to be implemented, milestones, responsibilities and time frames for
implementation of given activities. Implementation of various project activities was effectively
controlled at both the Implementing Agency level and the PCU level to ensure that project targets
were achieved within specified time frames.

3.4.   Disbursements to service providers for work done.: The PCU disbursed funds to designated
accounts of various service providers per contract deliverables. The World Bank client connection
was used for direct payments, with the adoption of e-signature in the process. Payments below
US$200,000 were mostly effected from the replenishment account of the project. There were
minimum delays with payment once contract deliverables were acceptable to the client.

4.0. PROCUREMENT
Experience with the procurement process: The procurement process for goods and services was
quite smooth. The time lag between procurement activity initiation and contract signature was
quite good in most cases.
Analysis of procurement processes reveals that the period between sending of tender notices to
prospective bidders and contract award ranged from 5.7months on the average (for 13 works
contracts analysed) to 6.3 months on the average (for 20 goods contracts analysed) and 11.6
months on the average (for 30 consultancy contracts analysed).
It is however noteworthy that this process was considerably longer than the recorded average in
some cases, notably, the BPO centre procurement for which the period between procurement
process initiation and contract signature took almost 14 months as a result of inadequacy of
allocated budget (US$5M) vis-a-vis the least evaluated responsive bid (US$8.84M). The contract
was signed as soon as Rockefeller Foundation provided the additional funds required (US$3.84M)
based on a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Communications for the purpose. Other instances
of recorded prolonged processes include selection of consultants for NCA strategic plan
(21months); selection of consultants for finalisation of elegislations (18months); selection of
                                               60
consultants for Investment promotion (17months); selection of consultants for strategic plan and
regulations for PCSRC (14months); selection of consultants for design of e-parliament system
(18months); selection of firm/institution for BPO incubation (25months).

Analysis of procurement methods deployed during implementation revealed that there was
conformance with procurement methods agreed upon at appraisal. Details of procurement methods
used vis-a- vis what was planned at appraisal and the status of procurement are detailed in Annex
3.

9.0.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

9.1.    Conclusions:
On the whole, project implementation was satisfactory. Physical targets that were set at project
inception were largely achieved at project closure.

Almost all the key project development indicators were achieved at project closure. In particular
   o Number of jobs created in the ICT/ITES sector was exceeded by 24.3%;
   o % contribution of ICT/ITES sector to GDP was exceeded by 144%
   o Export led revenues generated by ITES/BPO industry was exceeded by 2%.
   o Satisfaction of users with government services taken up for electronic delivery was
       exceeded by 4%.
The following development objective indicators however fell short of the targets set
   o Impact on IT/ITES sector of World Bank Technical Assistance fell short by 12%
   o Proportion of women engaged in IT/ITES sector fell short of target by 19.2%

Similarly programmed intermediate outcomes were achieved or exceeded under the various
components.
   o Proportion of MDAs expressing satisfaction with level of coordination and management
       of MoC was exceeded by 3.7%
   o Decrease in bandwidth price was exceeded by 233%
   o Eight (8) laws and 3 regulations were passed, as against a programmed four (4)
   o Proportion of women holding managerial positions in ICT/ITES industry was exceeded by
       40%
   o No. of companies incubated was exceeded by 36%
   o Number of transactions on public services taken up for electronic delivery exceeded the
       programmed target constituting 87900 business registrations, 425,305 TIN registrations
       and 390 page views on eservices portal.
   o All applications deployed under the eGhana project adhered to the IT architecture and
       interoperability standards
   o Ratio of electronic to manual transactions was exceeded by 65%
   o Number of public servant and judicial staff trained in e-government was exceeded by 14%.
   o
The following intermediate outcomes however fell short of the targets:
   o Proportion of ICT/ITES companies expressing satisfaction with the level of coordination
       of ITES secretariat fell short of target by 19.9%
   o 53.3% of people trained were successfully employed in ICT/ITES sector. This fell short of
       the target by 46.7%
                                               61
    o 90% of Regional Innovation centres were established.
    o BPO centre was 70% completed at project closure. Delayed completion was due to delayed
      access to supplementary funds from Rockefeller Foundation.

9.2.   Recommendations

    1) Provision of furniture and content for RICs: As part of the implementation arrangements
       physical structure provision was the scope for 9 RICs with the exception of the Korle Bu
       RIC. With the completion of the buildings for the innovation centres there would be the
       need to furnish the remaining 9 RICs to make them useful to citizens. It is estimated that
       an amount of GHS1.3 million would be required to furnish the 9 RICs. It is recommended
       that MoC should source for funds to make the RICs fully functional. The possibility of
       using part of the contingency fund under the upcoming eTransform project should be
       explored.
    2) Completion and eventual occupancy of BPO Centre: The BPO Centre project was at 65%
       completion point at project closure. Delayed completion was due to delayed access to
       supplementary funds for project execution. It would be necessary to complete the project
       with funds made available under the Rockefeller Foundation Grant to ensure that citizens
       have full benefit of the investments made.
    3) Relocation of Gas Station from the BPO centre: In order to be compliant with various
       national and international safeguards standards, it is pertinent to relocate the gas station
       that has been established within the vicinity of the BPO centre following a lease of a parcel
       of land to the investor by PWD after the property had been assigned to the Ministry of
       Communications for the BPO centre establishment.
    4) Speedy implementation of Strategic Plans: The evidence suggests that strategic plans that
       had been developed for NITA and PCRSC have not been implemented in great measure.
       The reason provided by respective agencies was that the organizations did not have
       adequate funds to implement the recommendations of the plans. Going forward, it would
       be necessary for the relevant organizations to make adequate budget allocations in annual
       budget proposals to move the process forward.
    5) Cabinet Approval for BPO Policy Document: Further to the completion of the BPO Policy
       document, there would be the need to pursue and secure cabinet approval for the policy
       document to enable it serve as a point of reference for BPO engagement in Ghana.
    6) Awareness creation and sensitization for increased transaction processing on eServices
       portal: Notwithstanding the large number of page views on the eservices portal (390,000)
       actual transaction processing has been limited (524). With the launch of the epayment
       portal, it would be necessary for NITA to carry out intensive sensitization and awareness
       creation on the existence and functionalities of the eservices and epayment platforms to
       enhance the uptake of public services for electronic delivery.
    7) Speedy deployment of TRIPS to all 10 sites: At project closure, two out of the ten sites
       that TRIPS was deployed, were fully functional. It is recommended that efforts aimed at
       the full functioning of TRIPS at all ten (10) sites, not later than 3 months after project
       closure should be vigorously pursued.
    8) Deployment of RGD portal: Deployment of RGD portal was one of the outstanding
       deliverables at project operational acceptance and remain outstanding at project closure.
       NITA RGD should follow up with the private partner GCNeT to ensure completion and
       acceptance.
                                                62
    9) E-immigration system implementation: Deployment of e-immigration system was not
        completed as at project closure due to inadequacy of funds under the eGhana project. Funds
        have been allocated under the eTransform project to complete the system deployment
        process. It is recommended that eTransform management, Ghana Immigration Service and
        NITA should follow through the process to ensure total delivery of requisite outputs.
    10) Leverage the incubation centre for expanded entrepreneurial development: In view of the
        commitment and creativity exhibited by the Kumasi Business Incubator (KBI) in the
        implementation of the incubation programme, it is recommended that the upcoming
        eTransform project should leverage the incubation infrastructure available at KBI and
        introduce other innovation measures such as the mlabs to deepen the benefits that citizens
        in the KNUST enclave will derive from the establishment of the incubation centre.
    11) Establishment of SREA: Establishment of Special Repayment Escrow Account (SREA)
        for the payment of the private partner was not concluded at project closure. It is
        recommended that Ministry of Finance should complete the process of establishing the
        SREA to enable payment to be effected to the private partner as and when requisite
        deliverables are made by the private partner (as per contract).

9.3.  Major Lessons Learned
   1) The implementation of an incubation programme in educational institutions has a very high
      rate of success, judging from the creativity, innovativeness and vision which the incubatees
      of the Kumasi Business Incubator brought on board in the implementation of the project-
      supported incubation programme. One way of cutting down on costs of maintaining
      incubatees could consist of the retention/selection of potential national service persons into
      the incubation programme (as was practised under the KBI programme), to ensure that
      incubatees are able to cater for their daily maintenance needs during the incubation period.
   2) In view of the innovative nature of ICT projects, it would be prudent to ensure that all
      future software applications related projects must have the inclusion of demonstration of
      live software which has been successfully deployed elsewhere by vendor as part of the
      evaluation criteria before final selection of Contractors and award of contracts. This would
      ensure that pretenders are promptly eliminated at the point of evaluation.
   3) The protracted dispute between the Contractor and sub-contractor for the automation of the
      revenue agencies brings to the fore, the need for the main contractor to have a high level
      of experience in deploying specific solutions they’ve been contracted to implement, rather
      than the focus on Sub-Contractors at evaluation for the deployment of specific solutions.
   4) The deployment of PPPs in egovernment, relative to revenue agencies, is a very
      challenging endeavour. The multiplicity of stakeholders in the implementation process,
      coupled with the need for Government agencies to ensure that public interest is diligently
      protected in the transactions, (while at the same time packaging the transaction in such a
      way as to attract potential investors), requires in-depth consultations each step of the way.
      Balancing the private partner’s business interest with government’s interest of social
      responsibility and citizen satisfaction is a delicate balance which needs to be managed in
      such a as to make the PPP business proposition attractive to the private sector participants.
   5) It is advisable to complete any reform implementation program before concluding a PPP
      agreement. The PPP agreement between the vendor and GoG was concluded at the time
      that GRA reform program had started. The pace of progress of GRA Reform Program had
      not been as rapid as originally envisaged - this meant that the vendor had been attempting


                                                63
    to define business processes for operational arrangements that did not yet exist. This
    subsequently delayed application roll-out.
6) Where study tours are organized on e-applications for top management staff of User
    Agencies to enable them see at close quarters best-practice examples of similar applications,
    there is a great propensity for buy-in and commitment from the leadership. This is
    evidenced by (a) the high support provided to the e-immigration project by the Director of
    the Ghana Immigration Service, having undertaken a study-tour to Malaysia and Hong
    Kong to observe e-immigration system in action in those countries, (b) the commitment of
    the Chief Justice of Ghana to the implementation of the e-justice system, following her
    visit to Turkey to study the operation of the e-justice system and (c) the drive of the
    Executive Director of the Public Procurement Authority for the implementation of the e-
    procurement system following his visit to India and Portugal to observe the operation of
    the e-procurement system in those countries.
7) In view of the complex nature of e-applications deployed to user agencies, it is necessary
    to beef up the technical capacity of User Agencies with staff from the National Information
    Technology Agency (NITA) to ensure effective supervision and monitoring of complex
    ICT programs. This is particularly relevant where the user agency does not have staff with
    requisite IT capabilities.
8) The engagement of an Independent Auditor (Engineer) to examine the work of vendors of
    complex ICT programs is a prerequisite for effective delivery of needed solutions.
9) In the light of the complex nature of e-applications there should be room for partial
    operational acceptance of sub-systems prior to Full Operational Acceptance. This will
    make it possible for some of the completed functionalities to be handed over to the Client,
    and at the same time improve upon the disbursement position of the project.
10) At project inception it was envisaged that e-applications would be implemented on Public
    Private Partnerships (PPP) basis. The assumption was that private sector would make direct
    cash contributions to the partnerships, through a Design, Finance, Build, Operate and
    Transfer Model, where private sector would be reimbursed after an agreed period of
    management. This allowed significant risk to be shifted to private sector, and the latter in
    return, received requisite compensation and some control of the systems. Subsequently,
    allocated project budgetary estimates were based on Government of Ghana contribution
    (through World Bank funding). However, apart from the Automation of the Revenue
    Agencies and RGD program which was financed through PPP with direct private sector
    contribution, the structure of the other remaining applications are being implemented with
    the private partner responsible only for delivery and management for agreed period through
    Design, Build, Operate and Transfer Model. The financing component is no longer part of
    the PPP model, due primarily to data security concerns raised by the Government of Ghana
    for the remaining applications, and also challenges with private sector financing. As a
    result, available funds for the implementation of e-justice, e-immigration, e-parliament and
    e-procurement fall short of budgeted amounts. There is therefore the need to critically
    assess the security implications of automating given government agencies before designing
    a PPP arrangement for such purposes.
11) Infrastructure remains a very critical and major component of decision making process for
    location selection for ITES/BPO companies, with the availability and quality of
    infrastructure directly impacting the ease and cost of doing business in a location. There is
    the need to locate additional dysfunctional government buildings for refurbishment and use


                                            64
    for more productive purposes in the image of the BPO centre which has been developed
    under the project to ensure employment and economic growth.
12) Business and financial environment, tax and regulatory environment, general law and order
    situation, administrative hurdles etc. have a direct impact on the ease and cost of doing
    ITES-BPO business. Promotion of the following creates a healthy environment for the
    growth of the ITES/BPO sector.
         a. Effective coordination between various agencies such as GIPC, GFZB,
              GASSCOM and ITES Secretariat
         b. Development of legislation and policies to discourage unionism in ITES-BPO
              sector
         c. Increased awareness on information security, data privacy and intellectual
              property laws.
13) Healthy incumbents are sign of vibrancy in the ITES/BPO sector and their success is a
    major factor in attracting foreign investment in the sector. In order to promote incumbents
    there is the need to do the following:
        a. Encourage, promote and develop strong linkages and tie-ups with companies,
            industry associations, and academia and private education service providers.
        b. Provide Go-to-Market and process improvement training to GASSCOM members
        c. Increase domestic and regional awareness for benefits of BPO which will enable
            local service providers to develop expertise and capabilities for competing
            effectively globally
        d. Undertake initiatives on branding and image creation that position the unique
            advantages of Ghana in the international market
14)         With respect to enabled legal/regulatory environment creation the following
    lessons are noteworthy:
         a) The need to constantly review and update the laws for NCA to address current
              regulatory trends.
         b) The need to put in place legal framework that further improves on the NCA’s
              engagement with the service providers and consumers.
         c) The need to strengthen the consumer protection laws and enforcement in the
              country.
         d) The legislative procedures and processes on amendments, etc have sometimes
              made it impossible to address challenges arising out of the legislations in an
              expeditious manner.
         e) Financial challenges associated with full implementation of the Acts.
         f) In the future the financial impact of laws must be properly assessed and
              commitment made for the full implementation of the laws once passed. The lack
              of such commitment towards implementation usually leads to situations where the
              necessary human and other resource needed for implementation is not readily
              available.
         g) Ghana’s success with the MNP can be largely attributed to the initial advance
              preparations and rigorous testing and the collaboration amongst all the key
              stakeholders; (National Communications Authority) NCA, Porting Access Ghana
              (the central MNP service provider), and the mobile network operators.

1. INTRODUCTION

1. The Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) was
   launched in May 2009 and implemented over a 4-year period (July 1, 2010 – June
   30, 2014). The original completion date was extended by 6 months to December 31st
   2014.
2. The project was made a part of a restructured eGhana project (Component 4) for a
   number of reasons, including the need to reduce the time required to complete the
   processes leading to the signing of the loan agreement. Key planning and
   implementation dates are summarized below:

      2. PROJECT GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

2.1      Goals and Objectives

      8. The overall project goal is to improve the effectiveness of service delivery and the
         allocation of scarce resources, using the new tools and processes resulting from the
         GIFMIS, and assure an accountable, more effective, and transparent financial
         governance. GIFMIS aims at providing improved aggregate expenditure control,
         predictability for financial flows, expenditure and investment planning, ability to
         monitor expenditures and fiscal accountability. In other words, the project aimed at

            a) The establishment and use of GIFMIS-based PFM functionality at
               national and district level treasuries;
            b) Improved macro-fiscal discipline and management;
            c) Improved financial management, control and efficiency across
               government.

      9. The GIFMIS system was to be set up and deployed to all MDAs and MMDAs

2.2      Scope

      10. GIFMIS comprised of 3 major components, and 9 subcomponents (or strategic
          segments)




                                              70

      •   Financing of the project by multiple DPs (either as joint or parallel financing) should
          be avoided in future to minimise reporting and administrative challenges.
      •   Well thought out project work plans, linked to budget and procurement plan to be
          prepared in advance and properly sequenced
      •   Ensure Early Establishment Of Systems For Monitoring, Evaluation And
          Reporting.

5.3       Sustainability

Risk of lack of sustainability of systems and practices soon after the project implementation
is a concern in terms of (a) readiness in defining functional specifications; (b) adequate
stakeholder ownership and commitment; (c) a robust change management and

                                                75
communication strategy; (d) adequacy of training and capacity building initiatives; (d)
prioritization and sequencing; (e) appropriate implementation timeline

The project has a high sustainability rating for the following reasons
    • Strong political support for project objectives
    • Project driven by public servants with limited support from consultants
    • Strong capacity building efforts provided technical staff
    • A comprehensive system that addresses most of the needs of MDAs e.g Budget
       preparation, execution, accounting, financial reporting and auditing.

          Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Development Partner Comments on Project and Bank Responses
Below are the comments received from the Development Partners (EU and DFID), and Bank
point by point response. The DP comments concern only component 4-Ghana Integrated
Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS). Related comments are grouped (i.e.,
comments 1. to 3., 4. to 6., 7. to 9., and 10.)

[Comment-1]: Our comments are based notably on the findings of the Performance & Financial
Audits of GIFMIS conducted jointly by the Development Partners DFID, DANIDA and EU in
2014 covering the majority of the implementation period. (The World Bank has received a copy
of the reports.)
Taking into account the findings of the joint Performance Audit, which assessed among others the
effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the GIFMIS project, we conclude, that despite some
achievements, significant challenges in the implementation of the GIFMIS project persist.

[Comment-2]: Using 2010 as a baseline, overall project implementation is assessed at being only
about 60%
[Comment-3]: Out of the four different types of funds, only the Consolidated Fund (CF) is
currently implemented.

[Bank’s response—Comments 1-3]: It is important to understand that the EU performance audit
was not limited to the GIFMIS component, but went beyond to cover the full spectrum of GoG
financial management information system. At the same time, the audit captures the performance
assessment between 2010 to the end of 2013, leaving out one full year of GIFMIS implementation.
Still, the EU performance audit registered substantial progress (60 percent overall) in project
implementation performance. The performance audit also did not consider a number of activities
that were not part of the original design but which were key to supporting wider Public Financial
Management (PFM) reforms, including: (1) the implementation of program-based budgeting; (2)
implementation of the Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS) to strengthen
credibility of payroll; and (3) the roll-out of peer-to-peer (P2P) implementation to agencies beyond
the core consolidated fund. At project closure, (1) was fully achieved; (2) was partially achieved;
and (3) was achieved for the consolidated fund that constitutes 66% of government budget – noting
that government budget includes all funds (consolidated, statutory, donor, and IGFs – see Annex
Table 8.1 below).

             C. Statutory Funds and Others

             D. Donor Funds
                                                                          100
                      TOTAL APPROPRIATION:

It is also important to note that not only were the consolidated fund was transacted through the
GIFMIS, but all statutory fund transfers (13% of total government budget) to their respective
management entities are transacted through the GIFMIS under the electronic funds transfer system
after formal release of the budgeted funds by the Budget Division of the MoF. What are not
transacted through the GIFMIS are the actual spending of the GIFMIS transferred statutory funds
since such funds are managed outside the core consolidated fund and are spent without using the
peer-to-peer (P2P) process. The IGFs constitute 9% of the total government budget. These, along
with the statutory funds, are planned to be also transacted using the P2P and the business process
requirements and design have been carried out under the GIFMIS for implementation in a follow
on project.

 GIFMIS activities (under component 4 of the eGhana project) were not designed to implement all
funds. Coverage of the CF in any jurisdiction over a 4-year period is a significant achievement.
The issue of expenditure arrears continuing to rise regardless of the introduction of commitment
control in a P2P context is not the result of the poor implementation of the GIFMIS but rather
because of weak fiscal policy management that falls outside the GIFMIS. New arrears arising as
a result of the crowding out of liquidity due to priority payment of prior arrears (impact of single
spine pay policy, lack of a system of public investment management policy, etc.). The SoEs, that
represent a major source of arrears, are not covered under the GIFMIS. Arrears include budgeted
legal transfers to statutory funds that have been delayed as a result of liquidity constraints, not
necessarily the growing flow of new arrears, have also informed the growth in the stock of arrears.
GIFMIS, was not expected to control fiscal policy, but rather establish the platform for monitoring
and control of arrears within the focus area – i.e., the consolidated fund.
[Comment- 4]: The update of the legislative and regulatory framework has still not been
implemented.
[Comment- 5]: We would like to particularly highlight the concerns regarding the integration of
the Payroll system onto GIFMIS as mentioned in the Performance Audit. Notwithstanding that
various tasks have been completed in this area the joint audit assessed that, "… a significant amount
of payroll is still managed outside the R12 Oracle platform and unless all payroll of the GoG civil
servants is run consistently on a unique platform, it will be difficult to achieve GIFMIS broader
objectives as set out in Project Charter and benefit full integration, enhanced control and robust
budgetary control." With reference to the conducted KPMG Payroll Assurance report dated
November 2012, the joint Performance Audit concludes "Being given the significant nature of the
findings reported by the 2012 KPMG report and challenges faced by the GoG relating to payroll
process regarding some agencies, a quality check performed by an independent consultant prior

                                                 79
to the upgrade of Oracle R12 platform would have been warranted. In the absence of this, it is
difficult to ascertain whether the issues which were highlighted have been resolved and do not
stand on the new platform."
[Comment- 6]: Significant weaknesses in the financial management of the GIFMIS pooled
account were observed, as evidenced by the joint Financial Audit (covering 2011-2013) which
resulted in ineligibilities of GHS 5,222,303.79. In addition the Internal Audit report of December
2013 established further GHS 1,142,500 of ineligible expenditures. Also World Bank's own "In-
depth Review on Selected Expenditures" of September 2013 is recalled in this respect.

[Bank’s responses 4-6]: The ‘issues and options’ report on the key PFM legal framework
weaknesses was delivered by project closure and the IMF was to assist in further supporting the
government in drafting of the amendments in a new Bill. Further political consensus on the holistic
PFM reform is required for the establishment of a new legal framework. World Bank will continue
working on this issue under the following new project (PFM reform project).

The payroll system has been upgraded from Oracle version 11 to version 12, and is now live for
all GoG employees, except the Ghana Education Service (GES) due essentially to political
economy considerations. This process has involved a massive clean-up of the payroll database and
consequent strengthening of the integrity of the payroll data which remains an ongoing activity in
any jurisdiction.

Regarding the finding of the KPMG report provided in the EU comments, the WB implementation
supervision team (before the upgrade) in January 2012, requested and the GoG agreed to undertake
a Payroll Assurance review. The objective of this review was to identify deficiencies and
vulnerabilities in controls in the Government’s payroll system and to recommend measures to be
taken to remedy any assessed weaknesses before the planned major upgrade of the system can be
financed under GIFMIS. It was the considered view of the WB team that a thorough due diligence
of Government’s legacy systems would avoid the replication of any existing control weaknesses
and data errors in an enhanced system. This report informed the upgrade of the payroll to version
12 and its integration with the GIFMIS general ledger for automatic data uptake of payroll costs
and posting to their respective cost centers – something that never existed before. This was
achieved for the all GoG payrolls, except GES.
There were some challenges in the financial management of the GIFMIS pooled account. These
challenges were relatively common across government projects. They covered expenditures such
as training, workshops, per diem payments etc. The WB first carried out a review and reported
ineligible expenditures which the GoG was requested to refund; the Bank also requested that the
internal audit agency carry out a further audit and the agency reported additional ineligibles which
the GoG refunded; and finally, the EU’s financial audit that covered a longer period brought to
light additional ineligibles (all based on the principle that the Bank established) and the DPs
(including the WB) requested a refund from GoG and the refund was made. It underscores that
the EU report did not point out any fraud or corruption, per se, but rather ineligible expenditures
for the GIFMIS pooled account funds for activities that, in as much as normal and systemic
government practices, are considered not to be financed under the project. The overall FM
arrangements (under the Bank’s BP 10.02) under the project were considered, adequate.

[Response from MoF, Ghana – 6]:
             RE: e-Ghana ICR- ISSUES RAISED BY DONORS REGARDING
                           INELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES

1.      We refer to paragraph 77 of the e-Ghana ICR relating to the statement that “there was a
concern by one of the donors that there were a number of ineligible expenditures”. We have
indicated in our comments in the draft ICR that “The eligibility or otherwise of the alleged
ineligible expenditures was a matter of protracted discussions as the PIU insisted that it had
followed GoG procedures, as indicated in the Internal Audit Report. The matter was eventually
resolved when GoG agreed to refund the amount of GHS 5,222,303.79 which was largely in
respect of hiring of venue for capacity building, representing about 3% of the total project cost.”
We hereby re-iterate our response on the entire Audit report as follows:
2.      We recall that the 2014 Performance and Financial Audit, commissioned by three of the
four Donors for the period 21st December 2010 to 31st December 2013 arrived at the following
key conclusions
    a) Implementation level as at 31st December was 60%
    b) The project had not progressed to a stage whereby the broad objectives of the project as
        detailed in the project charter will be achieved. Outstanding issues in this regard included
           i. Completion of all modules for the four different types of funds
          ii.   Full integration of the payroll on a common platform
         iii. The legal and regulatory framework are reviewed and updated in order to support
                full use of GIFMIS in the current reform initiatives
    c) Inadequate procedures to procure hotel services
    d) Other relatively minor observations.

3. We wish to re-iterate our response on the issue of inadequate procurement procedures to
procure hotel services, which informed the decision to declare the expenditure of GHS 4,
247345.29 as ineligible, as follows:
   a) It has not been the convention or practice to treat the selection of hotels as a
       procurement activity in the public sector. Doing so would have required the inclusion of
       hotel selection in the procurement plan and choice of procurement method also
       indicated. The choice of hotel for project activities is based on a complex mix of
       considerations including: hotel availability, cost, hotel environment, proximity to training
       center, size of conference room, availability of internet connectivity, the number of
       participants, among others.
   b) To ensure value for money in hotel selection process, prices were negotiated to
       obtain corporate rates, pro forma invoices obtained and subjected to internal review
       and approval and payment made directly to the established institutions i.e., the hotels
       which are all available for verification.

                                                 81
c) At regional and district levels, the hotels used were the only hotels which had the
   available facilities under the circumstances.
d) The periodic Joint Review Missions since 2011 had on no occasion objected to this
   process of selecting hotel services. The significant stakeholder buy-in and the success
   chalked so far in terms of public sector awareness and change on the project are directly
   linked to these sensitization and training programmes held in these hotels.

[Comment-7]: With reference to the procurement under the GIFMIS component (a pooled account
with Development Partners), which was supervised by the World Bank, we are concerned that
there were several instances of incorrect procurement methods used and of procurement files not
being complete. Further, the absence of a formal procedure to approve the annual procurement
plan let to challenges establishing a joint position on the procurement plan; consequently not all
partners approved all procurement plans. Furthermore, given the uncertainty about the
implementation of a unique and secured payroll database for the mechanized payroll, procurements
undertaken in 2012 for additional payroll licences are questionable from a value for money point
of view. Finally, with regards to procurement of assets under the GIFMIS component, as of July
2014, 37% of assets acquired under the GIFMIS pooled account, had not been distributed. This
refers to around 2700 items of IT equipment, which raises value for money questions.
[Comment- 8]: The joint Performance Audit continues to state that the description of some project
objectives are broad in nature and are not specifically related to the GIFMIS component; planned
activities for change management are not adequately detailed; M&E reporting procedures are not
sufficiently embedded; a detailed baseline was not initially established and a detailed work plan
was formulised only in Sept. 2013; a robust budgetary control framework for the project is not in
place and the role and responsibilities of key actors including DPs have not been defined in the
Project Charter.
[Comment-9]: The joint Performance Audit concludes on page 9 that: "The GIFMIS
implementation has not yet progressed to a stage whereby the broad objectives of the project as
defined in the Project Charter will have been achieved. The key enablers towards the achievement
of the objectives are:
o All modules for the four different types of funds are completed;
o Full integration of the payroll on a common platform is achieved; and
o The legal and regulatory framework are reviewed and updated in order to support full use of
    GIFMIS in the current reform initiatives. Without which, the broad objectives will not be fully
    met."

[Bank’s responses-7-9]: Based upon the MoU, signed with Development Partners, the
procurement management followed World Bank Procurement Guidelines and was reviewed by the
Bank team. Regarding the 37 percent of the assets acquired under the GIFMIS component that
were not distributed as at July 2014, the EU may be referring to the computers and vehicles
acquired for the planned roll-out to the MMDAs which remain useful as roll-out is ongoing
regardless of the closure of the project in Dec. 2014. It is not clear how the value for money
question has been impacted by this. The GIFMIS component was not a standalone project, but
rather added to the existing project (eGhana) as an additional financing operation. There are
specific guidelines on design principles for the World Bank Lending Operations, and all WB
lending projects follow the operations guidelines. For the GIFMIS component, the MoU signed
among the GoG and the Development Partners clearly set out the roles and responsibilities of all
for the use of pooled account. If further detail achievement/conditions were requested by a specific

                                                83
donor, it should have been specified in the respective bilateral financing agreements. The Project
Charter was referred to in the Additional Financing Project Paper but the charter was merely an
objective intention of the GoG on the needed reforms (which were mainly technical) that the
Additional Financing operation had to respond to, based on the government priorities.
As mentioned above (Bank’s response – 8), the Project Charter prepared by the GoG was not the
project document (Project Paper). Any measurement of performance and achievement or
otherwise of the objectives should be based on the Project Paper. The Charter was not conceived
as one to be accomplished under a 4-year project. Many of the project’s achievements went
beyond what the Charter sought to achieve – e.g., PBB; HRMIS; TSA.

[Comment– 10]: Finally, we would like to raise challenges which occurred around the various
joint implementation review missions, led by the World Bank. Although the Bank's analysis was
mostly sound, the proposed concluding scoring of progress was not always coherent with the
analysis and with partners' assessments. As a consequence, the EU and other partners decided to
officially abstain from approving the WB-led joint review missions as from October 2013 and to
participate as observer only going forward.

[Bank’s response– 10]: As mentioned in the main text of the ICR, joint financing with
Development Partners provided important lessons. , One of the lessons learned derived from the
pooled-financing arrangement where there is no acknowledged leadership amongst the partners, it
was difficult to have harmonized reporting requirements, and this was an additional burden on the
client. In addition, the DPs, as observers, were able to convey all of their concerns during
supervision missions. For Bank reporting, the team used Bank’s methodologies for project
performance for its ISRs, which might have been different from the DPs’ assessment. The Bank
does not believe that observer status impeded supervision of the project.

This summary is excerpted from the Borrower’s ICR.

1.1.     The National Communications Authority Act, 2008 (ACT 769)
Summary of the Law:The National Communications Authority Act, 2008 (Act 769) repealed the
then National Communications Authority Act, 1996 (Act 524). The Act re-established the National
Communications Authority (NCA) as the central body to license and regulate communications
activities and services in Ghana. Strengthening the weaknesses under the previous Act, it
incorporated international best practices on the principles of good corporate governance for a
telecommunications regulatory institution. The Act charged the NCA to apply the principles of
transparency and accountability in its work. It addresses the interests of consumers and users of
telecommunications networks. Concerns for the environment and the impact of
telecommunications activities for persons with disability, the elderly and low income earners are
all part of the responsibility of the Authority. The Act sets out the objects, functions, powers and
regulatory practices of the Authority. It among other things also provides for the composition of
the Authority's governing body as well as their powers and functions. It must be also noted that
Act 769 gave significant powers to the Authority to enable it assert its autonomy.

Status of Implementation: After the Act received Presidential Assent (11th December 2008), the
Board of the then National Communications Authority (Authority) was re-constituted to reflect
the new composition proposed. The Act has since been implemented and is the main legal
framework that the National Communications Authority derives it legal authority to regulate the
communications industry.

1.2            The Electronic Communications Act, 2008 (ACT 775)
Summary of the Law: This Act provides for the regulation of electronic communications,
broadcasting, the use of the electro-magnetic spectrum and related matters. It applies to electronic
communications and broadcasting service providers and their networks. It deals with licence and
frequency authorisation, interconnection, access, universal service and access, consumer
protection, numbering plans, equipment and technical standards, fees and resolution of disputes in
the regulation of electronic communications. Act 769 and 775 separated the Authority’s
operational and regulatory functions respectively. Act 775 also repealed the Telecommunications
(Frequency Registration and Control) Decree, 1977 (S.M.C.D. 71) but saved some regulations
made under the Telecommunications (Frequency Registration and Control) Decree, 1977
(S.M.C.D. 71) which regulations have since been also repealed by other legislations.

Act 775 also established the Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communications (GIFEC) to
provide financial resource for the establishment of universal service and access for all communities
in Ghana and to facilitate the provision of basic telephony, internet service, multimedia service,
broadband and broadcasting services to these communities. It defines amongst other things the
sources of GIFEC’s money as well as its composition, functions and tenure of office of its Board
of Trustees.
This Act also creates a number of offences in contravention with the laws set out in the Act. It
specifically prohibits provision of electronic communications service without a license and giving
false and misleading information to the NCA just to mention a few.

                                                86
Status of Implementation: After the Act received Presidential Assent (6th January 2009), the NCA
used it to re-orient its licensing regime. The Act has since been implemented and is the main legal
framework the NCA uses to license and/or authorize its service providers. In July 2004 the
Government of Ghana set up Ghana Investment Fund for Telecommunications (GIFTEL) as an
agency of the Ministry of Communications to facilitate the provision of universal service to basic
telephony for the un-served and underserved communities in the country. The Electronic
Communications Act, 2008 gave the legal autonomy to the agency (which started its operations in
January 2005), changed its name to the Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communication
(GIFEC) and widened the scope of its mandate to include the provision of access to electronic
services including ICT, broadcasting, internet, and multimedia service for the un-served and
underserved communities in Ghana. GIFEC continues to work within its mandate by bridging the
digital divide and has been recognized as one of the efficient universal service providers in Africa.

1.3.    National Information Technology Agency Act, 2008 (Act 771)
 Summary of the Law: This Act established the National Information Technology Agency to
regulate information communications technology and to act as the national implementation and
co-ordination Agency for the ICT policy. The Act sets out the objects, functions, powers and
regulatory practices of the Agency. It among other things also sets out the composition of the
Agency, its governing body as well as their powers and functions.

Its mandate includes identifying, promoting and developing innovative technologies, standards,
guidelines and practices among government agencies and local governments, as well as ensuring
the sustainable growth of ICT via research & development planning and technology acquisition
strategies to facilitate Ghana’s prospect of becoming a technology-driven, knowledge-and values-
based economy as espoused in the e-Ghana project which ideally seeks to assist the Government
generate growth and employment, by leveraging ICT and public-private partnerships.

The establishment of the National Information Technology Agency has been vital for the e-
Government to take off in Ghana. E-Government, being an essential component of the e-Ghana
project will contribute to improved efficiency, transparency and accountability in selected
Government functions.

Status of Implementation: The Act having received Presidential Assent on 11th December 2008,
the NITA Board was commissioned to take over IT policy implementation processes then being
undertaken by Ghana Information and Communications Technology Directorate. (GICTeD).
Currently NITA is fully operational with a complement of competent staff that are helping the
institution to implement its mandate under the Act. NITA is currently championing the e-
government initiative across the country in accordance with the Electronic Transactions Act, 2008
(Act 772).

1.4.    The Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 (Act 772)
Summary of the Law: This Act provides for and facilitates electronic communications and related
transactions in the public interest. It ensures the prevention and removal of barriers that affect
electronic communications and transactions in Ghana. The Act also helps promote legal certainty
and confidence in the electronic communications and related transactions in Ghana just to mention
a few. It applies to electronic transactions and records of every type. It helps to facilitate the use

                                                 87
of electronic media by recognizing the need to provide a framework for the preparation, processing,
storage, transmission and receipt of electronic data in a secured, efficient and trustworthy manner.
The Act provides for the establishment of a certifying agency to provide encryption and
authentications services for electronic communications and transactions in Ghana. It also provides
consumer protection laws and establishes a Domain Name Registry to be responsible for the
country’s domain name space. It creates cyber offences to help prevent the use of electronic media
for illegal or unlawful acts.

Status of Implementation: Act 775 received Presidential Assent on 11th December 2008 and has
since formed the basis of various ICT policy implementation activities including the following:
    • E-Government infrastructure and implementation processes.
    • Awareness creation and prosecution of cyber related offences.
    • Re-delegation processes and the setting up of the domain name registry.
    • Development of other legislations to facilitate full implementation of the Act 775 eg. the
        Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843).

1.5.    Electronic Communications Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1991)
Summary of the Law: The Electronic Communications Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1991) is a
subsidiary legislation to further strengthen the provision of the Electronic Communications Act,
2008 (Act 769). The Regulations expand the provision in Act 769. It specifically provides for
licensing regime and types, frequency allocation and regulations, standards, the fundamental
principles or policies to govern the electronic communications industry, dispute resolution
mechanisms, pricing and consumer protection related issues for the communications industry.
Status of Implementation: These Regulations came into force in March 2011, and have since
formed the basis of all licensing, standardization, authorizations, frequency allocations and dispute
resolution processes undertaken by the NCA.

1.6.    The Mobile Number Portability Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1994)
Summary of the Law: The Mobile Number Portability Regulations, 2011 (L.I. 1994) is a subsidiary
legislation to further strengthen the provisions of the Electronic Communications Act, 2008 (Act
769). The purpose of the Regulations are to remove obstacles to any mobile telephony customer
who wished to change networks but was reluctant to do so due to the inconvenience of changing
his/her number.
Status of Implementation: The implementation of this law marked two years in 2013 since its
inception in 2011. There is now system that allows mobile telephony customers to move from one
service provider to another whilst retaining their old mobile number.

1.7.   The Electronic Communications (Amendment) Act, 2009 (ACT 786)
Summary of the Law: This was an amendment to Act 775 above, to address challenges associated
with international incoming call termination (call by-pass fraud or SIM boxing), set a minimum
incoming international call termination rate as well as provide for electronic communications
monitoring mechanisms to assure quality of service as well government revenue.

Status of Implementation: The Act became effective on 31st December 2009 and has been
implemented by the NCA to date


                                                 88
1.8.    Subscriber Identity Module Registration Regulations, 2011 (L.I.2006)
Summary of the Law: The Regulations recognized the directive in existence prior to it and made
provision for the regulations to commence at the end of the period of the NCA directive. The
Regulations mandated the registration of persons who purchase or own a SIM card or a mobile
telephone from a service provider in Ghana. The essence of the law was to address challenges
associated with the use of mobile phones to commit various crimes in the country. The Regulations
also ensure that users of roaming facilities are not placed in a position different from the SIM
registration regimes of their original and existing foreign network operators.

Status of Implementation
Prior to these regulations, the SIM card registration exercise was conducted on the basis of an
NCA directive. Subsequently, the Regulations have facilitated the SIM card registration process.

1.9.    Companies (Amendment) Act, 2012 (Act 835)
Summary of the Law: This Act was passed together with Act 838 below, as an amendment to the
Companies Code and became effective on 1st March, 2012 to facilitate the electronic registration
process of companies at the registrar generals’ dept.
Status of Implementation: The Registrar Generals’ Department is currently engaged in the
electronic registration of companies.

1.10. The Electronic Transactions (Amendment) Act, 2012 (Act 838)
Summary of the Law: This Act was passed together with Act 835 above, as an amendment to the

1.11. Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843)
Summary of the Law: In recognition that every Ghanaian has the right to privacy the Data
Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843) gives meaning to Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution. The Act
was passed by Parliament in 2012 to protect the privacy of the individual and personal data by
regulating the processing of personal information as well as provide for the processes to obtain,
hold, use or disclose personal information and other related issues relating to the protection of
personal data.

Justice, Ministry of Communications, Industry Forum, the National Information Technology
Agency, the Bank of Ghana, the Statistical Service, the Executive Director and two other persons
nominated by the President one of whom is a woman. The governing body is to implement and
monitor compliance with the provisions of the Act. For its day to day administration, the Act
provides for the appointment of an Executive Director and other staff for the Commission.

Status of Implementation: The Act came into force on 16th October 2012. Consequently after due
process, the Ministry of Communications inaugurated its governing body in November 2012. The
Commission to date set up some of its structures is will be fully operational from January 2015.
The Commission has begun awareness creation targeting key stakeholders which will be
intensified in 2015. It will also launch its pilot registration of data controllers and processors before
the end of the year 2014. The Commission has also been recognised by the International
Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners as an independent data protection
authority and will be accredited at its 36th Conference in Mauritius in October 2014.

1.12, The Broadcasting Bill:
The purpose of the Bill is to provide comprehensive legislation on broadcasting services regulated
by the National Media Commission in a manner consistent with the Constitution. The Bill also
establishes the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation as a public broadcasting service in accordance
with the Constitution and repeals the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Act, 1968 (NLCD. 226)
which in certain respects is no longer appropriate.

As a result of the new Constitutional dispensation, the broadcasting landscape has within the last
decade or so, undergone radical but haphazard transformation. Today about two hundred and fifty
broadcasting frequency authorisations have been granted for FM radio stations across the country.
Of these, one is a state-owned broadcasting service with fifteen regional FM stations. According
to the National Communications Authority, it has granted more than thirty (30) authorisations for
community radio and one hundred and seventy for private commercial radio stations. There are
also twenty (20) authorisations for private free-to-air commercial television stations in addition to
the state-owned television station and seven pay television services. This development has
introduced a refreshing pluralism onto our mass media landscape and opened up access to new and
diverse voices that have promoted democracy and participation in governance and development.

The paradox however, has been that legislation has lagged behind these new developments on the
media landscape. The only legislation that relates to broadcasting are the Ghana Broadcasting
Corporation Act, 1968 (NLCD 226), National Media Commission Act, 1993 (Act 449) established
in accordance with articles 166 and 167 of the Constitution, the National Communications

                                                   90
Authority Act, 2008 (Act 769), the Electronic Communications Act 2008 (Act 775) and subsidiary
legislation enacted under these laws. As a result, the country does not have clear, transparent and
uniformly applied legal criteria for the grant of broadcasting authorisations. This lends the process
to arbitrariness and patronage. At the same time, the regulatory overview of the content of
programmes is virtually non-existent. This exposes the public and children in particular, to non-
edifying and sometimes, harmful programmes. Furthermore, some sections of the media have on
occasions carried inflammatory presentations with the potential to incite one section of the society
against the other.

In response to this drawback, the Broadcasting Bill was developed in collaboration with the
Ministry of Information. In March 2014, the Ministry of Information completed its stakeholder
consultations and has subsequently forwarded recommendations made to the Attorney-General for
incorporation into the Bill. Subsequent to the merging of the Ministry of Communications with
the Ministry of Information, the stakeholder recommendations are being reviewed and will be
submitted to Cabinet before the end of 2014 for approval and subsequent laying in Parliament.

The Broadcasting Bill articulates the fundamental values, principles and objectives of broadcasting.
The Bill classifies the types of broadcasting systems and articulates their responsibilities and
prerogatives. In addition, the Broadcasting Bill is intended to be fully alive to the world of rapidly
changing communications technology and its import for broadcasting. It also seeks to promote
the competitive growth of local broadcasting organizations.

The Bill makes adherence to the Copyright Act, 2005 (Act 690) a pre-requisite for the broadcasting
services and the National Media Commission is to ensure that service providers comply with the
Copyright Act. Under section 5 (c) of the Copyright Act, public performance, broadcasting and
communication of an author’s work to the public without authorisation of the owner, is an
actionable right infringement. Regulation 35 of the Copyright Regulations 2010 (L.I. 1962) makes
it mandatory for broadcasters and other users to secure a performance licence prior to the
performance in public of a copyright work. The Bill makes provision for the migration from
analogue television transmission to digital television broadcasting.

The Bill introduces a local content requirement that a percentage of airtime be devoted to
promoting Ghanaian culture and creative works. This is in order, as stated in clause 4 (b) of the
Bill “to safeguard, strengthen and enrich the cultural, political, social and economic fabric of
Ghanaian society “and clause 4 (c) (i) “to promote national identity and the national culture and
languages of the country”.

The Bill provides for the meaning, types and regulation of broadcasting. The types of broadcasting
provided for, are public service broadcasting, commercial broadcasting, and community
broadcasting. The Bill also provides for signal distribution and multi-channel distribution,
broadcast authorisation, programming and broadcasting standards as well as funding.

The Bill is in two parts. Part One is on the broadcasting sector as a whole and has provisions on
the three categories of broadcasting. Part Two is specifically on the Ghana Broadcasting
Corporation. The two parts have been brought together to consolidate the major legislation on the
broadcasting sector.

                    Annex 12: Additional Information on PPP Activities

The project design was strategic in using PPPs in e-government to expand opportunities for the
private sector while at the same time reducing public investments on e-government, overcoming
lack of relevant skills in government, and achieving faster roll out of e-government initiatives.
The PPP for the Ghana Revenue Authority was innovative in the way it was structured - as a
Design, Finance, Build, Operate, and Transfer (DFBOT) partnership between private and public
partners to improve the tax collection processes and expand the tax base. The contract
guaranteed about 33 percent payment (US$20 million) of the total contract price of US$60
million to the contractor from the project, with the remaining 66 percent contribution coming
from the private sector’s own resources and reimbursed based on performance. The contract
arrangement was for 5-7 years including the development and implementation of the application
under the DFBOT arrangement. Not only would the application be developed, but there was a
strong incentive for the contractor to improve tax compliance and collection. These activities
sent signals to the private sector that the GoG was committed to ICT as a main driver of the
national economy. The project design mitigated risks of using PPPs by using the Policy
Guidelines for the Implementation of Public Private Partnerships in Ghana based and through
extensive consultations between the Ministry of Communications and the private sector.

Should the private partner fail to perform any of the Design, Build or Operate functions, it would
jeopardize its investment. Hence the private partner would have the motivation to come forward
with the optimum design of the system that will provide for additional efficiencies and revenues.
Since reimbursement is key, the private partner would have a strong incentive to design a system
that indeed delivers project outcomes. In the end, eGhana was successful in using PPPs to
produce important applications for the Ghana Revenue Authority and the Register General’s
Department. This partnership has been key to improving the efficiency and transparency of
government services (revenue collection and business registration), which was a component of
the PDO. PPP implementation was challenging, balancing the interests of a number of
stakeholders and private contractors, along with the Government agencies’ need to ensure that
public interest was protected in the transactions, (while at the same time packaging the
transaction in such a way to attract potential investors). Thus, the PPP required frequent in-depth
consultations. The PPP is a 5-7 year engagement. The applications have been developed – the
GRA (TRIPs) and RGD (e-Register) successfully launched in November 2013 and April 2015,
respectively.

Four main unanticipated risks affecting PPP. First, contractor issues surrounding an intellectual
property dispute led to a one-year delay. To resolve the issue, the lead contractor, GCNet, was
forced to buy out the subcontractor and redevelop a portal from scratch.. The second
unanticipated risk was the decision of the GOg to consolidate all the revenue agencies (IRS,
VAT, CEPS, RAGB) in December 2009, in accordance with a new Ghana Revenue Authority
Act 2009, Act 791. This meant a reconfiguring of the systems design for the GRA which had
already been developed for the separate revenue agencies. The third risk was with the
mechanism for the repayment of the private partner. Under the contract signed between the
private and public partners, the private partner would receive payments for delivered system
goods and services from two sources: (i) funds provided from the World Bank Credit for this
project up to US$20 million; and (ii) a Special Repayment Escrow Account (SREA) to be

                                                95
established by the Government of Ghana and funded by depositing 85 percent of the incremental
revenues above the previous five year trend line in this SREA for the exclusive purpose of
making payments due to the Supplier. There has been challenges opening this SREA account
because the GoG informed the private partner that only parliament could authorize payments out
of a Government Consolidated Account. The two parties have been working out new
mechanisms for reimbursement of private partner’s investment. The fourth issue was an external
factor that arose from the 2009-2010 economic crisis which struck when the government failed
to attract a suitable partner in a first bid and had to undergo a second bidding process. The
Government requested that the World Bank Contribution to the e-government PPP Project
(payment to the private sector) be increased from US$10 million to US$20 million.

The reasons articulated by the client for this increase were as follows:
a. The case study undertaken at project appraisal in 2006 estimated the total investment cost
   for only one MDA (IRS) in the order of US$20 million. The estimated Government
   contribution was expected to be 50 percent (i.e., US$10 million). New estimates provided by
   the Consultants hired for more detailed feasibility studies put the investment cost at US$40-
   50 million (for 5 MDAs). The range of bid prices received during the initial bid process was
   indeed between US$40-50 million.
b. With the ongoing global financial crisis, an increase from US$10 million to US$20 million
   would reduce some of the difficulties in access to finance by private partners.
