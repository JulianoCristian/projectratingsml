                         Association of Software and IT Services Companies (GASSCOM), has resulted in registration and sustained membership of over 40 ICT SMEs in the Association – from 5 in 2006,
                         and establishment of several International BPO companies in Ghana. There has been an increase in the number of jobs from 2200 to about 7500. Additional key developments
                         include: i) a major call center operator (Teletech) which has increased seats from 300 to 500, ii) Tech Mahindra which has taken over the Bharti Airtel Assets in Ghana and
                         outsourced its payroll system to Infonaligy, a GASSCOM member, iii) Comviva which has set up office and is supporting Bharti Airtel and MTN with Value added services, and iv)

                         Aegis, Wipro, APAC, and Sutherland in final stages of negotiation to locate in Ghana. The continuous reduction in the price of wholesale bandwidth over the last five years from US
                         $5,000 per mbps per month to US$750 per mbps per month (and continuing to fall), coupled with increased redundancy resulting from multiple submarine cables, is also making the
                         BPO industry more competitive and attractive. Further reductions in bandwidth prices and the completion of the construction of the BPO Center will go a long way to making Ghana a
                         destination of choice for both domestic and international BPO/ITES business.

                         Significant progress has also been registered on the implementation of the first e-Govt PPP for electronic applications for revenue agencies in Ghana despite some initial delays
                         owing primarily to new institutional arrangements for the Revenue Agencies. These initial delays have resulted in approximately one year delay in completion and acceptance of the
                         egovt PPP solution. Progress includes: i) completion of the RGD applications (Registration of Businesses, Marriages, Properties and Estates) which went live in December 2011; ii)
                         deployment of the Tax payer registration module of TRIPS (Total Revenue Integrated Processing System) in the 12 most strategic offices of GRA; iii) Delivery of additional modules
                         including Refunds, Exemptions Application Process, Case Management, Debt Management; iv) launch of e-services program, and continued testing of selected online services; v)
                         completion of a fully functional Help Desk; and vi) training of about 2,460 of Ghana Revenue Authority staff on computer literacy and office applications, and close to 500 on TRIPS
                         and GeReg Applications, PRINCE 2 Project Management, Help Desk Boot Camp, and ISO27001. Preparatory work for 4 additional e-govt applications (e-justice, e-parliament, e-
                         procurement, e-immigration) are well advanced

                         Although implementation progress on the GIFMIS component was moderately satisfactory due to slow implementation of some elements of the PFM related reforms against two of its
                         core sub-components (PFM Business Processes and Control Systems as well as Project /Change Management), measurable progress has been achieved in the delivery of the
                         systems for budget execution across MDAs in Accra. Virtually all MDAs in Accra have commenced the implementation of a systems-based General Ledger and 'procure to pay' in
                         transacting government expenditures under the Consolidated Fund. Key achievements include installation of the technology infrastructure for implementation of the GIFMIS including
                         the servers/ work stations/WAN/LAN systems, upgrade of the application software to the latest version v. 12.1.3, and training of MDA staff to implement the system for their
                         expenditure (consolidated fund) management and control. In addition, design of systems interfaces between the GIFMIS Cash Management Module and the BoG using SWIFT and
                         automated bank reconciliation is still in progress, and transition planning for the use of a Treasury Single Account for all public funds, apart from only the consolidated fund, remains
                         part of the agenda for reform during the life of the project. Audit of the Payroll system has been completed and the outcome of that will feed into the final design and implementation
                         of a payroll upgrade that caters to the contro l weaknesses currently inherent in IPPD2.
