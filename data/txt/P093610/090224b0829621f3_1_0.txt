Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This ISR reflects the discussions of technical suprevision mission for the original eGhana held in October 2014. The task team reviewed implementation
 progress to date against targets under the Project Appraisal Document and Additional Financing Project Paper, assessd project management,
 instituitonal fiduciary and Monitoring and Evaluation. Also the team discussed with MOC and the current project coordination team the preparation of the
 Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
 The GIFMIS (Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System) component carried out a seperate mission in early December 2014.

 [Original eGhana Project]
 Implementation progress and the likelihood of achieving the developmental objectives of the eGhana Project continue to be is
 Satisfactory. Almost 98 % of the original eGhana project balance is disbursed. Almost all key performance indicators under the
 original eGhana project have already been achieved. Since the last supervision mission in May 2014, The project demonstrated
 significant progress regarding automation of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) and the Registrar General's Department (RGD)
 and the recent launch of the portal which will allow citizens to file taxes online and increase the tax base, also the construction of
 the Business Process outsourcing (BPO) Center, Regional Innovation Centers and Business Incubation Center, which will drive
 the growth of the IT industry in Ghana.
 A follow-up survey data collection was conducted in late-November to early December 2014 It shows very positive project results,
 for example, 8700 new job creation in the ICT/ITES sector (beyond the 7000 project-end target, 600% drop in E1 price recorded
 compared to the baseline data (US$10000 to US$1200),and 78% MDAs satisfaction rate for the MOC's project coordination.
 As the project closes on December 31, 2014, the project coordination team and the task team both stay in close supervision to
 make sure the full achievement of the Project Development Objectives.
 [GFMIS component]
 The project will close on December 31, 2014, and the final supervision mission has rated overall achievement of project development objectives and
 implementation progress as ‘satisfactory,’ noting that several original targets had been exceeded. The mission also identified a number of areas where
 continuing development of the system and PFM processes are required, and these provide a basis for a follow-on support program.
 The GIFMIS platform has given the Government a much stronger technical capability and set of tools to coordinate budget and financial control
 processes, and efficient management of all GoG bank balances is becoming possible through the Treasury Single Account now being established. All
 spending unit sites will be connected to P2P by end-December 2014, exceeding original targets. An interface with the BoG SWIFT has been established
 and extended to all MDAs. The GIFMIS system has also been successfully piloted in seven MMDAs. These are significant achievements that provide a
 much stronger technical basis for addressing Ghana’s fiscal policy and financial management challenges and for undertaking the broader program of
 reform proposed under the GoG’s PFM Reform Strategy currently being developed.
 The mission, in close consultation and in general agreement with the administration, identified areas where PFM processes need to be strengthened to
 realize the full potential of GIFMIS. Continuing reforms at the policy level will remain crucial to supporting the orderly use and implementation of the
 tools provided under the GIFMIS. For the immediate future, a very high priority should be given to establishing budget credibility by progressively
 building a firm medium term fiscal framework (MTFF) and expenditure framework (MTEF). These policies and processes need to be supported by much
 tighter warrant control in line with a realistic forecast of available cash. Strengthening the operations of the current Cash Management Committee and
 its Working Group, and extending the TSA are seen to be crucial to long-term success. Continuing rollout of GIFMIS and HRMIS are needed to
 complete the IT foundation already established, with particular emphasis on completion of the core HRMIS and payroll strengthening. Operationalization
 of GIFMIS interfaces with government systems for tax revenue, customs, and nontax revenue are also necessary for overall coverage and reliability. It
 is essential that an integrated payroll, including GES, be established on a single Oracle platform to ensure the integrity of the payroll system. Support to
 MMDAs is an important complement to ongoing work on local government capacity support, and will be supported by GIFMIS rollout to around 216
 MMDAs.
 The project management component of the project has improved significantly, although any follow-on support operation will require a more
 strengthened accountability framework. Continuation of the M&E process that has been established in GIFMIS should play an important role in
 linking any proposed new project to Ghana’s PFM Reform Strategy.

         Please note that the baseline data (70% as mentioned in PAD) is due to high women concentration in the begining of ICT/ITES industry in
         Ghana. As the sector size grows over time, the gender ratio turned to neutralized.
         Note: The final results (54%) is consistent with female peroject beneficiaries (52.4% of total project beneficiaries are women.)

         Comments
         Please note that when this inidcator was selected, it was a core sector indicator. As of December 2014, this idnicator is no longer core
         sector indicator. The team decided to put the full details of this indicator in the comment section, as it provides full picture of the
         measurement.
         In the eGhana project, the project end target for this indicator was set as 25% increase over the baseline user satisfaction rate with
         government services taken up for electronic delivery. Thus the project end target was calculated as 68% (=43% baseline + 25% increase).
         In December 2014, the follow-up survey was conducted, and the user satisfaction rate for GRA e-services was 69%, which achived beyond
         the project end target.

         Systems-based reports will be feasible only when IGFs and donor funds plus general government SFs are linked to the system. A template for
         such reports will define data and system requirements

               600% drop in prrice recorded compared to the baseline values. Prices are very competitive in comparison with the basket for the
               competitors; Egypt-US$3000, Nigeria-US$3500 and South Africa US$2000.
               Price of bandwidth is going down following the entry into the market of other competitors and dialogue between MoC and Service Providers,
               in particular earlier negotiation to lower price of bandwidth for ITES Association members.

               Please note that this indicator only shows the number of people trained and successfully emplyed in ITES industry. According to the tracer
               study, 71.1% of BPO agents trained are employed in total. it implies 17.8 % of trained agents are employed by non-ITES industries, as
               some of the BPO training curriculum (see below) was versatile to many different business functions or activities in different sectors (not
               limited to ITES industry).
               BPO Agent Training:
               It was programmed at appraisal to develop ITES skills set standards and curriculum for the BPO-ITES industry in an effort to realize its
               talent potential, and identify skill gaps in the BPO-ITES industry. Further to a contractual agreement with Messrs NIIT of USA, the BPO-
               ITES Curriculum was designed on the framework of Global Skill Set Standards. The curriculum also addressed the niche areas and market
               segments identified in the Hewitt Competitiveness Study Report 2006. The BPO-ITES Curriculum for Ghana includes the design for a high
               priority basic employability training necessary for working in the BPO-ITES sector in Ghana. With basic employability as a pre-requisite, the
               curriculum focuses on the following 6 niche areas for Ghana:
               12.        Customer Interaction
               13.        Data Entry and processing

               realistic budget ceilings. PFM reforms required.
