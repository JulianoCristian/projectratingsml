                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation support missions were carried out for the GIFMIS sub-component- Additional Financing (January 23 – February 2, 2012) and eGhana core activities (April 10-18,
                         2012). Progress towards achievement of the PDO continues to be Satisfactory. Key developments in the IT Enabled Services Industry include the establishment of a 300 seat call
                         center by TeleTech, with 2 additional international companies (Aegis and Tech Mahindra) at very advanced stages of contract discussions; an increase in the number of jobs from
                         2200 to about 7000; completion of standards, curriculum and training materials for BPO agents and training institutions which will be used for the training of the first 500 agents

                         anticipated to commence in May, 2012 to be followed by a training of selected training institutions (training of trainers program); and completion of the detailed Architectural Design
                         for the BPO Center which is expected to provide grade A facilities to BPO companies. The combined impact of local and international investment promotion activities, as well as more
                         aggressive outreach by the Ghana Association of Software and IT Services Companies (GASSCOM), has resulted in registration of over 40 ICT SMEs in the IT Association – from 5
                         in 2006; The continuous reduction in the price of wholesale bandwidth over the last five years from US$5,000/mbps/month to US$1000/mbps/month (and continuing to fall), coupled

                         with increased redundancy as a result of the multiple submarine cables landing in Ghana, is also making the BPO industry more competitive and attractive.

                         Significant progress has also been registered on the implementation of the first e-Govt PPP for electronic applications for revenue agencies in Ghana despite some initial delays
                         owing primarily to new institutional arrangements for the Revenue Agencies. These initial delays are likely to result in a one year delay in completion and acceptance of the egovt
                         PPP solution. Progress includes the completion of: i) the applications for the Registrar General’s Department which went live December 2011; ii) Tax payer registration module of
                         TRIPS in 10 of the 11 pilot offices iii) Interim Data Center and disaster recovery sites, and ongoing testing of selected e-services; iv) training of about 2,412 of Ghana Revenue
                         Authority staff on computer literacy and office applications, and close to 500 trained on TRIPS/GeReg Applications/ISO27001. Preparatory work for 4 additional e-govt applications
                         (e-justice, e-parliament, e-procurement, e-immigration) are well advanced.

                         Significant progress has also been registered on the implementation of the GIFMIS sub-component which was included as part of Project Restructuring/Additional Financing to
                         improve public financial management, albeit with an overall delay of about one year. Key achievements include installation of the technology infrastructure for implementation of the
                         GIFMIS including the servers/ work stations/WAN/LAN systems, upgrade of the application software to the latest version v. 12.1.3, and commencement of implementation actions
                         related to General Ledger and ‘Procure to Pay’ core modules that are to be rolled out to all MDAs in Accra by July 2012. In addition, design of systems interfaces between the
                         GIFMIS Cash Management Module and the BoG using SWIFT and automated bank reconciliation is in progress.
