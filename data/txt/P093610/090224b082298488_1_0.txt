                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the discussions of parallel missions of both the eGhana core Project and GIFMIS (Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System) component carried
                         out between October 28 and November 8, 2013. The GIFMIS component was conducted together with DiFD and the Delegation of the European Union. The task teams reviewed
                         implementation progress to date against targets under the Project Appraisal Document and Additional Financing Project Paper; assessed project management, institutional, fiduciary
                         and Monitoring and Evaluation arrangements; and discussed innovative ways to begin communicating project results.

                         Implementation progress and the likelihood of achieving the developmental objectives of the eGhana Project are very Satisfactory. Disbursement rate continues to improve and
                         stands at approximately 90% for the core eGhana project and 75% for the additional financing component. Almost all the key performance indicators under the core eGhana project
                         (jobs created in the ITES sector, revenues as % of GDP, number of PPPs etc) have been met. The automation of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) and the Registrar's General's

                         Department (RGD) has been accepted by Government and related disbursement under the project has been made. Key activities which have been completed as part of the GRA
                         automation include the following: 10 GRA pilot sites have been prepared, and equipped with high-speed connectivity and computing equipment. The system will eventually be
                         deployed at 67 branch offices of GRA, including at GRA Head Quarters, Legon, Agbogbloshie, Achimota, Adabraka, Spintex, Kaneshie, Makola, GRA Tema, GRA DTRD, and Vat
                         House; training has been provided to staff on usage and literacy of information technology; TRIPS tax administration software, involving 12 modules, has been deployed at two data
                         centers; tax payer registration module has been deployed and is in use in 10 GRA sites; core tax modules have been piloted at the large tax payer office; and GRA portal has been
                         deployed and is being tested by GRA and the system auditor. Since December 2011, 200,000 or more taxpayers have registered on the TRIPs system. About 50 filing transactions
                         have been successfully completed. Operational Acceptance (OA) has been agreed between the public and private partners and was finalized in December 2013 following
                         independent and government’s own audit. The Ghana electronic registration for the Registrar General’s Department (GeReg application) is operational at the RGD head office and
                         preparations are underway to roll-out the application at the three regional sites for RGD. The GeReg provides for the electronic registration of businesses, civil marriages, and
                         properties and estates in Ghana. There has also been significant progress in the support to the IT and IT Enabled services industry, with the completion of training for the first batch
                         of master trainers and agents for the ITES (37 out of 50 master trainers; and 532 out of 2000 agents), the launch of the University connectivity program, the signing of the Business
                         incubation contract and the completion of several investment promotion activities which has increased the visibility of Ghana as destination for IT and IT enabled services business.
                         The recent approval by the Rockefeller Foundation of a grant in the amount of US$3.8 million to complement the World Bank funding for the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)
                         center is a significant achievement for the project and will contribute significantly to addressing the shortage of Grade A facilities for BPO activities in Ghana.

                         Implementation progress and the likelihood of achieving the developmental objectives of the GIFMIS component is also rated Satisfactory. GIFMIS is now in place so that it can
                         realistically be expected to make progress towards its objectives. Key progress includes: roll-out of Procure to Pay (P2P) for the Consolidated Fund (Treasury Accounts) across all
                         Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MMDAs), with on-site processing across 25 additional spending units; implementation of payroll upgrade and integration progressing
                         according to schedule; achieved readiness for implementation of phase 1 of HRMIS within schedule; achieved readiness to begin implementation of a new budget module ‘Hyperion’
                         that will be used for budget preparation during 2014 for the 2015 budget and beyond; and operationalization of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system (with SWIFT) in 16 largest
                         MDAs constitituting over 80% of consolidated fund (Treasury) expenditures. In this regard, the interface with Bank of Ghana (BoG) through EFT is considered a significant milestone
                         towards ensuring strengthened controls. In addition, GIFMIS has been rolled-out at 7 MMDAs for transacting GoG funds. The recent signing of a Loan and Fiscal Agency Agreement
                         (LFAA) between the BoG and MoF marks a critical turning point in establishing the foundation of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) and an effective cash management system based
                         on this and other elements of GIFMIS. Progress also continues in establishing clear plans for implementing Program-Based Budgeting (PBB) and a common platform for budget
                         preparation and execution, though these outcomes will be fully achieved only over the longer run.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Two key activities under the project which require urgent attention from Government are: i) the completion of the Certification program under the BPO Training sub-component, and
                         iii) the Connectivity of Selected Tertiary Institutions. The completion of these activities will make significant contribution to the achievement of the Project Development Objective.

                         To maximize the project impact, the following will require sufficient attention as the project nears closing: (i) establish ex-ante controls through GIFMIS where possible; (ii) improve
                         timeliness and coverage of transactions of funds (such as the multitude of small Internally Generated Funds, or IGFs, and statutory funds) and include these ex ante and or/ex post in
                         GIFMIS, as the case may be; (iii) extend full GIFMIS functionality to MMDAs; and (iv) strengthen the strategic framework for fiscal policy be ensuring that spending decisions are not
                         made outside the parameters agreed by Cabinet in its consideration of the annual Budget Framework Paper. Continuing progress in all these areas is essential to contribute to the
                         achievement of the objective of comprehensive management of general government spending.

                         Restructuring History
