performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: funding of activities to\n            improve the enabling environment is not usually a big sell\n            but can have an enormous impact that goes beyond project\n            development objective (PDO). Because of the fast moving\n            nature of technology and other external factors, it is\n            important to maintain some flexibility to be responsive to\n            clients. The public private partnership (PPP) model can be\n            challenging to implement, but it provides strong incentives\n            for the contractor to deliver good value. Bank processes\n            such as procurement and project approval are often too slow\n            to keep up with a rapidly developing information technology\n            (IT) sector. Embedding consultants in the project\n            implementation unit (PIU) ensure appropriate expertise, but\n            may also cause resentment from lower paid government staff\n            working alongside them."}, "docdt": "2015-06-15T00:39:01Z"}
