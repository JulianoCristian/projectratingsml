                         (May 20 - 31, 2013), and partial review of the core activities was carried out between June 4-5, 2013. Progress towards achievement of the PDO continues to be Satisfactory. A
                         more detailed Implementation support mission is planned for the core activities in September 2013.

                         For the eGhana core activities, the combined impact of local and international investment promotion activities by the ITES Secretariat, as well and continued outreach by the Ghana
                         Association of Software and IT Services Companies (GASSCOM), has resulted in registration and sustained membership of 46 ICT SMEs in the Association – from 5 in 2006, and
                         establishment of several International BPO companies in Ghana. There has been an increase in the number of jobs from 2200 to about 8900. Additional key developments include: i)
                         a major call center operator (Teletech) which has increased seats from 300 to 500, ii) Tech Mahindra which has taken over the Bharti Airtel Assets in Ghana and outsourced its

                         payroll system to Infonaligy, a GASSCOM member, iii) Comviva which has set up office and is supporting Bharti Airtel and MTN with Value added services, and iv) Aegis, Wipro,
                         APAC, and Sutherland in final stages of negotiation to locate in Ghana. The continuous reduction in the price of wholesale bandwidth over the last five years from US$5,000 per
                         mbps per month to US$750 per mbps per month (and continuing to fall), coupled with increased redundancy resulting from multiple submarine cables, is also making the BPO
                         industry more competitive and attractive. Further reductions in bandwidth prices and the completion of the construction of the BPO Center will go a long way to making Ghana a
                         destination of choice for both domestic and international BPO/ITES business. Unfortunately, however, a lack of real estate (Type A Facilities) in Ghana continues to be a major
                         bottleneck for companies wanting to relocate to Ghana. The refurbishment of government warehouses into Type A facilities (funding provided under the project) will go a long way to
                         improving the enabling environment for location of IT and IT enabled businesses in Ghana.

                         Significant progress has also been registered on the implementation of the first e-Govt PPP for electronic applications for revenue agencies in Ghana. Progress includes: Operational
                         Acceptance of the egovt PPP on June 5, 2013 including i) completion of the RGD applications (Registration of Businesses, Marriages, Properties and Estates) which went live in
                         December 2011; ii) deployment of the Tax payer registration module of TRIPS (Total Revenue Integrated Processing System) in the 12 most strategic offices of GRA; iii) Delivery of
                         additional modules including Refunds, Exemptions Application Process, Case Management, Debt Management; iv) launch of e-services program, and continued testing of selected
                         online services; v) completion of a fully functional Help Desk; and vi) training of about 2,460 of Ghana Revenue Authority staff on computer literacy and office applications, and close
                         to 500 on TRIPS and GeReg Applications, PRINCE 2 Project Management, Help Desk Boot Camp, and ISO27001. The contract for the automation of immigration services (e-
                         Immigration) was signed on January 4, 2013, while bids expected for the e-parliament program on July 18. Preparatory work for the remaining 2 additional e-govt applications (e-
                         justice, e-procurement,) are well advanced. Implementation progress is rated Satisfactory.
                         ============================================================================================================
                         Implement ation progress on, and the likelihood of achieving the developmental objectives of, the GIFMIS component is rated satisfactory, an improvement over the last ISR due
                         essentially to the significant progress made in delivering on the activities particularly under sub-component 4.1 - PFM information systems. The 'procure to pay' functionality of the
                         system that supports systems-based commitment control, has been rolled out to all MDAs in respect of transactions covering the consolidated fund of the Government. In effect,
                         budget execution across all MDAs is facilitated and expenditure control, consistent with the appropriations and fund release rules, are complied with. There is, however, a dire need to
                         make visible progress in implementing sub-component 4.2 - PFM Business Processes and Control Systems especially in the following key areas: review of the PFM legislations for
                         consistency and for increased relevance as well as enable the Controller and Accountant General's Department (CAGD) to report on all public finances rather than just on the
                         consolidated (treasury) fund; fast-tracking the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) in as much as some initial progress has been registered in the design and
                         development of a phase one strategy that aims to link the government bank accounts with the Bank of Ghana in a TSA mode for reduced borrowing costs as part of government cash
                         management; strengthening the monitoring and evaluation process; and the design of the business processes to enable the bringing in board those other funds (Internally Generated
                         Funds, Statutory Funds, and Donor Funds) into GIFMIS for the purpose of transacting all government revenues and expenditures under a uniform financial management platform.

                         Good progress has been achieved in the drive towards a full transition from a strictly activity-based, line item budgeting, to program based budgeting (PBB). Readiness has been
                         achieved in rolling out the PBB to all MDAs during the current year's preparation of the budget for 2014. Except for a number of issues that would need to be addressed to enable
                         transition to the PBB to have real value, there is commitment across government to move on this budget reform agenda with great potentials for improved outcomes in expenditure

                         Training of all staff is progressing well as this will be the real test of the sustainability of systems implementation when the project closes in about 12 months' time. Al so, there is
                         good traction in the progress of upgrading the payroll system to a newer Oracle version so as to maintain a uniform platform, with the financials suite, and thus support the integrity of
                         the payroll especially with the linkage of personnel with their respective biometric data. To further enhance the integrity of the payroll and reduce the potentials for ghost workers, an
                         Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS )is being initiated (now at procurement stage) that will ensure that only those personnel in active service in government
                         can feature in the payroll and that the CAGD's responsibilities will be limited for internal control purposes to payment of salaries rather than both 'validation and payment' as is
                         currently the case.

                         Extending the GIFMIS to Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) has started with a pilot of 7 MDAs almost completed. The plan is well in place to extend the roll-
                         out to the remaining MMDAs by the closure of the project. This will provide the requisite assurance for, and facilitate systems-generated consolidated fiscal operations reporting of,

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The achievement of the Operational Acceptance for the largest e-govt PPP for Ghana Revenue Authority and Registrar General’s Department on June 5, 2013 is expected to make
                         significant contribution to improving tax collection, and business registration in the country. Two key activities under the project which require urgent attention from Government are: i)
                         the Connectivity of Selected Tertiary Institutions and ii) the development of a Grade A Facility to promote business development in the IT and IT enabled sector. The completion of
                         these activities will make significant contribution to the achievement of the Project Development Objective.
                         =============================================================================================================
                         Under GIFMIS, the completion of the legislative review of PFM laws and regulations for improved consistency with the needed revisions in the business processes for PFM is critical;
                         equally, the bringing on board all government finances on GIFMIS as well as transition to a full Treasury Single Account for all government funds will be needed to enable fuller
                         reporting on and comprehension of all government fund sources and uses and, at the same time, reduce the cost of domestic borrowing for the GoG.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
