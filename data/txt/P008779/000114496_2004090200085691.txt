      Re:   Loan No. 3481 ROM
            (Structural Adjustment Loan)
            Amendment
Excellency:
      We refer to the Loan Agreement between Romania and
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank),
dated June 2, 1992 for the above mentioned Project, and to our
previous discussions on the subject of amending said Loan Agreement
to increase the limit for withdrawals thereunder on the basis of
statements of expenditure.  We are pleased to inform you that the
Bank agrees to increase such limit by amending paragraph 3 of
Schedule 1 to said Loan Agreement to read as follows:
            "Withdrawals for expenditures under contracts for the
      procurement of petroleum products estimated to cost less than
      $1,000,000 and for other goods estimated to cost less than
      $5,000,000 may be required by the Bank upon the basis of
      statements of expenditure under such terms and conditions as
      the Bank shall specify."
      Please confirm your agreement, on behalf of Romania, with the
foregoing by signing, dating and returning to us the form of
confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter.
                                          Very truly yours,
                                    /s/   Michael H. Wiehen
