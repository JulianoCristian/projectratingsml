effective pricing system for fertilizer. The fertilizer\n            imports portion of the Second Fertilizer Imports Project\n            will be administered by the Bangladesh Agricultural\n            Development Corporation. The fertilizer raw materials\n            portion of the credit will be administered initially by the\n            Bangladesh Chemicals Industry Corporation and later by a\n            successor company to be established to operate the\n            Chittagong TSP factory. The allocation of funds between\n            finished fertilizer and fertilizer raw materials will be\n            performed by the External Resources Division of the Ministry\n            of Finance. A ministerial level fertilizer coordinating\n            committee has been established to improve the planning for\n            fertilizer procurement and distribution. There is a risk\n            that fertilizer consumption could be reduced below expected\n            levels (e.g. due to flooding or drought reducing farmer\n            demand). In such circumstances, import arrivals will be\n            rephased to assist in meeting FY82 requirements."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
