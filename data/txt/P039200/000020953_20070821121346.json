Since project approval in October 1999,\n            implementation was hampered by two main events. First, there\n            was delay in project effectiveness. The project was\n            originally scheduled to become effective in January 2000 but\n            did not become effective until February 2001. Second, not\n            long after project effectiveness, in May 2001 the Government\n            declared a major energy supply crisis which significantly\n            dampened the incentives for distribution companies to\n            execute the proposed project activities. There are two main\n            lessons from the project that should be used in subsequent\n            World Bank energy efficiency projects. (1) Demand-side\n            management (DSM) programs can be successful only if the\n            underlying incentives of the regulatory framework are in\n            place and correct. (2) The rationing program that was put in\n            place in 2002 to deal with severe cuts in electricity supply\n            was effective in reducing consumption, but also resulted in\n            large financial losses to the distribution utilities that\n            have been being made up through utility bills since the crisis."}, "docdt": "2007-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
