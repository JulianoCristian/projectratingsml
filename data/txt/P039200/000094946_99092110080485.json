at\n            increasing the efficiency of energy production and use in\n            Brazil. The first phase is to demonstrate cost-effective\n            measures in the electricity sub-sector through load\n            management and targeted peak period reductions so as to\n            better utilize existing facilities; demonstrate the same to\n            reduce energy use in public, residential, commercial, and\n            industrial facilities; enhance standards and labeling\n            programs; and set up a market-based support structure for\n            energy service companies. Project components will consist of\n            Demonstration Projects as follows: 1) Proper electricity\n            price signals and service options will target selected\n            electricity energy markets to test and demonstrate\n            innovative demand charge and time-of-day-tariffs, load\n            demand limiters, options in service conditions, and other\n            commercial actions. 2) Delivery mechanisms for dissemination\n            of emerging technologies will test delivery mechanisms to\n            increase the use of more efficient appliances, equipment,\n            and operational practices."}, "docdt": "1999-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
