RUBBER PROJECT
Z5DIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
sorX2wer:      India, Acting by its President
Pri.ect        The Rubber Board under the Ministry of Commerce;
BAnafiniariAs: Rubber Growers and Rubber Processors
Amount:        IDA Credit of SDR 66.4 million (US$92.0 million equivalent)
maimns:        IDA: Standard, with 35 years maturity.
On-lending     GOT to NARARD: Repayment of the principal in a lump sum at
2Taxmr:        the end of 15 years at an interest rate of 7% per annum, with
GOI bearing the foreign exchange risk.
NBABRD to_Partiipating Banks (PaBs:  Repayment over a maximum
of 15 years, includir- a maximum of 7 years grace period
providing a margin to -he PB of 4.5 - 6.5% per annum for a
maximum of 95% of sub-loans made to sub-borrowers.
Pss to Suh-horrowers:  Repayment over a maximum of 15 J-iar3,
including a 3 year grace period for the processing component
and 7/8 years for the planting component.   The prevailing
interest rates are 15-19% as per Reserve Bank of India's
guidelines depending on the size and type of loan.
Project        The project would finance over a 5-year period an expansion
9anLLMtion:   and rehabilitation phase of India's rubber subsector.  It would
include assistance for new plantings, replantings and
processing of rubber and rubber wood.   The project would
strengthen RB's research, extension and training activities and
support its on-go4ng program to enhance productivity of mature
rubber through improved management of inputs.   Development
programs for women and tribal beneficiaries and NGO
participation would be supported.   The project would benefit
about 150,000 rubber growers and rubber processors and create
about 2,800 jobs in off-farm activities.
B±aka:         No major implementation risks are associated with the project.
The rubber Industry is well established, and RB is a strong
organization with competent staff to implement the project.
The robust internal demand would ensure that there is a ready
market for natural rubber, any marginal supply may be exported
under GOI's new trade policy. As with all commodity projects,
the volatility of the international prices would affect the
economic viability of the project. However, price sensitivity
analyses undertaken reflect that the project is still viable.
The risk associated with loans made to smallholders are minimal
in the traditional areas, as is evidenced from past recoveries
of over 90%.   However,  in Tripura, the PBs have not had
sufficient experience of providing loans to rubber
smallholders, which would require greater technical support by
RB and close monitoring during project supervision.  There is
potential for the deterioration in the political situation in
Tripura which could hamper the implementation of the project in
that state. However, the situation is now stable.

I.   JUQTOR BACKGROUND
AQ;g'ulture in the National Economy
1.1      India's GDP grew at about 3% per annum in the 1950s and 1960s,
accelerating to 4.5% in the 1980s due to rapid growth in manufacturing and
se,-vices. Agricultural growth has averaged 2.4% per annum over the last two
decades,  slightly ahead of the population growth rate of 2.2%.   Despite
comparatively modest growth, agriculture remains important for the Iildian
economy.  Agriculture's share of GDP (33%) masks the extent to which India's
population of about 810 million rely on the sector.   About 75% of India's
people live in rural areas, and 64% are directly employed in agriculture.
These workers tend to be pocr (78% of India's poor are in rural areas) and
female (one-third of the agricultural labor force are women, and agriculture
remains the main source of employment for rural women).  Per capita income
grew to US$350 by 1990, but there has been only limited improvement in the
living standards of the poor, 280 million of whom live below the poverty line,
Agricultural exports account tor less than 18% of total exports, and have been
declining.
Development Priorities
1.2      India has a land area of 3.27 million km2, of which about half (150
million ha) is cultivable and about 19% is under some form of irrigation.
Agricultural development plans of the Government of India (GOI) and State
governments have promoted food production with the aim of achieving food
security, augmenting agricultural exports, alleviating poverty, and creating
employment, especially in rural areas.   Key elements of government strategy
have been the expansion of irrigation, improved technical packages (high-
yielding varieties, Zertilizers and plant protection chemicals), and
strengthened institutions and services (extension, research, seed production,
credit, and marketing). As a result of these efforts, the annual growth rate
in food grain production over the last 15-20 years has averaged 2.7%, and
India has become self-sufficient in grains.   High population densities and
limited land supplies mean that future growth must depend largely on
productivity gains through intensifying irrigated agriculture, improving
rainfed farming and agricultural diversificatioL. Thus, GOI's long-term focus
has shifted to stimulating agricultural growth and ensuring sustainable
development, through improved water use efficiency, development of rainfed
agriculture, natural resource conservation, environmental protection, and
further strengthening of public agricultural support services.   Investment
programs to address these elements will be receiving high priority in the
Eighth Five-Year Plan.
The Rubber Subsector
1.3      overvieX.  The Indian rubber industry is dominated by the private
sector, with an important supporting role played by the central government
agencies.   The country is the world's fourth largest producer of natural
rubber with about 6% of world production.   The area under rubber is now
440,000 ha, of which 310,000 ha are being tapped.   Indian rubber production
grew 7% per year during the 1980s and reached 330,000 tons in FY91,  an
increase of 11% over FY90. Yields average about 1,000 kg per tapped hectare,
which compares favorably with other major producers.  Traditionally, rubber
has been cultivated almost entirely in South India, and Kerala state alone
still accounts for over 90% of total Indian production. Rubber is primarily a
smallholder crop and the average size of a rubber smallholding is less than



one ha. The smallholders now account for 80% of total rubber production. An
estimated 4)0,000 people are engaged in activities related to rubber
production,. including 250,000 employed laborers.   Rubber also generates a
great deal of off-farm employment.   The organized rubber products sector
(tires, footwear) emoloys 125,000 people.   In the unotganized sector, there
are more than 4,000 small-scale units producing rubber ptoducts and employing
150,000 people, mosuly in rural areas; 2,500 of these units are very small,
consuming less than 1C tons of n tural rubber per year.
1.4      In addition, natural rubber cultivation produces several commercial
by-products:   rubber honey, rtlbber seed oil and rubber wood.   2,500 tons of
honey, 46% of India's total honey production, is produced on rubber holeings.
The retail value of India's current rubber honcy production is US$5.6 million
per year.  Rubber seed oil i' a minor source of non-edible oil in India used
mostly in the m3nufa^-ture of soap and paint. Annual production of rubber seed
oil is 4,000 tons, worth about US$1.2 million.  Old rubber trees felled for
replanting are an increasingly important source of fuel wood and lumber. One
ha of old rubber can produce 60 cu m of branch wood for fuel and 100 cu m of
lumber. Most of the lumber is used for packing cases and other low quality
products.    however,  with appropriate  processing,  rubber  lumber can be
converted into a high quality semi-hard wood, and Kerala's rubber furnituxe
industry is rapidly growing.   Annual consumption of rubber lumber is 1.2
million cu m, worth about US$240 million.
1.5      India has imported an average of 45,000 tons of natural rubber per
year ver the past 5 years until 1990/91 (12% of consumption; worth about
US$36 million per year in 1990 prices). In addition, India's annual imports
of synthetic rubber have averaged 35,000 tons (worth about USS42 million p.a.
in 1990 prices).  However, in 1991-92 only 14,000 tons of natural rubber was
imported, and India is fast becoming self sufficient. Indian consumption has
grown at an average of 8.6% per year, respectively, during the last 5 years.
At the same time, the rubber subsector has also been a substantial earner of
foreign exchange through export of manufactured rubber goods, mostly tires,
valued at nearly US$102 million in 1990-91.
1.6      The Rubber floard.  The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) of GOI has overall
responsibility for general policy, planning and development of the sector. It
operates largely through the Rubber Board (RB) with its headquarters in
Kottayam, Kerala.   The key features of RB and its operations are summarized
here with more detailed discussion in Annex 2.
1.7      RB was established by the Rubber Act in 1947.   Its main functions
include planning preparation and implementation of rubber plantation
development schemes, research, extension and training, support to processing
and marketing of smallholder rubber, collection of cess and compilation of
statistics.   RB,  with a staff strength of 1970 personnel,  is presently
organized into  six Departments:   Administration  (16% of staff), Rubber
Production (58% of staff), Rubber Research (20% of staff), Rubber Processing
(4% of staff), Finance & Accounts (4% of staff), and Training. In addition it
includes a Statistics and Planning Division, a Marketing Division, an Internal
Audit Unit and a vigilance wing.   About 51% of "he total staff are at the
headquarters and the remaining in field offices. Field organization includes
eight sub/liaison offices, four zonal offices, 34 regional offices, 160 field
offices, 20 regional nurseries, 35 Tappers' Training Schools and two Nucleus
Rubber Estate and Training Centers (NRETC), and regional research stations.
The regional offices and their field units, operating under the Rubber
Production Department, are the main contact points between the growers and RB.



3-
The current organization of RB at the headquarters and in regions is given in
Annex 2, Charts l(ai and l(b).
1.8      As part  of its promotional activities,  RB has  implemented two
categories of schemes. The first, Rubber Plantation Development Schemes which
are approved by GOI offers financial assistance and technical advice.  The
second, smaller schemes, approved by chairman of RB with a ceiling of Rs. 2
million per program, cover financial assistance for a variety of items
including agricultural inputs.  More recently, to reach a greater proportion
of increasing numbers of smallholders, RB has promoted: the establishment of
Rubber Producer Societies (RPSs) each with around 150-200 miembers. At present
there are nearly 1,2V0 RPSs, mostly concentrated in Kerala. They are proving
to be more effective in improving smallholder production, processing and
marketing activities.  RB has also set up a dozen companies under jc;nt share
participation with RPS in which it holds the controlling shares.            andle
processing and marketing while the remaining six mainly deal in ;.rading
rubber. More information on RPSs is given in Annex 8.
1.9      As  required by the Rubber  Act,  RB collects  cess  from rubber
manufacturern and credits the proceeds to the consolidated fund of India,
which in turn, is utilized to finance its expenditure.  For many years after
commencement of the replanting program in 1957, cess collections exceeded
total expenditure of the Board and sizeable reserves were accumulated.
However, due to considerable expansion of the rubber development programs,
cess collections have not kept pace with expenditures, resulting in deficits
which are covered by Government out of general revenue. GOI is increasing the
cess to Rs.1.00/kg, a 100% rise over the present level.  When effective, the
the increased rate of cess would finance nearly 90% of RB's expenditures.
1.10     RB h-s responded well to changing needs and grown into a successful
organization.   Its performance, whether measured in terms of achievement in
area  planted to  rubber,  level  of productivity gains  or  in terms  of
administrative efficiency, compares favorably to tree crop agencies in other
countries.   RB's programs have enabled some 661,000 units to establish and
improve their rubber production, increasing yields three fold from 365 kg to
1,075 kg/ha over the past 30 years.   The cost of administering planting
payments is comparatively low in relation to cost of administration of similar
programs in other countries - 6.4% as against 7% in Sri Lanka and 21% in
Thailand.
1.11     Despite its achievements, RB has potential to improve its performance
further by (a) divesting commercial activities like input supply; (b)
restructuring and streamlining operations of regional offices to provide
improved extension service; (c) speeding operation and administration of field
operators through computerization at regional offices and central office; (d)
strengthening planning and monitoring arrangements; and (e) phasing out
subsidies to achieve self-financing.
1.12     Cr      Institutians. Rubber development has been financed by 23
commercial, cooperative and private banks supported by assistance from the
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Bank (NABARD) refinancing
scheme. The lead banks are Canara Bank (commerical), State Bank of Travancore
(commercial and subsidiary of the State Bank of India), Federal Bank (private)
and the Land Development Bank (commercial). NABARD provides 70% refinancing
for nationalized commerical banks and private commerical banks and 85%
refinancing for cooperative banks. The first large scale NABARD refinancing
scheme for rubber began in 1979 with the second phase in 1984/85.  The rubber



-4-
lending activities of PBs have performed well with loan recoveries to date
estimated to be over 90%.   The PBs c..nsider rubber lending to form a
profitable part of their operations. The terms and conditions for providing
assistance by PBs to sub-bor'.ower3 are based on strict adherence by
smallholders to Rubber Board's technological package for rubber cultivation.
Certification by the RB is provided in support of sach installment of the
loan.  In Kerala State the total area under rubber financed by PBs waa 37,547
ha with loans amounting to Rs 735 million up to March 1991.   All PBs and
NABARD maintain separate accounts for rubber lending at their branches and
hence agreed, under the project, to keep separate accounts to reflect
recoveries on rubber loans.
1.13     The Bank is presently discussing with GOI broad based financial
sector reforms in India. In view of the successful performance of the rubber
sector, and the efficient administrative arrangements under the project (see
para 1.12 and Annex 6), the proposed arrangements are not expected to impact
adversely on the ongoing dialogue. In fact, the rubber portfolios of the PBs
are expected to strengthen the overall performance of these institutions
pending more comprehensive sectorial reforms.   Further, in April 1992 RBI
announced improved credit policy measures for all banks, including: improved
capital adequacy norms; adequate provision for bad debts; automatic
provisioning guidelines; specified rules for income generation; new guidelines
for bank's accounting to improve the accurancy and transparency of bank's
financial statements; and increased interest rates.
1.14     Private           Rubber production and processing continue to remain
essentia. .y private sector operations.  Rubber plantations are predominantly
in the hands of smallholders.  A small number of large estates (about 15% of
area)  are  owned  either  by  private  individuals  or  companies.    Rubber
processing, with the exception of limited investment of the Rubber Board
jointly  with  RPSs,  is  in  private  hands.    Rubber goods  manufacturing
enterprises are run by private entrepreneurs.   Processing of rubber wood,
rubber seed oil and rubber honey is similarly handled by private business.
Rubber marketing is largely carried out by dealers and, to a small extent, by
cooperatives, which are also engaged, albeit in a small way, in processing.
Development Strategy for Rubber
1.15     GOI's priorities for rubber development are  (a) replanting of old
rubber trees in the traditional areas in Kerala and Tamil Nadu; (b) improving
yields by better field management in mature rubber holdings; and (c) planting
new areas in non-traditional areas, especially in the northeast, with a
emphasis on programs for tribals and ot-ar target poverty groups.
1.16     The continuing future growth of the rubber subsector is attractive
from both a social and economic point of views. Once established, it provides
a reliable income, increased on-farm and off-farm employment; and contributes
to the increased production of manufactured rubber goods for the domestic
market and for export. The attractive returns generated by these enterprises
ensures continued and expanding private sector involvement. This is further
fostered by the industry's ability to generate its own funds (raised through
cess) to finance agricultural services - research and extension - and
provision of planting ansistance to supplement growers' capital in developing
new planting or replanting.



xpoigcwih  Past IDA Lending
1.17     The Bank has been supporti:.  agricultural development in India since
the early 1950s.   To date 128 projects have received IBRD/IDA financing
amounting to US$10.4 billion equivalent (80% IDA and 20% IBRD).  Of the 128
projects 52 were for irrigation and command area development (US$4.9 billion
equivalent or 50% of total agricultural lending). The remaining 76 projects
can be subdivided as follows: (a) 34 for agricultural support services
(credit, research and extension) at US$2.3 billion equivalent; (b) 22 for
commercial agricultural development (fisheries, livestock, tree crops and
agro-industry) at US$1.4 billion equivalent;  (c) 10 for forestry at US$508
million equivalent;  and  (d)  10  other projects  including  sector area
development, drought assistance and c---lone emergency projects at about USQ950
million equivalent.
1.18     The IDA has had only a limited involvement with the rubber dubsector
in India. The Kerala Agricultural Development Project, which closed in 1986,
had a small component (US$4.5 million; 6% of total project costs) for rubber
processing facilities in the cooperative sector.  Although the PCR concluded
that this component had not fulfilled appraisal expectations, suffering from a
number of delays and reductions in physical targets, the PCR estimate of the
economic rate of return for the rubber processing component was still high at
21% compared to the appraisal estimate of 67.5%.   Cooperative processing
facilities are not a component in the proposed Rubber Project.   Both the
production and processing investment under the project would be through the
private sector.   The proposed project design also takes into account the
problems of a general nature identified through PCRs and special reviews of
Bank projects in India.   These include: delays in project mobilization,
institutional weaknesses, and inadequate local funding. These include: delay.3
in project mobilization, institutional weaknesses and inadequate local
funding. RB, the main implementing agency, is a well established organization
which would be further strengthened to enable quick mobilization of the
project.   The requirements for local funds is provided for in the RB's 8th
Five Year Plan which , in principle, has been approved by the Planning
Commission.
II. THE PROaECT
Rationale for IDA Involvem.nt and Origin
2.1      The IDA's strategy in India is to support policies and investments
that encourage economic growt ind poverty alleviation in a context of macro-
economic restructuring.   The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation,
increased efficiency of the public sector and appropriate targeting and
delivery of support systems to the poor.   The proposed Project fits well
within this framework.  It  o',uld enable the Rubber Board to undertake rural
development activities within the context of its 8th Five Year Plan and
introduce new internationally practiced rubber production and processing
techniques.  This would lead to a more efficient rubber subsector, increase
yields, lower costs of production and provide better quality of processed
rubber. The project would promote sustainable use of natural resources (soil
and water), on- and off-farm employment generation with rural-urban growth
linkages and consequent poverty alleviation.   Expansion of environment
friendly rubber cultivation in Tripura would assist economic development of
tribal people who have given up shifting cultivation but continue to live



below the poverty line.   The IDA's support in Tripura would be the first
externally aided project in the economically depressed state.  These    nges
together with freer import and export of rubber, review of tariff st,  .ure,
the phasing out of inputs subsidies and the ability of self-financing of the
subsector through an increase !.n the cess would enable India to fully exploit
it's comparative advantage in rubber production. Based on its past experience
of the rubber industry in many other countries, the IDA is well placed to
assist in this process. The rubber subsector has an added attraction for IDA
assistance because of its potential for greater foreign exchange earnings
through the export of manufactured rubber products.
2.2      Rubber was identified as a possible area for assistance during a
review of the Indian tree crops subsector by the IDA.  The Project dcsign
conforms to Rubber Board/GOI's 8th Five Year Plan and the project proposal
submitted to the  IDA by RB.   These documents formed the basis of the
preparation report of April, 1991 and appraisal in February/March, 1992.  A
list of the background documents available in the project files is given in
Annex 19.
troject Area. ObjectiveR and Description
2.3      Project Area.  The project would be implemented primarily in the
traditional rubber growing areas: all replantirig and over 80% of the new
planting would be in Kerala and adjoining districts of Southern 'arnil Nadu.
About 17% of new plantings would be in Tripura, a non-i aditional area in the
Northeastern part of the country (Map No. 23686).   In other non-traditionai
states (Assam, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka) pilot plantations would be
established to assess technical, economic and social viability of rubber
production.  Further information on the proposed project areas is given in
Annex 3.
2.4      Projert Objectives.   The proposed project would be a time slice
covering the eighth five year plan of the long-term rulbber development program
of GOI.   Its main objectives would be to expand and strengthen the rubber
subsector to increase production by smallholders, provide assistance to rubber
processors and generate on- and off-farm ru_al employment.   In Tripura, its
objectives would be to benefit tribal people through expansion of rubber based
production systems on land degraded bv shifting cultivation.  Additionally,
the project would aim to strengthen RS and assist the rubber subsector in
becoming internationally competitive through suitable policy changes.
2.5      Project Deseription.  The main components of the project, to be
implemented over five years, would include:
(i)   Replanting of old,  low yielding rubber on  40,000 ha in the
traditional rubber growing areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu for
which a line of credit and planting assistance would be made
available;
(ii)  New rubber plantings on 30,000 ha, consisting of 23,000 ha in
Kerala and Tamil Nadu, 5,000 ha in Tripura and 1,500 ha of pilot
plantations in other selected non-traditional areas.  For all new
planting except 500 ha of pilot experimental planting a line of
credit and planting assistance would be made available;
(iii) Productivity EnhAnefment on existing rubber holdings in Kerala and
Tamil Nadu through the adoption of improved field practices, in



- 7 -
particular discriminatory use of fertilizers, plant protection,
tapping systems and use of l?tex flow stimulants, and rain
guarding;
(iv)  Opgrading and E-sablishment of Processing Facilitiel for rubber
(sheets, crumb and centrifuged latex) and rubber wood to be
financed through a line of credit;
(v)   Institutional  support for RB including project coordination,
research, extension, training and technical assistance;
(vi)  Women's P ograms and Tribal Development including support for
income generating activities and participation by NGOs.
Detailsd Feeature
2.6      Rubber Replanting. (US$44.4 million, 35% of base costs)  About 23% of
old plantations or about 100,000 ha still require replanting with high
yielding clon'-s currently being recormended by RB.  Under the project 40,000
ha would be replanted.  Based on a review of the past rate of replanting and
proposed strengthening of RB (Annex 2), it is planned to replant 6,000 ha
duri.ag the first year thereafter increasin, to 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 and 10,000
ha per annum during the second, third, four+Mh and fifth year respectively.
Details of cultivation technology to be adopted are given in Annex 4.  Funds
under the line of credit would be made available to individual smallholders
for financing of planting and maintenance of rubber through the immaturity
period (paras 3.2-3.3 and Annex 6). This would include preparation of fields
for planting, purchase of planting materials, inputs (fertilizer, crop
protection chemicals), far.a development (drainage, erosion protection) and
other crop maintenance operations.   In addition, to encourage farmers to
participate in a long-term investment program, meet their short-term cash
requirements and ensure adoption of new technology, a planting assistance
equivalent to Rs.8,000 (US$307) per ha for past given costs and land
preparation and agricultural inputs would be provided by RB over the seven-
year period of immaturity (Annex 2, Attachment I). Each instalment would be
paid oased on items of work performed and certification of satisfactory plant
growth by the RB field staff.  In traditional areas only the growers owning
less than 5 ha and in non-traditional areas all growers would benefit from
this assistance. The project would finance this assistance and in the post-
project period the costs would be covered under the cess. Given the 6/7 year
immaturity period of rubber, and the phasing of planting over the five year
project implementation period, IDA funds would not be available for total
ir,vestment requirements of the rubber plantations during the full immaturity
period.   Accordingly,  at negotiations assurances were obtained that the
Borrower, not later than June 30, 1996, would furnish to the IDA a plan for
DINBARD's post project investment support to smallholders for areas replanted
under the project.   The selection criteria for reciepients of planting
assistance is as specified for sub-borrowers of credit (para 3.5).
2.7      New Rubber PlantinG.  (US$28.5 million,  23% of base costs)   The
project would support 30,(100 ha of new rubber plantings by private
smallholders.   This would consist of 23,000 ha in the traditional rubber
growing areas of Kerala and Southern Tamil Nadu, 5,000 ha in Tripura, and
2,000 ha in other selected non-traditional areas (Assam, Maharashtra, Goa and
Karnataka).   Operational modalities for the utilization of funds under the



-8-
line of credit and planting assistance would be similar to those described for
rubber replanting in para 2.6.
2.8      In Kerala and Southern Tamil Nadu,  (US$20.0 million,  16% of base
costs) because of high population densities and the prevalence of multi-crop
farming systems, there are few blocks of land available for extensive new
rubber cultivation. Much of the new rubber plantings would, therefore, be on
small plots of less than one hectare.
2.9      In Tripura (US$6.4 million, 5% of base costs), which is the main non-
traditional area included under the project, new plantings would be mainly on
land degraded by slash and burn shifting cultivation.  It is expected that
tribal people and other socially disadvantaged groups would constitute over
50% of the project beneficiaries.
2.10     In other non-traditional areas  (US$2.1 million,  2% of base costs)
rubber cultivation has only been initiated recently and there are no long-term
data available on its growth, yields and social acceptance. Additionally, due
to low rainfall,  some of these areas may require irrigation, particularly
during immaturity to ensure satisfactory growth.  In view of this, only pilot
plantations would be established to assess the technical, social, financial
and economic viability of rubber cultivation.   Sites for pilot plantation,
owned by participating growers, would be selected by RB and development cost
financed by a line of credit excepting for 500 ha to be provided as a grant.
2.11     As with the rubber replanting component, at negotiations assurances
were obtained that the Borrower, not later than June 30, 1996, would furnish
to the IDA a plan for NABARD's post project investment support to smallholders
of the newly replanted areas under the project.  The selection criteria for
planting assistance is as psecified for sub-borrowers of credit (para 3.5).
2.12     Productivity EUnhancement  (US$23.0  million,  18%  of  base  costs)
Although new plantings and replantings would increase long-term production of
rubber, short term improvements in rubber yields would come from improved
maintenance and exploitation of existing mature rubber areas as about 40% of
them are still yielding below 750 kg/ha.   RB recently initiated a program
aimed at increasing the productivity of mature areas which would be continued
under the project with an objective to raise yields by about 150-200 kg per
hectare per year. This would be achieved through improved management in the
following key areas;   discriminatory use of fertilizers,  disease control,
tapping methods and use of latex flow stimulants, and rain-guarding of tapping
panels during the monsoon season.   Detailed information on technological
packages to be adopted is given in Annex 4.   The project financing for
fertilizers, latex flow stimulants, fungicides, rain guarding materials, and
chemicals used for processing of latex would be limited to RB's share of the
costs, averaging around 50% of the costs of different inputs for immature and
mature  phases  o   rubber  growth,  remainder  being  the  contribution of
smrallholders.
2.13     Pronewsin   (US$18.1 million, 14% of base costs)  Funds would be made
available through a line of credit to finance establishment and/or upgrading
of processing facilities as described below:
(a)  Rubber.  Increasing production would require additional processing
capacity for various forms of processed rubber including centrifuged
latex (cenex), Technically Specified Rubber (TSR), Ribbed Smoked
Sheets  (RSS) and latex crepe.   The current features of the Indian



-9-
processing industry and guidelines for the selection of investrment
proposals are discussed in Annex 5.  More specifically, the project
would  finance:  (i)  small  scale  increase  in concentrate  latex
production capacity during the later years of the project through
establishment of 3 new factories and provision of 20 centrifuge
machines to expand existing factories as and when needed.  As poor
storage facilities in existing factories is a major contributing
factor in reducing quality of the centrifuge latex, funds would be
provided to improve bulk storage facilities at 25 factories; (ii)
setting up of 10 TSR factories of about 15 tons/day capacity with
necessary flexibility to use latex and/or field coagulum and
upgrading of block rubber factories to improve quality; (iii)
establishment of 30 small capacity (500 kg/day) RSS factories to
respond to the needs of small remote areas where other processing
facilities are not av.ilable.   Production of RSS through large
capacity factories as compared to small factories or artisinal sheet
processing by smallholders is less economical due to high investment
and operational costs; (iv) improvements in the quality of artisinal
RSS through (a) enhanced extension support; (b) establishment of up
to five pilot units through RPSs under RB guidance for re-processing
(washing, smoking and grading) of poor-quality sheets; and (c)
improved design for smoking and drying of  sheets, construction of
which by smallholders would be eligible for project financing; (v)
conversion of a number of small existing brown crepe factories into
TSR (block rubber) factories of 10-12 tons/day capacity.   Provision
has been made for establishment of five such factories; (vi)
establishment of one factory for the production of an innovative
rubber product such as pre-vulcanized latex or thermoplastic natural
rubber; and (vii) improvements in the efficiency and upgrading of
effluent  control  facilities  at  existing  factories.    Factories
requiring such support would be jointly identified by RB and the
Pollution Control Boards of the respective participating states
(Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Tripura).
While the design for each type of factory has been agreed with the
Rubber Bvard, the phasing of the investment program would be based on
future demand pattern to be assessed at regular intervals during
implementation.   The investment program would be coordinated by
Rubber Processing and Product Development Department (RPPDD) and the
factories owned by the private sector including RPSs.
(b)  WQod.  The project would finance five wood processing factories.  The
replanting program of 40,000 ha under the project, is expected to
make available a minimum of 400,000 cu.m of sawn rubber timber. The
current treatment capacity (chemical and seasoning) is estimated at
about 7,000 cu m per annum.   The five factories proposed under the
project would be established as 'pilot' enterprises by the private
sector using different technologies with a total capacity of about
600  cu  m/month.    These would provide  relevant  information on
comparative efficiencies of each system and would be used to
encourage further investments by other private entreprer,eurs.
2.14    Tnstitutional SuRport (US$9.7 million, 7.7% of base costs)
(a)  Rubber Board OrGanization.  (US$2.3 million, 1.8% of base costs)  The
operational capacity of the Rubber Board would be expanded and
strengthened through a series of measures.  These would include: (a)



- 10 -
opening of a new zonal office at Agartala, and 8 regional offices
mainly  in  traditional  areas;  (b)  further  decentralization of
management functions for quicker decision-making and supervision; (c)
computerization of accounts at regional offices as well as at the
headquarters; (d) upgrading of Statistics and Planning Division in to
a Department; and (e) establishment of a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) attached to the office of the RB Chairman to oversee
implementation of the project and monitor its progress. The project
would provide funds to finance the required buildings, vehicles,
equipment,  and  computers.    Incremental  operating  expenditures
including   staff salaries,  travel expenses,  vehicle  repair and
maintenance, and office supplie- would be financed under the project
on a declining basis.   Details of  incremental professional and
support staff requirements are given in Annex 2 Table 3.   It was
agreed that condition of Credit effectiveness would be that the key
incremental staff for  RB  have been appointed by  GOI/MOC.    In
addition, at negotiations assurances were obtained that all the other
incremental staff positions would be filled by March 31, 1993 with
personnel having the requisite qualifications and experience
satisfactory to IDA.
(b)  Research. (US$3.5 million, 2.8% of base costs)  This component would
be implemented by Rubber Research Institute of India (RRII).  Funds
would be provided for rubber research programs aimed at resolving
technical constraints for the future development of India's rubber
subsector.    The  project  would  finance  limited infrastructure
development, cost of specific research activities and 62 incremental
scientific and support staff.   Provision has also been made for
technical assistance in specialized areas such as germplasm exchange
and genetic clonal identification.   Details of specific research
programs, to be supported under the project, are given in Annex 7.
The main objective of the short-term research would be to improve
growth of immature rubber and productivity of mature rubber.
Examples of this type of work would include: advanced tapping systems
with or without latex flow stimulants, fertilization practices and
socio-economic studies to establish constraints to the adoption of
new   technologies.       To   develop  local/regional  fertilizer
recommendations, RRII's soil and leaf testing capacity would be
strengthened  through  construction  and  upgrading  of   eight
laboratories.   In addition, a full analytical laboratory would also
be established through the United Planters Association of South
India, a private sector NGO. This laboratory would operate as a part
of the overall leaf and soil testing network and participate in
developing improved fertilizer use practices.
Key features of the long-term program would include: 500 ha of rubber
development on a pilot basis in non-traditional areas and improvement
and selection of planting material for different agro-ecological
zones (germplasm and clonal selection); propagation techniques
development (tissue culture); diagnostic fertilizer use; tapping
systems for higher productivity; inter-cropping and farming systems
research especially for Tripura.
Research in rubber processing, to be undertaken in collaboration with
RPPDD, would focus on improving efficiency of crumb as wel) as small



- 11 -
scale sheet factories, improvement in the quality of the processed
rubber and technical support to the manufacturers of rubber products.
tc)  Extension support. (US$2.0 million,  1.6% of base  costs)    This
service, operating under Rubber Production Department (RPD) of RB,
would be strengthened through the recruitment of 163 additional field
and support staff, training, provision of new regional and field
offices, vehicles and motorcycles, communication equipment and
extension materials. This would enable RB to not only provide better
supervision of replanting and new planting activities but also expand
its current efforts directed at raising the productivity of mature
rubber plantations.   Technological packages to be promoted by the
extension services would be developed and updated through close
collaboration with the research institute, including widening the
range of recommended clones and improvements in nursery techniques.
To further strengthen the practice of working with groups, RB would
assist in the establishment of 1,500 new RPs over the project period.
(d)  Training and Technical Assistance.   (US$1.9 million,  1.5% of base
costs)  The project would finance construction of a Training Center
including a training hall, laboratory and lecture rooms adjoining to
the RRII site.   Required vehicles, training equipment and other
facilities would be provided to ensure effective implementation of on
and off-site training pr-ngrams.   The core staff of the Training
Center would be strengthened by recruitment of 16 higher level and
support staff and by seconding staff from other departments of RB,
especially RRII, and outside agencies on a short or long-term basis.
The scope and coverage of the courses to be provided would be
enlarged to include training for farmers, women beneficiaries, NGOs
and other public and private agencies involved with rubber
development (Annex 9). In Tripura, particular emphasis would be given
to training of tribal people.   Project funds are also provided for
continuing training/education of the RB staff, including overseas
training and fellowships.   In addition, the project would finance a
study to prepare a comprehersive 5-year training plan to identify
short medium and long-term skills required, prevailing and
prospective skill gaps, the clientele to be trained and the type of
courses to be provided. Once prepared, the training plan would be
updated each year to meet the changing needs of the industry. At
negotiations assurances were obtained at negotiations that by March
31, 1993 RB would prepare a 3-year training plan which would be
reviewed by IDA and updated each year in consultation with outside
agencies participating in the training programs and thereafter
implement such a plan.
The project would support local and foreign consultancies and studies
for a variety of assignments related to rubber development, including
research, training, downstream processing and marketing.  A specific
study to be financed under the project would investigate alternative
schemes to meet GOI's objectives of domestic price stability for
rubber producers as an alternative to the current Buffer Stock Scheme
(para 3.28).  The terms of ;eference for this study would be agreed
to with GOI/MOC at negotiations. These funds may also be used for
the preparation of future projects in the rubber subsector for IDA
assistance.  Use of these funds for either purpose would be subject
to advance approval by the IDA.

2.15  Women and Tribal Development. (US$2.1 million, 1.7% of base costs)  In
addition to the involvement of women and tribal people in rubber new planting
and replanting programs, the project would assist in the promotion of a number
of income generating activities, especially during the immature period of
rubber.  These would include:  bee-keeping, sericulture, inter-cropping, and
spice and medicinal herb cultivation on homestead. Funds would be provided to
support  NGO  participation,  especially  in  Tripura,  to:  (i)  increase
participation of women and tribals in project activities; (ii) facilitate
participation of project beneficiaries in on-going social and economic
development  programs being financed by other agencies.    The RB would
administer these funds.  The proposed women's activities in the traditional
areas are described in Annex 11 and Tribal Development Plan is given in Annex
12.
Preiect Costs and Finanning
2.16 Total project costs including physical and price contingencies for a
five year implementation period are estimated to be US$141.2 million
(Rs.4,452.1 million) of which US$18.3 million would be in foreign exchange.
Estimated taxes and duties would amount to about US$5.7 million.   Costs by

costs including staff salaries and operating expenditures is estimated at
US$6.1 million.
Financing Plan
2.18     The proposed IDA Credit to India of SDR 66.4 million (US$92.0 million
equivalent) would finance about 68% of total project costs, net of taxes and
duties, on standard terms and conditions.   GOI would provide part of the
Credit as a grant to RB and on-lend the remainder to NABARD in accordance with
standard arrangements for development assistance.  GOI would bear the foreign
exchange risk. Remaining financing would be provided by GOI/RB, participating
banks and the beneficiaries themselves as proposed below:
Local      Foreign        Total

2.19    RB's  contribution  would  be  included  in  their  annual plans.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOI and RB would promptly
provide the funds necessary to support project implementation.
Procurement
2.20    Civil Works.  Civil works up to an aggregate value of US$1.12 million
comprising mainly of office buildings are small and scattered over different
sites and would be procured by force account.
2.21     Plantation Costs.  Plantation costs to an aggregate value of US$12.2
million, would be disbursed in small amounts to smallholders.   These costs
would cover part of the per hectare costs of rubber plantings.
2.22     Goods/Equipment.   Computers totalling US$0.30 million would be
procured following LCB procedures as each individual package is not expected
to exceed US$30,000.   Laboratory and office equipment including furniture,
generator, TV/VCR and video aids and goods for income generating activities
would be procured in small lots over a five year period. Individual contracts
are not expected to exceed $25,000 and as such will be procured following
local shopping procedures satisfactory to IDA up to c  aggregate value of
US$4.2 million.   The project envisages procurement of trucks, cars, motor
vehicles valued at US$0.5 million in aggregate. Most of the vehicles would be
used in rural areas where the ready availability of spare parts and
maintenance is a necessity. For operational efficiency, it would be essential
to have vehicles of types locally available and in use by state entities.
These will be provided as and when necessary, each package costing less than
US$25,000 and therefore, would be procured following local shopping
procedures.
2.23     Comzmoditiea. Fertilizers, polythene sheet, pesticides etc. valued at
US$18.1 million would be procured following ICB procedures. Rubber coat, rain
guard compound etc. valued at US$7.1 million are required over 5 year period
and individual contracts are not expected to be over $100,000. As such, they



- 14 -
will be procured following LCB procedures. Small quantities of inputs to meet
urgent requirements not exceeding US$20,000 per package and in aggregate
US$0.5 million may be procured following Local shopping procedures as and when
necessary.
2.24     Credit.   A  line  of  credit  would be  made  available  for  the
replanting/new planting and processing components.  Procurement of goods and
services under credit for the new planting and the replanting component would
be in accordance with established commercial practices. It is estimated that
sixty per cent of the costs of each subloan (each costing less than US$200/-)
would be labour costs where no procurement is involved. Under the investment
credit for the processing component, individual contracts for equipment
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 each would be procured following
established commercial practices. Individual contracts above US$200,000 would
be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).   Civil works
amount to US$6.9 million, comprising of factory buildings, are scattered
around different sites and individually quite small and would not attract
foreign bidders, hence would be procured in accordance with established
commercial practices.
2.25     Consultancv Services. Consultancy services valued at US$1.05 million
including international consultants (US$0.4 million) would be contracted in
accordance with terms and conditions and guidelines for the use of consultants
by IDA borrowers.
2.26     RAviAw.  Contracts for civil works and goods valued at US$200,000 and
above (about 10% of contracts), and all consultancy contracts would be subject
to prior IDA review. Selective post review of awarded contracts below the
threshold levels would be carried out.

2.28     The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be disbursed against:
(a)    100% of NABARD refinancing of sub-loans for the replanting,
and new planting components;
(b)    For subloans  for processing    component  -  100% foreign
exchange costs, 100% local ex-factory costs and 60% of other
local costs of equipment and 65% for civil works?
(c)    80% of expenditures on plantation costs;
(d)    50% of expenditures on commodities;
(e)    100% of foreign and local ex-factory costs and; 80% of other
local costs of equipment, office furniture, computers and
goods for income generating activities in support of women
and tribal development;
(f)    100% of expenditure on consultancy and NGO services, and
training; and
(g)    expenditures  on  incremental  staff  salaries  and  other
incremental recurrent costs (operation and maintenance of
vehicles, and offices) on a declining basis as follows: 95%
of expenditures incurred until March 31, 1994; 75% of
expenditures incurred until March 31 1996; 60% of
expenditures incurred thereafter.
2.29     Disbursements against expenditures under  contracts    for  goods
exceeding US$100,000 and for civil works ex':eeding US$200,000 will be fully
documented as would be expenditures for c'nsultant and NGO services. For all
other expenditures IDA would disburse against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
in accordance with IDA's normal procedures.
2.30     The project is to be implemented over a five year period with
completion date of September 30, 1997, and disbursed within a six year period
with a closing date of September 30, 1998 (Annex 18). Retroactive financing
of up to  SDR 3.6 million (US$5 million equivalent) has been provided for
eligible expenditures incurred after December 31, 1991, to enable the timely
implementation of the Project.   In addition, a Special Account would be
established in US dollars, in the Reserve Bank of India with an authorized
allocation of US$4.10 million equal to about four months disbursements, from
which IDA's share of project expenditures would be paid. The proceeds of the
IDA Credit are expected to be disbursed over a six-year period which is less
than the disbursement profile for previous agricultural projects in India.
However, the project activities are expected to be implemented rapidly since
RB is a well established agency and over the years has shown its ability to
implement large planting/replanting programs.  Furthermore, RB has already
initiated project activities.
2.31     The procedures for preparing SOEs would be:  (a) Project expenses
would be summarized monthly by the RB and NABARD under expense headings agreed
with IDA, certified by the authorized officer and forwarded to the Controller
of Aid Accounts and Audit at the DEA within 30 days of each month end with a



- 17 -
copy sent to the Ministry of Commerce for processing and reimbursement from
the Special Account. All supporting documents to the SOE will be retained by
the RB and NABARD to enable easy access for subsequent review and audit, with
the exception of sub-loans for the processing component which would be
r:tained by PBs.  The disbursement of credit of sub-loans by participating
banks for new planting, replanting and processing would be~ in strict adherence
to the terms and conditions for rubber loans set forth by NABARD (para 3.5 and
Annex 6). GOI would pass on the Credit in the normal formula in which
assistance is passed to the MOC/RB and NABARD with GOI incurring the foreign
exchange risk.   NABARD would relend to PBs as per RBI guidelines.   In
addition, GOI within one month from project signing, would release about three
months anticipated project expenditures from GOI resources in advance to the
RB and NABARD. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the procedures
and disbursement arrangements outlined above would be adhered to by RB and
NABARD.
Project Accounts, Audits and Financial Reporting
2.32     RB  would  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  of  project
expenditures identifying all transactions pertaining to IDA financing, with
the supporting documentation retained for review by IDA supervision missions
(see para 3.10 and 3.11). RB's accounts are audited by tne Accountant General
of Kerala.
2.33     NABARD  and  the  PBs  would maintain separate  accounts  for new
planting, replaniing and processing components. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
would maintain records for the project's Special Account. NABARD accounts and
RBI's accounts would be audited by independent qualified auditors. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that RB and NABARD would have the Project
accoulLts, and GOI would have the accounts for SOE and Special Account, audited
annually, and submit to IDA such audit reports, including a separate opinion
on SOE, not later than nine months for RB and GOI, and six months for NABARD,
after the end of the fiscal year.

Organization and Management
3.1      RB would be the nodal agency and have overall responsibility for the
implementation of the project. The operations of the proposed project would
be an extension of RB's on-going programs and executed by its existing
departments, with some reorganization and adjustments to meet the specific
needs of the project.   The current and proposed organization of the RB is
given in Annex 2, Charts 1 (a) and (b) and 2 (a) and (b).  To oversee the
implementation and to monitor the progress of the project, a Project
Coordination Unit (P%U), headed by a full-time Project Coordinator (PC) would
be established as part of RB Chairman's office (also see paras 3.8 and 3.9).
Establishment of a PCU and appointment of a full time PC would be a condition
of Credit  effectiveness.    To guide the activities of PCU,  a Project
Coordinating Committee (PCC) would be established with the RB's Chairman as
the head, PC as secretary and heads of departments, representatives from
NABARD and participating banks.
3.2      To implement the project activities, in Tripura, RB would be assisted
by; (i) Tripura Forest Development and Plantation Corporation (TFDPC); a
public sector agency wiLh commercial estates and experience of assisting



- 18 -
smallholders; and (ii) the Tripura Rehabilitation Plantation Corporation
(TRPC), dealing exclusively with tribal people.   Both TRPC and TFDPC would
enter into contractual arrangements with RB to assist in the development of
new rubber plantings over about 1,000 ha each in areas jointly selected with
RB. Key features of the contract document would include: (i) adherence to the
technological packages and schedules for rubber development scheme prescribed
by RB (Annex 2 Attachment 1 and Annex 4); (ii) adherence to beneficiary
selection criteria to be adopted under the TDP with the involvement of village
panchayats (Annex 12); (iii) establishment of separate cells and project
accounts within TRPC and TFPDC to manage the rubber development and to receive
funding through RB; (iv) adherence to procurement, disbursement accounts,
audits and reporting procedures specified by IDA for the rubber project. At
negotiations assuranpa= were obtained that RB would, not later than December
31, 1992, enter into contractual arrangements satisfactory to IDA with TRPC
and TFDPC as specified.
3.3      A Tribal Welfare Committee (TWC) composed of representatives of GOT,
RB, TFDPC, TRPC, Autonomous District Council (ADC) and NGOs would be formed to
guide and monitor progress of all activities related to tribal beneficiaries.
The Tribal Development Plan (para 2.15) provides the overall operational
framework for assistance to the tribal people.  NGOs, to be selected during
project implementation by TWC and RB using the criteria outlined in Annex 13.
At negotiations asurances were obtained that the NGOs would be selected in
accordance with procedure and criteria agreed with IDA.
Credit Arrangements
3.4      Funds for the investment credit for new planting,  replanting and
processing components would be onlent by GOI to NABARD under a subsidiary loan
agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA including a minimum
interest rate of 7% per annum (net of a reduction of 0.25% for prompt
repayment) with the principal to be repaid in a lump sum in 15 years.  The
terms and conditions will be subject to periodic review in line with GOI
policy with any changes being agreed to between GOI and IDA.
3.5      NABAIRD would refinance up to 95% of sub-loans made by eligible
participating banks (PBs) providing a margin of 4.5% - 6.5% to the PBs, with
repayment over a maximum of 15 years, including a maximum of 7 years grace.
NABARD's existing arrangements with PB's have been found satisfactory. This
also now includes segregation of rubber accounts by PBs at their branches and
headquarters for both disbursement and recoveries. For replanting components
the criteria  for the  selection of sub-borrower would include:  (a) EL
Baplanting: {i) sub-borrowers shall be owning no more than 5 ha of land, and
no less than 0.1 ha, with clear title to land; (ii) sub-borrowers shall have
removed all old uneconomic rubber trees; and (iii) Board shall have certified
suitability of land for rubber replanting;   (b) £Mr New Planting:  (i) sub-
borrowers shall be private growers with clear title to land; and (ii) Board
shall have certified suitability of land for rubber planning. The terms and
conditions for sub-loans for replanting and new planting component would
include a minimum financial rate of return (FRR) of 15%; PBs would finance
investment costs at an interest rate of 15%; with 7/8 years grace and loan
repayable within a maximum period of 15 years. For the processing component
sub-borrowers would be selected under the following criteria: (a) sub-
borrowers shall have been certified by the Board to have expertise in rubber
processing; (b) sub-borrowers shall have obtained a license from the Board;
(c) sub-borrwoers shall agree to the Board guidelines for the establishment
and operation of each factory; and (d) the investment shall have a financial



- 19 -
rate of return of at least 15%.   PBs would finance up to a maximum of 70% of
investment costs at prevailing interest rates of 15-19% (as per RBI guidelines
depending on the size of the loan); 3 years grace and the loan would be
repayable within a maximum period of 10 years.  Additionally, the RB would
prepare bidding documents and supervise tendering for processing equipment
bought under ICB/LCB procedures according to IDA guidelines. IDA will need to
review and approve the first three processing sub-projects of each PB; if
these first subprojects are found acceptable, only subloans above the
US$500,000 free limit will require prior IDA review and approval.    It would
be a condition of project effentiveness that the dubsidiary loan agreement,
satisfactory to IDA, has been entered into by GOI with NABARD.  In addition,
at negotiatioias assuranoes were obtained that:  (a) the criteria  for the
selection of PBs and beneficiaries, and terms and condition of the sub-loans
would be as specified; and (b) NABARD would introduce a system for the
segregation of rubber accounts at its branches and the headquarters no later
than January 31, 1993.
Research. Extension and Training
3.6      Resarch.  RRII and RPPDD are well managed units of the RB and with
the proposed strengthening through incremental staffing and technical
assistance would be able to execute agreed research priorities in a timely
manner. To ensure that the research programs of both the units continue to
address the needs of the industry, a more formal system of consultation
between producers (RRII and R!?PDD) and users of research (RPD, rubber growers
and manufacturers) would be introduced.   The Chairman of the RB would be
responsible for organizing such consultations at least once a year.   More
information on the research component is given in Annex 7.
3.7    E£xtension.   The extension activities would be managed through the
zonal, regional and field offices of RPD and delegated greater autonomy and
supervisory functions.   Field  staff would be  responsible for both the
inspection of smallholdings to authorize release of planting assistance and
extension support within a defined geographical area. The extension unit at
the Headquarters would be the extension subject matter specialists. This unit
would also manage RB owned nurseries and field level training of extension
workers and farmers. RB nurseries supply about 15% of the planting material
required by smallholders, the remainder coming from privately owned nurseries.
Increased training and mobility would strengthen the ability of extension
staff to provide effective support to RPSs, privately owned nurseries and
smallholders. In addition, to improve delivery of extension messages, mass
communication techniques would be closely integrated with the regular
extension work programs. The focal point for the transfer of technology would
be the RPSs. Market information and supply of inputs under various programs
managed by RPD would also take place through these societies. However, as the
subsidies on inputs, are withdrawn (para 3.31) and the societies are
strengthened, the responsibility for procurement and distribution of inputs
would be fully transferred to t}:em.
3.8      The extension service would play a critical role in implementing the
productivity enhancement component. Fertilizer use efficiency would be
improved  through  promotion  of  regional/local  recommendations.           The
effectiveness of commonly used fungicides would be improved through better
timing, method and rates of application.   Other recommendations in the
productivity enhancement package, namely rain guarding of tapping panels to
enable continuation of scheduled tapping operations during the rainy season
and the use of latex flow stimulants, are not yet widely practiced and require



- 20 -
extension support for large scale adoption. Thus, different components of the
productivity enhancement package would be adopted by growers at different
rates.   It has been assumed that in any one year of the project at least
60,000 ha would be under one or more of the recommendations in the
productivity enhancement package. More information on the extension component
is given in Annex 8.
3.9      Training. RB's training activities at present are managed on an ad
hoc basis.  Establishment of training center, provision of additional staff
and preparation of a long-term training plan would enable the Training
Department to develop a comprehensive training program catering to tha needs
of the RB staff, other related public and private agencies, NGOs, women
beneficiaries, tribal people and other farmers.   Overseas study tours by
selected research and extension staff to rubber producing countries and
attendance at the international conferences by other RB staff would be an
important source of new technologies which may be adapted to 7ndian
requirements. More information on the proposed training programs and
guidelines for the preparation of the Training Plan are given in Annex 9.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.10     PCU would collect information from all relevant departments and other
agencies on individual components, identify outstanding problems, and indicate
proposed solutions. The monitoring work would give emphasis to impact studies
through baseline and follow-up surveys of the planting programs in traditional
and non-traditional areas and effectiveness of various schemes providing
financial assistance. These surveys would be executed through contracts with
local universities or other public or private institutions with appropriate
expertise and supervised by the PCU.   Monitoring of the TDP would be
undertaken with assistance   from outside agencies  (Annex 12) and findings
reported to PCU on a quarterly basis.   NABARD would obtain information on
disbursements against the --w planting/replanting components and the
processing component from PBs on a quarterly basis and submit a report to the
PCU. Proposed IDA/Borrower supervision plan is summarized in Annex 17.
3.11     PCU would prepare quarterly and annual reports starting December 31,
1992. Quarterly reports would give a brief account of project progress during
the past three months.  Annual reports would be detailed, highlighting the
main achievements and problems encountered during the past 12 months of
project implementation and listing actions and recommendations proposed to
resolve them. In addition, RRII would prepare an annual report describing the
progress of the activities financed under the project. These reports would be
submitted to IDA within two months from the end of each period.  PCU would
also prepare the project completion report within six months of the closing
date of the IDA Credit. Azsurance on the proposed reporting requirements were
obtained at negotiations.
3.12     A Mid-term Review (MTR), to be jointly undertaken by RB and IDA
based on inputs from operational units of RB and NABARD, would be carried out
not later than 31 December 1994, the third financial year from the date of
effectiveness. The review would assess progress of all project componients
with a particular emphasis on technological developments, effectiveness of the
credit arrangements, farmer incentives, women's participation, tribal
development in Tripura, NGO involvement, crganization and management and
disbursement performance of components. The review would also include expert
assistance to evaluate the economic potential of the pilot income generating
activities in traditional areas and in Tripura and develop recommendations to



- 21 -
ensure that women tribals undertaking these activities would over time have
access to formal credit.  MTR would also address needs to reallocate funds
between  different  project  components.    Asurances  were  obtained at
negotiations that RB in conjunction with IDA would carry out the MTR in
accordance with terms of reference and methodology agreed with IDA and shall
thereafter implement the recommendations of the MTR.
Environmental Impact
3.13     Rubber cultivation has a number of environmental benefits in areas
prone to degradation either due to a lack of vegetative cover or inappropriate
soil and water management practices. The benefits include avoidance of soil
erosion, improved soil fertility and moisture retention.  In Tripura, areas
degraded due to slash and burn shifting agriculture would be brought under
rubber cultivation. Intercropping during the first four years of the immature
phase would be restricted to crops like bananas and papaya to allow
establishment of secondary soil cover.   In addition,  to assist efficient
allocation of land for the future expansion of rubber areas, by December 31,
1993, a long term land use plan would be prepared by GOT/RB with terms of
reference acceptable to IDA.  Draft terms of reference were provided to and
agreed  at negotiations.   Assurances to  this effect  were  obtained  at
negotiations.
3.14     Replanting of existing rubber plantations in traditional areas would
increase availability of rubber wood in a well established market for its
utilization as lumber and as fuel. This would offset an increased demand for
fuelwood generated by greater quantities of rubber to be processed into
sheets.  Jn Tripura, a concern is that increased rubber cultivation would, in
the long term, increase pressure on fuelwood to be used for smoking rubber
sheets as the new plantings come into production.   This concern would be
addressed by increasing fuelwood supplies through social forestry schemes,
planting of trees on the borders of rubber smallholdings, and examination of
alternative sources of energy such as natural gas, which is abundant in the
state.
3.15     There are adequate national and state regulations to ensure that
emissions and effluent from rubber processing factories conform to the
prescribed standards.  Adherance to regulations is monitored through routine
inspections by officials from Pollution Control Board of each state.
Treatment measures for relatively benign effluent from rubber factories,
involving anaerobic and aerobic ponding, are well known and incorporated in
the design of processing plants.   The project would help to speed up
replacement or improvement of older facilities with efficient systems as
recommended by RB and Pollution Control Board of the respective states.  In
Tripura, the state Pollution Control Board has just been set up, but there are
no effluent testing facilities. Therefore, RB would undertake this work until
the new facilities become a'Tailable.
3.16     The most important crop protection problem affecting rubber in the
traditional areas are diseases.   Amongst these the disease caused by
Phytopthora species (abnormal leaf fall) *is by far the most important 4n
Kerala.   In the case of susceptible clones, the control measures rely on a
prophylactic treatment of foliage with either a high volume spray of 1%
Bordeaux mixture (1 kg copper sulphate + 1 kg quick lime per 100 1 of water)
or copper oxychloride dispersed in diluent spray oil using a low volume air
blast sprayers from the ground. Under the project new plantings with tolerant
clones would be emphasized, which would permit reduction or avoidance of



- 22 -
funs,icide use.  The second disease of importance is the pink disease of stem
caused by Cortinium salmonipolor. which is best controlled by painting of
affected surfaces with formulations containing fungicide tridemorph, a
compound with good safety record. The third disease of some significance is
the black stripe of stem caused by Phvto2thora palmivorR, which can be
controlled by painting the affected bark with formulations based on mancozeb.
All formulations based on fungicides described above would be eligible for
project financing.
3.17     The copper based fungicides are the most frequently used chemicals in
Indian rubber plantations.   Although these compounds have no significant
history of ill effects to humans or environment, in view of their regular use
over the economic life of the rubber tree, RB would introduce regular
monitoring, of copper residues in soil and water from selected locations. At
negotiations assurances were obtained at negotiations that by March 31, 1993,
RB would develop a plan for monitoring of copper residues in soil and water
from selected locations from project states. As smallholders are increasingly
employing contractors to undertake fungicide spraying, the RB training program
would include special courses to promote safe and effective use of pesticides,
especially fungicides, for extensions staff, spray contractors and farmers.
In addition, RB, with the assistance of agricultural universities in Kerala
and Tamil Nadu, would monitor pesticide use practices in rubber plantations.
Impact on women
3.18     In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, about _0% of smallholdings are owned by
women. High literacy rates and levels of education, combined with long years
of experience with rubber cultivation,  would ensure that landowning women
derive increased benefits under the Project.   Labor on smallholdings is,
however, gender typed and majority of the female workers have limited access
to economic resources through formal employment. In Tripura, there are very
few female smallholders, and nearly 80% of the families live below the poverty
line.
3.19     In view of the stark contrast in socioeconomic status of women
beneficiaries between the traditional areas and Tripura, the project would
have different approaches to their development. Speciftc project intervention
for women in traditional areas are provided in Annex 11.   These include
increased opportunities for employment on rubber smallholdings and nurseries
through training in tapping and budding techniques, establishment of
microenterprises and provision of income generating activities like bee
keeping and rabbit rearing through the existing NABARD refinanced schemes for
self help groups.   Project activities for women in Tripura are incorporated
into the Tribal Development Plan which is summarized in Annex 12 and includes
increased opportunities for employment and social development.  Pilot income
generating activities such as pisiculture, poultry farming, and beekeeping
would be initiated.    The women would also benefit from ongoing social
support/schemes such as nutritional and health programs, provision of creches
and social forestry schemes.   In addition, the project would encourage the
establishment of informal saving schemes to provide some measure of financial
independance to women.
=mpact on Tribals
3.20     The project would benefit about 2,500 tribal families in Tripura,
most of them living below the poverty line (per capita income of less than
Rs. 6,000). Cultivation of rubber by the tribal people would appear to be an



- 23 -
appropriate choice as it grows well in less favorable soil and climatic
conditions and provides a steady income from the time of tapping.
Furthermore, ability to intercrop rubber with food and cash crops, eg, banana
and papaya, during the first 4 years of immaturity provides additional
security. A culturally compatible Tribal Development Plan (TDP) which adopts
an integrated approach to tribal development and rubber cultivation and
conforms to requirements under O.D. 4.20 has been formulated, in conjunction
with the Government of Tripura (Annex 12). This provides the broad framework
for implementation, monitoring and evaluation of social and economic
developmen".  activities  aimed  at  tribals.       Further,  to  assist  the
implementAtion of the TDP a socio-economic survey of tribal beneficiaries
financed by the Bank has commenced and would be completed before December 31,
siz.  At negotiations assurances were obtained that GOT with the assistance
of RB would carry out the TDP in a manner and timetable satisfactory to IDA.
Non-Governmental Organizations ENGOsI
3.21     The Project would seek the assistance of NGOs to strengthen informed
participation of beneficiaries, particularly women in all states, and tribals
in Tripura. In close collaboration with extension service, NGOs would provide
the necessary assistance to support transfer of technology, and facilitate
access to credit services available under on-going GOI/GOT programs. For new
income generating activities,  for which no credit  facilities yet exist,
experimental pilot approaches would be tested with the RB providing seed money
as a grant.
roiect senefits and Justification
3.22     Production  and Marketing.    The  estimated  incremental  rubber
production resulting from the project activities over the economic life of the
trees would be 0.82 million tons from new plantings; 1.1 million tons from
replantings; and 1.3 million tons from productivity enhancement.  The yield
and production levels will vary between the traditional and non-traditional
areas. In traditional areas, it is expected that tapping will start in year 6
after planting and estimated average yield would be 1,252 kgs/ha.   In non-
traditional areas tapping will begin in year 7 with average yield of 1,139
kgs/ha. These yield levels are considered conservative (Annex 4).
3.23     At present all the natural rubber produced in the country is consumed
in the  domestic market.   GOI  has consistently maintained a policy of
supporting the rubber industry to increase production to meet domestic demand
and to ensure supply for the export oriented manufacturing industry. Over the
past five years, on an average 45,000 tons have been imported annually to meet
the gap between demand and supply. However, recent increases in production
have changed the situation, and it is envisaged that for the next 3-5 years
India would be self-sufficient in natural rubber.
3.24     Rubber is primarily traded by private dealers who are licensed by RB.
A large proportion of the rubber produced by smallholders is sold in ungraded
lots. The main outlets for rubber from the traditional areas are the major
manufacturing centers like Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Ludhiana.
Rubber from Tripura is sold to manufacturers in Calcutta. Cost of transport
and freight are similar from Kerala and Tripura to the respective
manufacturing centers. Further details on marketing arrangements are provided
in Annex 15.



- 24 -
3.25     Employmant.   The  30,000  ha  of  new  planting and  40,000  ha  of
replanting will generate nearly 215,600 work years during the immature period
and 11,500 work years per annum during the maintenance period.   The rubber
processing factories under the project are expected to employ about 2,000
persons in the rural areas.
3.26     Financial and Economio TnMact.  The major assumptions underlying the
financial and economic analyses are as follows: (a) the economic life of the
new planting and replanting will be 30 years and the economic life of the
processing plants will be 15 years; (b) the Project will be implemented over a
five year period; (c) the immature or gestation period for development before
tapping will be 6 years in traditional areas and 7 years in non-traditional
areas; (d) the expected annual yield levels will increase from 800 kgs/ha to
1,550 kgs/ha at peak production in traditional areas and 500 kgs/ha to 1,400
kgs/ha at peak production in non-traditional areas, with the peak production
period lasting from year 12/13 to year 20; and (e) productivity enhancement on
mature plantations will result in average yield levels increasing from 988
kgs/ha without the project to 1,192 kgs/ha with the project (Details in Annex
16).
3.27     Financial analyses for one hectare crop budgets were undertaken
separately for the traditional and non-traditional areas  (Annex 13).   The
financial rate of return (FRR) for both models is estimated at 18.6% in
c -istant terms. Though the yield levels are 10% lower in the non-traditional
areas in comparison to the traditional areas, labor costs are higher in the
traditional areas.
3.28     As  a  majority  of  smallholders  are  expected  to  finance  their
investment with a loan, cash flow analyses of one hectare models were
undertaken in current terms to establish their ability to pay. The analyses
demonstrate that with interest capitalized (at the current interest rate of
15%) over the immature period the smallholder would be able to repay the loan
over 13 years in traditional areas and 14/15 years in non-traditional areas.
The terms and conditions for rubber lending are within the established
guidelines provided by NABARD and PBs for rubber subloans.
3.29     Financial analyses undertaken for the processing plants reflect the
following FRR: rubber sheet factories 26%; centrifugal latex factories 35.3%;
conversion of crepe to crumb rubber factories 12 tons/day 28%; coagulum based
crumb rubber factories 38.7%; and wood processing factories 35.5%.
3.30     The economic costs are expressed in February 1992 constant prices and
include all investment and recurrent costs of the project, taking into account
physical contingencies and excluding price escalation, taxes and duties. The
standard conversion of 80% was applied to non-traded costs including labor.
The economic analyses was undartaken based 'n IBRD commodity Price Projections
of February 1992 and taking into account appropriate price differences for
Tqality for natural rubber. Both import and export parity prices were derived
for natural rubber and import parity prices for traded inputs such as
fertilizers. The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was calculated
on the basis of both export and import parity prices for natural rubber as in
India is more or less self sufficient in natural rubber. The opportunity cost
of project land was taken as Rs. 5,000/ha in traditional areas where
coconut/cashew nut cultivation would be the alternate crop.   In Tripura the
opportunity cost of land is negligible given that degraded lands would be used
for rubber cultivation The ERR for the project is estimated to be 20.7% using
export parity prices and 29.9% with import parity prices. The ERR for the new



- 25 -
planting and replanting component are 17.3% (export parity) and 21.4% (import
parity). The ERR for the processing compoi,ent is estimated at 38%.
3.31     Sensitivity Analyses  The major quantifiable risk to the project's
economic viability is the price for natural rubber. The present price of US$
.84/kg (CIF Indian ports) and USS .75/kg (FOB Indian ports) is at an
historical low, and was used for the sensitivity analyses. Using the present
prices, the ERR for the project is 12% (export parity) and 17.7% (import
parity) and for the raw planting and replanting component the ERR are 12.8%
(export parity) and 17.7% (import parity).  Sensitivity analysis undertaken
for the productivity enhancement component, assuming a 10% reduction in yields
with costs remaining constant, reflect an ERR of 10.3% (export parity) and
16.3% (import parity).  However, the yield assumptions used in the base case
ERR are developed from RB's past experience and are considered conservative.
Further 'with Project' routine application for high rates of various inputs
are  based  on  currently  followed recommendations.    Under  the  Project,
significant reductions in these rates are envisaged through the introduction
of discriminatory use of fertilizers and fungicides. Sensitivity analysis for
project  delays  was not undertaken  as delays  are  unlikely.    The past
performance of the rubber subsector has proved that the project can be
implemented on a timely basis. Furthermore, a delay in planting would result
in-a proportionate decrease in investment costs, largely negating the effect
of delays on ERR. Additional findings from sensitivity analyses are provided
in Annex 16. The project is considered viable.
Policy Aspects
3.32     Polyhag Substieg:   The RB provides a subsidy on plants grown in
polybags to encourage planting of good material which gives a more regular
tree stand with minimal casualties  (Annex 4).   The costs of this subsidy
amounts to Rs. 2,700 (US$104) per ha Or Rs. 61= per plant.  This subsidy would
be phased out when 80% of growers have adopted this technique. The adoption
rate would be assessed at the mid-term review and once again six months prior
to the proposed phaisng out date. Assur-ances were obtained at negotiations
that the polybag subsidy would be phased out by December 31, 1996, or such
later ate as may be agreed between IDA and RB.
3.33     Input Subsidies.   Input subsidies have been provided by the RB
amounting to about Rs. 10 million (US$.38 million) per annum. The subsidies
are for the provision of fertilizers, chemicals and other materials during the
mature phase of rubber cultivation and channelled through RPSs, the
traditional areas and through the regional offices in the non traditional.
The level of subsidy varies between 10-50% of the cost price. RB's rationale
for the subsidies is to encourage the use of new technology and inputs. While
the subsidies have provided incentive for change, in the long-term, the main
thrust for technology dissemination and adoption would be through effective
extension support in which the RPSs would play an important role.   At
negotiations assurances were obtained that the input subsidies would be phased
out by the end of the project. A time table for the phasing out of subsidies
was agreed to at negotiations.
3.34     Rubber Trade.   GOI's  policy has protected the domestic rubber
industry through restriction of imports and exports of natural rubber. Until
March 1992 imports of natural rubber were through the State Trading
Corporation (STC); imports against exports (44 kgs of imports against 105 kg's
of exports) under the advance licensing scheme; and through the provision of
eximscrips. Imports through STC in the past 3 years have been around 30,000
tons per annum with no imports in 1991-92, imports under the advance licensing



- 26 -
scheme have been around 14,000-20,000 tons per annum for the same period and
none through eximscrips.  Tne tariffs on imports by STC have varied between
25%-48% of the CIF value in the past 3 years and imports under advance
licensing are duty free and imports through eximscrips are subject to a 20%
basic duty and 50% auxilliary duty.  The recent Government announced trade
reform package allows for the free import of rubber both by the public and
private sector, and exports are allowed though with quantity restrictions on
grade RMA4 rubber.  The tariffs on rubber imports remain at 20% basic duty and
50% auxilliary duty.  However, as referred to in para 3.35 the CIF price, at
present, is at par   with the domestic price.   Further trade reforms are
expected to be introduced by GOI shortly and it is envisaged that import
tariffs on natural rubber would be reduced.   Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that GOI would inform the Association as soon as a decision has
been made.
3.35     Buffer Stock Scheme.   The GOI has maintained a buffer stock scheme
since 1986, which operates more or less as a price support mechanism for
rubber producers. The Scheme is managed by STC.  STC procures excess rubber
from the producers at a pre-determined price. This price is based on cost of
production studies carried out by the Cost Accounts Branch of the Ministry of
Finance and has been consistently higher than world market prices until the
devaluation in July 1991.  Since then the CIF value for imported rubber has
been at par with the domestic price. Furthermore, in recent years, STC has
procured more of the lower quality RMA 5 which has limited demand.  This has
at times resulted in stocks worth over US$34 million being maintained by STC
at a considerable cost to GOI.  However, at negotiations, GOI informed IDA
that a proposal has been submitted to the Cabinet to modify the buffer stock
new scheme into a price support scheme.  This scheme is expected to be in
place by September 1992 and operated by STC.   The support price would be
determined by the Commission on Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOI would inform IDA once the
new price support mechanism for rubber is approved and that not later than
June 30, 1993 GOI would review with IDA the implementation of the new scheme
with the view of effecting any improvements that may be necessary.  The review
would include the cost effectiveness of the scheme, basis for price
determination and operational modalities.
3.36    Cess.  According to the Rubber Act a cess on rubber manufacturers is
collected and credited to the consolidated fund of GOI which in turn finances
RB's expenditures.   The cess, which continues to be at Rs 0.50/kg, has not
kept pace with inflation or RB's expenditures (Annex 2). At negotiations MOC
informed the Association that a bill proposing modification to the Rubber Act
which provides for an increase of cess to a maximum of Rs 2.00/kg has been
submitted to the legislative.  This bill once approved would allow MOC as a
first step, to implement an increase in cess to Rs 1.00/kg immediately. It is
estimated that at this rate the collections from cess would cover about 70% of
RB's expenditures.  Assurances were obtained at negotiatiors that by January
31 of every other year, starting January 31, 1994, in consultation with the RB
and the IDA, GOI would review and adjust the cess on rubber taking into
account the expenditures of the RB.
Prodec!t Risks
3.37     No major implementation risks are associated with the project.  The
rubber industry is well established, and RB is a strong organization with
competent staff to implement the project.  The robust internal demand would
ensure that there is a ready market for natural rubber with any marginal
oversupply exported under GOI's new trade policy.   As with all commodity



- 27 -
projects the volatility of the international prices would affect the economic
viability of the project.   However, price sensitivity analyses (para 3.31)
undertaken reflect that the project is still viable. The risk associated with
loans made to smallholders are minimal in the traditional areas, as is
evidenced from estimated past recoveries of over 90%.  However, in Tripura,
the PBs have not had sufficient experience of providing loans to rubber
smallholders, which would require greater technical support by RB and close
monitoring during project supervision. There is some potential risk for the
deterioration in the political situation in Tripura which could hamper the
implementation of the project in that state.  However, the situation is now
stable.

(n) not later than December 31, 1996 or such later date as maybe
agreed with IDA and the RB phase out the polybag subsidy would
be phased out (para 3.32);
(o) all input subsidies would be phased out as per time table agreed
between the Borrower and IDA (para 3.33);
(p) the borrower shall (i) once the new price support mechanisms for
rubber is approved inform IDA of such mechanism; and (ii) not
later than June 30, 1993 review with IDA the implementation of
such mechanism with a view of affecting any improvements that
maybe necessary (para 3.35); and
(q) b_r January 31 of every other year starting January 31, 1994 in
'onsultation with the RB and IDA GOI would review and adjust the
cess on rubber taking into account the expenditures of RB (para
3.36).
4.2      Condition of Credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) The specified key incremental staff for RB have been appointed
by GOI/MOC [para 2.14(a)];
(b)  A Project Coordination Unit has been established along with
appointment of a full time Project Coordinator (para 3.1); and
(c) Subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and NABARD has been
executed (para 3.5).
4.3      With above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable for an
IDA Credit of SDR 66.4 (US$92.0 million equivalent).

RUBBZR PROJZCT
THT RUEBZR BOARD
Organization
1.    The Rubber Board (RB) is a statutory body established under the Rubber
Act 1947. It is goverr.ed by a RB of Directors consisting of a Chairman and 25
members representing different interest groups. The Chairman, who is an
appointee of the Central Government, is responsible for implementation of the
decisions of the RB and reports directly to the Secretary, Ministry of
Commerce (MOC).  The main functions of the RB cover planning, preparation and
implementation of Rubber Plantation Development Schemes, research, extension,
training, collection of cess, provision of support to processing and
marketing, compilation of statistics, and workers' welfare. (Further details
may be obtained in the Working File)
2.    The present organization of the RB is presented in Chart 1.  It is
presently organized into six Departments with a total of 1970 staff with the
following functions:
Department                      Responsible  for
Administration                 Personnel administration, collection of cess,
licencing, labor welfare measures, vigilance and
legal functions (staff - 315).
Rubber Production              Planning, formulation and implementation of
rubber development schemes, extension services,
support to RPS and training of tappers (staff -
1,139).
Rubber Research                Research on aspects of germplasm and clonal
selection relating to productivity,
biotechnology, physiology, tapping systems, agro-
management and post-harvest technology (staff -
399).
Rubber Processing              Provision of engineering and quality control
services, factory management and technical
consultancy services for the rubber goods
manufacturing industry (staff - 83).
Finance and Accounts           Budget and budgetary control and annual accounts
(staff - 30).
Training                       Training to RB's employees, plantation and
industry personnel (staff - 6).
3.    Other Function. 6  ha Rubbr Boan'i. Major functions of the RB include:
(a)   LjganAa±n:  To assist in the maintenance of its statistical
database, the RB issues licences to dealers (licence to deal in



-32-

rubber), processors (licence to acquire rubber for processing and
to sell processed rubber), and manufacturers (licence to acquire
rubber and to sell manufactured rubber goods). The licencees are
also required to furnish the information requested by the RB from
time to time.
(b) Monitoring Interstate transportation of RuhbAr: Declarations have
to be issued by the dealer/processor/manufacturer if rubber is to
be transported from one state to another.
(c)   Collection of cess on rubber from rubber manufactures.
(d)   Monitoring of Prina Information:  RB collects the daily prices of
RMA4 and ungraded sheet rubber from Kottayam and Kochi markets.
Price of scrap rubber is collected twice every week. Weekly
average prices of RMAl to RMA5 and the weekly and monthly prices
of centrifuged latex are also collected and released in the press.
This helps in dissemination of price information and contains
price exploitation of growers.
Financing
4.    Cass Collantions.  As required by the Rubber Act, the RB is entrusted
with the responsibility for the collection of cess from rubber manufacturers.
The collections are to be credited to the Consolidated Fund of India which in
turn is used by Central Government to finance the RB's expenditure over years.
GOI grant has remained the principal source of RB funds, accounting for about
90% of its expenditure with the remaining 10% coming from sale of planting
materials and rubber from experimental stations, technical consultancy and
advisory fees, cess administrative charges (2%) and other receipts. For many
years after commencement of the replanting programme in 1957, cess collections
have exceeded total expenditure of the RB and sizeable reserves were
accumulated (Rs. 275 million by the end of 1980/81). Since 1987/88, however,
cess collections have not kept pace with the RB's expenditures, resulting in
deficit which had to be covered by GOI out of general revenue. With the
present plans and assuming current levels of cess, cess collections are
projected to be insufficient to cover RB's costs in full. GOI is now planning
to increase cess to Rs. 1.00/kg, a 100% of rise over the present level.
5.    A close examination of the RB's expenditure trend during the last ten
years reveals that: (a) per ha planting grant has remained constant since 1980
in spite of the fact that there has been a significant increase in the
planting costs (currently 13% of the costs at Rs.5,000/ha); (b) allocations
made for weaker segments of the population (tribals) have recorded remarkable
increases; and (c) a tighter targeting approach has been followed enabling a
large number of smallholders to benefit from grant support, while at the same
time totally withdrawing subsidies previously extended to large holders
operating more than 5 ha in traditional areas (see Table 1).
Cash Flow Projections
Cash flow projections have been prepared to ascertain the extent of
external/budgetary support which would be necessary to ensure the future
viability of Board's operations, assuming present levels of cess.
Alternatively, an estimate has been made of the Board's cash flow on the



-33-
Page 3 of 7
assumption that the cess rate will be increased to Rs. 1.00/kg.
For preparing the cash flow (Table 2), it is assumed that annual rubber
production would go up from 330,000 tons in 1991 to 522,000 tons in 1996 (an
average annual rate of increase of 10%). Areas expected to be planted are
estimated at 6,000 ha, and replanted at 8,000 ha evenly from 1992-1996. Cash
inflow is based on cess collections - at the present and proposed rate of 50
and 100 paise per kg respectively. In addition, other receipts are estimated
at 10% of total cash inflow.
Cash outflows have been estimated in constant 1991 prices (i.e. at presently
prevailing payment rates). These include payments for new planting and
replanting (seven lnstallments totalling Rs. 5,000/ha), and payments to
(SC/ST). The cashflow makes provision for payments to be made against prior
year commitments (i.e. remaining installments on areas planted/replanted
between 1985/90). Board's administrative costs have been included based on an
annual growth rate of 10%.
Based on the above assumptions, Table 2 shows that, with an unchanged level of
cess rate, the Rubber Board would need budgetary support beyond contribution
from cess collection. If the deficit cess is paid by is recovered wholly
through an increase in cess levels, with the increase coming into effect in
1992, the cess would need to be increased from the present level of 50 paise
to little over Rs. 1.00 per kg.
6.    Existing Develoh=nt Shomes Managed bi the Rubber-Board.  The RB's main
schemes can be broadly classified into two categories: Rubber Plantation
Development Schemes which are approved by GOI, and smaller schemes known as
pool fund schemes for which the Chairman is given approval authority up to a
ceiling of Rs. 2 million per scheme. The Rubber Plantation Development Scheme
presently offers financial assistance and technical advice, with the former
consisting of: (a) a cash grant of Rs. 5,000 per ha (see Attachment), and
interest subsidy of 3% on bank loans for smallholders owning up to 5 ha in
traditional areas and for all smallholders in the non-traditional regions;
and (b) polybag plant subsidy at the rate of Rs. 6 per plant up to Rs. 2,700,
assuming 450 plants per ha. Smaller schemes cover financial assistance for
inputs during the mature phase of rubber and are seen as promotional
activities which are phased out over time. Currently, depending upon location
age and category of the beneficiary the subsidy may cover a proportion of the
cost of: fertilizers and other inputs over 3 years, sprayers, Rollers, mini-
smokehouse, fencing, irrigation facilities and bee-keeping. Over the last
decade, replanting assistance subsidy is the largest covering all growers
(virtually 100%), followed by new planting assistance (59% of beneficiaries),
polybag plant (40-50% of beneficiaries), and the remaining forms of assistance
(less than 25% of beneficiaries).
7.    Input subsidies are presently channelled through the Rubber Producer
Societies (RPSs) and through regional offices in areas where RPSs do not
ext;t. These subsidies cover a variety of items ranging from fertilizer
(11%), spraying materials (5%), panel protection materials (25%), rain
guardirg materials (18%), sieves (50%), planting cups (15%), tapping knives
and template (50%), headlight, aluminum dish and latex can (25%). The average
subsidy level on each input has declined from about 20% in 1988/89 to nearly
14% in 1990/91.

8.    Planntinrg MeaiB.  The RB maintains nurseries - 8 in traditional areas
and 12 in non-traditional areas - to ensure availability of high yielding
planting materials at reasonable prices. Although production from these
nurseries is able to meet only about 15% of total annual requirements,
remainder coming from privately owned nurseries, supplies have a salutary
effect on quality and prl e. The planting materials raised in RB's nurseries
are made available to growers on a no loss - no profit basis, based on annual
cost analysis, which is carried out only for nurseries in traditional areas.
Prices so fixed are applied to planting materials sold from nurseries in non-
traditional areas. Under a separate scheme implemented by the RB, the very
small growers are provided planting materials at concessional prices, which
resulted in a total subsidy of only about Rs. 188,000 in 1990/91.
9.    Effectiveness of Planting Payments.  Planting grant is a highly
effective means of transferring new technology to smallholders because it
enforces an important measure of discipline that is unlikely to take place
through regular extension services alone. The grant is paid in installments
of both cash and kind over the development period of the crop (7 years). The
main problems in the administration of planting payments relate to: (a)
operating procedures which could be streamlined through reduction of forms and
computerization of payment and accounts at regional offices; and (b) combining
the extension service and administration of planting payments which would
improve their technical effectiveness but which are, at present, carried out
at supervisory level by different personnel.
Rubber Board's Achievement
10.   Overall klarfo manc .  The RB has grown into a successful organization
and its performance, whether measured in terms of achievement in area planted
to rubber, level of rubber productivity gains or in terms of administrative
efficiency, compares favorably with tree crop agencies in other countries.
Structurally, rubber cultivation in India is dominated by the smallholder
sector which accounts for some 82% of the total area and 79% of the aggregate
production. India has emterged as the fourth largest producer of natural
rubber and it stands second, next to Malaysia, in terms of productivity.
Until the end of March 1991, the RB's programmes heve enabled some 661,000
units to establish and improve their rubber (451,000 ha) on average more than
trebling their rubber yields from 365 kg to 1,076 kg/ha over the period 1961-
1991. Production of rubber which was 200,465 tons in 1985-86 rose
dramatically to 329,615 tons 4n 1990-91, representing an annual growth of
10.5% compared to 5.6% achieved during 1980-85. This was made possible
through a combination of an increase in harvested area and higher yield per
ha. Introduction of planting grants for new planting from 1979, together with
a favorable rubber price has stimulated a spurt in new planting. About 82,900
ha were newly planted and 25,500 ha replanted over the five-year period 1985-
86 to 1990-91. The. new plantings include 26,400 ha in non-traditional areas.
Annual replanting for 1987/88 to 1990/91 was on the upward trend of 4,800 ha
to 6,000 ha. Progress of new planting has passed through three development
phases - 1955 to 1963, 1964 to 1979 and 1980 onwards. Average annual new
plantings over this period have varied from 12,250 ha, to 5,150 ha and to
17,025 ha, depending mainly on rubber price fluctuations, promotional
activities in non-traditional areas and introduction of planting grant. The
average yield per ha has increased from 898 to 1,076 kg over this period, with
the smallholder yield going up from 834 to 1,048 kg. High yielding planting



-35-
Page 5 of 7
materials particularly the variety RR11 105 developed and released by the
Rubber Research Institute towards the end of 1970 have contributed to this
achievement. There is, however, scope for further improvement in yields.
11. Administrative Efficiency. The cost of administering planting payments
has tended to rise but it is comparatively low in relation to cost of
administration of similar programmes in other countries. A total of 165,660
inspection/extension visits has been carried out in 1990-91 by the field staff
of the Rubber Production Department. Given the total administrative expenses
of the Department in 1990-91 of Rs. 34.3 million, the average cost per
inspection is estimated at Rs. 208. A total of seven inspections are carried
out over seven years; the total cost of these is estimated at Rs. 1,456 per
participant in the scheme. The average area planted in that year per
applicant is estimated at 0.50 ha. In line with this, the administration cost
per ha works out to Rs. 2,912 or 7% per ha total planting costs. This
compares closely with Sri Lanka where administration costs as a percentage of
replanting costs (in 1988) were estimated at 7%. Based on the operations of a
Regional office (Kottayam) which carried out a total of 8,322 inspections in
1990-91, administration cost (Rs. 1,339 incurred in 1990-91) per ha is
estimated at 6.4% per ha total planting costs. This is lower than that of Sri
Lanka. If the total salary and pension costs of the RB (Rs. 50.0 million in
1990-91) are related to the area planted (13,650 ha), per ha cost works out to
Rs. 3,660 or 10.5% of planting cost, which compares favorably with 21% (in
1986) in Thailand.
StrengtheRning Institutional Ccpacity of the Rubber Board
12.   The proposed project would strengthen the operational capacity of the RB
by reorganization of the RB (Chart 2, a) and b)) and increasing the staff
(Table 3):
la)   Rubber Production :'e2artmrnt
(i)   Opening new field units - one zonal office at Agartala, 16
regional offices and 75 fie.'d offices. About 163 additional field
officers, junior field officers and administrative support staff
will be required to deal with a backlog of over 20,000 planting
applications, 63,000 ha new planting and replanting in traditional
areas and the 5,000 ha new planting in Tripura over the project
period. This is the minimum staff requirement based on the
assumption that each field officer deals with 600 individual
plantirgs each year, visiting an average of three holdings on each
of the 200 working days remaining after provision for weekends,
public holidays and annual leave.
(ii) Restructuring regional offices to provide services on an area
basis with the supervisory level officers combining the activities
of extension, inspection and support for RPSs. The above ratio of
staff to smallholdings will be achievable only through the
continued development of RPSs. An additional 1,500 RPSs will be
promoted during the project period.
(iii) Further decentralization of responsibilities by locating Deputy
Regional Production Cciumissioners (RPC) at selected regional
offices for quicker decision-making and supervision with



-36-
AumMPa 2
Page 6 of 7
associated changes in staffing levels and grades. Seven
supervisory units headed by Deputy RPCs will be appointed at seven
regional offices with each covering about five regional offices.
Each Deputy RPC will be assisted by one Development Officer, one
stenographer and a peon. The current scale of business of a
regional office is not sufficient to justify the upgrading of its
head (Development Officer) to the level of Deputy RPC.
(iv) Computerization of planting grant payments and accounts. It is
proposed to install a mini-computer system at the Central Office
and a personal computer system at the regional offices - 21 in
Kerala and 13 in other areas. This would allow regional offices
to process planting grant payments, maintain a data base on other
items like planting area, type of planting material, size of
holding etc., and forward rtonthly reports for consolidation at the
Central Office computer center. The regional offices are also
expected to process payroll and maintain their financial accounts
using the computer facilities. The computers will be installed in
a phased manner. Phase I in 1992-93 will involve the installation
of a mini-computer system at the Central Office and PCs, the
Departments of Rubber Production, Research and Administration, and
at two regional offices (Trivandrum and Ernakulam). Based on
implementation experience at these two regional offices, 10 more
regional offices will be provided with PCs under phase II
(1993-94). The remaining regional offices in Kerala (9) will be
provided PCs under phase III (1994-95). Provision of PCs to the
northeastern region will be studied and, if found appropriate, the
remaining regional offices will be provided with PCs in years
1995-96 and 1996-97.
(b) Proj nt Coordination Unit. Statiatins Planning and Monitoring and
evaluation
(v)   The newly established PCU would coordinate implementaion of the
project and monitor its problem. The PCU, which would be created
to monitor project activities, would help the departments to
prepare their annual work plans and budgets; undertake
procurement procedures; submit disbursement applications; and
prepare progress reports and project accounts. Semi-annual
reports on project progress would be submitted to IDA within two
months of the end of each hal:'-year.  It would also be responsible
for preparing the project completion report. It would operate in
close collaboration with the upgraded statistics, Planning and
Monitoring and Evaluation Department. A total of 16 incremental
higher level and support staff would be provided to these two
units, including statistician, agricultural economists, financial
analyst, sociologists, and computer programmer. The absence of
experience from comparable projects, inadequate socio-economic
data and the aim of the RB to develop technical solutions in
non-traditional areas require detailed monitoring and evaluation
of the proposed project. Assistance in project implementation
monitoring to PCU would be the responsibility of the Statistics
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Department. Essentially, it
would collate information from all departments involved on the
progress of individual components identify outstanding problems



-37-
AUMX 2
Page 7 of 7
and indicate possible solutions. The project would provide for a
more systematic monitoring of the RB's performance with emphasis
on: (a) the impact of the RB's planting scheme on the productivity
of smallholders in traditional and non-traditional areas; and (b)
the impact and effectiveness of various schemes providing
financial assistance. In addition, base-line data on
participating smallholders will be collected covering information
which includes: (a) area, number of plots, age of trees, yield and
prices received for rubber; (b) area of other crops; (c) income,
by sources; (d) number of workers in the family; (e) hired labor
and other inputs in rubber production; and (f) slope, soil type,
distance from road and previous land use of planting areas. This
information would be gathered in respect of new planters and
replanters.
(c)   Training Department
(vi) This department to be headed by Director would be provided with 16
incremental staff including a training specialist, Subject Matter
Specialists and support personnel. Details of training program to
be covered and operational stabilities are given in Annex 9.
(d)   Rubber Research Institute of Tndia (RRII)
(vii) RRII would be provided with 62 incremental scientific and support
staff to strengthen regional field stations, especially in the non-
traditional areas, biotechnology, soil and leaf analysis
laboratories, statistics, agricultural economics and computer
support facilities. Key research programs to be supported under
the project are discussed in Annex 7.
(e) Rubber Proeessing and Product Development Department (RPPDD)
(viii) RPPDD would have 18 incremental staff primarily to strengthen its
capacity to provide technical advise/support to small scale rubber
good manufacturers. Over the years a very large number of small
manufacturing units have entered the business with no technical
backing or knowledge to maintain and improve quality or develop
new products. With increased staff strength and training, RPPDD
would help to bridge this gap.

RUBBER PROJECT
Project Areas
Traditional rubber Growing Areas
1.    Agro-climatically, the best location for rubber cultivation in India is
the foothill region of Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu at the southern tip
of the Indian peninsula. As one moves northwards and away from the equator
and along the west coast in Kerala, the soils become less fertile and the
climate more seasonal. Some of the major and potential rubber growing areas
are summarized below, in a generally south to north direction.
Traditional Areas
2.    Kanyakumari District. Tamil Nadu.  The annual rainfall is about 1,900 mm
evenly distributed over 12 months. Laterite, lateritic and red soils are
generally deep and relatively fertile. Available magnesium is good.
Incidence of powdery mildew is severe for rubber.
3.    Thiruvanathapuram (Trivandarum   nd Kol1am 10Ui1nn  Districts, Kerala.
Annual rainfall ranges from 2,000 mm to 3,000 mm. June-July rains are heavy
enough to cause incidence of abnormal leaf fall disease. January and February
are dry. Soils are laterite, lateritic and red loamy types, comparatively
rich in nutrients.
4.         namthitta. Allepay. Kottayam. Idukki (21ainsl. Ernakulam region.
Kerala. The traditional rubber growing region of India. 3,000 to 4,000 mm of
rain each year, mostly during the southwest monsoon in June and July.
However, only December to March is dry and hot. Soils are largely of laterite
type and comparatively poor in available plant nutrient status and notably of
magnesium. Heavy incidence of abnormal leaf fall.
5.    Palakkad (Palghat) and Thrisnur (Trichur) Districts. KerOWA. 3,000 to
3,500 mm of rain per year. Wet and dry seasons are pronounced. Subject to
strong dry winds during November-December when growth and yield of rubber
suffer. Abnormal leaf fall occurs, but not severely. Soils are laterite and
lateritic and well supplied with nutrients, particl"arly magnesium.
6.    Malappuram. Kozhikode (Calicut) and Kannur (Cannanore) Districts.
Eazala. 3,200 to 3,400 mm of rain per year, 80-90% from June to September.
Northeast monsoon is weak. Prolonged and intense drought December to mid-May.
Soils are laterite and lateritic types, highly leached and deficient in
available plant nutrients other than magnesium.
7.    Tdukki (high ranges} and Wynad region. Kerala.  High elevation areas
400-1,000 m above sea level. Rainfall in Idukki high ranges around 4,000 mm
distributed more or lesa as in the central Kerala region. In Wynad low
temperature and hanging mists are common during November-February. soils are
lateritic and loamy. Rubber trees are subject to incidence of both abnormal
leaf fall and powdery mildew. The high elevation results in slow growth, poor
regeneration of bark on tapping and overall reduced yield.

ANNEX 3

Nnn-Traditional Areas
8.    Tripura.  Tripura is the main non-traditional state proposed for the
project, and, based on the 17,000 ha already planted, will overtake Tamil Nadu
as India's second largest producer of natural rubber by the end of the
century. Although Tripura is still classified as a non-traditional area, it
is now confirmed that rubber trees are well adapted to the local environment.
Soils are derived mostly from sandstone and shale parent materials and are
deep. Available plant nutrients are generally low. Annual rainfall is 2,000
to 2,500 mm distributed over 8 to 9 months. There are five relatively dry
months, but some rain falls every month. Altitude is not an issue as
virtually all rubber areas are below 200 m. Minimum temperatures in winter
(10 to 14 degrees C for about two weeks), while lower than in Kerala, are
acceptable, and, because of the protection of the Himalayas, warmer than
rubber areas at the same latitude in other countries such as China. In fact,
wintering of rubber trees in Tripura may have some positive impact because the
defoliation/refoliation period coincides with the dry season and thus may be a
factor causing a demonstrable lower incidence of rubber diseases compared to
southern India. Wind damage is the main potential natural hazard and should
be ameliorated over the longer term by the development of wind resistant
clones. Another problem observable in Tripura is Imperata, a pernicious
grassy weed also known as alang-alang or thatch grass. Fortunately, this can
be controlled through good establishment of a leguminous cover crop with some
assistance from herbicides at the time of planting. An unavoidable factor in
Tripura is that rubber will largely be a new crop; thus smallholder
performance is unlikely to be as high as in Kerala. Although on-farm training
will be a Rubber Board priority in Tripura, it is possible that the lower
level of smallholder expertise will adversely affect yields. Overall yields
in Tripura may average 10% less than in Kerala and tapping may start 12 months
later, which would still provide acceptable financial and economic returns.
Rubber planting in Tripura would largely be on land degraded by slash and burn
njhumiya" shifting cultivation.
Other Non-traditional Areas
9.    Dakshin Kannada, Uttara Kannada region in Karnataka.  The main rubber
growing region in Karnataka. Rainfall is heavy 4,000-7,000 mm per year,
mostly from end May to early December. The northeast monsoon is weak and the
remaining months are dry and hot. Soils are lateritic and gravelly and rather
poor in available nutrients except magnesium. Limited irrigation for young
rubber helps in promoting growth.
10. Goa and South Konkan region in Maharashtra. 3,500 to 5,000 mm of rain
during June-November. Remaining months dry. Heavy downpours during June-
August when abnormal leaf fall is heavy. March to may very hot. Soils are of
basaltic origin, coarse, often gravelly and slightly acidic or neutral in
reaction. Irrigation is essential during early years for proper establishment
and growth of rubber.
11.   Orissa. coastal Andh                     ar nistrint in Madhya PradAsh.
Soils are generally of lateritic types or red loamy types and poor to fair in
available nutrients. Rainfall is 1,400 to 1,700 mm per year obtained from
both southwest and northeast monsoons during June-December. Occasional off
season drizzles also occur. However, the period from January to May is
genarally dry and March to May is very hot. Irrigation for young rubber



-54-                         ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 3
highly desirable for proper establishment and growth. Fungal disease3 or
pests affecting rubber are uncommon.
12.   Othgr northas st Late. Proposed rubber areas are mostly in the
Brahmaputra and Barak river valley areas in the Tropic of Cancer region, thus
experiencing mild winters as in Tripura. Soils are loamy to clayey loam
types, deep and fairly fertile. At elevations higher than 500 m in the high
hills and plateaus, the low temperature and other deleterious effects severely
inhibit growth and yield of rubber. Annual rainfall is generally 2,500-3,500
mm, although limited locations on the southern slopes of Shillong hills in
Meghalaya and in Cherrapunji receive far more. The wet season lasts 8 months
and dry season temperatures are moderate. Abnormal leaf fall is present but
mild. Powdery mildew also occurs at elevations above 300 m, Winds are not
usually a problem, but hailatorms can cause damage to young rubber.

RUBBER PROJECT
Rubber  Cultivation  Technoloay
1.    Detailed technical recommendations for the cultivation of rubber in
India are described in the "Rubber Grower's Companion", which is published
annually by the Rubber Board and widely distributed to Indian rubber growers.
Particular attention would be given under the project to the implementation of
the following cultural practices.
Planting Material
2.    Clone Selection.  For the past several years, the Rubber Board has
recommended RRII 105, RRIM 600 and GT1 clones (Category I) for large scale
planting of up to 80 percent of the area of any holding or estate, the balance
consisting of Category II clones (such as _) not to exceed 20 percent whether
singly or in aggregate. Experience over the last ten years has shown that
growers, particularly small farmers, have almost exclusively been planting
RRII 105. Such an extensive use of one clone could present serious risks in
the case of epidemics of specific diseases. Moreover, RRII 105 presents some
c'efects such as susceptibility to Pink Disease, panel dryness, and declining
yield on renewed bark. To break the monoclonal continuity and reduce the use
of RRII 105, the Rubber Board revised its planting recommendations in 1991 to
promote multiclonal planting with no single clone to cover more than 50
percent of any holding or estate and the blend to be done either in separate
blocks or in the same field. Whereas the project would support multiclonal
planting in separate blocks, clonal mixing at the field level should only be
used on a limited scale, in view of: (i) the possibility of breakdown of
resistance of tolerant clones to specific diseases through enhanced exposure
to inoculum pressure in mixed planting of tolerant and susceptible clones;
(ii) the difficulties of implementing preventive disease control treatments;
and, (iii) the hinderance to the future adoption of tapping systems adapted to
specific clones, based on the combination of reduced tapping frequency with
stimulation. On very small holdings (less than one hectare) where multiclonal
planting in separate blocks may be difficult to implement, only a maximum of
20 percent of the trees would be from a different clone.
3.    greparation of Planting Material.  Traditionally, smallholders use 10-12
month bare root budded stumps for planting which they procure from private
nurseries. This method is only advantageous if soil moisture is sufficient to
enable the root system to develop rapidly after planting. Under Indian
climatic conditions, the casualties can be very high, usually resulting in
heterogeneous blocks when replacements are only done partially or too late.
However casualties can be minimized with polybag planting material, as the
root system is not disturbed during transplanting in the field. Polybag
plants, which are usually also raised in private nurseries, are prepared
either directly from stock seedlings (issued from seeds) which are later
budgrafted or from greenbudded stumps raised in the ground and transplanted in
the bags. With polybag plants, a more regular tree stand can be obtained,
resulting in a shorter immaturity period and a higher production potential for

the holding. As this method is still not widely practiced, the Rubber Board
would continue under the project to promote the use of polybagged planting
material through the provision of a polybag subsidy to farmers.
Plantation Establishmant
4.    Plranting Density.  Whereas the production per tree is the most important
factor for commercial estates or smallholdings using hired labor for tapping,
- as profitability depends on labor productivity -, the production per unit
area, which results from the combination of production per tree and number of
trees, is the key parameter for farmers tapping their own rubber plantations,
as their income depends on the total amount of production from their holding.
Density trials carried out in different rubber producing countries have shown'
that the optimum number of trees to maximize the production per unit area is
generally around 400 trees per hectare at the time of commencing tapping.
Planting density should therefore be determined with the aim of obtaining 400
tappable trees at maturity, taking into account the expected loss of trees
during the immature period under local agro climatic conditions, due to
diseases, wind damage or other causes. The Rubber Board currently recommends
a planting density of 420 to 450 trees per hectare, with an upper limit of 500
trees/ha. The initial density of 445 trees per hectare may be insufficient to
ensure that under most conditions 400 trees will be tappable at maturity. It
was agreed that farmers would be allowed to plant up to 500 trees/ha under the
project, which would ensure availability of the optimum number of 400
trees/ha for tapping at maturity.
5.    Cover Crop.  In line with traditional plantation practices, Legume cover
crop (LCC) would be established in the interrow at the time of planting, to
control weeds and soil erosion, raise soil fertility through the fixation of
atmospheric nitrogen, and keep soil moisture during the dry season (mulch) and
lower soil temperature during the summer.  The most commonly used legume would
be Pueraria Phaseolides, which is easy to establish from seeds or cuttings,
grows very vigorously under Indian conditions and covers the soil in a short
time, smothering all weeds, including Eupatorium. As Pueraria dies in the
shade 4 to 5 years after planting, when tree canopies close, the shade
tolerant Calopogonium mucunoides and Ce.trosema Pubescens to be used in a
mixture with Pueraria would provide a persistant cover. A wild legume Mucuna
bracteata collected in Tripura has been introduced to Kerala by the RRII and
found to be drought resistant and shade tolerant. It also has the advantage
of growing fast, suppressing all weeds, and of not being eaten by cattle and
it appears to have high nitrogen fixing capacity. However, Mucuna is
difficult to establish in South India as it only produces seeds under climatic
conditions prevalent in Tripura. In South India, it must be propagated from
cuttings. RRII would continue work on the development of rapid multiplication
of MuSuna bra teata to enable its evaluation for large scale use in rubber
holdings.
6.    Erosion Control.  Under high rainfall conditions, soil erosion cannot be
fully controlled with LCC on steep slopes. Recent experierce in other major
rubber producing countries in Asia has shown the potential effectiveness of
Vetiver hedges established at the time of planting to control surface erosion,
and it was agreed that the Rubber Board would test the effectiveness of
Vetiver hedges under the agro climatic conditions prevalent in the rubber
growing areas.



-57-
Page 3 of 5
Plantation Upkeep
7.   kWeding.  Weed control is essential to prevent competition with the
rubber plants for soil nutrients, moisture and light. The main weeds are
EupatoriUM odoraUm, Mimosa pudica and Imperata cylindrica and can be
controlled through the establishment of legume cover crop and by manual
weeding. Herbicides are rarely used by smallholders under Indian conditions.
8.    Fertilization.  The effects of fertilizer applications on tree growth
during the immaturity period have generally been well demonstrated in India
and most rubber producing countries, while the effects of manuring on rubber
yield levels during the maturity period are not as clear except in specific
cases of severe soil nutrient deficiencies or imbalances. The Rubber Board
currently recommends country wide blanket fertilizer applications for
nurseries, immature and mature rubber, irrespective of soil types or regional
climatic conditions. Recent research by the RRII, however, has demonstrated
the benefits on growth and yield of using discriminatory fertilizer
applications. Under this approach, quantities of fertilizer to be applied are
determined based on the results of soil and leaf analsysis, and are usually
lower than the blanket recommendations, avoiding or correcting nutrient
imbalances, which can depress yields. In view of these results, RRII
recommends the use of discriminatory fertilizer applications, which would be
promoted under the productivity enhancement component (see Annex 7).
9.    The coverage under the discriminatory fertilizer application system,
however, would not be extended to the country's 600,000 smallholders as: (i)
heavy investments would be required to establish large numbers of additional
laboratories; (ii) the majority of ruibber growing soils in India belong to the
laterite and lateritic types which only show little variation in their
fertility status and do not warrant individual soil analysis; and, (iii) as
indicated above, yield response to fertilizer applications during maturity has
not been clearly demonstrated under all conditions. It was therefore agreed
that the Rubber Board would follow a different, less costly approach, which
would benefit all smallholders and would consist in the development of
regional/local fertilizer recommendations for the main soil categories and
agroclimatic zones. When fully developed, the use of individual analyses for
the determination of discriminatory fertilizer applications under this
approach would be restricted to large holdings or estates and to problem
areas.
10.   Plant Protection.  Rubber trees in the high rainfall areas of South
India are subjected during the Monsoon season to Abnormal leaf fall disease,
caused by the fungus Phvtophtora s=p. Whereas the most widely planted clone,
RRII 105, is fairly tolerant to the disease, Phytophtora can cause the
complete defoliation and dieback of young shoots of susceptible clones such as
RRIM 600, resulting in slow growth and longer immaturity and lower yields (by
30 to 50%). The disease, however, can be effectively controlled through
prophylactic spraying of the foliage before the onset of the monsoon, with
either high volume, water based Bordeaux mixture (1 kg copper sulfate + 1 kg
quick lime per 100 1 of water) or low volume, oil based copper oxyclhoride.
Whereas large estates undertake systematic aerial spraying, small scattered
holdings cannot be sprayed by air but can only be sprayed from the ground,
either manually or with power sprayers. As manual spraying requires large
amounts of water, which may not be available during the dry spraying season,



-58-
Page 4 of 5
and large labor inputs, and power sprayers are too costly for smallholders,
the project would assist the RPSs to procure power sprayers and would promote
their systematic use under the productivity enhancement program. With
tolerant clones, spraying is either fully avoided or, during a year of severe
disease incidence, one spray round may be sufficient. Under the project new
plantings would mainly be with tolerant clones which would permit reduction or
avoidance of fungicide use. The second disease of importance is the pink
disease of stem caused by Corticium salmonicolor. If detected early, use of
bordeaux mixture paste prevents further build-up of the disease. A more
effective treatment is painting of affected surface with formulations
containing fungicide tridemorph, a compound with good safety record. The
third disease of some significance is the black stripe of stem caused by
Phytopthora plamivora. An effective treatment is painting of bark with
formulations based on mancozeb.
11.   Tapoing Systems.  All rubber trees in India, whether on smallholdings or
estates, are tapped according to the traditional half spiral, alternate daily
tapping system (S/2, D/2), which requires high labor inputs (trees are tapped
every other day) and has been shown in other rubber producing countries not to
exploit the full production potential of the trees. Early research results in
Malaysia and India showed that the chemical stimulation with ethrel of trees
exploited with the traditional tapping system led to temporary yield incresase
followed by a decline due to the exhaustion of the trees. The experience with
ethrel stimulation in West Africa, however, has shown that when the tapping
frequency is reduced, stimulation can be used sustainably to increase
productivity without any long term adverse effects on yields. These
stimulation based reduced frequency tapping systems, which have been practiced
for at least 15 years on all rubber plantations in Ivory Coast, Cameroon and
Gabon, give higher yields and require less labor inputs (trees are tapped with
a lower frequency, such as every third, fourth, or even fifth day). In view
of the potential impact of such technology on the rubber subsector, the
project would provide assistance to RRII to increase research on tapping
systems with ethrel stimulation. In particular, to accelerate the evaluation
of such technology and its future transfer to India, the project would assist
RRII to establish demonstration blocks on selected private estates and
smallholdings to test under Indian conditions the stimulation based reduced
frequency tapping systems developed in West Africa.
12.   Tapping Tools.  Tapping knives used in India are designed for precision
tapping (the Michie Golledge type) but are time consuming in their use and
only fit for tapping at low heights. Under the productivity enhancement
component, the project would promote the use of Jebong type knives, which are
widely used in Malaysia and other rubber producing countries and allow easier
and quicker tapping, therefore enabling the coverage of larger tasks per
tapper per day, - up to 500 trees instead of the normal 300 trees per day in
India. Jebong knives also enable higher level tapping without using
cumbersome ladders.



-59-
Page 5 of 5
13.   USa of Chgamical Stimulant in Old Plantations. While RRII would test
stimulation based reduced frequency tapping systems under Indian conditions,
the Rubber Board would promote, under the productivity enhancement component,
the use of ethrel stimulation to increase the latex production of old trees
three to five years before their felling.
14.  Rain_Guara. Excluding weekly and other holidays, and the refoliation
period when latex production and flow are at their lowest during which estates
normally stop tapping to take up various annual maintenance work required, the
total number of tapping days in a year is around 280 on estates. Under the
standard, traditional S/2, D/2 tapping system, each tree or block of trees is
therefore tapped for 140 days. In small holdings, tapping is also generally
stopped during the heavy rains, reducing the number of tapping days to about
170 to 190 in a year. By attaching polythene sheets (rainguards) to the trees
above the tapping cut, it is possible to protect the tapping panel from the
rains and tap the trees during the rainy season, thereby gaining additional 30
to 40 tapping days per year. Although adopted by large estates, rainguarding
is not practiced by smallholders due to its cost (about Rs.2.50/tree), and the
unsubstantiated fear that rainguards may cause damage to the panel or
uncontrollable fungal diseases. The project would promote the use of
rainguards in the high rainfall areas of South India under the productivity
enhancement component.
15.   Xials.  Project yield estimates are presented in the attached table.
It is assumed that the average immaturity period would last six years in the
traditional areas but seven years in Tripura due to less favorable local
climatic conditions (see Annex 3). With improved planting material and better
plantation practices, it is assumed that the yields of rubber planted in the
traditional areas under the project would average around 1,250 kg/ha during 23
years of exploitation, -against the current national average of around 1,050
kg/ha -, with a peak of 1,550 kg/ha; and around 1,140 kg/ha with a peak of
1,400 kg/ha in Tripura.

RUBBER PROCESSING
World Production Trends
Natural rubber is marketed in many different forms which include:
ribbed smoked sheets (RSS) also described in India as Rubber Manufacturers
Association (RHA) Specified Sheets, Technically Specified Rubber (TSR) also
described in India as Indian Specified Natural Rubber (ISNR) concentrate
(centrifuged) latex and others (pale crepe, brown crepe, creamed latex).
Amongst RSS group there are 5 grades (1 to 5) the highest quality is
RSS 1, but the consumption of this grade has been reduced dramatically over
the years, and it is at present only consumed by the major tire manufacturers
for specialized products and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The
grade that is primarily produced is RSS 3 which is consumed to a large extent
by the tire industry in competition with TSR 20 (and TSR 10 to a limited
extent). RSS 3 and TSR 20 are the two grades demanded by the tire
manufacturing industry, and both in supply and price they may be equated.
These two grades will remain the major commercial grades demanded by the tire
industry, the largest consumer of processed rubber.
The price differential between higher graded processed rubber and the
other grades is marginal, due to an over supply of higher grades (TSR
especially) and the increasing demand for lower grades. This situation may
worsen with the development of a large number of TSR factories in Indonesia,
Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. The demand for RSS 1 may further decline as
the East European market changes.
Indian Production Trends
Indian production by grades at present is as follows: RSS 71%; TSR/ISNR
production is of latex grades and grade 20 - 5-7%; and centrifuge latex - 10-
12%; others (pale) - 12%.
The estimated breakdown of different grades of RHA sheets is: RMA 1 and
2 - 15-20%; and RHA 4 - 50-55%; RMA 5 - 15% and the off grade sheets - 10% to
15%. TSR production is of grade 20 and under others pale crepe and creamed
latex account for around 1% each and brown crepe for the remaining 10%.
Consum"tion Trends
Indian rubber industry at present mainly caters for the relatively large
domestic market. The demand for processed rubber is divided into two main
sectors : the automotive tire industry consuming primarily the higher quality
processed rubber, and the other sectors which include cycle tires, footwear,
belts and hoses, camel backs, latex foams, cables and wires, battery boxes and
medicinal products. In the past five years, the demand, from these two groups
of users in terms of proportion of the overall production, has more or less
remained constant as shown below:

The estimated number of processing facilities in India are, excluding
those in the estate sector, are:
Technically Specified Rubber (TSR)
factories:                             25 units - 10 ton/day capacity
Crepe factories:                          110 units -
*RJbbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) factories:   18 very small units/smallholder
units
Pale crepe factories:                     2 units in cooperative sector
Centrifuge latex factories:               44 units with 102 machines
Cre&med latex factories:                  28 units and other smaller units
*Excludes artesinal sheet production by smallholders which accounts for
a very high proportion of RSS production in the country.
The current capacity utilization of these processing facilities is very
low. Around 27% for TSR factories and 53% for centrifuge latex factories.
Oqality Aapg=
Quality of processed rubber in India requires considerable improvement
when compared to other major producing countries. The main features of the
processing industry in Indi4 are: the average to low quality of latex
concentrate; poor quality and limited acceptance by the market of block
rubber; inconsistent quality of sheet rubber, but good acceptance for sheet
and crepe rubber by the local industry.
RSS prodtlrtion: RSS production accounts for about 70% of total Indian
production. Most of these sheets are produced by smallholders, and they are
totally or partially dried and smoked. The sheet are sold to dealers as
ungraded sheets. Some grading is undertaken by the dealers with limited
clipping.' Hence, it is difficult to obtain good quality RMA 4 and 5 sheets.
TSR production: In India there is a lack of consistency in the finished
TSR product. The level of technology is generally poor and unadapted to the
type of raw material available compared to other major producing countries,
Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. This is probably one of the reasons for the
low demand for the product. It is important for the production of good
quality TSR that the end users are consulted in order to meet the processing
requirements, which is not done in India at present.



-63-
ANNEJL 5
Page 3 of 4
Crepe productinn: The quality of crepe is dependent on the mix of raw
material together with the amount of milling. In other major producing
countries TSR factories have been substituted for crepe factories. There does
not seem to be any quality prob'.ems in India for crepe and the production is
consumed entirely by the tire industry.
Centrifuge latex Larodution: The quality is related to: a) quality of
field latex; b) storage time of field latex; c) dry rubber content (DRC) of
field latex at time of centrifugation; d) time of bulk maturation; and e)
chemical treatment after centrifugation. The quality of centrifuge latex
could be termed "average" in India.
Future Trends
Based on world trends and the domestic demand situation, the trend in
the Indian production is projected to be as follows: (a) 60% sheet rubber
(part of it being remilled as TSR/ISNR 20); (ii) 10% to 12% of centrifuged
latex (CENEX); (iii) a maximum of 6% to 7% of latex TSR/ISNR grades, latex
crepes and creamed latex; and (iv) 15% to 20% of field coagulums and scraps to
be converted in brown crepe or TSR/ISNR 10-/20.
In general, it is likely that the production of high quality grades
would be limited as industries at present do not require large amounts of
these grades. The main focus would be to improve the average quality of RMA,
CENEX and TSR/ISNR grades and develop a TSR/SNR 20 grade of a much higher
standard than the present one.
The Project Prol2onal
The proposed Project, takes into account the factors outlined above and
would include provision for a number of factories that will be phased out over
the life of the Project, guidelines for the selection of investment proposals
taking into account the short/medium term demand for the different forms of
processed rubber (Attachment 1). Additionally, to respond the changing
patterns of market demand, the proposed factories would have flexibility to
increase processing capacity. A large number of these factories will be
operated by the private sector. Selection of the private sector beneficiaries
will be made by a committee composed of 6 members including a chairman. The
committee will include - the chairman (RB chairman project coordinator, 2 RB
representatives, 3 representatives of producer associations. The composition
of the committee may change to include the relevant persons from the RB and
producer associations. The committee will review each case taking into
account the need for additional processing and production capacity in the
area; the financial strength of each candidate, the management capability, the
technical aspects of each proposal, and latest information on market demand.
Tvn  of Factoriea to be Finance
Cenrifuge oatex Factories: There is at present over production of
centrifuge latex hence investment of additional processing factories will be
made during the last phase of project implementation. The Rubber Board will
continuously monitor the demand and provide license to the private sector
accordingly. The overall design of current factories is such that they can
easily take up to additional three machines over and above the three they hold
at present.  Provision has been made under the Project for 3 centrifuge latex



-64-
AMMNZX5S
Page 4 of 4
factories with 3 machines and 20 additional centrifuge machines for the
existing factories. After centrifugation, concentrate latex is stored in bulk
for a limited time and then transferred to drums. It is important for good
quality product to allow a longer bulk maturation of the concentrate latex.
For this the factory has to have adequate bulk storage facilities so that
storage in drums is after the latex has reached the required quality level.
Ideally, the latex should be stored in bulk until its mechanical stability has
reached an acceptable level. Provision for twenty bulk storage facilities
with stirrers to ensure homogenization has been made for twenty factories
under the Project.
TSR/IS14R FactoriJa: The Project will provide for 10 combined
latex/field coagulum factories. The factories are expected to be designed so
that they may produce various grades of TSR/ISNR which include: a) TSR/ISNR
grades out of field latex coagulated directly in the factory. The capacity of
coagulation being of approximately one third of factory capacity, with
possibility of extension; b) TSR grades out of latex coagulated outside the
factory; c) TSR 20 grade processed out of field coagulums; d) TSR 20 grade
processed out of a blend of field coagulums and poor quality RMA sheets. To
ensure better quality of TSR grades, it is necessary to improve the design of
the factories (in relation to the available raw materials) and to introduce
new types of equipment (developed in Malaysia) in the past ten years. The
existing Rubber Boards pilot factory, which is out of date, would be improved
with imported equipment for training and development activities. Provision
has also been made to convert existing crepe mills of small capacity into
larger sized block rubber factories (10/12 tons per day capacity) as in the
future TER would be in greater demand than crepe, although at present crepe
production seems to be economical and marketing is not a problem.
Shoot Produetion: A limited number of 500 kg/day capacity of sheet
factories would be developed in some remote areas, e.g. in Tripura. In other
areas the smallholders would continue to produce artesinal sheets as it is
more economical, with emphasis on improving the quality of the final product.
This would be achieved through technical assistance to smallholders in
improved methods of smoking and drying of sheets. RPSs and NGOs would under
the guidance of the Rubber Board (see below) be encouraged to assist
smallholders in the development of pilot units for re-processing of sheets
(washing, smoking, grading!.

RUBBER PROJECT
Research Component
ahe Rubber             ntItutk of India _       Rfl 
The RRII is headquartered at Kottayam in Kerala, and is headed by a
Director of Research. Research programs are carried out under eight
divisions: Agronomy and Soils, Biotechnology, Botany, Germplasm, Mycology and
Plant Pathology, Plant Physiology and Exploitation, Rubber Chemistry, Physics
and Technology, and Agricultural Economics. The RRII has a large network of
research stations throughout India, including: its main station (255 ha) in
Chethackal, Kerala; the research complex for the North East with stations in
Tripura, Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram; regional stations in West Bengal,
Maharashtra and Orissa; and breeding substations in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
The RRII is a member of the International Rubber Research and
Development Board (IRRDB) which groups 15 research institutes working on the
development of natural rubber throughout the world. IRRDB has established
five technical committees on breeding, physiology and exploitation,
phytopathology, socio-economics, and technology. These enable specialists
from all Institutes to exchange results at regular scientific meetings.
With its broad scope of research programs, its comprehensive network
of regional stations and well established international links, the RRII is
able to assist the development of natural rubber in India. The project would
provide support for the following priority research programs.
Reaea~h Pogram   tnhe flUcpRt undr t-he Pret
1. Expintatfien
1.1.    The program envisaged would support the project's productivity
enhancement component. The results, however, would considerably exceed the 5-
year project framework and would be applicable to the entire Indian rubber
sector.
1.2     Objecties,.  The aim of the exploitation program would be to modernize
rubber tree exploitation techniques by:
(i)   first, developing tapping systems which take into account: clonal
characteristic; eco-climatic conditions of plantations;
stimulation, in particular the danger of high tapping frequency
for clones sensitive to brown bast; the need to maximize
production in the final years of the life of the trees; the
existence of "revolutionary" tapping systems such as Hypodermic
Latex Extraction (HLE) (to be tested); the problem of production
losses due to the rains (use of rainguards); and,
(ii)   second, establishing a system for the regular monitoring of tapped
rubber trees by analyzing various physiological parameters of



-70-
Page 2 of 9
latex in representative samples. This method ensures that the
tapping system is suited to the physiological condition of the
tree, that is to say that it leads to optimum exploitation, and
neither to over-tapping (with a risk of lost yield through brown
bast), nor under-tapping (with lost production because the
potential of the trees is not fully used).
1.3     To achieve these objectives, tCe RRII would need to:
-  acquire the latex diagnosis technique from the IRRDB institutes
which use it;
-  determine the reference parameters for the Indian clones;
-  make new analysis methods operational (latex diagnosis
laboratories);
-  try to see how to apply the method (developed for large estates)
to the monitoring of some 500,000 Indian smallholdings.
2.   Clna   Uay.lutifnl
2.1      Only 3 clones are used in the main rubber-producing region in India -
Kerala - and one of them (RRII 105) is used in nearly 80% of newly planted
smallholdings. The situation is almost one of monoculture, with all the risks
involved. It is therefore necessary to introduce greater clonal diversity in
plantations in Kerala.
2.2      The natural rubber requirements of Indian industry are also
increasing rapidly, and Kerala can no longer provide new rubber-growing land
and this mtust be sought elsewhere. There is land which could be used for
rubber-grAwing, especially in the NE (Tripura and other regions), and also in
other zones but where the eco-climatic conditions require suitable clones and,
if necessary, cultural techniques to "help" adaptation. The project alone
represents 70,000 ha of plantings to be completed in 5 years, 12,000 ha of
which are in non-traditional zones. It is obviously important to be able to
cover under satisfactory conditions (including full guarantee of clone
authenticity among other things) the requirements of the "clone
diversification", "performance" and "adaptability" of the plant material in a
given eco-climatic situation.
2.3     ghRj*tives.  The aim of the clonal evaluation program would be to
offer smallholders a varied range of tested clones both in traditional and non-
traditional zones, accompanied if necessary with a minimum amount of
information on the cultivation practices best-suited to each of them.
2.4      The program would consist of:
(i)   first, statistical studies, in particular the following
- the systematic review of annual record sheets of data on
plantation blocks (estates) and records of the "good" results
obtained (site features, clones, densities, etc.);
- the comparison of available clones and plant material used in
planting programs in India and other main rubber-producing
countries;
-  the compilation of lists of foreign clones whose early
introduction in India could be envisaged and taking the first



-71-
Page 3 of 9
steps for this with the countries concerned; and
(ii)   second, simultaneously with the intensification of national
breeding programs to be carried out at various locations
(including a germplasm section):
- the setting up of a network of comparative clone field trials
(for both Indian and imported clones) in both traditional and
non-traditional zones (with a tissue culture section); and
- the study of a few special "marginal" cases (irrigation of
young rubber trees, planting mixtures of clones, etc.);
(iii)    finally, the development of clonal identification technique, based
on the use of electrophoresis, to ensure that the genetic
authenticity of planting material is maintained. This
authenticity is particularly vulnerable as about a hundred
thousand fairly scattered smallholders must be supplied from a
"cascade" of private bud wood gardens.
3.     _to_hnnoay  -  'im
3.1      The prospects offered by tissue culture (better "true-to-type" copies
of mother trees than those obtained by bud grafting) have led most IRRDB
member-institutes to undertake research on the subject. The RRII is one of
these, and has just established, at its main center at Kottayam, a large
laboratory where work on both microcuttings and somatic embryogenesis (from
both fruits and flowers) can be carried out. Several vitroplants of known
clones, classically used for bud grafting, have even been planted in recent
years (2 or 3 hectares).
3.2     Although the RRII is making progress, much remains to be done,
especially in the following areas:
-  the choice of genotypes to be used for tissue culture.  The major
clones should obviously be tried but it would also be interesting
to search the old control books for the mother trees, which showed
high performance;
-  large-scale multiplication (using microcuttings and somatic
embryogenesis);
-  the hardening-off of vitroplants before they ar.e planted out and
their satisfactory state of health; and,
-  the field monitoring of the improvement contributed by tissue
culture in comparison with bud grafting.
3.3      It would be necessary to verify the satisfactory results of tissue
culture before starting large-scale operations, and it is unlikely that tissue
culture would be used to a great extent in the project. The important thing
is that the program of 70,000 ha of new plantings and replantings in 5 years
should be used - if RRII does not possess the land required - for starting to
plant a few areas (experimental but nonetheless significant) with vitroplants
and making elementary comparisons:
-  between clonal vitroplants (clone classification is not



-72-
Ai-X 7
Page 4 of 9
necessarily the same under "bud grafted" and "vitroplant"
conditions); and,
- between the performances in a given clone of bud grafted plants
and vitroplants and among vitroplants between material grown from
microcuttings and from somatic embryogenesis.
3.4     Objegtivea.  The Biotechnology Division should aim at producing
sufficient quantities (if not yet on a large scale) of vitroplants of known
clones using one or other of the techniques and planting them in field trials
to compare their performance with bud grafted material, and with each other.
These experiments should be replicated in the main rubber-growing zones in
India and non traditional areas.
3.5     The project would strengthen the facilities of the Division both at
the main center in Kottayam and at RRII regional stations, and especially at
Agartala station in Tripura. The following would be required:
- buildings (greenhouses, hardening facilities, etc.);
- laboratory equipment to increase vitroplant production (from both
microcuttings and somatic embryogenesis);
- field testing of these clonal vitroplants in the main rubber-
growing areas in India (in the absence of available land, the RRII
will doubtless have to draw up agreements with "motivated"
planters under the project); and,
- the rapid transport of vitroplants from the production laboratory
(Kottayam) to the various hardening-off units scattereQ around the
country near the plantation sites.
4.  9.aUl;.az
4.1    The 8 million hectares of rubber trees in the world today originate
from only 22 plants. In order to inject "new blood" into rubber tree clone
breeding, which was not making enormous progress, IRRDB organized the
collection of new material in the Amazon basin in 1981. The genotypes
collected were distributed between an Asian center in Malaysia and an African
Center in Cote d'Ivoire (with 12,000 and 2,000 genotypes respectively today).
The RRII obtained 5,000 genotypes which are kept at Kottayam. A small number
was also sent to a non-traditional zone (Tripura).
4.2    Ohjertives.  The aim of the germplasm program would be to use the new
genotypes in breeding operations in the beat possible way. The preliminary
approach consists of observing it in its present state in a comparative field
trial with several classic clones as controls.  Although there is little
likelihood of finding remarkable genotypes, the experiment is of interest.
Some seeds produced from the mixing of Amazon and Wickham parents can be
collected and overall performance can soon be seen (sensitivity to leaf
diseases, bark quality or technological features of rubber) in the hope of
using these genotypes as parents (a much more promising approach). The
observation of such germplasm in the different Indian rubber growing areas,
and especially in the marginal zones, can make it possible to identify
genotypes with natural characters favorable for good behavior in the face of a
specific adverse feature of the environment. However, handling a population
of 5,000 genotypes is not easy and this population should be subjected to
preliminary sorting. This can be done by obaerving performance in the field,
as envisaged above, but also by "characterization" operations - e.g.



-73-
A-X 7
Page 5 of 9
electrophoresis - which among other features can be used to measure the
"genetic distances" conventionally used in the choice of parents for crosses.
4.3    The above observations show that the first steps to be taken to draw
benefit from the germplasm (the germplasm "effect" will hardly be seen during
the 5 years of the project) should have two results:
(i)    the better intrinsic knowledge of the germplasm.  This will
require:
- all forms of characterization (morphological, biometrics and
above all electrophoretic) of the constituent genotypes;
- without waiting for completion of this, the use of the
germplasm fields already established in Kerala (main RRII
station) to attempt to sort the 1,000 genotypes which are
thought to be the best of the 5,000 of the collection;
- and the completion of the RRII's collection by returning to the
sources in Malaysia and C6te d'Ivoire, thus benefiting from the
knowledge gained in both places concerning this remaining stock
of germplasm and simultaneously saving the trouble of sorting
it itself (without very solid bases); and,
(ii)    the possibility of sending this selected germplasm to the varicus
non-traditional rubber-growing regions (RRII regional stations,
starting with those running their own breeding programs) for
establishing observation fields (with some well-known Wickham
controls) to identify genotypes with naturally favorable
characters (for the area in question) for use in local breeding
programmes ('seed garden" treatments).
s.  VAX11LLfAUo
5.1    Indian rubber growers, particularly smallholders who account for the
majority of rubber plantations. use large amounts of fertilizer. In Kerala,
planters are often at the second or even third generation of rubber trees and
better planting materials have obviously been planted from one generation to
the next. Considerable land consolidation work (the area is often hilly with
steep slopes and even rocky outcrops) has been carried out (terraces with
stone retaining walls) enclosing plots of all shapes. These are generally
small and include a varied range of tree crops: mainly rubber, but also
coconut palms, betel palms4 jack fruit trees, cocoa, pepper, etc. alternating
with food crops (cassava, pineapple, etc.) and a few cattle heads. Kearala is
largely covered with trees (which is satisfactory from the environmental point
of view) and fairly densely populated. This potentially is a fragile
structure and in spite of the crop diversification practiced sustainability
depends on good soil fertility. Insofar as rubber trees are the dominant crop
and are doubtless the most regular source of income, farmers rightly
concentrate fertilization efforts on this crop.
5.2    In the non-traditional zones, and especially in Tripura, one would
expect the situation to be better as there is less population pressure. In
fact, as the "forest" nature of rubber trees has not yet been recognised, the
land available has always been cleared for some time and, in case of shifting



-74-
Page 6 of 9
cultivation ("Jhuming"), is strongly degraded. The problem of soil fertility
arises once again with the aggravating factor that the environment is fairly
new for rubber growing.
5.3    Fertilization is thus a major topic in Indian rubber-growing as a
whole, and it is understandable that the RRII has reserved a special division
(Agronomy and Soil Division) for studying the question.
5.4    Although not abandoning its policy of systematic fertilizer
application, the RRII is aware of the uncertainty of the effectiveness of
fertilizer applications on mature rubber and is setting up a system of use
based on soil and leaf analysis. This would ensure basic mineral dressing for
identified cases of mineral deficiency with a reasonable hope of savings in
fertilizer rates and drawing benefit from the corrective fertilizer use.
However, there are over 700,000 smallholders and systematic monitoring by the
RRII of each holding is almost impossible. A number of laboratories of this
type are operational. These should be used not so much for detecting possible
deficiencies by studying all cases but for limiting analyses:
-   either to samples taken from homogeneous groups of smallholders
(e.g. at RPS level) - this is feasible if the crop units are
organized at planting stage;
-   or to special cases reported by the RPS or Extension Service
officials in which growth and yield are well below average in the
whole of the crop unit in question.
5.5    objectives.  The aim of the program would be to enable the RRII to
ensure effective fertilization monitoring which is necessary for maintaining
or even imp.oving of the rubber production potential and, through agricultural
extension, and improving or maintaining the nutritional state of the rubber
tree populations. This should be applicable to Indian smallholdings in the
various rubber growing regions without a need for systematic study of all
cases.
5.6    The program would consist of:
-   the strengthening of the current analysis capacity of the Agronomy
and Soil Division through 8 new units soil and leaf analysis
laboratory. In addition, one laboratory would be established
under UPASI, NGO operating in tree crops sector. These would be
distributed as best as possible in the light of the requirements
of the various project areas, (traditional zones, non-traditional
zones, replantings, new plantings, adult plantations);
-   the establishment of the clonal leaf analysis references (starting
with the most frequently planted clones or those which are likely
to become the most frequently planted) and, if possible, indexes
which might be applied to the results to take into account certain
features of the environment studied;
-   the development of an approach using "crop units", which should be
as homogeneous as possible, to address the problem of
fertilization (especially of the mature plantations) which enables
monitoring of the soil fertility potential and the good
nutritional level of the trees, without individual examination of



-75-
AinX 7
Page 7 of 9
all the smallholdings in these crop units.
6.                             li  Agrieultur.  SyAtm
6.1    The cultivation of the interrows between rubber trees during the early
years after planting is well known to Indian smallholders. However, it does
not follow well-established pattern. The aim of inter-cropping is to draw
regular farm income, while waiting for rubber trees to mature. There are many
possible crop combinations and they deserve to be studied, according to
different exploitation and land management systems.
6.2    Thus, if the rows were widened and the trees in the rows were planted
closer, it would be possible to make more room for intercrops and prolong them
somewhat without changing the density per ha of the rubber trees. It is also
possible to accept a certain decrease in rubber tree density per ha and
clearly separate the planting rows (or use double rows, particularly suitable
in this case) to provide a larger area for associated crops. The latter can
be food crops (difficult in the long term because of the repeated soil work)
or perennial crops (cocoa, coffee, etc.) which, although they do not produce
income as soon as annual crops, start producing before rubber trees and do not
disturb the soil. Such treatments can also be used to mix annual and
perennial crops.
6.3    The possibility of combining animal production with rubber growing has
been studied for a long time but is rarely put into practice. Conserving soil
fertility, i.e. its ability to withstand intensive productivity, the only way
of enabling farmers to live on such small areas, is a fundamental factor in
agriculture in Kerala and possibly in Indian agriculture in general. It
should be noted that 0.5 ha of rubber trees represents only 200 trees at
normal density. If inorganic fertilizer (which it might be necessary to
purchase) and organic fertilizer (which can be found on the site through
cattle and poultry, plants wastes, etc.) are combined, it would be possible to
ensure the best possible nutrition for the trees.
6.4    This is a "farming system" approach which should be progressively
substituted for the classic "intercrop" approach. However, it would be
necessary to take into account the eco-climatic diversity of the rubber
growing zones in India. This has been stressed under the project, in which a
distinction is drawn between the traditional zones (Kerala) and the non-
traditional zones (especially Tripura, where a certain degree of ethnic
diversity results in special features and habits in agriculture which can be
discouraged if they are clearly unfavorable but which cannot be ignored).
6.5    It should be noted that supplementary income can be sought in special
crops which can be envisaged with adult plantings such as bee-keeping or the
production of medicinal plants.
6.6    objectivea.  The aim would be to develop various sustainable models
for profitable rubber-based operations, based on the analys'.s of the farming
systems used by smallholders in Kerala and non-traditional rubber growing
regions (mainly Tripura). Sustainable models should conserve the environment,
suit a variety of farm types (location, size, etc.) and enable smallholders to
wait under acceptable conditions for latex production to start and then



-76-
ANNEX 7
Page 8 of 9
perhaps to earn some extra income from exploiting the under wood of adult
rubber trees.
6.7    The program would consist of:
-   the study of existing sLtuations and common agricultura. practices
(in particular in Kerala and Tripura). Control of Imperata would
be essential;
-   the development of profitable, easily applicable farm models (by
varying the distance bet--.en rows of rubber trees), including a
number of features other than rubber: plant crops (food or
perennial crops or a combination of both), animal production
(cattle, poultry, etc.) or both, not forgetting the possibility of
producing honey or medicinal plants, etc. when the trees have
reached adult stage;
-   the establishment of a number of field experiments on farming
systems.

1.1    A review of some processing factories has shown that improvements are
needed in production of block rubber. The main problems which were identified
are lack of blending, lack of dirt removal, uneven drying and inconsistency of
final products. The main reasons for these problems are inappropriate design
of factories for the type of raw material used (these factories will be
perfect to process clean estate field coagulum), and improper operating
practices. The share of block rubber in Indian production is very small at
present (5%) but this situation would change due to: (a) increase in
production; and (b) reduction in brown crepe production. To improve the
efficiency of block rubber production, two actions would be implemented: (a)
training of Rubber Board processing staff and (b) a complete updating of the
existing pilot block rubber processing plant.
1.2    Training of Staff.  A craining for four staff is included in the
project.. This training should be done in major producing countries
(Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia) with a preference for Thailand as much as
possible as the situation of Indian rubber production is much more similar to
the one of Thailand than to the one of the two other countries.
1.3    Updating of the Present Pilot Plant Factorv  Main problems regarding
this factory are: (a) obsolete equipment; and (b) inadequate location (no
possible extension and no possible effluent treatment). This pilot plant
factory would be moved to a new location which would provide adequate space
and allow installation of pilot of present and additional modern imported
manufacturing equipment. The new facility would be used for research and
training of staff from RB and rubber product manufacturers.

on natural rubber (NR) comes from small growers and used with or without
grading by the industry. India is the only country where such a situation
prevails. Usually rubber has to go through an industrial process before it
can be used by manufactures. Although the average quality is reasonable an
important proportion of the rubber is of insufficient quality and it leads to
downstream manufacturing problems, the majors being the high rejection rate
and poor quality of finished products. Beside traditional production of MR
for which the end use are well identified, research institutes all around the
world are working on modified types of NR (thermo plastic NR, epoxidized KR,
liquid NR, pre-vulcanized latex, etc.). The Rubber Research Institute of
India is working on such types of new products on laboratory or pilot plant
scale but it is facing testing equipment limitation to really exaluate the
real quality of such products. Under the project it is proposed to strengthen
the present facilities through provision of additional testing equipment in
order to enable a faster development and implementation of the works presently
carried out.
2.2    In the field of traditional sheet production, it is proposed to
undertake further development work to: (a) improve the manufacture of sheet at
the small grower's stage by the introduction of low technology smoking
facilities; (b) upgrade the lowest quality sheets by reprocessing (washing,
resmoking and grading) in low cost facilities; and (c) remove from the present
commercial system, the un-upgradable sheets and direct them to block rubber
factories to be used for blending with field coagulum for the production of
ISNR20. The large scale implementation of such a practice would first be
evaluated on a small scale to assess the technical and economic feasibility.

3.1 The Rubber Board ha3 been supporting manufactures ir. a limited way
through techrical consultancy. However, the demand in this field is
increasing but RB is unable to respond to due to lack of resources and trained
staff. To respond efficiently to this iucreasing demand and to diversify the
range of products for which the Rubber Board has the production know how, the
consultancy unit of RPPDD Department would be strengthened through additional
staff, training and equipment is necessary both in term of staff (number and
qualification) as in term of new types of equipment which will enable
development of new manufacturing techniques. Additional scientists would be
given a long-term training in a specialized overseas institution to allow them
to obtain information on current manufacturing developments and practices in
other countries. To 4ugment the existing facilities, additional equipment
would be provided to allow the development of new manufacturing techniques.
These facilities would be used both for research and development activities as
well as for training support to manufacturer.

RUBBER PROJECT
Eztension Servico8
1.    The Rubber Production Department (RPD) of the Rubber Board is
responsible for planning and implementing rubber plantation development
schemes and providing extension advice to growers. Current organizational
structure of RPD is shown in Annex 12 Chart l(b). The RPD is headed by the
Rubber Production Commissioner (RPC), assisted by four Joint RPCs, and nine
Deputy RPCs. Activities in the non-traditional areag of northeast India are
managed by two Joint RPCs operating from Agartala, Tripura and Gawahati,
Assam. The Department has two divisions, Development and Extension, each
under a Joint RPC. Under the project, the Development Division would be made
responsible for both inspection of holdings in relation to the planting grant
and extension support, and field staff would carry out the two functions
within a geographical area. The Extension Division, which would be staffed by
subject matter specialists, who would provide extension specialists to support
development activities in the traditional and non-traditional areas and
continue to be responsible for nurseries and field training of extension staff
and farmers. Field activities are currently handled through 34 regional
offices grouped under four zonal offices (South, Central, North and Eastern).
Regional offices are headed by Development Officers (DO), assisted by
Assistant Development Officers (ADO). They administer 160 field offices
staffed by Field Officers (FO) and Junior Field Officers (JFO), in addition to
20 regional nurseries and 35 tappers' Training Schools. The RPD's staff
currently total 1,181 persons, including 46 DOs, 68 ADOs, and 285 FO/JFOs.
Extension ActivitiAe
2.    General.  The RPD provides technical advice to rubber growers throughout
India, whether smallholdings or estates. There are less than 400 estates in
the country, - defined as those plantations larger than 20 ha - , averaging
about 200 ha in size, but the number of smallholdings is large, about 700,000.
The average size of smallholdings is estimated around 0.9 ha, with 77% of the
total being less than 5 ha each. The large number and small individual size
of the smallholdings make it difficult to provide an effective extension
service, and the RPD has largely focussed in the past on the holdings with
planting or replanting assisted by planting grants. These plantings are
inspected prior to payment of each instalment of the planting assistance over
a period of seven years and the inspectors serve also as extension agents.
Under the project, the RPD would aim at reaching a larger number of
smallholders, with a minimum of staff and resources, by promoting group
activities through the establishment of Rubber Producers' Societies (RPS), the
organization of field days, training courses, and various exhibitions and
demonstrations, in addition to the increasing use of the mass media and
distribution of printed material. Inspection of individual smallholdings by
extension staff, however, would continue in relation to the planting grant and
used to promote new technologies.

are voluntary associations, registered under the Charitable Societies Act and
operating under bye-laws dictated by the Rubber Board. Each RPS requires the
approval of the Rubber Board for its registration to ensure, among others,
that the proposed members are eligible rubber griwers, at least fifty growers
wish to join the Society, suitable premises are available, and capable
managers are identified. Very close supervision of the RPS is maintained by
the RPD and a Field Officer serves as a member of the Executive Committee
which meets each month and normally arranges a general meeting of members each
quarter. The general meetings allow the RPD representative to address members
on technical matters and are often held on a member's holding so that topical
matters may be discussed and practical demonstrations given. Since 1986, some
1,200 RPSs have been established and, apart from talks and demonstrations,
these are used by the RPD as channels for the distribution of subsidized
materials and other items procured centrally. Another important function of
RPSs is the improvement of members' processing and marketing of rubber. The
RPD is planning to establish 1,500 new RPSs over the next five years. These,
together with the 1,200 existing RPSs and the 300 which the RPD hopes to
establish before the start of the project, would provide contacts initially
with some 300,000 smallholders (average of i00 growers per RPS, with a maximum
of 200) aad ultimately double that number, or virtually all active
smallholders in India. The RPSs would be the focus of all extension effort
and would be the channel for farmer training, dissemination of technical
advice, productivity enhancement, promotion of new planting, replanting, and
improved processing and marketing and the supply of subsidized items under all
RPD programs. RPSs would also be encouraged to undertake group planting and
replanting, togather with further group nurseries. The use of mass media
would be intensified in support of regular extension activities. Audio-visual
programs would be developed in major production and processing activities and
used as a basis for discussion with farmer groups organized through RPSs. In
addition, support for press, radio and television programs currently in place
would be continued. The support for women planters/workers would be provided
as an integral part of the extension service and focus on production and post-
harvest activities specifically undertaken by them. As the RPSs become
stronger and gain experience, they would take full responsibility for the
procurement and distribution of inputs. Direct costs met by the RPD for the
establishment of RPSs are small, at about Rs.10,000 for weighing scales and
minor equipment, as premises are rented and all furnishings, stationery and
other needs provided from members' entrance fees and subscriptions. The staff
requirements are, however, significant since RPD officers must first identify
suitable locations, gather a small core of farmers prepared to start and
manage a society and assist with the registration of the RPS. The simple
establishment of 1,500 RPSs would be a major operation of the extension
services through the project period.
4.    Productivity Enhancement Program. The project would provide for the
intensification of RPD's ongoing extension efforts directed at raising the
productivity of mature rubber plantations. Although smallholder rubber yields
in India compare favorably to smallholder yields in other major rubber
producing countries, with an average around 1,050 kg/ha, about 45% of the
tapped area produce between 500 and 1,000 kg/ha and should bt suitable for
yield enhancement through improved cultural practices. Special extension
campaigns would be designed by RPD headquarters and carried out by field staff
throughout the country. Each campaign would choose one technical package for



-80-
Page 3 of 3
promotion for about one year, but after this special emphasis, extension work
on that item would continue as further topics receive campaign attention in
their turn. The technical packages to be promoted would include: (i)
discriminatory fertilizer applications; (ii) plant protection; (iii) improved
tapping methods and yield stimulation; and, (iv) rain-guarding (see Annex 4).
5.    A typical campaign would comprise the preparation of printed material,
mass media presentations, talks at RPS meetings by extension officers and
practical demonstrations. The audio-visual materials would be drafted by
Rubber Board staff and then made by professionals under closa Rubber Board
supervision of technical details. An essential part of the campaign would be
the refresher training of all staff, undertaken by Regional Offices when the
campaign materials are issued to them.
6.    Adoption of the technical recommendations by growers would be encouraged
by providing them technical and financial assistance through RPS. Initially,
material inputs, such as fertilizers, copper fungicides and spraying
equipment, tapping panel protestants, improved tapping knives, yield
stimulants, and polythene sheets and adnesives for rainguarding, would be
procured centrally by the Rubber Board and distributed to the growers through
the RPS. Later, this function would directly performed by RPSs. As all
rubber smallholdings would not be suitable for adoption of all the technical
packages, due to different planting materials, age and bark condition of
trees, and as all the growers would not be amenable to acceptance of all
improvements, response to the productivity enhancement program would only be
expected on a small proportion of the mature plantings, estimated around
60,000 ha. Provisions would be made under the project to finance inputs for
these targeted 60,000 ha.   It is expected that the adoption of technical
recommendations would result in yield increases of about 150-200 kg/year,
representing an additional production of 1.3 million tons of rubber over the
economic life of the mature tree (25 years).
Strengthening of the Rubber Production Department
7.    To achieve the project's targets for new plantings (40,000 ha),
replantings (30,000 ha) and productivity enhancement (60,000 ha), the RPD's
operational capacity would be strengthened through changes in its
organization, provision of incremental staff and operating procedures. These
are discussed in Annex 2.

TRAINING
1.   Ban.kgrund.  RB has a limited capacity for training its staff and to
contribute towards the training requirements of the rubber industry.  A small
number of training programs are undertaken on an adhoc basis with limited
consultation with potential clients. Under the project, it is proposed to
strengthen RB's Training Department and to enlarge both the scope and number
courses provided in relation to the needs of the perspective clients.
2.    cbjientiv a.  The key objectives of the Training Department would be to:
(a)   improve and upgrade the skills of RB st. !f;
(b)   provide training service -a the rubber industry; and
(c)   provide short orientation/refresher courses to growers in
specialized areas.
3.    Proiect Propo=al.  The key areas of activities to be covered under the
project would include:
(a)  Ttainina Cente. At present, training activities are undertaken
in shared facilities with other departments of the Board which
restricts the range and frequency of courses. The project would
support construction of lecture halls and laboratories on a site
adjoining to RBI. In addition, necessary office and training
equipment and materials would be provided. Trainers would be
trained to upgrade their teaching skills.
(b) ArAff±ng. Currently the training programs are being implemented
with the help of the faculty largely drawn from other department
of RD. Under the project, it is proposed to add 15 additional
professional and support staff. Details are given in Annex 2.
(c)  Trranilng Prram.  The proposed range of training activities to be
coordinated by the Training Dep&rtment are shown in Attachment 1.
The proposed program is divided into four groups covering
(i)   training of RB Staff;
(ii) training for rubber growers and small scale
manufacturers; and
(iii) specific programs for women and tribal people; and
(iv) overseas training.
The duration, frequency and the number of participants in each course
would be determined based on demand/need to be identified by the
proposed long-'erm Training Plan (see below). Proposed overseas
training program is shown in Attachment 1.

(d)   Long-Thrm Training P an (TP) . In order to identify short medium
and long-term skills required, prevailing and prospective gaps,
scope, duration and frequency of different courses, a five year
rolling training plan by local consultants by December 31, 1992.
Proposed guidelines for the preparation of the plan are given in
Attachment It.
4.    Tmplamfntation Arrangemants.  In addition to the core staff of the
center, who would be largely responsible for coordinating the training
program, experts from other units of RB (research, extension, processing) and
outside agencies would also participate to meet specific faculty requirements.
As far as possible, smallholder training on different aspects of rubber
production and processing technologies would be carried out in villages with
the involvement of extension staff and RPSs. Wherever appropriate, outside
training institutions would be used to cover specialized needs, e.g.,
management accounts, mass communications in agricultural extension.  The long
term training plan would be prepared by local consultants. Proposals for
annual updating of this plan would be prepared by the Training Department in
consultation with other operational units of RB and outside agencies
participating in the training programs. Training Department would produce a
quarterly and an annual progress report for incorporation into the overall
project reports to be rrepared by PCU. The effectiveness of various training
activities financed    er the project would be assessed at the mid-term
review.

SUGGESTED GUIDELINES FOR THE PRZPARATION
OF THE TRAINING PLAN
A.    ObiAecivAs
1.    The main objectives of the Training Plan (TP) would be to:  (i) provide
a long-term perspective on the skill needs based on changes anticipated in the
direction and requirements of the rubber industry; (ii) provide an
authoritative and systematic framework for investment to enhance and broaden
the quality and skill mix of the Rubber Board staff and the environment they
operate in; (iii) outline procedures and mechanisms for cost effective
implementation of the training program.
B.    Arrangement for Preparing the TP
2.    The first TP would review the skill requirements of RB and other
participating agencies in the light of changing priorities and resource
availability.
3.    The preparation of this plan would require the appointment of
consultants with appropriate expertise from within India. The consultant
would be identified by the Director of the Department of Training in
consultation with the RB Chairman and Head of PCU . The appointment of
consultant would follow IDA guidelines and would be undertaken in consultation
with IDA. The director would be responsible for finalizing the terms of
reference coordinating the preparation work, work plan and reporting
arrangements. The recommendation of TP would be the basis for financing the
training program under the project.
C.    The TP_ uggeated         s of Antivities
4.    To provide the necessary information and to enable TP to complete its
objectives, the following tasks wold need to be carried out and reported:
(a)   prepare an inventory of existing management,
professional/scientific, administrative and support staff
specifying job, grade, education, qualifications, skills and
experience of each;
(b)   indicate qualities and quantities of required staff categories
over a three year, five year and ten year period with indications
of requirements beyond this period;
(C)   the assessment of manpower requirements should also take into
account the expected impact of present and future technological
developments and new approaches in task performance and
management;



-88-
ANNEX 
Attachment 2
Page 1 of 2
(d)   based on (a) and (c) above, knowledge and skills requirements
should be defined, together with number of positions required at
various stages in different categories, taking into account the
salary, budget constraints and priorities allocated under the
Rubber project;
(e)   compare the desired manpower demand estab)lished under point (d)
above, with the actuai manpower structure availability in the
system to develop a long-term manpower plan, including training
and recruitment needs;
(f)   the plan should present different job categories in RB and
indicate the main areas for the improvement of kr.owledge and
skills;
(g)   it should also indicate the types of training relevant for the
different categories, the training plan (numbers of selection of
participants, timing, responsible training institutions) and the
training budget. It should constitute the basis for the planning
and implementation of training programs for the different target-
categories, e.g., managers, scientific staff,
technicians/technologies and administrative support staff; and
*h)   training facilities available within RS and Indian institutions
relevant to the rubber industry should be reviewed and if
appropriate, make recommendations for improvement in areas where
appropriate training facilities are not available within India; it
should also identify cost effective mechanisms for involving
overseas institutions in meeting needs.

Rubber Project
Tribal Development Plan (Tripura)
1. Socioeconomic Profile of Project Beneficiaries: In Tripura, more than 50Z
of the beneficiary families will be of tribal origin. While different tribal
groups are involved, there are no significant differences in cultural practices
of significance to be a constraint to participation in rubber cultivation, with
73.4Z belonging to the 'Tripure' group.  Economically tribals are among the
weakest of the population, with more than 751 living below the poverty line. The
projec: will only involve those tribals who have been allotted 2 ha of land.
Such land are usually degraded, and underutilized.
2.  Tribals and Rubber Cultivation:  There is an increasing awareness of the
economic viability of rubber cultivation. Where other crops have failed, rubber
has grown well on degraded soil. Once mature, rubber cultivation provides all
year employment and a long term source of income. Processing of latex is simple
and processed rubber can easily be stored and transported. Rubber cultivation
also helps to improve soil fertility and increase moisture retention.
3. Proposed Tribal Development Plan (TDP)
a. Objective: To ensure that tribal and other socially disadvantaged groups
living below the poverty line receive culturally compatible social and economic
benefits.    In  addition,  to  develop  beneficiary  capacity  for  informed
participation in project activities which would also contribute to the
sustainability of the development process beyond project period.
b. Activities Proposed Under the Project: These are listed in Attachment I
under mitigation actions.
c. Funding for the TDP: Since the project deals with a large group of people
who l.ive below the poverty line, the TDP in line with OD 4.20, adopts an
integrated approach to the economic and social development of the
heneficiaries. In addition to Project funds, the Government of Tripura (GOT)
has agreed to allocate US $ 1.0 million towards the TDP, by financing a part
of the social and economic schemes, and schemes for have agreed to provide
funding for additional infrastructural facilities required should rubber
cultivation prove successful over a large scale after Project ends.
d. Selection criteria: ;3pecific criteria and processes for the selection of
beneficiary families have been laid down in the TDP.   Such criteria would
includes i) beneficiary mr.st have clear title to at least 1.5 ha of land to be
used for rubber cultivatio.a; ii) living below the poverty line with an annual
income of less than Rs 11,500 p.a. per family; and iii) currently involved in
agricultural activities.   Further, female headed households will be given
priority in selection. Criteria for selection of participating NGO0, who would
assist in the implementation of the TDP, are provided in Annex 12.
e. Implementation Arrangements: These are described in the Attachment I under
three sections covering organization and management, impact management and
monitoring and evaluation. The training requirements under the TDP are given
in Annex 13.

1.    Transport and Trading.  Rubber in Kerala is auctioned at che terminal
markets of Kottayuia and Kochi (Cochin), where the growers, traders, processors
and other buyers meet. Transactions in rubber are regulated and licensed by
the Rubber Board. One such licence is the Dealer's Licence which is required
for anyone, other than a processor, who wants to deal in rubber. There is an
extensive network of about 5,000 rubber traders who account for nearly 90% of
the trade in smallholder rubber. They reach the remotest of the villages and
operate an admirably efficient marketing service. They charge about 1% of the
terminal market price for ungraded rubber for their servi-es, including
transport, giving the smallholders a farmgate price of 99% of the terminal
market  price  for  ungraded rubber.    This  price  fluctuates daily,  but
smallholders are well aware of the current price because the prices in the
newspaper are published and there is a high literacy level amongst the
smallholders.
2.   As indicated above, almost all of the rubber purchased by the dealers at
the village level is classified as ungraded, i.e., with a auality below the
lowest recognized grade of RMA 5. For the dealers, the main orofit comes not
from the nominal 1% margin, but from grading the smallholder rubber into
officially recognized grades (including off-grades), and selling them as such
to the manufacturers.   The practice of trader lc-ans to smallholders also
exists, and in such cases, the dealers do obtain wider margins from the
borrower-smallholders.   However,  even after accounting for these "extra"
dealer margins the smallholder still receives over 90% of the "true" terminal
market price, which is quite high by world standards. Furthermore, the grower
is relieved of the problem of transporting his rubber to the terminal markets,
and in general the system can be considered efficient. The main problem has
been that the smallholder has little motivation for improving the quality of
his rubber since he knows that he will be paid based on the ungraded rubber
price.
3.    Although there are 35 cooperatives engaged in rubber marketing, the role
of the private dealer is little changed. One of the main reasons is that most
of the cooperatives are processing-oriented and normally operate from a base
in towns and cities. Thus, the degree of penetration into the villages for
obtaining smallholder produce is not very satisfactory. It is estimated that
these cooperatives have never been able to procure and market more than 8-10%
of total smallholder crop.  These cooperatives do not include the recently
established RPS organizations referred to above, which are hoped to perform a
more effective transport and marketing role for the smallholders.
4.    Recently, many manufacturing units in the tire sector (which consumes
45% of India's natural rubber production), have opened up procurement centers
for purchase of rubber sheets directly from the growers.   This has helped
promote a healthy competition with the rubber dealers, generally increased the
effective farmgate price and has provided some incentive to the growers to
improve the quality of their product.

Page 2 of 5
In the estate sectorp almost all of the estates sell directly to the
final buyers, and circumvent the trader/middleman link.  In a large number of
case, the latex required by the endusers is directly procured only from the
estates.  In case of endusers who require significant consistency in quality,
bulk purchases are directly contracted with the estates.
6.    It is important to note that the relatively efficient marketing system
described above applies mostly to the traditional areas of Kerala and southern
Tamil Nadtu, which are extensively served by rail, road and air transport.
Kochi which is a major seaport, is located centrally in the area and postal
and communication facilities are good.   This favorable situation is rather
similar in some non-traditional areas, namely, Goa, Karrnataka, and the south
Konkan region of Maharashtra.  Tripura is connected by a rail and road along
the periphery of Banglade:h to the markets in Calcutta.  Freight rates have
remained low, transport from Tripura returns to Calcutta virtually empty thus
providing the Tripura traders and advantage in sending their produce at low
cost to Calcutta markets.
7.   ERubber .Goods ManufacturerR.  The rubber goods manufacturing units, like
their dealer and processor counterparts, have to obtain a licence from the
Rubber Board. The industry consists of the following major endusers:
consumption
'9d)
Automobile tires and tubes               48.4
Cycle tires ana tubes                    12.1
Tread rubber                              6.5
Subtotal for tires                 67.0
Footwear                                 11.6
Belts and hoses                           7.0
Latex foam                                3.8
Dipped goods                              3.1
Other goods                               7.5
Total                             100.0
8.    There are around 27 automobile tire units in the organized sector, 160
rubber products manufacturers, and over 4,000 units in the small scale and
tiny sector.   The total industry turnover is around Rs. 45 billion with
exports worth Rs. 2.2 billion, and a contribution to the national exchequer in
the form of duties and taxes of around Rs. 13 billion.   The employment
generated is around 100 million workdays.
9.    The small scale sector's contribution is particularly noteworthy.
According to the All India Rubber Industries Association, the small scale
units account for Ra. 10 billion (around 22%) of the total turnover, export
goods worth Rs. 250 million, tax revenue worth Rs. 1.3 billion, and employment
generation of around 30 million workdays.

10.   The consumption of natural rubber by the rubber goods industry increased
at the rate of 8% p.a. compounded over the period 1979-80 to 19e9-90, i.e.,
from 165,000 mt to 342,000 mt.  The industry also consumed around 92,000 mt
(19% of total consumption) of synthetic rubber (which also grew at an annual
compounded rate of 8% oveo the same period from 43,000 mt to 92,000 mt), and
44,000 mt of reclaimed rvbber (9% of total consumption). As the consumption
of rubber his been increasing at a faster rate than the increase in
production, the gap has had to be met with imports, which have also shown an
increasing trend. During 1989-90, as much as 45,000 mt of natura'. rubber and
37,000 mt of synthetic rubber were imported, but in 1990-91 was only 14,000
tons.
11.   The mair  categories of natural rubber consumed, including imports, and
their relative shares are as follows:
% share
Preserved latex and latex concentrates                 10
1ibbed smoked sheet                                    72
Pale latex crepe
Technically specified rubber or block/crumb
rubber                                                6
Others (including estate brown crepe)                  11
Total                                          100
12.   The main difference in the shares of rubber consumed by Indian rubber
goods manufacturers and the shares of rubber produced by Indian rubber
processors is the greater share of higher quality RSS and TSR required by the
manufacturers, which is made up by imports.
13.   The main types of synthetic rubbers consumed are Styrene Butadiene
Rubber  (SBR)  and  Poly Butadiene  rubber  (PBR).    The  former  is  being
manufactutred by Synthetics & Chemicals Ltd. (SCL) and the latter by the public
sector corporation  Indian Petrochemicals  Corporation  Ltd.  (IPCL).   The
existing capacity of SCL is 33,000 mt per annum, slated for expansion to
80,000 mt, and that of IPC1 is 20,000 mt per annum, slated for expansion to
30,000 mt. Another feature of these units is that their production is based
on a single new material - petroleum based feedstocks - which is imported by
these units to large extent.   World prices of synthetic rubber, which has
historically been about 10% cheaper than equivalent grade natural rubber,
averaged 15% higher than natural rubber prices during the latter half of 1990
and may continue to be an expensive substitute for natural rubber, ahould the
world prices of synthetic rubber and its feedstocks increase and/or the rupee
depreciate.
14.   The present proportion of natural to synthetic rubber of 70:21 in India
is in marked contrast with the other count-ies where the ratio is 32:68. As
the number of synthetic rubber units and their capacities is not expected to
increase significantly in the short- and the medium-term beyond that indicated
above, the reliance of the rubber goods industry on natural rubber is likely
to increase over time.
15.   The industry exported around 25,000 mt of rubber in the form of rubber
goods worth Rs. 2.2 billion in 1989-90.   These consisted of tires and tire



-101-
Page 4 of 5
tubes and retreading materials of around Rs. 1.1 billion, footwear of around
Rs. 130 million and miscellaneous rubber products such as belting, hoses and
medical items. The Chemicals and the Allied Products Export Promotion Council
is the coordinating agency for the exports of rubber products. A flow chart
of the rubber industry is reflected in Chart 1.
World Market
16. During tlie 1980s world production of natural and synthetic rubber
trended steadily higher, totally an estimated 15.0 million tons in 1990.
Natural rubber accounts for about one-third of annual productiL,u and totalled
5.1 million tons in 1990 and synthetic rubber production      around 9.9
million tons.   Natural rubber production is concentrated iA Asia,  with
Malaysia consistently the largest producer, accounting for about one-third of
the world's output,  followed by Indonesia and Thailand.   World synthetic
product'-on is diversified with U.S.S.R. the largeat producer followed by the
U.S. and Japan. In recent years, supply has more or less stagnanted primarily
due to low world market prices.
17.   The automotive  industry accounts  for more than half the woxld's
consumption.   Total rubber consumption has kept paue with rising production
consumption was about 15.1 million tons.   The U.S. is the world's largest
single consumer of rubber accounting for about one-fifth of world use.
Consumption has declined with the recent downturn in the U.S. economy and
decline in imports to E. Europe and the former Soviet Union.
18.   The International Natural Rubber Agreement which came into effect in
1979 proved effective in the 1980's.  Thirty producers and consumer nations
are members  (India has yet to become a member).   The agreement does not
attempt to peg prices, but responds to market conditions. Under the accord,
the buffer stock manager can sell rubber out of the stock pile, when prices
rise 15% from a hybrid target price (reflecting several types of natural
rubber expressed in a blend of Malaysian and singapore dollars).   If prices
rise by 20% buying is required. Selling is undertaken when prices decline by
15-20%. The agreement may modify prices if market conditions require it.
Prica
19. Prices between the Indian market and the world market have been
consistently different and the Indian prices have been much higher (see Table
1). However, with the recent devaluation of the rupee the Indian market
prices for natural rubber have been more or less in par with the world market.
20.   In February 1980 the GOl introduced a buffer stock scheme with a view to
stabilize the price of natural rubber at a reasonable level so as to make it
remunerative for the rubber growers. The price has been based on average cost
of production studies undertaken by the Ministry of Finance.   The State
Trading Corporation (STC) operates the scheme and charges a service fee of
2.5% on the CIF price of imports. The price is regulated by STC by releasing
imported rubber or by procuring domestic rubber. The average market price of
RMA4 grade rubber during the last 5 years has risen from Rs. 1,732/100 kgs to
Rs. 2,129/100 kgs at an average annual growth of 4.5%, is shown below:

International prices are enpected to remain at the top of the "may-buy" range
as it is at present, under the International Natural Rubber agreement, until
*prices rise. Projections show that recovery will begin in 1992 as commercial
stocks have fluctuated at low levels and production has stagnat3d in response
to low prices. Unleis consumers find they are able and willing to operate
with lower stocks or production increases dramatically in the aosence of
higher prices, both of which seem unlikely, a rise in consumption would
require prices to rise and stimulate higher production.

FINANCIAL AND ZCONOMIC ANALYSES
A. Financial Analyses
1.    The impact if the Project on the beneficiaries for the replanting and
new planting components has been undertaken for the traditional and non-
traditional areas separately. (Tables 1 & 2). The one hectare smallholder
models do not take into consideration inter cropping during the immature
phase, and take into account only the costs and benefits associated with the
rubber crop. The costs included are the investment costs for the six/seven
years, considered the immature phase, and the maintenance costs during the
mature or yielding phase of the crop. An estimated sixty percent of the costs
during the immature phase are costs of labor. The yield assumptions for both
Project areas are provided in Annex 4 on technology. The yield levels in non-
traditional areas are about 10% lower than in traditional areas and production
is one year lAter in non-traditional areas. The analyses indicates that the
small farmer net returns from the crop are Rs. 23,146 in traditional areas and
Rs. 22,454 in non-traditional areas during peak production. The financial
rate of return (FRR) is estimated at 18.6% for both one hectare models. The
returns are similar primarily because the labor costs in non-traditional areas
is Rs. 18.0 per man-day (md) compared to Rs. 31.0/md in traditional areas.
The analyses concludes that rubber cultivation for smallholders is profitable.
2.    Investment in rubber cultivation by a majority o. smallholders will be
financed, through a loan. One hectare crop budgets analyzing the debt
servicing capacity, in current terms, of the smallholder was also under taken
(Tables 1&2). The assumptions include: (a) planting grant of as. 5,000; (b) a
polybag subsidy of Rs. 2,700; (c) sweat eqaity of 50% of labor costs provided
by the smallholder; (d) Bank loan on the remai.irng investment costs; and (e)
the smallholder replanting will also borrow for planting rather than utilize
income generated from the sale of rubber wood estimated at Rs. 20,000/ha.
Interest has been capitalized over the immature period at 15%, the current
interest rate chargeable to rubber smallholders. On the assumption that the
smallholder starts repaying as soon as the land becomes productive, the
analysis indicates that in traditional areas, assuming a debt service
allocation of 50% of gross revenue, would be able to effectively pay back the
loan within a 13 year period. In non-traditional areas the debt service
allocation is about 50% of gross revenue and repayment would be from 14-15
years. These are based on RB guiidelines. Thus allowing the smallholders to
have a profitable return from the crop of around Rs. 8,000 during the loan
repa'ment period. Though the debt services ratio is high and income low,
during the period of repayment, rubber cultivation for many smallholder3 is
not the primary source of income in traditional areas. In non-traditional
areas, the Tribal Development Plan will assist in providing alternate income
generating activities during the repayment period.
3.    Crop model (one hectare) of smallholders participating in the
productivity enhancement program was undertaken in the with and without
project situation. The incremental benefits reflect a net increase in revenue
of Rs 3,000 during the peak production period (Table 3).
4.    Indicative financial analyses was undertaken for the different

processing components. The FRR are: rubber sheet factories - 26%; centrifuge
factories - 35.3%; conversion of crepe to crumb rubber factories (12 tons/day)
- 28%; coagulum based crumb rubber factories - 38.7%; and wood processing
factories - 35.5%.
B. Economic Anialyses
5.    The economic analyses of the Project takes into account the development
of replanting, new planting, productivity enhancements, processing, and
institutional development components. Only the direct quantifiable
incremental costs and benefits have been taken into account. Alternative use
of the rubber land is assumed to be for coconut/cashew cultivation in
traditional areas and this has been included in the analyses. The opportunity
cost of land in non-traditional areas is expected to be zero as it is degraded
land that is to be used for rubber cultivation.
6.    Economic Cos and Benefits.  The economic costs are expressed in 199?
constant prices and include all capital and recurrent costs of the project
taking into account all the physical contingencies but excluding price
escalation, taxes and duties. The annual recurrent costs for maintenance of
the plantations and processing component have been taken into account. The
costs have been adjusted for taxes and duties by applying the standard
conversion factor (SCF) of 0.8.
7.    Economic Pricing of Tnputs and  utputs. Import parity and export parity
farmgate prices were derived for the major output of the project, natural
rubber, based on the Bank's Commodity Price Projections of February 1992
(Tables 4 and 5). Appropriate quality differential was reflected in the price
of RSSI New York price. Farmgate prices have been derived by adjusting world
market prices to border prices and accounting for quality differential and the
economic costs associated with handling, transport and distribution between
the border and the farmgate. Import parity prices were derived and used for
the major inputs Urea, Muriate of Phosphate (MOP), and Rock Phosphate. For
non-traded inputs, adjustments were made for taxes and duties and other
transfer payments using the SCF of 0.8.
8.    Economic Rate of Return.  Based on the assumptions detailed above, the
economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was estimated to be 20.7% using
export parity prices and 29.9% using import parity prices. The ERR for the
new planting and replanting components are 17.3% (export parity) and 21.4%
(import parity). The ERR for the processing component is estimated to be 38%.
The with high ERR for the Project reflects the profitability of rubber
cultivation even with the conservative assumptions that have been made in the
expected yie d levels (Table 6).

analyses (para. 3.26 (main report). Additional sensitivity analyses reflect
the following ERR.

component                           18.1 %                   21.9 %
Switching value analyses show the following percentage changes in costs and
benefits would be needed for the Net Present Value, at the assumed 12%
opportunity cost of capital, to fall below zero for the project: (a) using
export parity prices costs up 16.9% or benefits down 14.5%; and (b) using
import parity prices costs up 38.1% or benefits down 27.6%.
Though the ERR is sensitive to relative changes in costs and benefits the
assumptions used to calculate the ERR for the base case are conservative. The
project is considered viable.
