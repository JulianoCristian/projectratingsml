MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA
FOR THE RUBBER PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed devslopment Credit to India for SDR amount 66.4 million (US$92.0
million equivalent) to help finance the Rubber Project. The proposed Credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years. The pr-oceeds of
the development Credit would be provided as grant by the Government of India
(GOI) to the Rubber Board (RB) and onlent to the National Bank for Agriculture
and Rural Development (NABARD) is. accordance with the standard arrangements
for development assistance to the central Government agencies. GOI will bear
the foreign risk.
2.    Ba.ckground. India is the world's fourth largest producer of natural
rubber with about 6% of world production.   The area under rubber is now
440,000 ha, of which 310,000 ha are being tapped.   Rubber is primarily a
privately owned crop, with smallholders accounting for about 80% of total
rubber production. Indian rubber production grew 7% per year during the 1980s
and reached 330,000 tons in FY91, an increase of 11% over FY90.   Yields
average about 1,000 kg per tapped hectare, which compares favorably with other
major producers. Traditionally, rubber has been cultivated almost entirely in
South India, and Kerala state alone still accounts for over 90% of total
Indian production.   An estimated 400,000 people are engaged in activities
related to rubber production, including 250,000 employed laborers. A further
250,000 people are employed   in the manufacturing of rubber goods  (tires,
footwear, gloves, rubber bands) undertaken by large and small units.   In
addition, natural rubber cultivation produces several commercial by-products:
rubber honey, rubber seed oil and rubber wood. Old rubber trees felled for
replanting are an increasingly important source of fuel wood and lumber.
Annual consumption of rubber lumber is 1.2 million cu m, worth about US$240
million.
3.    India has imported an average of 45,000 tons of natural rubber per year
over the past 5 years until 1990/91  (12% of consumption).   In addition,
India's annual imports of synthetic rubber have averaged 35,000 tons.
However, due to increased domestic production, in 1991-92 only 14,000 tons of
natural rubber was imported. During the last 5 years the Indian consumption
has grown at an average of about 8.6% per year. At the same time, the rubber
subsector has also been a foreign exchange earner through the export of
manufactured rubber goods, mostly tires, valued at nearly US$102 million in
1990-91.
4.   Due to low labor costs and suitable agro-climatic conditions, India has
comparative advantage in natural rubber production.  GOI's priority for the
future development of the rubber subsector is to achieve self sufficiency by
supporting: (a) new plantings and replantings of old rubber in the traditional
areas; (b) improving yields of mature rubber; and (c) new plantings in non-
traditional areas, including the Northeast of India which would also benefit
the tribal people.



2-
5.    Responsibility for rubber development lies with the RB, headquartered at
Kottayam, Kerala, reporting to the Ministry of Commerce (MOC).  The RB has
been effective in promoting rubber development and targeting assistance to
benefit a large number of small growers. Credit requirements for the rubber
subsector have been provided since 1979 by participating nationalized
commercial, cooperative and private commercial banks supported by assistance
from NABARD's refinancing scheme.   This credit program has been highly
successful with recovery rates estimated to be over 90%.
6.    Lessons Learnt from Previous Bank Operations. The IDA's only previous
experience in this subsector was the Kerala Agricultural Develrpment Project
(Credit 0680-IN), which closed in 1986.  That project had a small component
(US$4.5 million; 6% of total project costs) for rubber processing facilities
in the cooperative sector.   The PCR concluded that this component had not
fulfilled appraisal expectations, suffering from a number of delays and
reductions in phys:cal targets. The PCR estimated the economic rate of return
(ERR) for the rul er processing component at 21%, compared to the estimated
ERR of 67.5% at appraisal. This time the Bank has been requested by GOI to
finance a free standing rubber project able to take a comprehlensive view of
the subsector and assist in its vertically integrated development with active
participation of the private sector in all aspects of the project.   The
proposed project design also  adddresses problems  of  a general  nature
identified through PCRs and special reviews of Bank projects in India. These
include: delays in project mobilization, institutional weaknesses and
inadequate local funding.   RB, the main implementing agency, is a well
established organization which would be further strengthened to enable quick
mobilization of the project. The requirements for local funds is provided for
in the RB's 8th Five Year Plan which, in principle, has been approved by the
Planning Commission.
7.   RationalA for Bank _Trua_1^ment.  The IDA's strategy in India is to
support policies and investments that encourage economic growth and poverty
alleviation in a context of macro-economic restructuring. The emphasis is on
efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency of the public sector and
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor.   The
proposed Project fits well within this framework. It would enable the RB to
undertake rubber development activities within the context of its eighth five
year plan and introduce new internationally practiced rubber production and
processing techniques. This would lead to a more efficient rubber subsector,
increase yields, lower costs of production and provide better quality of
processed rubber. These changes together with liberalized import and export of
rubber, expected reduction in tariff structure, the phasing out of input
subsidies and self-financing of the subsector through an increase in the cess
rate would enable India to fully exploit it's comparative advantage in rubber
production. Based on its past experience of the rubber industry in many other
countries, the IDA is well placed to assist in this process.   The rubber
subsector has an added attraction for IDA assistance because of its potential
for greater foreign exchange earnings through the export of manufactured
rubber products.
8.    Project Ohbjctives.  The proposed project would be a time slice covering
the eighth five year plan of the long-term rubber development program of GOI.
Its main objectives would be to expand and strengthen the rubber subsector to
increase production, provide assistance to rubber processors and generate on-



-3-
and oZf-farm rural ernployment. tn Tripura, its objectives would be to benefit
tribal people through the expansion of rubber based production systems on land
degraded by past practice of shifting cultivation. Additionally, the project
would aim to strengthen Re's and encourage policy changes, specially those
relating to self-financing of development activities and further trade reforms
(under the SAL Loan No., 3421-IN and Credits 2316-IN and 2316-1-IN).
9.    Projant DeLL   psripin.   The main components of the project,  to be
implemented over five years, would include:
(i)  £aplan.tig (US$44.4 million; 35% of base costs) of old, low yielding
rubber on 40,000 ha in the traditional rubber growing areas of Kerala
and Tamil Nadu. Funds would be made available to individual growers
through a line of credit by PBs refinanced by NABARD and a planting
assistance by RB;
(ii) Maw r.ubher plantings (US$28.5 million; 22% of base costs) over 30,000
ha, consisting of 23,000 ha in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, 5,000 ha in
Tripura.  In addition, about 1,500 ha of pilot plantations would be
established in selected non-traditional areas (Assam, Maharastra, Goa
and Karnataka) to assess technical, economic and social viability of
zubber production.   Funds would be made available to individual
growers through a line of credit by PBs refinanced by NABARD and
planting assistance by RB;
(iii)Producrtivity Enhancement  (US$23.0 million; 17% of base costs) over
60,000 ha mature rubber in Kerala and Tamil Nadu through improved
management of inputs, in particular discriminatory use of fertilizers,
fungicides, latex flow stimulants, and rain guarding of tapping panels
during the monsoon season. The project financing for inputs would be
limited to RB's share of the costs, ranging between 10-50% for
different inputs, remainder being the contribution of smallholders;
(iv) Upgrading and Establishment of Processing Facilities (US$20.4 million;
16% of base costs) for different categories of rubber (sheets, crumb
and centrifuged latex) and value added rubber by-products such as
rubber wood.   Funds would be made available to private investors,
including Rubber Producers Societies (RPSs), through a line of credit
by PBs refinanced by NABARD;
(v)  Tnstitutional  support  (US$10.3 million; 8% of base costs) for RB
including project coordination, research, extension, training,
technical assistance; and
(vi) Women's Programs ane Tribal Devpment  (US$2.1 million; 2% of base
costs) through a number of income generating activities, especially
during the immature phase of rubber trees as part of the Tribal
Development Plan (TDP). Support would be provided for the
participation of NGOs to facilitate increased participation of
beneficiaries (women and tribal people) in project activities as well
as other ongoing social and economic development programs.



10.   Projct T ml'mrntatioX.  RB would be the nodal agency and have overall
responsibility for the implementation of the proposed project.   The line of
credit to finance replanting, new planting and processing component would be
implemented through NABARD. The sub-loans to project beneficiaries would be
provided by PBs on commercial terms, which in turn would be refinanced by
NABARD in accordance with the Reserve Bank of India's guidelines. The self-
financing ability of the RD would be enhanced through costs reductions and
increase in the cess.  The 3% interest rate subsidy provided by RB to sub-
borrowers would be withdrawn and the input and polybag subsidies phased out.
To encourage growers to undertake long term investment in rubber cultivation,
a crop with long gestation period, and adoption of new technologies the
planting assistance of Re 8,000/ha (US$ 308 per hectare) would be maintained.
The cess rate would be increased from Rs 0.5/kg to Rs 1.0/kg of processed
rubber, with a provision to increase it to a maximum of Rs 2.0/kg, a
modification included in the revision to the Rubber Act. A start would be
made in transferring responsibility for procurement of inputs from RB to
Rubber Producers Societies.   The project costs are estimated at US$143.8
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$18.3 equivalent
(13%).   Estimated taxes and duties would amount to about US$6 million
equivalent.   IDA would finance US$92.0 million equivalent (100% of foreign
exchange and 67% of total costs). Retroactive financing up to an amount of
SDR 3.6 million (US$5.0 million equivalant) for all project activities,
especially those relatad to the planting and replanting programs, is proposed
for project expenditures incurred after Decexiber 31, 1991 to enable the
project to proceed quickly and to take advantage of the planting season that
begins in June. In addition, a special account would be established amounting
to US$4 million equal to about four months disbursements.  The project is to
be completed by September 30, 1997 and the closing date of September 30, 1998.
A breakdown of project costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amcunts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively.  Map IBRD No.23686 is attached.  The Staff Appraisal
Report, No.10633-IN dated May 11, 1992, is being distributed separately.
11.   Agreed Actlonns.  The main actions agreed at negotiations with GOI,
MOC/RB and NABARD include the following: (a) A plan for post project
investments through NABARD would be furnished toIDA by June 30, 1996 for areas
newly planted and replanted under the project; (b) MOC/RB would appoint the
remaining incremental staff by March 31, 1993; (c) RB would prepare a 5-year
training plan by March 31, 1993, which would be updated annually; (d) RB would
enter into contractual arrangements with TRPC and TFDPC for assisting in the
establishment of new plantings in areas jointly selected with RB- (e) NGOs
would be selected using criteria agreed with IDA; (f) the criteria for
selection of PBs and beneficiaries and the terms and conditions of sub-loans
and selection criteria for recipients of planting assistance would be as
specified and agreed with IDA; (g) NABARD would introduce a system for the
segregation of rubber accounts under the line of credits by January 31, 1993;
(h) RB in conjunction with IDA would complete the mid-term review by December
31, 1994 and implement its recommendations; (i) GOT with assistance from RB
would develop a land use plan for Tripura by Deszember 31, 1993; (j) RB would
develop a plan for monitoring copper residues in soil and water from selected



- 5 -
locations by March 31, 1993: (k) GOT with assistance trom RB would carry out
the TDP in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (1) not later than December 31, 1996
or such later date as may be agreed between IDA and RB, the polybag subsidy
would be phased out; (m) all input subsidies would be phased out by the end of
project as per agreed time table; (n) not later than June 30, 1993, GOI
jointly with IDA would review the implementation of price support mechanisms
proposed by MOC with a view to affecting any improvements that may be
necessary; (o) starting with January 31, 1994,  review would be undertaken
every other year by GOI to determine the level of cess required to meet RB's
expenditures and necessary measures would be taken to adjust the cess
accordingly. Conditions of credit effectiveness would be: (i) the specified
key incremental staff for RB have been appointed by GOI/MOC; (ii) appointment
of a full time project coordinator and establishment of the project
coordinating unit; and (iii) signing of subsidiary loan agreement between GOI
arnd NABARD.
12     nvi ronnmental AapectA.   The  environmental classification for the
project is category "B."  Rubber cultivation avoids soil erosion, improves
soil fertility and enhances moisi:ure retention in ax3as prone to degradation
either due to lack of vegetative cover or inappropriate soil and water
management practices.   In Tripura, areas degraded due to slash and burn
shifting agriculture would be brought under rubber cultivation and a long term
land use plan prepared to allow efficient allocation of land to cash (rubber)
and food crops.   Replanting of existing rubber in traditional areas would
increase availability of rubber wood in a well established market for its
utilization as lumber and as fuel. In Tripura, fuelwood supplies required for
rubber processing would be increased through social forestry schemes and
planting of trees on the boundaries of rubber holdings under the TDP.
Pollution control measures for treatment of relatively benign effluent from
rubber factories are well known (anaerobic/aerobic ponding system) and
incorporated in the design of processing plants.   Containment of diseases,
which are the main crop protection problem, would be through planting of
tolerant clones and/or judicious use of fungicides with a good safety record.
Environment monitoring would be undertaken by RB with support from Pollution
Control Boards of each state and Agricultural Universitites in Kerala and
Tamil Nadu.
13.   TMpact on wNmen and Tribals. The project would provide women with
increased opportunities for employment and assist them in developing alternate
sources of income.   In traditional a-eas these would include: training in
skilled jobs such as tapping and bud grafting. In addition, assistance would
be provided in establishing microenterprises like beekeeping and rabbit
rearing through existing NABARD refinanced schemes. Project activities for
women in Tripura are incorporated into the Tribal Development Plan (TDP),
which meets the requirements under OD 4.20. Cultivation of rubber by about
2,500 tribal families, currently living below the poverty line, would provide
a steady source of income from the time the rubber tree comes into tapping.
During the immaturity phase of rubber, intercropping with other cash crops
such as papaya and banana would provide additional security.   In addition,
pilot income generating activities such as pisiculture, poultry and beekeeping
would be initiated. Under the TDP, the tribals would also benefit from on-
going social support schemes (nutrition, health, social forestry) being
financed by GOT/GOI. NGOs, operating in close collaboration with extension
service, would assist in motivating growers, transfer of technology, and



establishment of income generating activities, especially during the
i=aturity phase of rubber.
14.   Pr*njee-t  anfit-.  The project has a satisfactory Economic Rate of
Return estimated at 20.7% at export parity prices and 29.9% of import parity
prices. Incremental benefits would result from: (a) increased rubber
production due to replanting, new plantings and productivity enhancement
components; (b) improved quality of processed rubber through upgraded
processing facilities; and Ic) value added rubber byproduct in the form of
processed wood.   The  project would benefit  150,000 rubber growers and
processors, and directly create about 2,800 jobs in off-farm activities.
15.   B-'ka:  There are no major risks associated with the project.  Internal
demand and India's new trade policy would provide export opportunities for
incremental rubber produced, especially for manufactured rubber products. As
with all conmodity projects, the volatility of the international prices could
affect the economic viability of the project. However, sensitivity analyses
undertaken for price fluctuations confirms the project's viability. Thi risks
associated with loans made to smallholders are minimal in the traditional
areas, as is shown by estimated past recoveries of over 90%.  However, in
Tripura the PBs have not had sufficient experience of providing credit to
rubber smallholders, which would require greater technical support by RB and
close monitoring during project supervision. The potential for deterioration
of the political situation in Tripura could hamper the implementation of the
project in that state. However, the situation is now stable.
16.   ee! zmndatJo.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the credit.
