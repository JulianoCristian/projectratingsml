                         The project development objective for TAP was to assist the GoT to increase tax revenues without increasing tax rates. The PDO for TMP-IDA is designed to
                         reflect TRAs mission statement which is: "To be an effective and efficient Tax Administration, which promotes voluntary tax compliance by providing high
                         quality service with fairness
                          and integrity through competent and motivated staff".
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall Implementation Progress is satisfactory although the PDO remains at marginally satisfactory. Progress has been made in the review period with regard to the implementation
                         of the customs modernization program; this has already resulted in tangible improvements in customs clearance times. Further reduction in clearance times are to be expected as a
                         result of the implementation of the recommendations of the Time Release Study (TRS). A number of other major initiatives included in the TRA Corporate Plan aiming at increasing
                         the efficiency of revenue collection and facilitating taxpayer compliance have been launched and are at the implementation stage. This includes the implementation of an enterprise-
                         wide risk management system, the launch of the second large taxpayer perception survey, the installation of a forensic lab for tax investigations, and the preparatory work for
                         establishment of an external whistleblower mechanism.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Revenue projections needs to be more realistic, as TRA consistently falls short and VAT refunds needs to be made on a more timely basis.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
