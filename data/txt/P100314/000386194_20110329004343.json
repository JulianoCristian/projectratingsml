The\n            closing date for the above-mentioned project will be\n            extended from March 31, 2011 to September 30, 2011 to enable\n            a number of contracts for the delivery of specific goods and\n            services which have been procured, to be completed. This\n            will be the second extension of the project. The project\n            development objective of the TMP is to promote an effective\n            and efficient tax administration that provides high quality\n            customer services with fairness and integrity. Although\n            revenue targets have not been met 93 percent, progress has\n            been made with regard to the implementation of the customs\n            modernization program; this has already resulted in tangible\n            improvements in customs clearance times. Further reduction\n            in clearance times are to be expected as a result of the\n            implementation of the recommendations of the Time Release\n            Study (TRS). A number of other major initiatives included in\n            the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) Corporate Plan aiming\n            at increasing the efficiency of revenue collection and\n            facilitating taxpayer compliance have been launched and are\n            at the implementation stage. This includes the\n            implementation of an enterprise-wide risk management system,\n            the launch of the second large taxpayer perception survey,\n            the installation of a forensic lab for tax investigations,\n            and the preparatory work for establishment of an external\n            whistleblower mechanism."}, "docdt": "2011-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
