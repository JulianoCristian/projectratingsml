                         The project development objective for TAP was to assist the GoT to increase tax revenues without increasing tax rates. The PDO for TMP-IDA is designed to
                         reflect TRAs mission statement which is: "To be an effective and efficient Tax Administration, which promotesvoluntary tax compliance by providing high
                         quality service with fairness and integrity through competent and motivated staff".

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall Implementation Progress is satisfactory although the PDO remains at marginally satisfactory. Progress has been made in the review period with regard to the implementation
                         of the customs modernization program; this has already resulted in tangible improvements in customs clearance times. Further reduction in clearance times are to be expected as a
                         result of the implementation of the recommendations of the Time Release Study (TRS). A number of other major initiatives included in the TRA Corporate Plan aiming at increasing

                         Revenue projections needs to be more realistic, as TRA consistently falls short and VAT refunds needs to be made on a more timely basis.
