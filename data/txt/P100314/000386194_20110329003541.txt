7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project development objective for TAP is to assist the GoT to increase tax revenues without increasing
tax rates. The PDO for TMP-IDA is designed to reflect TRAs mission statement which is: "To be an
effective and efficient Tax Administration, which promotes voluntary tax compliance by providing high
quality service with fairness and integrity through competent and motivated staff".

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for the above-mentioned project will be extended from March
31, 2011 to September 30, 2011 to enable a number of contracts for the delivery of
specific goods and services which have been procured, to be completed. This will be the
second extension of the project.

2.      The Project Development Objective of the TMP is to promote an effective and
efficient tax administration that provides high quality customer services with fairness and
integrity. Although revenue targets have not been met (93 percent), progress has been
made with regard to the implementation of the customs modernization program; this has
already resulted in tangible improvements in customs clearance times. Further reduction
in clearance times are to be expected as a result of the implementation of the
recommendations of the Time Release Study (TRS). A number of other major initiatives
included in the TRA Corporate Plan aiming at increasing the efficiency of revenue
collection and facilitating taxpayer compliance have been launched and are at the
implementation stage. This includes the implementation of an enterprise-wide risk
management system, the launch of the second large taxpayer perception survey, the
installation of a forensic lab for tax investigations, and the preparatory work for
establishment of an external whistleblower mechanism.

3.     With the completion of the proposed activities, the remaining funds will be fully
disbursed. TRA has indicated that it does not require additional funding at this time as
DFID and AFRITEC have provided parallel funding through the basket fund.

4.     The team has discussed and agreed with the Borrower the Implementation Action
Plan that is feasible and realistic, and will enable a successful achievement of the Project
Development Objectives within the proposed time-frame. Everything will be completed
by end-August 2011.

5.     There are no budget implications for supervision. There is adequate funding
under the TMP until the end of 2010/11 fiscal year. Project and supervision of this single
remaining activity does not require much additional time.

6.     Preparation on the Implementation Completion Report should not be delayed and
would still be completed within FY 2012.

7.     All audits are current and unqualified
