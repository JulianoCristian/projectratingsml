increase their productivity and incomes.  The project\n            includes investments to strengthen the major components of\n            an extension service.  On organization and management, funds\n            will be provided for: (i) investments and operation support\n            necessary to strengthen the extension service, expand it to\n            six new areas, and develop two prototypes in arid and\n            semi-arid areas; (ii) transportation to increase staff\n            mobility and enable them to work with groups; (iii)\n            divisional offices; (iv) office, field and training\n            equipment; (v) a computerized monitoring system on a pilot\n            basis; (vi) technical assistance in procurement, accounting\n            auditing; and (vii) impact assessment, organization, and\n            staff deployment studies.  On extension methodology, the\n            project will fund:  (i) improved use of mass media and\n            better communications; (ii) rehabilitation and furnishing of\n            Farmer Training Centers; and (iii) establishment of two\n            Farmer Service Centers on a pilot basis.  On training, the\n            project supports: (i) a review of the curricula and\n            operations of agricultural educational institutions; (ii)\n            degree training; (iii) courses to retrain staff in crop and\n            livestock production; (iv) regular training sessions; and\n            (v) orientation courses.
