NFRF and the Agricultural Co-operative Bank, to be\n            responsible for defining and implementing feed policies\n            aiming at optimizing, on a national basis, the use of\n            available feed materials and feed storage facilities; (b)\n            provision of financing for the annual purchased feed needs\n            of sheep co-operatives, thus permitting the creation of
