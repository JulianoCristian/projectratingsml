                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's closing date was extended from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012 to allow (i) the health component activities to be completed - notably the re-impregnation and
                         distribution of 266,000 bed nets and the equipment of clinics, (ii) the extension of HIV/AIDS activities to the rural areas and (iii) the identification and implementation of community sub
                         projects which were proved to be more complex and time-consuming than planned. This is the second extension of the project.
