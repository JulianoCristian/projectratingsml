"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The original objectives of the\n            Multisectoral HIV/AIDS, Health, and Education Emergency\n            Support Project were to help the Government reduce HIV/AIDS,\n            prevalence in the Central Africa Republic (CAR), and to\n            mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected with or\n            affected by HIV/AIDS. The main reasons for the project\n            restructuring are: new emergencies resulting from civil\n            disturbances and developments since original project\n            approval and because HIV-AIDS remains a major problem in\n            CAR. The revised project development objectives (PDO)\n            reflect on today's understanding that the\n            Multi-sectoral AIDS Program (MAP) projects cannot use\n            prevalence rates as impact indicators. The revised PDO would\n            be to contribute to meeting (a) urgent needs in the fight\n            against HIV, such as access to prevention, treatment, and\n            impact mitigation services (b) urgent social needs such as\n            prevention of malaria, increased access to water supply and\n            improved primary education. The project components and\n            subcomponents would reflect the new objectives, addressing\n            HN/AIDS, health and education emergency needs. The\n            restructured project would include a component for each\n            sector, plus a component for a small financial management\n            and procurement unit."}, "docdt": "2007-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
