"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS,\n            Health, and Education Emergency Support Project for Central\n            African Republic (CAR) were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: strong ownership and the\n            commitment of key actors could leverage significant funding\n            and ensure continuity in the government and partner efforts\n            even under circumstances that do not allow for normal\n            operation. The case of CAR demonstrated this in two ways.\n            First, the project faced more than five years of suspension\n            before effectiveness but the government was still able to\n            make full use of project advances and Trust Funds that were\n            exceptionally granted to strengthen its institutional\n            capacity, and as a result, leveraged large amount of\n            resources from different partners. Second, once the decision\n            on re-engagement was made, the World Bank team and the\n            government moved swiftly with the project preparation\n            capitalizing on what had been built in the preceding years,\n            while adjusting the design and implementation mechanism to\n            meet the actual needs. A strategy shift in 2007 from a\n            single HIV/AIDS operation to a multifaceted one encompassing\n            broader social sectors promoted a higher response to needs\n            in diverse areas. In addition, synergies were created to\n            ensure efficient use of resources. A clear, well-defined\n            institutional arrangement from the outset is crucial to\n            achieving optimal results in a multisectoral operation.\n            Stakeholders agreed that part of the initial implementation\n            delays were caused by ambiguity in their division of roles\n            and responsibilities, given the complexity of the project\n            set-up and the numerous parties involved. Some of\n            project's creative approaches for fiduciary\n            arrangements could provide important lessons in a context of\n            political instability and post-conflict situations. Use of\n            Civil-Society Organizations (CSOs) needs to be accompanied\n            by a realistic capacity assessment and support for capacity\n            strengthening. The project underscored the great benefits of\n            civil society involvement and empowerment of communities in\n            responding to their own needs and reaching out to the most\n            remote areas; however, adequate technical capacity of these\n            organizations needs to be ensured."}, "docdt": "2012-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
