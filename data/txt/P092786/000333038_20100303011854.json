Some lessons learned included:\n            designing a project that depends on the permanence and\n            efficacy of a handful of individuals is a high-risk\n            proposition. More work up front, and where that was not\n            possible, early on in implementation, to build support for\n            the project at the technical level will have resulted in\n            greater ownership. The amount the loan for the HCTA Project\n            was probably adequate for the actual tasks, but not enough\n            to catch and hold the interest of ministers once the project\n            champions had moved on. Also, the fact that the project was\n            not incremental to regular ministry budgets further reduced\n            interest. If it had been possible to decentralize the\n            project steering committee to a lower level (perhaps\n            department heads), the amount of money might have been\n            enough to gain attention, and built greater ownership. But\n            this will have required more work done up front to build\n            ownership for project activities. Traditional Bank\n            investment projects have a lot of rules and are a lot of\n            work to implement. As European funds with fewer strings\n            became more available, the ministries could turn to other\n            sources to fund activities (such as information technology\n            investment) originally contemplated under the project and\n            the pressure to implement the Bank funded project grew still\n            less urgent."}, "docdt": "2009-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
