A.2. Project Objectives

The objective of the Project is to assist the Government of Slovakia in modernizing its systems of
employment, education and social cohesion by developing an effective policy infrastructure to implement,
manage and evaluate employment, education and social cohesion reforms in the MoLSAF and the MOE.

If successful, the project will develop institutional capacity for evidence-based policy making in the two
participating Ministries.


The Government of Slovakia intends to consolidate the reforms undertaken to date, and to couple them
with forward-looking and mutually consistent employment and social cohesion policies in order to achieve
a lasting decline in poverty and social exclusion.        These reforms will be a necessary condition of
Slovakia's continued growth.

The Human Capital Technical Assistance (HCTA) project will contribute to these objectives by
developing the human resources involved in policy-making; strengthening the management systems and
processes governing policy preparation and ensuring the capacity for evidence based policy monitoring.

The proposed project is fully consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy1 goals of supporting poverty
alleviation through economic development, strengthening labor market reforms and introducing education
reforms. It directly relates to two of the three main development challenges for Slovakia as discussed in
the CPS:       (i) to make Slovakia fully competitive in European and World Markets through the
implementation of the structural reforms to improve labor and capital mobility; and (ii) to reduce poverty
and unemployment and to address the marginalization of Roma.

A.3. Project Description

The project will have three components:

Component 1: Creation Of A Policy Capacity Framework (Euro 1,070,000)

The objective of this component is to create a framework within which evidence-based policy making and

     1    Country Partnership Strategy, May 6, 2004.

the design and implementation of components of reform in the two Ministries and associated institutions
can be coordinated. The component will provide technical assistance to: (i) assess the current institutional
capacity for policy making and monitoring in the two participating Ministries and their associated
institutions; and (ii) develop a consistent and sustainable strategy to increase technical capacity for
implementation and monitoring of the reforms. Additionally, the component will provide support for:
(iii) the creation of project coordination mechanisms and the necessary project implementation structure;
and (iv) strategies to mainstream and ensure the sustainability of reforms.

Component 2: Investment In Human Resources (Euro 3,050,000)

The objective of this component is to achieve a significant improvement in the quality of human resources
available for policy making and implementation in the two participating Ministries and associated
institutions, through increasing the capacity of the existing staff reallocation and targeted recruitment, to
analyze policy options and the impact of ongoing reforms. The component will provide assistance to: (i)
to build institutional capacity through improving the quality of the Human Resource Management systems
in both MoLSAF and MoE.; (ii) identify training needs and opportunities (including internships,
scholarships. capacity building and research grants); (iii) enhance policy capacity through the provision of
training and exposure to other policy environments; and (iv) create instruments to attract new researchers
and policy analysts to enter the field through scholarship and research grants.

Component 3: Building And Upgrading Institutional Capacity (Euro 800,000)

The objective of this component is to create and implement an integrated policy management system to
structure and guide the various steps in the policy cycle in both the participating Ministries and in the
network of associated institutions. The component will: (i) develop effective mechanisms to improve
policy making, including the development of important national social and educational action plans and
reports; (ii) improve the quality and quantity of internationally comparable data available to policy makers
in both MoLSAF and MoE; and (iii) will develop social policy monitoring and evaluation indicators in
the field of employment, education and social cohesion.
