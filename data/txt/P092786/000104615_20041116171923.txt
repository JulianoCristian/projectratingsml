1.  Country and Sector Background 
 
Since 1998, Slovakia has followed an impressive reform agenda,  ranging from public finance to 
employment, education, health and social cohesion.  The principal aim has been to make labor law and 
the welfare system more accommodating for productive employment, the taxation and regulatory 
frameworks more supportive of new enterprise creation and business sector development, and  the public 
education system more efficient, effective and responsive to the needs of a twenty-first century 
environment.  There is now, however, concern that the improvement in efficiency has been achieved at 
the expense of an increase in inequality and poverty, with the reforms having reduced access to economic 
opportunities and basic services for the socially excluded and those left behind by recent economic 
growth. 
 
2. Objectives 
 
The project will develop an effective policy infrastructure to implement, manage and evaluate 
employment, education and social cohesion reforms in the MoLSAF and in the MoE.  
 
If successful, the project will develop institutional capacity for evidence-based policy making in the two 
participating Ministries. 
 
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
The Bank has been engaged for a number of years in a comprehensive policy dialogue with both the 
MoLSAF and the MoE.  Extensive analytical work has been done in the area of social assistance.  The 
programmatic Living Standards Assessment currently underway  will inform the dialogue on poverty.  
The Bank has also provided technical assistance on higher education financing.  The Bank recognizes that 
Page  2
the improvement of policy capacity is a key to sustainability of the ambitious reform process started in 
Slovakia in 1998 and accelerated since 2002. 
 
4. Description 
 
The Government has requested a Technical Assistance loan of Euro 4,920,000.   This project will be fully 
financed by the Bank loan. There are no cost sharing arrangements which is consistent with the proposed 
Country Financing Parameters for TA lending. The project will finance technical assistance and operating 
costs.

7. Implementation 
 
The project will be implemented over a three-year period by two agencies: the MOLSAF and the MOE. 
Overall responsibility for the project will rest with the MOLSAF, where a Project Director for HCTA will 
be appointed in the MOLSAF. In addition, the MOE will also appoint a project coordinator to work with 
the Project Director for HCTA. To provide policy oversight and direction for the project as a whole, a 
Steering Committee, comprising representatives from MOLSAF, MOE, MOF (to be confirmed) and the 
Project Director for HCTA, will be established. The State Secretary for the Ministry of Labor, Social 
Affairs and Family will chair the Committee. 
 
The Project Director for HCTA will be responsible for overall coordination of the activities of the project, 
in particular, the common procurement, disbursement and reporting functions. The Project Director for 
HCTA will function as the liaison between the Bank and the MOLSAF for the project, as well as liaison 
with the other involved Government agencies.  The Project Director for HCTA, with support from the 
PCU for the Social Benefits Reform Administration Project (SBRA) will be responsible for: (a) overall 
financial management of the project, including handling of disbursements and required reporting 
procedures (e.g. quarterly financial monitoring reports) for the Bank; and (b) overall management of the 
procurement process, including processing of procurement packages and coordination of the bid 
evaluations. The project coordinator in the MOE will be responsible for technical oversight of its 
respective components, and all technical background work for the procurement process, including 
preparation of terms of reference and technical specifications. To ensure coordination of the project 
activities, the Project Director for HCTA and project coordinator in the MOE should meet on a regular 
basis. 
 
The Project Director for HCTA will report directly to the State Secretary in the MOLSAF and has the 
overall responsibility for the implementation of the project, including day-to-day coordination of project 
activities and logistics. The Project Director for HCTA is authorized to act, sign contracts and enter into 
agreements on behalf of the MOLSAF.  The Project Director for HCTA will also coordinate project 
supervision, and monitoring and evaluation.  The MOLSAF has advised the Bank that the fiduciary 
Page  3
functions would be sub-contracted to the PCU for the Social Benefits Reform Administration (SBRA) 
Project, which is also based in the MOLSAF. This sub-contracting arrangement of fiduciary functions to 
the SBRA PCU will continue until the MOLSAF advise the Bank a new alternative arrangements, 
acceptable to the Bank, are to be implemented. The SBRA PCU have experienced financial manager and 
procurement specialists. A chart on this sub-contracting arrangement of fiduciary functions is attached 
below. 
 
Agreement between Borrower and Implementing Agencies.  The Borrower is the Slovak 
Republic represented by its Ministry of Finance (MOF).  The MOLSAF and the MOE will be the 
implementing agencies for the Project. Subsidiary loan agreements will be signed between the 
MOF and the MOE. Assurances have been obtained from the MOLSAF and the MOE that 
adequate funding, based on the project financing plan, will be made available in a timely manner 
and necessary steps will be taken to expedite the procurement procedures related to the major 
equipment purchases. 
 
8. Sustainability 
 
The project has been designed in response to the request of  the MoLSAF senior management in 
cooperation with the MoE.  The project design is based on the detailed proposals of the Borrower for 
assistance to develop capacity to manage own-initiated reforms, evaluate their effects and develop further 
strategies to improve access to education and economic opportunities for the Slovak population..  The 
loan will not provide any incremental resources to the MoLSAF and to the MoE but will be financed by 
the budget of the Ministries.  Although there is no counterpart funding, the two participating Ministries 
will not receive additional budget financing for this project, so effectively their budgets have been 
reduced in order to contribute notionally towards the total borrowing for this project. .  Assuming that the 
existing strong leadership continues, it is expected that project outcomes will be mainstreamed in the 
MoLSAF, and to a lesser extent in the MoE, within the lifetime of the project.
 
9.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The proposed project builds on several years of policy dialogue with the two principal  Ministries 
(MoLSAF and MoE).  Specifically, the project will build on the Social Sectors Expenditure Review , on 
the extensive analytical work that had been done as part of the proposed Social Development Fund 
operation in Slovakia; on the Living Standards Assessment and on several years of policy dialogue and 
technical assistance to the Ministry of Education. 
 
The experience of two other technical assistance loans in Slovakia  has been helpful in the design of this 
project.  The 
Public Finance Management Project
 (2003) which is being implemented through the 
Ministry of Finance focuses on strengthening the management of the public sector and is thus directly 
relevant to this project. The 
Health
 
Sector Modernization Support Project
 
(2004) also has a component 
on capacity building. 
 
The lessons learned to date from these and other Capacity Building Loans are that the 
preconditions of excellent technical assistance always include: (i) strong ownership of the project 
in the relevant Government Ministries and other participating institutions; (ii) understanding of 
the objective of the reforms supported by the project; and (iii) clear project
 
goals that are well 
Page  4
communicated to stakeholders both inside implementing Ministries and in associated institutions.   
These lessons are reflected in the design of the project.
