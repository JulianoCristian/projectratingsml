In\n            Bangladesh, some announced policies have never been\n            implemented. This report focuses on issues related to (a)\n            through (d) with the objective of assisting GOB to develop a\n            medium-term strategy for non-traditional export promotion\n            based on the findings of the IPC-14 pre-appraisal mission\n            which visited Bangladesh from October 5 to 22, 1985."}, "docdt": "1986-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
