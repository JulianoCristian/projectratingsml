                                             I.    INTRODUCTION



           1.1       The GOB has recently undertaken many important measures to

           promote non-traditional exports.        As a result of the export policies,

           adopted under the NIP, the GOB has recently achieved impressive growth in

           its non-traditional exports.      However, the GOB needs to continue expanding

           its non-traditional exports in order to earn scarce foreign exchange and

           implement its overall development strategies, as defined in the NIP.          To do

           so, GOB will have to meet the dual challenges of:        (a) continuously

           improving its export policies and their implementation; and (b) c.ompeting

           in an uncertain, highly competitive world market with growing protectionism

           (several OECD countries recently imposed garment quota restrictions on

           Bangladesh).   The objective of this Sector Credit is to support the GOB in

           developing medium-term strategies and designing specific policy instruments

           and administrative arrangements to meet these challenges.        The major areas

           of reform proposed in this paper are:        (a) assurance of free and

           unrestricted imported inputs for export industries; (b) easy access to

           export financing; (c) maintenance of a realistic exchange rate for

           exporters; Cd) development of backward linkages from non-traditional

           exports; (e) dealing with the import restrictions imposed by developed

           countries; and (f) promotion of foreign direct investment and technology

           transfer in non-traditional export industries.

            1.2        In designing future strategies for the development of manufac­

            tured exports in Bangladesh, four major points must be taken into account.

            First and foremost, the key policy factors that have contributed so greatly

            to the unprecedented success Bangladesh has had with garment exports must

            be strengthened and expanded to other manufacturing industries.     Thus, any

            serious discussion of Bangladesh's export policy and administration must

            start with a careful review of the policies and administrative measures

            being implemented in the garment export sector.     It seems that this

            critical step appears to be overlooked in the midst of the shock stemming

            from the quota imposed by developed countries.     Second, in evaluating the

            effectiveness of various policy measures, the experiences of other

            developing countries that have succeeded in expanding their manufactured

            exports needs to be studied.     Third, given that external factors have

            become increasingly important, the design of policy measures should

            preclude future controversies and threats of retaliation by importing
                    .        .
            developed countries. Fourth, policy measures are useless unless they are

            effectively implemented.     They need to be founded on concrete action

            programs supported by detailed and efficient administrative arrangements

            and institutional set-ups.     In Bangladesh, some announced policies have

            never been implemented. while others have not been carried out very effect­

            ively.   The first priorities should be to design efficient administrative

            arrangements, build the necessary institutions and effectivelv implement

            the specific policies.



            1.3        Product-specific or firm-specific approaches have typically been

            usen in designing and implementing export incentives.     These approaches

                    might be reasonable in the early stages of administering the system of

                    export incentives.    However, as the export sector grows, these ad hoc

                    policies will not only mislead potential exporters but will respond very

                    inefficiently to the rapidly changing needs of the sector.     Thus, priority

                    should be given to setting general principles and guidelines for export

                    incentives and administration that apply equally to all industries and

                     firms generating direct and indirect exports.   They should be based on

                    automatic mechanisms without any discretionary elements and bureaucratic

                    delays.



                     1.4        Within this context, the GOB needs to develop carefully phased

                    and detailed programs in six areas:



                           (a) 	 Ensuring both duty- and restriction-free access to imported

                                inputs to all exporters, direct and indirect;



                           (b) 	 Assuring equal and easy access to export financing by all

                                exporters, direct and indirect;



                           (c) 	 Maintaining realistic exchange rates for all direct and indirect

                               exports;



                           (d) 	 Designing the administrative arrangements that promote backward

            1.5           This report focuses on issues related to (a) through (d) with the

            objective of assisting GOB to develop a medium-term strategy for

           non-traditional export promotion based on the findings of the IPC-14

            pre-appraisal mission which visited Bangladesh from October 5 to 22, 1985.

            (issues related to (e) and (f) are discussed in the separate notes prepared

           by the other mission members).



                              II.   THE SUCCESS OF BANGLADESH'S GARMENT EXPORTS



            2.1          . One very bright spot in Bangladesh's current economic picture is

            the performance of its garment exports.         Table 1 shows the average annual

           growth rates in current U.S. dollars during 1976/77-1984/85 for the major

            Bangladesh export items that had a value in excess of US$10 million in

            1984/85.      The comparison of garments with other exports is revealing.

           While Bangladesh's exports have been dominated by jute-related products,

            two of them, "raw june" and "jute manufactures," did not increase much over

            the last eight years, although another one, "j une speciali ty products,"

           which are still a very small fraction of jute-related exports, grew more

            than   )m~   a year on average since 1979/80, except in 1981/82.      The growth of

            other primary exports such as "tea' was not very rem;irkable.

            2.2         As to domestic non-june primary resource-based exports, such as

            "leather and leather products" and "frozen shrimps, fish and frog legs,"

            their expansion has been quite promising, despite variations in growth of

            from less than 15% to 25% a year.        The other important non-garment

            manufactured export shown in Table 1 is "naphtha."        However, it is the

            result of temporary excess output, rather than of trade based on

            comparative advantage.



            2.3         The record of "ready-made garment" exports from Bangladesh over

            the eight years is, in contrast, unprecedented, not only in comparison with

            all the other products in Table 1, but even in comparison with the growth

            of East Asian manufactured exports during the sixties, seventies and

            eighties.   Garment exports increased their share in Bangladesh's total

            exports from 0.001% in 1976/77 to 12.4% in 1984/85, for an annual average

            growth rate of 300%.        Clearly, there mus.t be many valuable lessons to be

            drawn from this'experience.        Unfortunately, the recent shock of the quotas

            imposed by a few OECD countries on garment exports from Bangladesh may be

            overshadowing these lessons.        Yet, in developing effective strategies for

            Bangladesh's manufactured exports, nothing is more important than

            understanding clearly the underlying policy factors that have contributed

            to the unprecedented high average annual growth rate of garment exports.



            Equal Footing with Foreign Competitors

            _ .(.l.     Unlike in other sectors, 100% garment exporters using special

            bonded warehouses (SBW) have had equal footing with foreign competitors,

            who enjoy free trade in inputs and easy access to export financing, as well

            as realistic and flexible exchange rates, that is, they benefit from

            undistorted markets and policies.     On the other hand, these garment

            exporters have not gotten the many additional export incentives available

            to import-substitution industries and firms.



            2.5          Some experts say that equal treatment of both groups is

            necessary.    They call for flat aggregate export subsidies, which will

            equalize the incentives between export and import-substitution firms at the

            aggregate sectoral level (Rab, 1985; Hutcheson and McKay, 1985).        They

            argue that no one would attempt to export under a policy regime such as

            that described above, which assures equal footing only with foreign

            competitors, as selling to the domestic market is more profitable.



            2.6          The empirical evidence in Bangladesh does not support that

            argument.     Instead, it is shown' here, "for the following major reasons, that

            guaranteeing individual producers and sellers of export goods with equal

            footing with foreign competitors (the equal footing argument, or EF) is

            much more important than providing equal incentives to export and

            import-substitution firms at the aggregate sectoral and economy-wide levels

            (the equal incentive argument, or EI).        First, the profits exporters reap

            under EF policies are not necessarily lower than those of import­

            substitution firms in Bangladesh.     The reason is that the domestic market

            is extremely limited, while the international market offers economies of

            scale and externalities.     While garment exporters were enjoying an

            extraordinary boom up until the quotas were imposed, the domestic garment

                   industries, which have been under a high rate of effective protection,

                   stagnated.



                   2.7          Second, the EI argument has become very impractical, at least in

                   the short run, in developing countries with heavy import protection and

                   balance of payment difficulties.     It has proven virtually impossible to

                   provide equal export incentives by means of huge export subsidies because

                   of the threat of counterveiling actions by developed countries and because

                   of domestic budgetary constraints.     In Bangladesh's garment sector, it is

                  not feasible to achieve EI by providing additional export incentives as

                   they would have to amount to a 200-300% rate of effective protection [TIP

                   (1984a)].     The only way to achieve EI and EF is to have free trade for the

                  whole economy, a condition that is far from feasible in the short run in

                  most developing countries, even if it should be a medium- or long-term

                  goal.   Therefore, Bangladesh does not seem to have a rational choice

                  between EF and £1.      Rather, the" issue -is which is feasible given current

                  external and internal constraints.      (We are not suggesting that the current

                   income tax and other incentives being granted to exporters in Bangladesh be

                  discontinued.      The incentive value of these instruments is very small when

                  compared to those needed to achieve EI.)



                  2.8           Third, some of the policy instruments designed to assure EF are

                  much more important for the development of manufactured exports than E1

                  proponents believe.      For example, under the EF argument, the critical role

                  of export financing is to assure automatic and speedy access to financing

                  at competitive interest rates.      According to EI proponents, the only role
'~NAME:' ExPolicy (R)P: (D-l72a) 09



                                                - 9 ­



           of export financing is to provide an export subsidy equivalent to the

           difference between the interest rates for export and general bank loans.

           The latter view ignores the critical role export financing systems have

           played in such NICs as Singapore and Korea (Republic of Korea), where there

           is currently virtually no difference between export loan and prime interest

           rates.    (All the TIP studies, including Rab's [1985], fail to appreciate

           the critical importance of export financing.)



           2.9         Fourth, the true empirical status of E1 during the 1960s, '70s

           and '80s in most developing countries has not been fully exposed, partly

           because of different researchers have used different levels of aggrega­

           tion.    The conventional wisdom is that the economies which have succeeded

           on the basis of outward-looking development strategies have all achieved EI

           between exports and import substitution.     However, that conclusion has been

           based on" aggregate economy-wide information.    It is not true that EI has

           be~n achieved at the firm or subsector level in many successful developing

           countries, including Korea.    On the other hand, it is true that the

           successful economies have guaranteed, without exception, EF with foreign

           competitors at the individual firm and product level.



           2.10       A careful comparison of Brazil and Korea would be quite

           instructive.    Even though both countries had more or less achieved EI at

           the aggregate economy-wide level during the 1960s and 1970s, there has been

           a marked difference between the two at the micro level.     Korea built its EI

           on EF at the firm and product level.    During the sixties and seventies, it

           succeeded in achieving EF for all activities generating export value added
<NAME:.ExPolicy (R)P: (D-172a) 10



                                                 - 10 ­



          at the product and firm levels (i.e., for all indirect exporters and small

           producers, as well as for direct exporters and large companies), even

           though it did not assure EI across the board at that level.       Therefore, at

           least a minimum level of free trade and automatic access to export

           financing has been assured without exception.       As such, there has been

           little variation in the effective incentives available to exporters (direct

           and indi rect) •



           2.11         Brazil did not follow the same approach initially.    Instead, it

           used financial and tax incentives for exports to achieve an aggregate EI

          without EF at the firm and product level.       As a result, many exporters

          enjoyed neither duty-free nor restriction-free imports, nor have automatic

          access to export financing, while at the same time other selected exporters

          were getting large discretionary tax and financial incentives.        While at

           the aggregate level, these negative and positive incentives cancelled each

           other out, yielding EI, the extreme    v~riation   in incentives among exporters

          at the micro level discouraged many from participating in the country's

          export drive.



          2.12         The above comparison, combined with Bangladesh's garment

          experience, suggests that guaranteeing EF for all activities generating

          export value added at the product and firm level is much more important and

          feasible than providing EI at the aggregate level.        Unfortunately, some

          experts propose the approach used unsuccessfully by such countries as

          Brazil without understanding the critical importance of the former, which

          h~s     heen used so successfully by such economies as Korea.

                       Guaranteed Free Trade Status Through SBW



            2.13       The single most important policy factor responsible for

            Bangladesh's export success with ready-made garments was a very effective

            instrument, the SBW system, which is used to guarantee free trade status

            for imported inputs.        The SBW system, which applies to 100% garment

            exporters, is nothing more than a duty exemption system that uses a stock

            accounting book method (see below) of administration.        The fact that

            Bangladesh has successfully applied this innovative duty exemption system

            for garment exports suggests that it can be extended to other sectors and

            less than 100% exporters with proper modification.



                       Easy Access to Export Financing Through Back-to-Back Usance

                       Import LIe.



            2.14       The second most important factor has been the quick availability

            of export related financing, especially for imported inputs.        The easy

            access to suppliers' credit, based on the so-called "Back-to-Back (Usance

            Import) LIC (BUM L/C) scheme, has been critical in meeting exporters'

            working capital needs in the absence of loans in foreign currencies through

            the Bangladesh Bank.        Thanks to the textile and garment quotas imposed by

            developed importing countries, the textile-exporting NICs have been more

            than willing to provide suppliers' credits tied to the exports of fabrics

            needed for garment manufacturing in such non-quota countries as Bangladesh.

                         Maintaining a Realistic Exchange Rate Through XPL/IEC or XPB



            2.15         The Export Performance Benefit (XPB) system, and before it, the

            Export Performance Licensing (XPL)/Import Entitlement Certificate (IEC)

            system, were designed to compensate for the overvaluation of the official

            exchange rate.     Based on different entitlement rates, this system has been

            quite important in compensating garment exporters, either partially or

            fully, for the overvaluation of the official exchange rate associated with

            net foreign exchange earnings.



                         Other Export Incentives



            2.16         The other export incentives available to garment exporters have

            been an income tax rebate system and a concessional duty rate on imports of

            machinery.     The value of these instruments for garment export value added,

            however, "have not been significant (about 7% according to Rab, 1985).



                         Other Policy Factors



            2.17         Had Bangladesh garment manufacturers not acquired technical,

            managerial and marketing know-how, they would never have achieved the

            export growth they did.     This conclusion holds even in light of the

            rational policy regime that assured equal footing with foreign competitors,

            a policy thRt allowed Bangladesh to exploit its comparative advantage in

            garment manufacturing, which stems from its relatively low wages and

            reasonahle labor productivity (TIP, 1984b).     In turn, without the active

           participation of trading companies and firms from or joint ventures with

           NICs, acquisition of that know-how would not have been easy.     Therefore,

           the policies that have encouraged the participation of companies from NICs

           in Bangladesh's garment exports must also be given credit.



                             III.    FREE TRADE STATUS FOR ALL EXPORTERS



           3.1       Free trade status for exports should include three elements.

           First, firms should be able to import required inputs with no

           restrictions.   Second, they should have automatic access to the foreign

           exchange to pay for their imports.     Third, they should be exempt from

           duties and other indirect taxes on inputs.     These incentives should be

           available to both direct exporters and to the local firms that supply them

           with inputs or outputs (indirect exporters).     These three elements are

           discussed in greater detail below.



           Restriction-Free Imports of Inputs for Export Production



                     Positive List System



           3.2       The 1985-86 Import Policy for Export Production contains a

           "negative list" system of banned or restricted imports, some of

           which--"positive list"--can however be imported by designated export

           industries, as shown in Table 2.     Even though it does not appear that

           current practice restricts access to imported inputs by most export

           industries, a shift from a case-by-case or product-by-product approach to

           an automatic mechanism by which no import restriction is applied to inputs

           used for direct and indirect exports is desirable.



                        Recommendation



           3.3          The first recommendation, which amounts to a general policy

           statement, is to permit all materials needed for export production, direct

           and indirect should be imported without restriction, as long as the imports

           are actually used for export production.       Second, concerned ministries

           should develop efficient administrative arrangements that enable all

           exporters to import currently banned or restricted items automatically,

           i.e., without having to be on a preannounced "positive list."       The key

           tasks under the administrative arrangements would be verification that

           imported inputs are to be or were actually used for export production, to

           be accomplished with minimum red tape and delays.      Verification would be

           based on:     (a) an export order," (b) an import LIe, (c) input-output

           coefficients, and (d) evidence of completion of exports.

           3.4          The entitlement rates of the XPB system, which, as noted, is

           designed to compensate for the overvaluation of the official exchange rate

           for export value added, are based on the assumption that all imported

              inputs are purchased at the official rate (see below).       As shown in Table

              3, however, access to the Government's foreign exchange holdings at the

              official exchange rate (the so-called official "cash" market, as opposed to

              the secondary "WES" market) is not automatic, even in the case of imported

              inputs used strictly for export production.       To the extent that exporters

              are relying on the WES market for access to foreign exchange, while their

              export earnings are being converted into the local currency at the official

              exchange rate and the XPB entitlement rates are roughly proportional to

              their export value added, strictly speaking a free trade status is not in

              existence.    The reason is that export manufacturers are paying more than

              the true world market prices for their inputs (see below for more detail).



                           Positive List System



              3.5          A careful review of Table 3 leads to the conclusion that

              Bangladesh is    u~ing   a positive list system with very stringent and

              arbitrary rationing criteria, even for export industries, with respect to

              access to the Government's foreign exchange holdings at the official

              exchange rate.     First, only seven export sectors are included in the

              positive list.     Second, there is no assurance that the allocation of

              foreign exchange, based on the announced rationing criteria, is consistent

              with the actual needs of exporters.       Of the "annual entitlement" or

              "sanctioned capacity" (defined as the total capacity of an exporter based

              on a single shift operating 300 days a year) 25% or 12.5% is to be

              rationed, depending on proof of export of 80i. or more of the exporter's

              product during the previous year.       However, it is entirely possible that

           the import requirements for export orders in a given year could be several

           times higher or lower than the rationed foreign exchange.



                      Import Substitution Industry'S Access to Official Exchange Rate



           3.6        According to Public Notice No. 11 (1984/85), many import-

           substitution industries also have access to the Government's foreign

           exchange holdings at the official exchange rate.   Even though the relative

           share of the WES exchange market in total import payments has increased

           steadily over the years, while the relative share of the Government's

           foreign exchange holdings has declined steadily, as shown in Annex 1, the

           latter was still higher than the former in 1983/84.   However, the more

           important issue is the failure to assure automatic access to the

           Government's foreign exchange holdings at the official exchange rate for

           importing inputs needed for export production, at the same time that

           import-substitution industries subjecr to heavy protection do have access.

           It appears that the major part of the Government's foreign exchange

           holdings has been allocated to import-substitution or non-tradable

           industries rather than to exporting firms.   For example, more than half of

           the imports of "textile yarn, fabrics, made-up articles and related

           products" during 1983/84 was paid for with foreign exchange from the

           Government's holdings at the official exchange rate, as shown in Annex 2.

           However, the implication is that all or most of these imports were for

           import-substitution, given that the export-oriented garment industries were

           relying un BUM L/Cs (Le., suppliers' credit).

                       Recommendation



           3.7         The Government should guarantee automatic access to the

           Government's foreign exchange holdings at the official exchange rate for

           the purchase of all imported inputs needed for export production, direct

           and indirect, without any positive list or rationing constraints.     It

           should, by contrast, have let all import-substitution industries rely on

           the WES exchange market for their import needs.     This system should prevail

           until a uniform exchange rate system is achieved.



           Duty- (and Indirect Tax-) Free Imports of Inputs for Export Production



           3.8        There are currently five schemes that exempt imports for export

           production from duties: 1/   (a) Notional Payment, (b) Drawback at Actual,

           (c) Drawback at Flat Rate, (d) Special Bonded Warehouse, and (e) Private

           Bonded Warehouse (a sixth program, access to duty-free imports through free

           trade zones, is discussed in a separate paper).



                      Notional Payment (NP)



           3.9         This system (sometimes called temporary exemption or prior

           exemption) exempts exporters outside the free trade zones or bonded



           l/ 	 In  Bangladesh, tariffs and sales taxes are levied on imports. Since,
                 unlike in other countries, the sales taxes are not levied for locally
                 rroduced commodities, the sales tax in Bangladesh amounts to an import
                 duty. Therefore. hereafter "duties" in Bangladesh should be taken to
                 include "sales taxes" as well as tariffs. Bangladesh's indirect tax is
                 an excise tax.

                warehouse system from paying duties and indirect taxes on imports to be

                used in export production.          The exemption is granted case-by-case at the

                time of importation.       This system is the most widely used in most

                developing countries, including the most successful ones.          However, since

                its introduction in April 1983 under the Notional Payment of Drawback of

                Customs Duty and Sales Tax Rules, 1983 (NBR Notification [Customs and Sales

                Tax], Dhaka, April 19, 1983:          No. S.R.O. 136.L/83/774/Cus), Bangladesh has

                never   u~ed    the NP system for exporters (as shown in Table 4).



                               Drawback at Actual



                3.10           This individual drawback system refunds the duties and indirect

                taxes paid by exporters on imported inputs on a case-by-case basis.          As

                shown in Table 4, during 1982/83-1984/85, duty refunds were granted in only

                18 cases.       This system was introduced in August 1970 under the Drawback for

                Manufactured Exports Rules, 1970 (Government of Pakistan, Central Board of

                Revenue, Customs, Islamabad, August 19, 1970:          S.R.O. 200[1]/70).

              product groups have been included in the fixed drawback schedules, as shown

              in Table 4.         Table 5 shows that in Bangladesh the drawback utilization rate

              (i.e •• exports that rely on the drawback system for duty refunds as a

              fraction of total manufactured exports) was only 2%.



                               Special Bonded Warehouse (SBW)



              3.12            This special private bonded warehouse manufacturing system is

              available to Bangladesh's 100% garment and specialized textile exporting

              firms.         Under this system. custom officers do not remain in a factory to

              inspect the inflow of inputs to and outflow of outputs from the factory.

              Instead. the system is administered using import and export passbooks,

              input-output coefficients, and stock accounting book.         These procedures

              make 	 it one of the most innovative duty exemption systems that rely on the

              stock accounting book method (the drawback is that it applies only to 100%

              garment exporters).         Bangladesh.'s bonded warehouse systems are administered

              by separate standing orders (S.O.) issued by the individual collectors of

              customs in the districts (even though ultimate authority rests with the

              National Board of Revenue under Section 13 of the Customs Act of 1969).2/


              2/ 	 There are two types of bonded warehouses in Bangladesh: (i) public
                   warehousing stations maintained and operated by the Customs Department.
                   which any private importer can use to store goods for up to two years
                   pending removal; and (ii) private bonded warehouses under license.
                   There are four categories of the private bonded warehouses:

                     (a) 	 Private bonded warehouses for keeping dutiable imported materials
                           for subsequent clearance on payment of duties and taxes;
                     (b) 	 SSW, allowed for 100% garment exporters;
                     (c) 	 PBW. allowed for 100% exporting firms other than garments;
                     (d) 	 Private bonded warehouses for holding raw materials imported for
                           the manufacture of goods to he sold against international tender
                           and against foreign exchange without payment of duty and taxes.

           In the case of the Dhaka Collector of Customs, the SBW is administered in

           accordance with S.O. No. 1/Cus/84, dated October 28, 1984 (Procedure of

           Working of Special/Private Customs Bonded Warehouse Manufacturing Garments

           with Bonded Raw Materials for Exporting thereafter).         As shown in Table 5,

           as of September 1985, 387 SBW were licensed in the area of jurisdiction of

           the Dhaka Collector.         As pointed out in our review of the policy factors

           contributing to the success of garment exports, the guarantee of free trade

           status through the SBW system has been the most important factor in the

           impressive growth of garment exports.         Of all the methods being used in

           Bangladesh, the SBW system has been the most effective duty-free import

           administration instrument.

           3.12           This typical bonded warehouse manufacturing system has the usual

           requirements fot licensing :



                  (a) 	 A firm's factory must be engaged exclusively in manufacturing

                          for export;



                  (b) 	 A firm's factory must have separate warehouses approved by

                          customs after inspection as appropriate for the storage of

                          imported inputs and finished commodities; and



                  (c) 	   customs officers must be present to inspect the inflow of

            3.12         In Bangladesh, PBWs are licensed for 10070 export manufacturers

            other than     garme~t    and specialized textile exporters.      As shown in Table 4,

            as of September 1985, 51 PBWs were licensed in the Dhaka area.             Because of

            the above rigid requirements, however, the PBW system can hardly serve as a

            major instrument for duty-free import, even though it bypasses most of the

            procedural requirements imposed under the other four systems.             In our

            review of Bangladesh's duty-free import administration below, we therefore

            focus on the NP, Drawback at Actual, Drawback at Flat Rate and SBW systems.



            Basic Framework of Duty-Free Import Administration



            3.13         The section looks at how the exemptions and refunds are

            computed.      First, the value of the duty to be exempted or refunded for one

            unit of an export commodity equals the sum of the input-output coefficients

            times the import prices of inputs times the duty rates:




            Value of duties
            and indirect
            taxes (to be                      Imported             Import price
            exempted or
            refunded) per
            uni t of export

                                         input i-output j
                                            coefficient
                                                                    of input i       Duty rate i     (1)




          where



           [Import price

          Note that in Equation (1) the most critical information in administeriqg duty-free imports
          is imported input i-output j coefficient, i.e., the physical quantity (or weight) of the
          imported input item i needed to produce one unit of export commodity j.

           3.14       Based on equation (1), two further equations can be derived:




            Value of duties
            (to be exempted                                        Approved (or

            quantity of
            commodity j


          and


            Allowed duty-
            free import of
            input i required                     Imported             Import          Approved
            to produce              =        input i-output j        price of         export          (3)

            quantity of
            commodity j



          Based on equations (1)-(3). the basic procedures for the NP, Drawback at Actual, Drawback
          at Flat Rate. and SEW systems can be, summarized as below.



                               NP



           3.15       Equations (1)-(3) are applied to calculate the duty exemption at 


           the time of import case-by-case only for commodity j             if it is included on 


           the positive list.           As of September 1984, only eight items were included on 


           the positive 1ist. 3 /        The approved export quantity in equations (2) and 


           (3) is the confirmed irrevocable export L/C.             In Bangladesh, the process of

              system starts only after the exporter makes an application following

               receipt of an export order.             The exporter must complete the export within

              one year.       The expected long wait for approval of input coefficients (in

              light of the experience with the drawback systems, as indicated below)

              appear to be the major cause for exporters' failing to apply under this

              scheme.



                            Drawback at Actual



              3.16          Equations (1)-(3) are applied to calculate duty refunds after the

              export on a case-by-case basis only when commodity j is not included on the

              negative list (the negative list consists of the products included in the

              Drawback at Flat Rate             schedul~s).    The completed export quantity in

              equations (2) and (3) must be proven with documentation.                Again, in

              Bangladesh, the process of estimating and approving the imported input­

              output coefficient for this system stgrts only after the exporter makes an

              application.        Sakhawatullah (1984) reports cases in which, even after two

              year input coefficients acceptable to both exporters and NBR could not be

              arrived at.       This delay was the major reason why refunds were granted in

              only 18 cases during 1982/83-1984/85.



                            Drawback at Flat Rate



              3.17          The fixed drawback schedules announced by the Government are

              estim8ted based on equation (1).                An effective fixed drawback system in

              general provides for:             (a) frequent updating of the fixed drawback

              schedules, based on changes in c.i.f. import prices, exchange rates and
                                         - 27 ­



duty rates, as well as changes in imported input-output coefficients; and

(b) reasonable coverage of products included in the fixed drawback

schedules, which are preannounced before exporters apply.          In Bangladesh,

frequent updating has so far not been achieved and the preparation of the

fixed drawback schedules for included products has been started only after

the exporters have made their applications.          Again, Sakhawatullah (1984)

reports cases in which the refunds have been much less than the actual

duties paid and the waiting periods have run three to five years.

Moreover, only 13 product groups are included on the schedule, as shown in

Table 4.    For those products, although the application of equation (2) is

supposed to be mechanical once the export completion documents are

available, the processing of applications appears to take some time.

3.18       . Even though duty-free·   impor~   is allowed based on equation (3) in

an accounting sense, that equation is not applied case-by-case at the time

of import, unlike the situation under the NP system.          Further, unlike the

NP system, the pretabulated imported input-output coefficients are formally

announced, so that exporters simply apply them mechanically for their stock

accounting.    At the time of import, Customs enters the duty-free imports in

the pass book not on the basis of equation (3), but on the basis of the

maximum import stock balance allowed (i.e., the allowed value of BUM LIC,

which is 75% of the export L/C).       Customs also records the export value in

the pass hook.     To facilitate the frequent inspections by Customs, the

exporter updates the stock book based on imports, exports and equation

            (3).     This scheme allows the excess inventory of imported inputs, which is

            total actual imports less the sum of duty-free imports entitled based on

           equation (3).        However, the real advantage of the scheme is that the

           procedures allow imports to be processed quickly based on the import L/Cs.

           The checking that is based on the input coefficients, which is

            time-consuming, is handled internally by the company and inspected by

           customs officers later.        The only shortcoming of the SBW system is that

           currently it applies only to 100% final stage garment and specialized

           3.19            Among the schemes reviewed above, the SBW system, as noted, has

           been the most successful.       The reason is that it permits speedy

           administration of the import procedures and offers an absolute guarantee of
                       .
           free trade status.
                                .   These conditions have been attained for two reasons.

           First, as the input output coefficients are preannounced exporters can

           simply apply for their accounting of duty-free imports, as shown in Annex

           3.      Second, import processing is based on the maximum import   Llc   allowed,

           whereas the duty-free entitlement and duty-owed imports are computed later

           in the stock accounting book based on input coefficients.        This system have

           been applied to almost 400 SBWs in the Dhaka area only.        The success of the

           SBW system should be the most important factor in rationalizing

           Bangladesh's duty-free import administration.

              Major Issues in Rationalizing Duty-Free Import Administration



              3.20      The following are the major issues to be resolved in

              rationalizing duty-free 'import administration:     the present ad hoc (or

              passive) approach to administration; the product-specific approach; the

              100% export and BUM L/e requirements; the lack of free trade status; the

              exclusion of indirect exporters; and the exemption vs. drawback.



                        Ad Hoc (or Passive) Approach



              3.21       Input-output coefficient information is handled on an ad hoc or

              passive basis only after the exporters have applied for their duty

              exemption/drawbacks.      This lack of systematic framework has been the major

              reason that duty exemption/drawbacks based on the NP or Drawback at Actual

              system are not processed speedily and that new products are added to the

              Drawback'at Flat Rate system only slowly.



              3.22      Since speed is the name of the game when competing in the world

              market, the most important requirement of an export incentive administra­

              tion system is rapid processing of applications.     A systematic approach

              that estimates and publishes input-output coefficient information in

              advance of applications, so that exporters and customs can use them

              uniformly in their applications for duty exemptions or drawbacks, would not

              only result in speedy processing of applications but also save a lot of the

              administrative costs of exporters and the Government.

                       Product-Specific Approach



             3.23      The positive list system for the NP, Drawback at Flat Rate and

             SBW systems, and the negative list for the Drawback at Actual system, are

             quite inconsistent with the basic principle of export incentives:         all

             firms, manufacturing industries and activities that generate export value

             added should have the same access to export incentives automatically.           In

             fact, all products should have access to all the instruments relating to

            duty-free imports.     In some exceptional cases, it will be desirable to have

            a negative rather than a positive list.          In no case, however, should

             negative list be used with the Drawback at Actual system (only those

             products not included on the Drawback at Flat Rate schedules are allowed).

            The reason is that the real purpose of offering two parallel schemes is to

             let exporters choose between the advantage of the administrative cost

            savings associated with the fixed drawback system and the advantage of

            getting full refunds based on the indrvidual drawback.



                       100% Export and BUM   Lie   Requirements



             3.24      It is desirable, under the PBW system, that a company export 100%

            of the products.     In the case of the SBW system, however, that requirement

            needs to be replaced by one calling for 100% export of those products

            manufactur~d   with inputs imported on duty-free.       The rationale is that the

             system is safeguarded on the basis of the accounting framework, with spot

             investigation by customs officers, rather than by checks. on entry of

             imports into a SBW and checks on exit of exports to external markets.

           Further, the condition that imports must be based on BUM LIC should not

           apply to SBWs, as reliance on the BUM LIC is a separate issue relating to

           export financing.



                      Less Than Free Trade Status



           3.25       It can be inferred from Table 5 (which shows only a 3% drawback

           utilization rate) that the trade status of imported inputs for Bangladesh's

           manufactured export industries has been less than free (except for garment

           exports through SBWs).     The reason is inefficient administration of

           duty-free imports.    In turn, the Drawback at Flat Rate system fails to

           refund the full amount of duties paid by exporters.       Here the reason is

           that c.i.f. import prices and the exchange rate are not updated, even one

           assumes that input-output coefficients are reasonably correct.

           Furthermore, the failure to publish the detailed data underlying the fixed

           drawback'schedules makes it    impossibl~   for exporters to identify the

           specific elements that lead to their less than free trade status.



                      Exclusion of Indirect Exporters



           3.26       The inefficiency of the current administration of duty-free

           import schemes practically prevents indirect exporters from having access

           to duty-free imports (see below).

                      Exemption vs. Drawback



           3.27       Duty exemption systems are preferable to duty drawback systems,

           as the latter entails additional interest costs for exporters,~! while the

           former are, in general, less risky in terms of potential controversy over

           subsidy charges and the threat of countervailing duties.   In Bangladesh,

           however, other than the SB\>l system only the Drawback at Flat Rate system is

           being widely used.   In reforming the duty-free import system,'high priority

           should be given to exemption measures.



           Recommendations



                     New 	 SBW!NP System



           3.28       the well-administered duty exemption system used in some

           successful deveioping countries' are not that different from the current SBW

           system.   Therefore, it is recommended that the Government make a combined

           SBW!NP system the cornerstone of its duty-free import administration for

           all industries and firms that generate export value added directly or

           indirectly.   The two systems should be merged by redesigning the NP system

           and expanding the SBW system.   The key instruments in the new system would

           be the passbook, the stock accounting book and the input coefficients, as

           in the case of the present SBW system.   The current requirement that a firm



           4/ 	 The Duty Drawback Credit System has been implemented to reduce the
                arlditional interest costs. However, the financing under this system is
                ~~ranted only after the drawback amount is fixed and notification (SRO)
                is issued.

              export 100% of its output should, however, be replaced by a rule according

              to which only products manufactured with duty-free imported materials

              should be exported 100%.      To safeguard the system from potential abuse by

              unreliable exporters, different forms of guarantees (such as promissory

              notes and bank guarantees) related to the types of exporters could be

              introduced.



                            Improving the Drawback Systems



              3.29          In the medium and long term, the new SBW/NP system should become

              the main instrument for all direct and indirect exporters.       Until that

              system becomes efficient, however, an improved Drawback at Flat Rate system

              must be used in parallel.      To improve the fixed drawback system, it is

              necessary that import prices, exchange rates and input coefficients be

              updated at least twice a year and published in complete detail.       In

              addition~ the product coverage bf the "fixed drawback system must be

              increased.



              3.30          In turn, the reformed Drawback at Actual system must be available

              as an alternative to the SBW/NP system or the improved Drawback at Flat

              Rate system.      Those exporters (direct and indirect) who did not plan to

              export when they imported their inputs but who later used them in export

              production without, however, being able to use the SBW/NP system must be

              able to ohtain full refunds of duties based on the reformed individual

              drawb~ck     system for all products.   Identical pretabulated input-output

              coefficients should he used for both the exemption and the drawback

              .s;ystems.

            3.31           The administrative cost saving of a fixed drawback system is

            mainly the result of not having to trace the import-export linkages

            case-by-case.       Additional savings are also possible by aggregating the

            products and inputs in the fixed drawback schedule.          However, there may be

            two potential dangers--exporters may end up with less than free trade

            status, and countervailing actions may be incurred unless the aggregation

            is done very carefully.



                           Tariff Reform



            3.32           If duties and indirect taxes are negligible, the duty

            exemption/drawback administration is either simple or unnecessary.          If all

            redundant duties are eliminated as a first step toward lowering,

            simplifying or removing all duties, the administrative burden of the

            duty-free import system would be reduced substantially.          Therefore, the

            Government shouid review its duty schedules first to eliminate redundant

            duties and second to lower/simplify most duties.



                           Non-Advisability of a Uniform Rebate Scheme



            3.33           It is not advisable to consider an aggregate uniform duty rebate

            scheme, as some experts have proposed (Hutcheson and HcKay, 1985; and Rab,

            1985).    It would be a giant step backward for the following reasons:



                   (a) 	 Success of the SBW System.      A uniform rebate scheme ignores the

                    innovative and efficiently implemented duty exemption systems in

                    handling the input-output coefficients for products exported

                    through it, and of recording imports of inputs for export

               (b) 	 Giving up Free Trade Status.      Note from Table 5 that the duty

                    drawback as a percentage of export ranged from 0.3 to 19.4 in

                    1984/85.   On the other hand, the duty exemption as a percentage

                    of export in the SBW was 78 in 1984/85, as shown in Table 6.

                    Assume that the variance in the duty drawback rates in Table 5

                    for all industries whose duty drawback/exemption rates ranged

                     see a proposal advocating a uniform duty rebate rate scheme in

                     light of today's increasingly hostile external environment, which

                     in 1985 led to the garment quotas.        The uniform rebate proposal

                    does not take into account the numerous trade disputes between

                     the   us   and many developing countries relating to alleged export

                     subsidies based on aggregate duty rebate rates.         Recently, such

                     countries as Thailand' and Indonesia and most of Latin America

                     agreed with the US to switch from aggregate rebate rates to

                     highly disaggregated rebate/exemption systems in order to avoid

                     the countervailing duties.       They did so 'even where their previous

                    The major element in the controversy has been the failure to meet

                     the "physical incorporation" test ,~./ which can be satisfied only

                    by a duty drawback/exemption system based on disaggregated

                    physical input-output coefficients.        In the case of Thailand, the

                    average duty drawback rate was less than 2.5% in 1983, whereas

                     the rates consistent with free trade status must range from

                    10-20%.   The US, however, charged that the Government was

                    granting export subsidies, arguing that the method of estimating

                    the rebate rate was based on an aggregate input-output table that

                    did not meet the physical incorporation test of US law.

                    Therefore, the uniform rebate scheme proposed for Bangladesh

                    would invite countervailing actions from developed countries,

                    even while many exporters would hardly receive full refunds of

                    the duties paid.



               (d)' 	 Distorting Pattern of· Specialization.    The pattern of domestic

                    specialization for the external market under the proposed uniform

                    rebate scheme is likely to be identical to that under the no

                    rebate scheme.     Domestic specialization for export markets will

                    be determined by the current structure of import duties rather

                    than by the comparative advantages of the country.        Exports based

                    on the true comparative advantages of the country can be expected

                    only with free trade status for export industries.        Likewise, the

                        pattern of development in domestic input-supplying industries

                        under the proposed uniform rebate scheme would be dictated by the

                        duty structure rather than by comparative advantage.   The

                        analytic base of the argument that the proposed uniform rebate

                        rate scheme would promote backward linkages is therefore

                        extremely weak.   Here again, the only way to promote efficient

                        backward linkages based on true comparative advantage is to

                        assure the free trade status (and other export incentives) for

                    IV.   AUTOMATIC ACCESS TO EXPORT FINANCING FOR ALL EXPORTERS



           4.1        The cornerstones of an export incentive system that puts

          exporters and foreign competitors on an equal footing are automatic access

           to restriction- and duty-free imported inputs (discussed in Chapter II),

          and automatic access to export financing for all industries and firms that

          generate export value added (i.e., both direct and indirect exporters).

          The underlying rationale at present for providing export financing in

          developing countries is the market failure of the financial sector such

           that actual and potential exporters are denied access to working capital.

          Without that capital, even confirmed export orders cannot be filled.



          4.2         As such, resolving the access issues must be the primary goal of
          an export financing system.     It should not be the provision of preferential

           interest rates, as is sometimes argued.       In both Singapore and Korea, which

          have export financing systems that assure speedy and automatic access to

           funds for all exporters, the interest rates virtually identical to prime

           rates.   Here, then, the focus is assuring speedy and automatic access.



          4.3         Export financing of preshipment and postshipment working capital

          (local currency loan) is available at 9% annually for non-traditional

          products (7% for incremental exports and 12% annually for traditional

          exports) up to 90% of the export LIC (or export order)--but only for direct

          exporters (BCD of Bangladesh Bank Circular No.5, July 21, 1983, and BCD

          Circul;H No. 42, October 15,1984).      Table 7 shows the export loan

           (Business Research Associates, 1984).      During 1982-83, just over half the

           non-jute export volume was covered by export loans on average.      While

           leather-related exports were covered almost 100%, only just over 20% of the

           other non-jute exports (other than tea and the fish group) were covered.



           4.4       It appears that there have been very wide variations in the

           export financing coverage across sectors and firms.      (Because current and

           comparable export loan outstanding data are not available, it is not

           possible to determine the degree of variation in export loan periods across

           sectors and firms).   These wide variations in coverage may reflect a

           failure by some sectors and firms to achieve equal access to the loans.



           4.5       To ensure equal and easy access to working capital export

           financing (mostly preshipment) for all firms generating exports directly or

           indirectly, further improvements are needed:      (a) better access by small

           and infant exporters; (b)   bette~   access by indirect exporters; (c) import

           financing for exporters; (d) administrative arrangements; and

           (e) refinancing mechanisms.

                           Reports are often received that the non-traditional export sector
                           does not get adequate export credit facility. Banks are, there­
                           fore, advised to take neceS'3ary steps to adequately meet the
                           credit needs of the exporters particularly those dealing in non­
                           traditional items.


             Subsequently, in September 1984, the Bangladesh Bank reaffirmed:

                          Banks should not decline any request for export credit when such
                          applications are received for the first time. Banks would be
                          free to make advances on the basis of their own judgement on the
                          merit of the proposal without any collaterals/security/Export
                          Credit Guarantee Scheme (ECGS) coverage. If, however, such
                          security is at all necessary, banks should invariably utilize the
                          coverage available under ECGS, but under no circumstances export
                          credit to first time applicants should be refused. (BCD Circular
                          No. 35, September 4, 1984)


             A study conducted by the Business Research Associates concluded:

                          The limited availability and scope of export credit •••• and the
                          tendency by banks to support only few favored longstanding
                          clients are usually considered serious bottlenecks to the
                          development and operation of an effective export financing
                          system. (Business Research Associates, 1984, p. 7)

             4.7           Based on the above statements, it appears that automatic

             availability of and equal access to the export financing of the Government

             have not been achieved, especially by small and infant exporters.



                          The Issue of Collateral



             4.R           Strict demand for physical collateral by the commercial banks

             handling the export financing system appears to be one of the most

             important reasons that automatic and equal access is particularly

             infrequent for small or infant exporters, who do not have track records.

             Banks demand physical collateral to cover the risk of default or of failure

           to comply with the contracts.      For those small or infant exporters who

           cannot meet the collateral requirements, the Government has provided two

           alternatives:      a preshipment export finance guarantee, and quasi-collateral

           using the materials being financed by the export loan.



                       ECG.



           4.9         The Government issues a preshipment finance guarantee to banks

           handling export loans as a substitute for physical collateral.         The

          comprehensive guarantee amounts to export credit insurance issued to the

          exporters to cover the risk of non-payment by foreign buyers.       The Export

          Credit Guarantee Wing of the Sadharan Bima Corporation has been

          administering the ECGS since January 1978.       (See Annex 4 for the

          operational details of the ECGS.)



          4.10        . Tab1e'8 shows the ECGS coverage during 1978-84.   In the recent

          years, about 80% of the total ECGS coverage has been for finance

          guarantees.      Nevertheless, in 1984 the total coverage was only about 4% of

           total exports, although even that level is a substantially increase over

           the initial 0.5%.     Further, the activities of the Export Credit Guarantee

          wing of Sadharan Bima Corporation are less than 1% of its total activities,

          a level that suggests an extremely low degree of commitment to the system,

          even though the ECGS is a very important export incentive.       In turn,

          according to Business Research Associates (1984, no commercial bank accepts

          ECGS   ~s   complete and strong collateral for a preshipment export loan, in

          most cases, it is used only as additional collateral.       Finally, those

holding ECGS complain that it is by and large very difficult for them to

get claims settled.



            Quasi-Collateral

4.11         According to a Bangladesh Bank Circular (BCD Circular No. S,

March 13, 1981), there are three types of quasi-collateral (other than the

ECGS) that commercial banks can accept:



       (a) 	 Back-to-Back Inland LIC, (BIN L/C) which is issued by the final

            exporter's bank based on the export LIC (E L/C) to the indirect

            exporter (supplier of the finished export commodities) on behalf

            of the final exporter;



       (b) 	 Pledge of the export commodities; and



       (c)' 	 Hypotnecation of the export "commodities.



4.12        According to the above circular, quasi-collateral appears to be

available only to trading companies that purchase finished export

commodities from indirect exporters.      It does not apply to producers with

material inputs financed by an export loan.       In practice, there appear to

be only a few trading companies.     However, it also appears that commercial

banks consider material inputs purchased by manufacturers of exports as

quasi-collateral in the case of selected customers.       Clearly what is

lacking is an automatic mechanisms (spelled out in a central bank circular)

that allows quasi-physical collateral to be created for inputs as well as

outputs financed by an export loan (see below).

                      Major Issues



          4.13        To exploit the country's export potential fully, small and infant

          exporters must have equal access to the preshipment working capital export

          loans.    The Government could create substitutes for collateral through the

          preshipment finance guarantee scheme and quasi-collateral through the

          well-designed export financing mechanisms.



          4.14        The current ECGS appears to be insufficient to meet the risk-

          pooling needs of small and infant exporters because of its institutional

          weakness.    On the other hand, the current export financing system needs to

          be streamlined and modernized in order to create quasi-collateral and meet

          other export financing needs (see paragraphs 4.28-4.33).    The risk aversion

          of commercial banks handling the export loan could be reduced by (a) a more

          innovative spread structure that rewards some risk-taking and (b) well­

          coordinated technical assistance designed to reduce the risks to small and

          infant exporters.



                      Recommendations



          4.15        Four specific steps could assure automatic and equal access to

          export loans for small and infant exporters.



                 (a) 	 To improve the preshipment finance guarantee system, it is

                      recommended that the Government carefully evaluate two options:

                      (i) creation of an independent Export Credit and Guarantee

                       Corporation (Gupta, 1983); and (ii) expansion and improvment of

                       the ECGS under the existing institutional arrangement.



                  (b) 	 To institute the automatic mechanisms for the creation of

                       quasi-physical collateral for export manufacturing firms (direct

                       and indirect) and trading companies, it is recommended that

                       administrative arrangements for the export loan be streamlined

                       and modernized (see paragraph 4.32).



                  (c) 	 To encourage the commercial banks handling export loans to take a

                       development-oriented rather than a security-oriented approach, it

                       is recommended that the Government consider a more imaginative

                       spread structure (that, for example, favors loans to small or

                       infant exporters).



                  (d)' 	 To reduce the risks of smal} and infant exporters, it is

                       recommended that the Government develop a comprehensive program

                       of managerial, technical and marketing assistance for them. 9 /



           Preshipment Working Capital Financing for Indirect Exporters



           4.16        Despite the Government's objective of promoting backward linkages

           from exports of non-traditional exports (see paragraph 6.01), the current


           9/ 	 This program should include indirect assistance through trading
                companies, exporters associations, multinational companies, and large­
                scale final stage export manufacturers. as well as direct assistance by
                the Government. In the latter category. the program being developed by
                the ITC would be important (lTC, 1985).

           circular~    of the Bangladesh Bank regarding export loans fail to include

           indirect exporters as eligible recipients of Government-supported export

           financing.       This omission is surprising.    The main objective of the

           domestic   Lie    system in the developing. country that originated the system

           and used it more extensively than any other developing countries was to

           assure equal (direct) access to export financing for indirect exporters.

           This scheme is similar to the BIN      Lie   in Bangladesh, which has not,

           however, been used for the same objective (see paragraph 6.06).



                        Major Issues



           4.17         Export financing for indirect exporters should be the backbone of

           the export incentives for indirect exporters.        Without automatic access to

           export financing, even confirmed orders cannot be met, a situation that

           renders all other export incentives for indirect exporters irrelevant.



           4.18          The burden of administering export financing and other incent­

           ives for indirect exporters need not be great.         If there is a well-designed

           administration for export financing that includes indirect exporters, it

           could also be used for the other export incentives for indirect exporters,

           as their requirements are similar.       Therefore, modernizing the overall

           export financing system (see paragraph 4.32) is the first step in

           instituting an incentive system for indirect exporters.

                                              - 54 ­



                     Recommendations



           4.19      It is recommended that the Bangladesh Bank form a task force on

           the modernization of the export financing system and take the lead in

           designing administrative arrangements for incentives for indirect

           exporters (see paragraph 4.32 and 6.08).



           Working Capital Financing for the Purchase of Imported Inputs



           4.20      Financing available under a preshipment working capital export

           financing system in a developing country is used for three purposes:

           (i) the purchase of imported inputs; (ii) the purchase of domestic inputs;

           and (iii) the payment of value added.   In a country with foreign exchange

           controls, the financing needed to purchase imported inputs for export

           production is usually met either by foreign currency loans earmarked for

           exporters or by foreign suppliers' credits.   However, in Bangladesh export

           loans are strictly local currency, designed to finance domestic payments.

           It is unclear what percentage of the export loan disbursements used to

           finance imported inputs for export production have actually come through

           the Government's foreign exchange holdings at the official exchange rate,

           or through the WES market at the market exchange rate.   One thing is clear,

           however, major export industries such as garments have been relying

           strictly on suppliers' credits, without any support from the Government's

           export financing system •

           4.21         According to the so-called Back-to-Back (Usance Import)        Lie (BUM
           L/c) system, commercial banks can establish BUM Llc on a back-to-back basis
           with an E Llc without prior permission from the Bangladesh Bank, if the

           purchase is for imported inputs to be used by 100% direct export

           manufacturers with SBWs in the ready-made garment, specialized textile,

           household linen and hosiery product sectors (Circular Letter No. ECP, COM.

           24l/A-3050, December 5, 1982).     This system has been extended to indirect

           exporters supplying fabrics to 100% garment export manufacturers with SBWs

           if the final exporters open BIN LIC in favor of the former (Circular Letter
                                               .        .
           No. 	 ECP. COM. 241/A-583, ,April 22, 1984).



           4.22         This system can hardly be called an export incentive or export

           financing scheme as i t is normally unde'rstood in most developing

           countries.     It forces the exporters in designated sectors and firms to rely

           on suppliers' credits for the import financing needs of their export

           production.~1     The automatic access garment exporters once had to export

           financing through BUM LICs was, however, disrupted by the US quota shock,

           in certain markets for reasons indicated below.



           4.23         The end result of this system is that if a garment exporter has

           difficulty obtaining suppliers' credits for the import of fabrics and other

           inputs in export production, whatever the reason, he cannot meet his export

           orders.   In that case, an opportunity to earn net foreign exchange is

           lost--because of the unavailability of      Government-~upported   import



           101 	 In practice, BUM LICs are compulsory, as the precondition for using the
                 SBWs for duty-free imports is importation based on BUM L/Cs.

            financing for export production and the BUM Llc condition that bases access

            to duty-free imports on the SBW system.



            4.24       In light of the foreign exchange constraints, the use of BUM LICs

            should be encouraged for imports of materials to be used in the production

            of export goods or import-substitution commodities, as long as commercial

            banks are willing to open them and foreign suppliers are willing to grant

            credits.   Even where this situation pertains, however, there is still a

            stringent condition that not only appears to be an important "disincentive"

            for exporters, but that has also led to the considerable controversies that

            followed the US quota restrictions:


                       the authorized dealer opening LIC as per Bangladesh Bank
                       permission shall effect remittance against an import bill after
                       realization of export proceeds under the special arrangement of
                       back-to-back L/C." (Circular Letter No. ECP. COM. 241/A-1343,
                       June 16, 1982)


            There have been many instances in which overseas suppliers of fabrics could

            not receive payment after the usance import LIC periods were expired, as

            the commercial banks in Bangladesh failed to honor the BUM LICs because the

            corresponding garments were not exported on time.   This situation has

            endangered the credibility of the commercial banks in Bangladesh in dealing

            with LIC facilities, even though the LICs are the cornerstone of a

            country's capacity to handle international trade.



            4.25       Faced with a growing controversy, a Bangladesh Bank Circular

            issued in October 1985 (Circular Letter No. ECP. COM. 241/A - 845,

            October 5, 1985) stated:

                                               - 57 ­



                      Of late, some complaints are being received from overseas banks
                      and from foreign suppliers of fabrics and other raw materials and
                      accessories that some authorized dealers are making delay in
                      meeting their obligations under confirmed, irrevocable import
                      letter of credit opened by them back-to-back against export
                      letter of credit favoring their ready-made garment manufacturer­
                      exporter clients for various reasons. Authorized dealers are
                      advised that they should settle expeditiously all cases of over­
                      due payments to beneficiaries of their back-to-back letters of
                      credit. Where found necessary, they may approach Bangladesh Bank
                      for allowing remittance under WES furnishing the undertakings and
                      certificates to Bangladesh Bank as per prescribed instructions in
                      the matter.


          It appears unclear, however, how the conflict between the two circulars

          regarding overdue payments to   for~ign   suppliers under BUM LICs should be

          resolved.



                      Major Issues



          4.26        One of the most serious deficiencies in Bangladesh's export

          financing system is the exclusion of financing for imports for export

          production from the preshipment working capital export loan program.

          Reliance on BUM LICs in place of Government-supported import financing

          should be left to the discretion of individual exporters.      Moreover, given

          the seriousness of the foreign exchange shortage, the highest priority in

          allocating foreign exchange should be working capital for use in net

          foreign exchange-earning activities.      Any attempt to limit the foreign

          exchange use for activities that yield it, such as the BUM LIC system, mean

          a loss in foreign exchange earning opportunities.      The reason for any loss

          should not be a lack of access to import financing and the uncompetitive­

           ness of alternative financing terms.~1         In turn, the policy to li~it the

           use 	of the SBW system only to 100i. garment exporters who open BUM LICs is

           inconsistent with the principle of a rational export incentive administra­

          . tion that separates duty-free import eligibility from export financing

           conditions.



                        Recommendations



           4.27         To assure automatic access to import financing for export
                                                                        .        .      .
           production, it is recommended that the Bangladesh Bank       c~eate   a foreign

           currency loan scheme to meet the import financing needs for export

           production, direct or indirect.     Exporters who want to use Government-

           supported import financing should rely on Back-to-Back Sight Import L/Os

           (BSM L/Cs) rather than on BUM L/Cs.     The requirement that exporters who

           want to use the SBW system must open BUM LICs should be abolished.



           Administrative Arrangements for Preshipment Working Capital Financing



           4.28         The 1985/86 Export Policy Book lists only one Bangladesh Bank

           circular, issued in 1981, that deals with the administrative arrangements

           for export financing, whereas it includes five circulars regarding export

           loan interest rates and two on export finance guarantee and credit

           insurance.     The 1981 administrative circular (BCD Circular No.5, March 13,



               A ccording to TIP (1984), in general the interest rate costs associated
           III 	
                  with the suppliers' credits for fabric imports by Bangladesh's garment
                  exporters through BUM LlCs seemed higher than prevailing world market
                  interest rates.

          1981), which is supposed to guide commercial banks and exporters on the

          procedural arrangements for export loans, appears to leave most

          administrative mechanisms to the discretion of the commercial banks,

          providing only broad guidelines on the maximum ceiling for an export loan

          (i.e., 90% of the value of the export order) and the types of collateral

          commercial banks may accept (summarized in paragraph 4.11).      In particular,

          the circular fails to specify the automatic     mechanisms (L/C or otherwise)

          for disbursing and liquidating export loans and for creating quasi-physical

          collateral.    The basic question these loose administrative guidelines raise

          is whether the objective of automatic and equal access to expor't loans for

          all firms that generate export value added can be achieved, given the

          excessive discretion·of very conservative commercial banks?      Rather, is it

          not necessary to introduce automatic and carefully coordinated mechanisms?



          4.29        To administer the export financing scheme effectively, the Export

          Credit Cells at the head offices of the commercial banks are asked:



                 (a) 	 To review their export loan position monthly and quarterly; and



                 (b) 	 To improve their administrative procedures (BCD(c) 650 


                      [1--946-95], August 1, 1983). 




          For its part, the Banking Control Department of the Bangladesh Bank is

          responsible for overseeing the export financing administration ?f the

          commercial banks.    According to the study by Business Research Associates

          (1984), the Bangladesh Bank has not carried out its supervisory role

           very effectively.       It does not even have a separate section with highly

           qualified staff. l2 1



                        Major Issues



           4.30         The current export loan disbursement and liquidation mechanisms,

           as directed by the Bangladesh Bank circular, do not amount to the automatic

           and well-coordinated mechanisms needed not only for administrative

           efficiency but also for automatic access by all exporters.  They do not:
                                                                   .      .
           (a) allow the creation of quasi-physical collateral using the materials

           financed by the export- loan; (b) minimize the misuse of export loans

           through loan disbursement and liquidation mechanisms tied to the material

           purchase    Lie as well as E Lie negotiations; and (c) link export financing
           for the direct exporter with that for the indirect one.



           4.31         To achieve automatic and well-coordinated mechanisms, the export

           financing system needs to be modernized.        In turn, the supervisory role of

           the Bangladesh Bank needs to be streamlined and strengthened.



                        Reconnnendations



           4.32         It is recommended that the Bangladesh Bank form a task force on

           the modernization of the preshipment export financing administration.          The

           flow chart in Figure 1 compares the automatic loan disbursement mechanisms


           11/ 	 It  does not appear that consistent and up-to-date export financing data
                  by sector are available at the Bangladesh Bank. Instead, the recent
                  data published contain errors and inconsistencies (Bangladesh Bank,
                  1984, p. 73).

           of a modernized export financing system with the discretionary mechanisms

           permitted by the current Bangladesh Bank circular (compare lines A, B, e

           and 0 with lines E and F in Figure 1, and compare columns (b), (d), (e),

           (f) and (g) with columns (b), (c) and (a) in Figure 1).           The key elements

           of the modernized export financing administration are:



                (a) 	 The BIN   Lie system is applied to the export financing of both
                      direct and indirect exporters and the 8SM         Lie system to import
                      financing for export production for those exporters unwilling or

                      unable to use the BUM   Lie    syst~m (see column [d] of F'igure '1);



                (b) 	 Disbursement of the direct exporter's loan in the form of a

                      payment to the indirect exporters,who supply finished export

                      commodities (i.e., output-supplying indirect exporter) or

                      intermediate inputs (i.e., input-supplying indirect exporter) and

                      the foreign supplier of imported inputs at the time of BIN         Lie or
                      BSM   Lie negotiations (see lines A, Band e that link column [b]
                      to column [g] of Figure 1);



                (c) 	 Granting the indirect exporter's production loan as soon as the

                      indirect exporter receives a BIN       LIe   (see column [f] of

                      Figure 1);



                (d) 	 Creation of quasi-physical collateral using the finished export

                      commodities or domestic and imported inputs purchased with the

                      export loan granted under the BIN      Lie and 8SM Lie (see column [e]
                      of Figure 1);

          4.34            Commercial banks can grant export loans either from their own

          funds or from the refinancing facility of the Bangladesh Bank.                   In the case

          of the former, the Bangladesh Bank provides a 5.S% interest rate

          interest (BCD Circular No.5, July 21, 1983).                  In the case of the latter,

                       Major Issue



            4.35       The Bangladesh Bank is supposed to refinance only after it is

            convinced the commercial bank has liquidity problems.    It has been

            reported, however, that in some cases considerable time was required to get

            approval from the Bangladesh Bank for the refinancing because of the time

            required to"agree on the liquidity status (Business Research Associates,

            1984, p. 30).    Therefore, export loan refinancing by the Bangladesh Bank

            does not appear to be automatic.    Depending on the liquidity situation, it

            may be difficult to assure automatic and'quick access to' export' loans for

            all exporters, direct and indirect, without an automatic refinancing

            scheme.



                       Recommendation



            4.36       It is recommended that the Government separate export financing

            from general bank lending in terms of the link to general liquidity status,

            and instead institute an automatic and speedy refinancing mechanism that

            disregards the general liquidity situation.

                      v.     MAINTAINING A REALISTIC EXCHANGE RATE FOR ALL EXPORTERS



           5.1             The most important policy instrument affecting the real return

           exporters realize in local currency for the foreign exchange they earn

           through export is the exchange rate.        Even though much progress has been

           made recently in adjusting the official exchange rate flexibly and in

           compensating exporters for the difference between the official and market

           rates, efficient schemes still need to be designed that assure all

           exporters (direct and indirect) an exchange rate (a) that is not lower than

           the market rate and (b) that maintains a' stable and rear effect'ive Ie"vel.



           Export Performance Benefit Scheme



           5.2             The Export Performance Benefit (XPB) scheme replaced the Export

           Performance Licensing (XPL)/Import Entitlement Certificate (IEC) system on

           July 1, 1985.       Under the XPL/IEC system, importers bought lEC from

           exporters at the market (WES) exchange rate and then received foreign

           exchange from the Bangladesh Bank.       Under the XPB scheme, authorized

           dealers pay a "premium" in cash to the exporters along wi th "normal export

           proceeds" (which are converted into the local currency unit based on the

           official exchange rate).       This payment is made at the time of negotiation

           of the export bills.       In turn, the authorized dealers are reimbursed by the

           Bangladesh Bank.       The amount of premium is determined by the following

           formula:
                                                                                                                                                                            •

                     Amount of premium   = 	(Value of export) x (XPB entitlement rate)
                                             x (rate of premium),                        (4)



           where



           XPB entitlement rate is announced by the Government as shown in Table 9,

           and rate of premium is announced by the Ba~gladesh Bank from time to time

           based on the difference between the WES market and the official exchange

           rates.



           5.3           In addition to improving the administrative procedures, the XPB

           scheme aims at:



                   (a)   Adjusting the XPB entitlement rate in line with approximate

                         export value added (i.e., the local value added contained in the

                         export products);



                   (b) 	 Extending XPB benefits to indirect exporters (F.E. Circular

                         No. 55, July 6, 1985).



           While the XPL/IEC system had four different entitlement rates, only four

           items (leather goods, finished leather, carpets and packed tea) qualified

           for the 100% one.      The XPB scheme offers three entitlement rates (40%, 70%

           and 100%), with 45 items included under the 100% one.       Furthermore, of the

           Group 0 export items in Table 9, selected exports containing local inputs

           are entitled to a higher XPB rate than are those using imported inputs, the
~tNAME: thapter /5 (R) P: (D-l72c) 68




                                                         - 68 ­



            purpose being to vary the entitlement rate in line with export value

            added.   In addition, local suppliers of intermediate inputs for the

            selected products (i.e., indirect exporters) receive the same XPB rates as

            do the final exporters.



                         Major Issues·



            5.4          Assumptions.         The rationale for the XPB scheme is that the amount

            of premium given to exporters based on equation (4) will ensure the shadow

            exchange rate (the rate that refl~cts th~ true opportuni'ty cost' of foreign

            exchange) for the net foreign exchange earnings of exporters even under the

           dual exchange rate system.



            5.S          What assumptions underlie this rationale?         It is easy to show the

            following:




                         Starting with

                         Net Taka Earning from export

                               ~    (Net Taka earnings from exports without XPB)

                                    + (amount of premium under XPB).                         (5 )



                         and wanting to reach 


                         Net Taka earnings from export

           we need the following assumptions:~/



                     (a) 	 XPB entitlement rate = Net foreign exchange earning rate; 14/

                     (b) 	 Exporters have automatic access to the official exchange rate for

                            100% of their imported inputs;

                     (c) 	 WES market exchange rate      = shadow      exchange rate.



           For a review of the XPB system, it is necessary, therefore to focus on

           whether its detailed rules and administrative arrangements are consistent

                 where 	OER = Official exchange rate (Taka per $)
                        WESR = WES market exchange rate (Taka per $)
                        SER = Shadow exchange rate (Taka per $).

the sectoral variations in the net foreign exchange earning   r~tes.     In

addition, as shown in Table 9, at the sectoral level, the net foreign

exchange earning rate of the product using domestically produced inputs

would be higher than that of the product using imported inputs, other

things being equal.    Therefore, it may be justifiable to rely on the

pre-announced XPB entitlement rate and the export value to estimate the

value of the net foreign exchange earnings, if there are some

administrative difficulties in calculating the latter directly from the

data:



            $ net foreign exchange earnings ~/

               • ($ export value) • (XPB entitlement rate).                   (7)



However, if the three different XPB entitlement rates (40%, 70% and 100%)

for the various products in Table 9 deviate much from the net foreign

exchange Earning Rates for these products, and if 'the accounting of the net

foreign exchange earnings can be administered without much difficulty, then

it would be desirable to use the latter data (rather than the XPB

entitlement rates) to calculate the correct premium amount.     For example,

exporting firms using the SBW system can easily compute their annual net

foreign exchange earnings with the same data they use for their duty-free

imports.    As the duty-free import administration becomes more efficient,

the same data base can in turn be used to calculate the net foreign

exchange earnings for the XPB system.



11/   Once ($ net foreign exchange earnings) are known, then the (Premium
      amount) can easily be estimated by multiplying the (rate of premdum).

             It is clear from the above framework that:



        (a) 	 As long as the export value added rate at stage s is identical,

             the XPB entitlement rate at that stage should not vary, depending

             on whether inputs at stage s are imported or produced

             domestically ~ (even though the net foreign exchange earning

             Rate at the sectoral level would be different in the two cases);

             and



        (b) 	 As long as the export value ad<ied rate at stage s is 'identi-cal,

             the XPB entitlement rate at that stage should not vary, depending

             on whether the product at that stage is supplied to the next

             stage export manufacturer as an input (i.e., indirect exporter)

             or is exported directly ~ (i.e., direct exporter).



             Even though the XPB system that provides benefits to indirect

exporters directly is consistent with the above framework, one element in

the system appears to contradict that conclusion.       First, the 70%-40%

distinction is applied to the XPB entitlement rates for final exporters in

ready-made garments, hosiery goods, silk fabric products, and specialized

textiles and household linens, depending on whether they use local or




~       The
         	  producer at stage s will not use domestic inputs unless their
        prices are identical to or lower than imported ones without duties.

lZ! 	   The aggregate export value added of the country will be identical in
        these two cases, other things being equal.

               imported inputs 18 1 (in Table 9).       This approach does not appear to be

               consistent with the reasoning in (a).        Second, the 70%-40% distinction

               applied to the XPB entitlement rates for indirect exporters of ready-made

               garments and hoisery goods depending on whether they supply their products

               does not appear to be consistent with the reasoning in (b). 19 1



                             In sum, in computing the premium amount, it appears desirable to

               use the export value added data directly rather than the XPB entitlement

               rates (see below on the administrative arrangements) fO[l the products- whose

               5.07          Access to the Official Exchange Rate.    The above framework and

               the XPB rates are based on the assumption that all imported inputs for

               export production are purchased at the official exchange rate.        As

               discussed in paragraphs 3.04-3.07, however, this assumption is incorrect in

               many sectors.        Therefore, to assure the WES market exchange rate for all

               export value added, either full access of imported inputs to the official

               exchange rate mut be assured, or the XPB rate should be increased to




               181 	 The simple distinction between domestic and imported inputs is
                     extremely misleading unless the relative degree of each use is
                     measured, because in most cases both are used.

               191 	 It may be argued that these two examples must be understood as
                      attempts to deal with some irrational elements related to mere brand
                      preference for imported inputs. However, the rational policy regime
                      (that provides the equal export incentives to direct and indirect
                      exports) must be neutral for direct exporters whether they use
                      imported or domestic inputs. Further, it must be neutral for local
                      suppliers whether they export directly or sell to direct exporters.

            5.08       Stable Real Exchange Rate.     The above framework is designed to

            assure the WES market exchange rate for all export value added.      However,

            even if the tJES rate is achieved (see Annex 5 for the past data on the WES

            and official exchange rates), it does not necessarily mean that the WES

            rate is close to the shadow exchange rate.      In particular, in order to

            assure that real export incentives do not decline, it is desirable to

            maintain a stable real exchange rate by introducing an adjuRtme'nt factor on

            top of the premium rate.     Another adjustment that could be used effectively

            is to reduce further the anti-export bias further and uniformly for all

            export value added.



            5.09       Administrative Arrangements.     The XPB entitlement rate system

            attempts to bring direct and indirect exporters closer to the WES market

            exchange rate regime for their export value added by using a simple

            administrative instrument.    Because of the lack of very efficient and

            automatic administrative mechanisms to check on direct or indirect exports

            as well as on domestic or imported inputs (this information is critical for

            the implementation of the XPB system), however, the administration

            procedures appear to be ad hoc, cumbersome and inefficient.

     (a) 	 Use the export value added framework for products in whi.::h the

          domestic value added is less than 100% of the eKport value. as

          efficient   ~dministrative   arrangements for the Back-to-Back based

          Lie system (inland Lie as well as import L/C) are already in

          place;



     (b) 	 Assure automatic access to the official exchange rate for 100% of

          the imported inputs required for eKport value added;



     (c) 	 Adjust the premium amount fle»ibly (beyond the    diffe~ence   between

          the 	\-lES and official exchange rates) in order to maintain a

          stable real effective exchange rate (weighted currency basket);

          and



     (d) 	 Evaluate the relative effectiveness of a value added-based tax

          credit incentive for exporters (it can be introduced by adding

          another adjustment factor in the above scheme), as well as the

          current income tax reduction incentives.

 Value)s and (Domestic Input Value)s can be recorded hased on the

  Back-to-Back-based Inland                                    Lie system.   Note in equation (12) that, once the

  dual exchange rate system becomes unified, the premium rate will be

  eliminated.                  llowever, the administrative scheme can be used continuously to

  provide a stable real exchange change rate for all firms that generate

  export value added based on the ,-{ factor and to reduce the ant i-export bias

  based on the                 Pfactor.

          VI.   DEVELOPING A STRATEGY TO PROMOTE BACKWARD LINKAGES



1985-86 Export Policy



6.01      One of the three basic objectives of the 1985-86 Export Policy is

"to maximize export earnings by providing both direct and indirect needs.

i.e., to generate more exportable surplus." (p. 1)   Specifically, "Export

incentives and facilities like duty drawback, XPB, etc., available to

locally produced materials used as direct inputs for the manufacture of

exportable products or products sapplied' against international   ~ender ••••


in the same manner in which they are entitled to such incentives and

facilities when these are directly exported" (p. 21)20/.



6.02      Despite these statements, the GOB has not yet achieved its

objectives of increasing the export value added through backward linkages

from non-traditional exports and providing equal export incentives to

indirect exporters, except in the case of the XPB.   The major explanation

is the lack of efficient administrative mechanisms to provide export

incentives to indirect exporters directly.




20/ 	 To reform the current incentive structure that discriminates against
      the use of domestically produced inputs, the Government is taking the
      right approach by attempting to provide identical export incentives to
      indirect exporters directly. Some experts suggest (Hutcheson and
      McKay, 1985, Rab 1985) a quick fix such as an aggregate uniform duty
      rebate scheme (for direct exporters). That approach, however,
      directly contradicts the Government's policy, as it fails to provide
      any analytic or empirical basis for promoting backward linkages and
      instituting an effective and rational incentive system. as pointed out
      above.

                   Back-to-Back Based Llc System



                   6.03          The fact that the concept of a Back-to-Back-based Llc has been

                    incorporated in some part in the export incentive system in Bangladesh is

                    impressive, even though a full articulation of the concept has yet to be

                   accomplished.     This start is vital if the Government wants to take

                   advantage of the concept in modernizing the administration of its export

                   incentives.     Given that the Back-to-Back-based LIC system has been the

                   backbone of the efficiency and automaticity demonstrated in successful

                   developing countries, it is desirable to' review the current status of

                   Bangladesh's system.



                   6.04         The concept of the Back-to-Back-based Llc is broader than that of

                   the      so-called Back-to-Back (Usance Import) LIC commonly used in

                   Bangladesh.     At the same time, a Back-to-Back-based LIC is nothing more

                   than a LIC (import or inland) created on the basis of a master export LIC

                   (or other type of export order).      Since the ultimate basis for authorizing

                   any Llc in a country is a master export LIC, the Back-to-Back-based LIC

                   system is the most effective way to separate activities related to

                   exporting from those related to import substitution.



                                Back-to-Back-based Import LIC



                   6.05         It should be noted that the term "Back-to-Back L/c" has been used

                   in Bangladesh for the Back-to-Back-based Usance Import LIC (BUN LlC) for

                    100% direct export manufacturers with SBWs in the ready-made garment,
                                          - 79 ­



specialized textile, household linen and hosiery product sectors (Circular

Letter No. ECP, COM. 241/A-3050, December 5, 1982).           As indicated above

(paragraph 4.15), the BUM       Llc   system has been designed to get users to

Import their inputs based on suppliers' credits rather than using

Government-supported import financing for export production.             The most

useful role the BUM     Llc   system plays, however, is to serve as one of the

most effective instruments for the administering of the SBW system (as

discussed in paragraph 3.18 and 3.19).           Furthermore, the BUM   Llc   system has

been extended to indirect exporters supplying fabrics to 100% garment

export manufacturers with SBtols where the' final exported open a BIN tIc in

favor of the former (see the next paragraph).           Therefore, the BUM     Llc
system provides basis for the Back-to-Back-based Import LIC system for

direct and indirect exporters, even though it has been quite limited in

scope and access itself.       It appears that the Import     Llc   rules spelled out

in the Import Policy Order, 1985-86 need to incorporate Back-to-Back-based

Llc    mechanisms, if automatic access to restriction-free and duty-free

imports and import financing for all direct and indirect eKporters is to be

assured, based on efficient and automatic administrative mechanisms.



             Back-to-Back based Inland     Llc


6.06         It should also be noted that the concept of "Back-to-Back Inland

L/Cs" was introduced not to include indirect exporters in the Government­

supported export financing system, but rather to include them in the Bm1

Llc    system.   The Bangladesh Bank Circular on "Procedures for Opening of

Inland Back-to-Back     Llc   (by 100% export oriented ready made garments
                                        - 80 ­



industry) in favor of    Lo~al   Manufacturer and Supplier of Fabrics" (Circular

Letter No. ECP. COM. 241/A-583, April 22, 1984) states:


          At present fabrics as well as other raw materials for iOOi. export
          oriented ready made garments industry are being imported under
          Back-to-Back L/c (i.e., BUM L/C) arrangement.

          It has been decided that the same system shall be extended to the
          local manufacturer-cum-supplier of fabrics for importation of
          their raw materials. The procedure will he as under:­

          (i) On receipt of export L/C from the buyer, a ready made garment
              unit under bonded warehouse system may open Inland
              Back-to-Back L/C through their banker against the external LC
              in favor of the local manufacturer-cum-supplier of fabrics up
              to 68% of 75% of the net fob value of the export L/C (i.e.,
              51% of the original. export· l/C) for import. of.

          From the above circular, it is clear that the original objective

of the Back-to-Back-based Inland L/C system in Bangladesh was to allow

designated indirect exporters to get suppliers' credits for their imported

inputs, just as the original objective of the Back-to-Back-based Import L/C

system in Bangladesh was to let designated direct exporters to obtain

suppliers' credits for their imported inputs.      The Back-to-Back-based

Inland L/c system so far has not allowed any import financing for indirect

exporters, just as the Back-to-Back Import L/C system for direct exporters

has not done so.   Further, the Back-to-Back-based Inland L/C system has not

made Government-supported local currency export financing available to

indirect exporters.     In turn, the Minutes of the   ~eeting   held in the   ~BR   on

January 19, 1984 state:



          ••• supply of fabrics by a local manufacturer to the bonded
          warehouse of a 100% export oriented ready made garments industry
          will be treated as export. Such being the treatment given, the
          manufacturer-cum-supplier of local inputs will be entitled to
          refund custom duty and sales tax element involved in the imported
          raw materials and also any excise duty paid on locally procured

                                                                           - 81 ­


                    raw materials after the manufacturer has made the supply to the
                    bonded' warehouse of the fabricator-cum-ex:porter •

                    •• •Towards establishing Ii case for cash rebate (duty drawback),
                    the manufacturer-cum-supplier shall be required to produce to

                    the buyer (100% export-oriented government industry) drawing
                    reference to the foreign currency Llc received by the latter from
                    his buyers abroad.


                   Just as the BUM                           Llc    system for direct eKporters has been

instrumental in administration of duty-free imports based on SBWs,

according to the above Minutes, the government is attempting to use the BIN

Llc    system in duty-free import administration and to provide refunds of

indirect taKes to designated indirect exporters.                                          As discussed 'in Chapter

III, however, because of the ineffectiveness of the duty-free import

.administration (other than the SBW sytem), it is doubtful that the policy

of allOWing certain indirect eKporters access to duty drawback and indirect

tax refunds has been implemented efficiently.                                         Nevertheless, the fact that

the BIN       Llc        system has introduced the concept of a Back-to-Back Inland                             Lie
system on which a full-scale system can later be developed, is positive.



                   Major Issues



6.07               The weakest aspect of the current Back-to-Back-based                                Lie   system

in Bangladesh is that it has not been developed as an instrument to

administer Government-supported eKport financing for imported inputs and

indirect exporters.                                  Since a       Lie   is a trade-finanCing instrument, the

Back-to-Back              Llc             system cannot be used for eKport incentives other than

export financing, unless it is first instituted as the Government's export
                                      - 82 ­



financing instrument.     Furthermore, if the Back-to-Back-based Inlctnd Lie

system is not designed to administer the export financing system for

indirect exporters, then the other export incentives for indirect exporters

can hardly be administered using the same system.     Therefore, as indicated

above (paragraph 4.12), modernizing the export financing system is the

first step in instituting the export incentive system for indirect

exporters.



             A second point is that in deve1Qping the administrative schemes

for the various export incentives such as export financing, duiy-frei

imports, indirect tax exemptions, XPB and income tax reductions for

indirect exporters as well as direct exporters no serious consideration has

been given to the effectiveness of using the common instrument and

automatic mechanisms centered around the Back-to-Back-based Lie system.



             Third, the current 1007. export and product-specific approach

applied to the Back-to-Back-based    Lie system is inconsistent with the basic
principle of equal export incentives for all direct and indirect

exporters.     The need to design efficient administrative arrangements for

the basic indirect exporters' incentives (i.e., automatic access to

duty-free, res triction-free and indi rect tax-free inputs and working

capital export financing) based on the Back-to-Back-based    Lie system has
become much more important recently.     The reason is that the basic

incentives for indirect exporters (together with the basic incentives for

direct exporters) are one of the few that the GATT rules and importing

developed countries accept.     (Hufbauer and Erb, 1984).

6.08              Recommendations



                  It is recommended that the Government form a task force to

design arrpngements for administering the indirect exporters' incentives.

The Back-to-Back-based                                      LIe   system should be the backbone of the

arrangements.                     Since the modernized export financing system is going to

provide the foundation for the administrative arrangements for indirect

exporters' incentives, the task force should work very closely with the

task force on the modernization of the export financing system (see

paragraph 4.32).



                  The task force for indirect exporters' incentives should develop

a phal3ed program for the following areas:



                  Phase 1:                          Export financing for indirect exporters;

                  Phase 2:                          Duty-free importing for indirect exporters;

                  Phase 3:                          XPB for indirect exporters;

                  Phase 4:                          Indirect tax exemptions for indirect exporters;

                  Phase 5:                          Income tax reductions (or value added-based tax

                                                    credits) for indirect exporters.



Other Policies to Assist Small and Infant Exporters



6.09              As indicated above (paragraph 2.4), the most important factor inr

the remarkable success of the 100% garment exporters with SBW facilities is

that they were guaranteed equal footing with foreign competitors, who were
                                     -   84 ­




enjoying free trade in inputs and easy access to export financing      3S    well

as realistic and flexible exchange rates.       The 100% garment exporters

benefitted greatly from the undistorted markets and policies.



           If the Government wants to promote backward linkages from garment

exports by gradually replacing the imported fabrics used as inputs for

exported garments with domestically produced fabrics, it first must ensure

that local fabric producers are on an equal footing with foreign fabric

producers in terms of free trade status for their inputs and easy access to

export financing, as well as fair' fabric' prices in thesE! local 'currency

unit (i.e., world market prices converted into the local currency unit

based on a realistic exchange rate).     It should also continuously ensure

garment exporters absolute freedom in choosing between imported and local

fabrics.



           The first requirement for promoting backward linkages from

exports of non-traditional commodities is to assure the identical export

incentives ~or indirect and direct exporters or final stage export

manufacturers.   This objective requires the efficient administrative

arrangements, as discussed.



6.10       Most actual and potential indirect exporters in developing

countries are small or infant producers who do not have equivalent footing

as do foreign competitors or large-scale export manufacturers.       This

discrepancy exists even though the export financing system includes

indirect exporters as beneficiaries.     The reason is that the commercial

                                                                        - 85 ­



      banks handling the export loan are not always wi lUng to accept the risks

      of small producers, the use of quasi-physical collateral is not                                   ;1



      well-instituted process in the export financing system; and                                 ~o   well­

      developed risk pooling system is avai lable.                                 Therefore, the second

      requirement for promoting backward linkages is to build institutions to

      deal with the risk-averse attitudes of commercial banks, as discussed above

      (paragraph 4.08).



      6.11                          Assume, however, that the system of indirect exporters'

      incentives and the risk-pooling institutions were well developed for -the

      local fabric manufacturers that supply Bangladesh's garment export

      industries.                            Is it then possible to replace most imported fabrics with

      locally produced ones rapidly?



                                    A clue to the answer may again be found in the experience of

      garment exporters.                                 As indicated above (paragraph 2.17), active

      collaboration with trading companies from, and joint ventures with, some

      NICs have been critical in the acquisition of technical, marketing and

      managerial know-how by Bangladesh garment export manufacturers.                                        ~ithout


      that know-how, they could not have achieved such a remarkable performance

      in such a short time.                                 By the same token, local fabric producers        I~st   also

      acquire know-how, if they are to evalute effectively whether and how soon

      they can compete with foreign producers of fabrics in supplying Bangladesh

      garment export manufacturers.                                 Effective policies designed to accelerate

      the acquisition of technical,                               mar~eting   and managerial know-how by small
                                        - 86 ­


and infant exporters are another important factor in promoting >,ac\:ward

linkages.



             Major Issues



6.12         What government policies are the most effective in assisting

small and infant exporters in acquiring know-how, in the light of

experience?     The successful East Asian countries have relied more or

less on the three sources of assistance for small and infant

exporters;



       (a) 	 Local trading companies, final stage export manufacturers and

             exporters' associations;



       (b) 	 Foreign trading companies, foreign buyers, foreign suppliers of

             equipment and intermediate inputs, and joint venture

             multinational companies; and



       (c) 	 The Government directly_



While (c) has played a selective role at the early stages, both (a) and (b)

have been the major instruments in the success of the East Asian

countries.     In Bangladesh, (b) will all along be very important (as in the

case of garments) in the short run.       In addition, the Government appears to

be stressing (c) (lTC, 1985).     It appears, however, that there is a lack of

                                                     - 87 ­


            the understanding about the critical importance of (a) in a medillM-term

            strategy to promote backward linkages from non-traditional exports.



                          Recommendations



            6.13          In developing a medium-term strategy to promote backward linkages

            from non-traditional exports, a balanced emphasis on the following three

            areas is required:



                    (i)   Assurance of equal export incentives to indirect exporters;



                   (ii) 	 Building of institutions to deal effectively with smaLL and

                          infant exporters' risks; and



               (iii) 	 Development of effective assistance schemes for small and infant

                          exporters.



            In developing effective schemes that help small and infant exporters to

            acquire technical, marketing and managerial know-how, a balanced approach

            is needed.      It should maximize (i) the short-term gains derived from direct

            assistance by the Government and indirect assistance by multinationals and

            (ii) the medium-term benefits that derive from the indirect assistance of

            local trading companies, final stage export manufacturers, and exporters'

            ~ssociations.      On   the last point in particular, it is recommended that the

            Government develop a medium-term program.

                 consumption 4.5% to the marking length has to be added for process
                 loss.
            2. 	 The above formula has been based on the fabrics having 44/45" width.
                 If there is a variation of width, the same has to be calculated on the
                 basis of the following formula.

              2. 	 The above formula has been based on the fabrics having 44/45" width.
                   If there is a variation of width, the same has to be calculated on the
                   basis of the following formula.
