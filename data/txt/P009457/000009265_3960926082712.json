achieving high rates of industrial growth to meet domestic\n            demand, expand exports and create employment outside\n            agriculture, the Government has agreed to undertake a major\n            industrial policy reform program Which this credit supports.\n            The reform program covers (a) developing and improving\n            administrative and financial arrangements for implementation\n            of export policies; (b) rationalizing the structure of\n            protection; and (c) liberalizing the investment approval\n            system.  The program further involves (d) improving the\n            central monitoring of the performance of public enterprises,\n            while granting them more autonomy and strengthening their\n            management; and (e) improving the efficiency of the\n            industrial credit system.
