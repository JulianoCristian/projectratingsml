ultimate objectives of the War\n            Victims Rehabilitation Project are to facilitate the\n            reintegration of war victims into economically productive\n            activities and normal social life, and to avoid the heavy\n            costs of lost productivity and sustained disruption of the\n            social fabric of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Specifically, the\n            project is aimed at reducing the burden of physical and\n            psycho-social disabilities through targeted and\n            cost-effective rehabilitation services. In pursuit of these\n            objectives, the project will include the following\n            components: 1) community-based rehabilitation, which will\n            address the rehabilitation needs of physically injured and\n            psychologically disabled war victims; 2) prostheses and\n            orthoses production, which will support the production and\n            maintenance of quality of prostheses and orthoses in three\n            production units and five maintenance units; 3) orthopedic\n            and reconstructive surgery, which will improve the\n            availability and quality of essential orthopedic and\n            reconstructive surgical services in three clinical centers\n            and four cantonal hospitals; and 4) project implementation\n            support, which will support the establishment and functions\n            of a project implementation unit to manage the\n            project's activities."}, "docdt": "1996-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
