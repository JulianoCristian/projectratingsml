However,\n            lessons drawn from the project, convey that the major\n            constraints to project implementation, were the continuous\n            staffing problems, i.e., insufficient staff, and lack of\n            appropriate skills to accomplish procurement, disbursement,\n            and supervision tasks. Furthermore, the integration of\n            project investments into an overall sector strategy\n            development, would have improved with additional, skilled\n            staff. However, and although the insufficient, and\n            appropriate skills may be easily understood given the\n            post-conflict situation, the fact remains that, particularly\n            essential to overcome implementation delays is a strong\n            procurement capacity. Thus, the procurement problem could\n            have been avoided by engaging a procurement agent, to act on\n            behalf of the implementation unit. The introduction of the\n            community based rehabilitation model, largely used in\n            developed countries to decentralize the care of the\n            physically disabled, and mentally traumatized, or\n            handicapped, thus reducing institutionalization, may not\n            have been possible in Bosnia and Herzegovina, under any\n            other circumstance, and has proven a success in addressing\n            the country's short-term needs, hence, the use of this\n            model in future health sector restructuring operations, is suggested."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
