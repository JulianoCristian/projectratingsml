the Caribbean Development\n            Bank ( CDB ) aim to improve the effectiveness of their aid\n            and increase the efficiency of their operations in the\n            Commonwealth Caribbean, by progressively intensifying their\n            collaboration. CDB will complement, and eventually supplant,\n            some current Bank roles in the region.  This will enable the\n            Bank, over a 3 -5 year period, to redirect its manpower\n            resources.  Project objectives are : a) to enhance the\n            amount and scope of development and financial services\n            offered to common member countries; b) to strengthen CDB to\n            become a more effective regional development institution;\n            and c) to channel, at a lower cost than the Bank could do\n            directly, IBRD / IDA loan funds to eligible member\n            countries.  In support of this process, the project will :\n            1) help CDB improve its institutional capabilities; and 2)\n            provide CDB with additional lending resources in support of\n            its lending operations.  In conformity with CDB's\n            recently formulated lending strategy, the Bank's funds\n            will be relent by the CDB in sectors which will make a\n            maximum contribution to the economic development of\n            borrowers for public and private sector projects.  Emergency\n            recovery assistance will also be included."}, "docdt": "1990-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
