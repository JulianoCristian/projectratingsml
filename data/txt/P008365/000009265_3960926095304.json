Southern Conveyor Project for Water\n            Resources Development - Phase II is the second phase of a\n            two-phase development to harness the Republic of\n            Cyprus' last substantial remaining surface water\n            resources.  The Southern Conveyor Project's primary\n            objectives are (i) to ensure adequate water supplies to four\n            major population areas and nearby villages, and (ii) to\n            maintain vitally important irrigated crop production in an\n            area threatened by aquifer seawater intrusion and extend\n            irrigation in other selected areas.  The project also aims\n            to rationalize further the utilization of the country's\n            scarce water resources through appropriate institutional\n            reform and the implementation of realistic cost recovery\n            measures for both domestic and irrigation water.  The second\n            phase of the project supplements phase I through the\n            following:  (a) the Dhiarizos diversion works, including a\n            tunnel; (b) irrigation distribution networks for 4,335 ha;\n            and (c) domestic water treatment works at Limassol and\n            Tersephanou, the Tersephanou-Nicosia conveyor and about 20\n            rural water supply schemes.  In addition, phase II provides\n            (d) on-farm development through the medium-term; (e)\n            provision of O&M and miscellaneous equipment; and (f)\n            provision of technical services and training."}, "docdt": "1988-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
