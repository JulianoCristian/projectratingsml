  project was rated satisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower were also rated satisfactory. Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: (1) the success of\n            SCP II being implemented closely behind SCP I demonstrates\n            that follow-on projects should continue directly and without\n            delay from the initial project in order to: (i) benefit from\n            experienced staff and routine procedures already in place,\n            and (ii) avoid or minimize delay in achieving the objectives\n            of the combined project; (2) the unfavorable experience with\n            deviating from the original Dhiarizos tunnel construction\n            concepts and methods shows that such action should be\n            avoided unless a thorough investigation and a full review of\n            the proposed deviation by independent experts is undertaken;\n            (3) experience with this project suggests that quality\n            problems under supply contracts should be minimized through\n            independent expert checks at manufacturers' plants; and\n            (4) the land use conflict experienced under the project\n            between irrigated farming and tourism points to the need for\n            thorough prior investigation of competing demands for basic\n            project resources."}, "docdt": "1997-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
