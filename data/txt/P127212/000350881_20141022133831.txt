A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The purpose of the proposed restructuring is to extend the closing date of the project for 12 months from
March 31, 2014 until March 31, 2015.

B. Project Status
Overall, project implementation has progressed well since May 2013 despite a slow launch in January
2013. The US$5 million State and Peace-building Fund (SPF) Grant Agreement was signed on April 20,
2012. The four effectiveness conditions were met and the grant was declared effective on October 3, 2012.
The program encompasses the financing of sub-projects focusing on meeting social needs by improving
service delivery at the local level. The project contributes to: (i) fostering social cohesion and stabilization
among disadvantaged populations following the January 2011 revolution; and (ii) mitigating the
socioeconomic risks faced by Tunisian returnees fleeing Libyan civil strife and by Tunisian communities
near the border with Libya affected by depressed cross-border trade and commerce. The target number of
beneficiaries (4000) has been exceeded, reaching approximately 4,200 beneficiaries as of December 1,
2013; therefore, the project objectives continue to be achievable.

Approximately 50 service delivery sub-projects are on-going or have been completed and a plan to
evaluate the results of these sub-projects has been developed. The project coordinators for Médenine and
Tatouine regions have initiated training for sub-project beneficiaries. The Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) is in the process of collecting all data related to beneficiary training, including: quality of training
(certification) and number of hours per beneficiary. Finally, the PIU has been actively engaged in
significant media outreach efforts (television news, radio, newspapers, website, facebook). Recruitment is
underway for hiring a survey firm to conduct an evaluation of the project, expected to be finalized in
March 2014.

C. Proposed Changes

Change in Loan Closing Date(s):
Explanation
The closing date will be extended for 12 months from March 31, 2014 until March 31, 2015. The
proposed extension is necessary to make up for the nearly 6-month lag between project approval and
effectiveness. The project team received from the grant Recipient the implementation plan for completing
the project by March 31, 2015, available in the project file.
