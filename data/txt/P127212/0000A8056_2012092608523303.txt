                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of the Tunisia Participatory Service Development for Reintegration (PSD) Project is to pilot participatory approaches to employment
                         generation through a cash-for-service program for vulnerable Tunisian households. The program encompasses the financing of subprojects focusing on meeting social
                         needs by improving service delivery at the local level. The project contributes to: (i) fostering social cohesion and stabilization among disadvantaged populations
                         following the January 2011 revolution, and (ii) mitigating the socioeconomic risks faced by Tunisians returnees fleeing Libyan civil strife and by Tunisian communities
                         near the border with Libya affected by depressed cross-border trade and commerce.
