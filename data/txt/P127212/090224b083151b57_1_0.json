      Fund (SPF) Participatory Service Delivery for Reintegration\n            Project for Tunisia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in\n            terms of implementation arrangements, the project showed\n            that public-private partnerships can support the\n            implementation of employment generating, cash-for-service\n            programs and projects. Despite early delays in setting up\n            the legal institutional arrangements of the project and\n            training a new Project Implementation Unit (PIU) on Bank\n            procedures, this project exceeded targets and nearly fully\n            disbursed all grant funds. Moving forward, monitoring and\n            results-based contracting can be gradually strengthened to\n            boost the quality and effectiveness of implementation\n            further. Employability through delivering basic services can\n            help boost short-term employment opportunities in specific\n            sectors. Participatory approaches can help foster social\n            cohesion and accountability in service delivery to varying\n            degrees. Finally, in terms of participatory approaches to\n            build social cohesion, the project showed the importance of\n            involving local actors in selecting and targeting local\n            development needs and solutions. Giving greater choice and\n            involvement to key stakeholders at the local level,\n            including public authorities, the private sector and civil\n            society groups helped match demand and supply in identifying\n            the most viable, needed opportunities. However, greater\n            local capacity in terms of technical know-how and financial\n            resources and more systematic coordination between\n            stakeholders are needed moving forward."}, "docdt": "2015-09-30T22:44:01Z"}
