                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective of the Tunisia Participatory Service Development for Reintegration (PSD) Project is to pilot participatory approaches to employment
                         generation through a cash-for-service program for vulnerable Tunisian households. The program encompasses the financing of subprojects focusing on meeting social
                         needs by improving service delivery at the local level. The project contributes to: (i) fostering social cohesion and stabilization among disadvantaged populations
                         following the January 2011 revolution, and (ii) mitigating the socioeconomic risks faced by Tunisians returnees fleeing Libyan civil strife and by Tunisian communities
                         near the border with Libya affected by depressed cross-border trade and commerce.

                         The mission also prepared an impact evaluation plan. UTSS visited the target regions of Medenine and Tataouine, gaining full support from local Governors and NGOs who
                         welcomed the opportunity to enlist beneficiaries in local community projects.

                         The PIU accomplished the following since project effectiveness:

                         prepared a note (in Arabic) to introduce the project to stakeholders (objectives, NGO eligibility criteria, etc)
                         undertook field visits to both regions between Dec. 3-14, 2012 to raise awareness of the project with local stakeholders
