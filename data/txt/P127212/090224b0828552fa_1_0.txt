                         Government, the Project was restructured on February 27, 2014 to extend the closing date for a period of 12 months, from March 31, 2014 to March 31, 2015 and allow for the: (i)
                         finalization of the sub-projects that have not yet been completed; (ii) disbursement of funds to the over 4,000 project beneficiaries, which has turned out to be a longer process than
                         originally anticipated; and (iii) preparation a more thorough project evaluation, with carefully articulated recommendations for possibly scaling up this type of project in the near future.

                          To date, the project implementation has progressed significantly with the completion of the implementation of 57 service delivery sub-projects (more than the 40 targeted sub-
                         projects) following three calls for proposals. The total number of direct beneficiaries for these 57 sub-projects (4,260) has exceeded the initial target number of 4,000 beneficiaries
                         while the target number of indirect beneficiaries (12,000) has also largely been surpassed (62,669). Furthermore, with the launch and closing of the fourth and last call for proposals
                         in July 2014, 22 new sub-projects will be selected and 600 more direct beneficiaries would be added once the implementation of these newly selected sub-projects start. On the other
                         hand, the implementation of the 57 sub-projects necessitated the mobilization of 200 trainers-supervisors, of whom 51% are women and identification of resource persons and
                         agreements with local training centers to present lectures in connection with the training themes.

                         As of October 17, 2014, 84,7% of the Grant has been disbursed and the remaining proceeds are fully committed.
