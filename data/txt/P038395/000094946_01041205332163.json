Maximum abstraction levels are specified, to be\n            phased out during a two year period; 2) construction should\n            be limited to daylight schedules as a noise abatement\n            measure; appropriate covers will control dust emissions;\n            and, an efficient traffic management plan will limit\n            congestion, and reduce public risk; 3) ecological protection\n            include fencing, and the provision of alternative habitats,\n            or relocation of flora, and fauna."}, "docdt": "2001-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
