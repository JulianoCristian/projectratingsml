Nonetheless, during construction, adverse\n            environmental impacts will occur, namely noise, and dust\n            pollution, as well as pollution due to increased traffic on\n            local roads. In addition, groundwater abstraction from the\n            Vardar River, will adversely affect river flows. The\n            Environmental Assessment addresses separately each of the\n            three locations, providing the environmental baseline\n            encountered, and, in accordance with the country's\n            laws, and regulations, proposes mitigating measures as\n            follows: 1) monitoring of groundwater levels, to establish\n            the effect - on the river flows - of using groundwater for\n            irrigation. Maximum abstraction levels are specified, to be\n            phased out during a two year period; 2) construction should\n            be limited to daylight schedules as a noise abatement\n            measure; appropriate covers will control dust emissions;\n            and, an efficient traffic management plan will limit\n            congestion, and reduce public risk; 3) ecological protection\n            include fencing, and the provision of alternative habitats,\n            or relocation of flora, and fauna."}, "docdt": "2000-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
