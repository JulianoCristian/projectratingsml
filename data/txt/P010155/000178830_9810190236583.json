    goods; expand export promotion of handicrafts and small\n            industry products; and initiate project development\n            activities in Baluchistan. The project also includes\n            subsector studies and project preparation in support of the\n            credit component. The Credit would provide US$26 million for\n            onlending to the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan\n            (IDBP) for refinancing loans by five commercial banks, and\n            US$4 million for the technical assistance components.\n            Project risks relate mainly to dealing with institutions\n            that are new to the Association. Monitoring by IDBP of the\n            credit component and technical assistance to the small\n            industries corporations should reduce these risks."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
