aimed at improvement and expansion of existing harbor and\n            shore facilities at Visakhapatnam, Kakinada and Nizampatnam,\n            expansion of the mechanized fishing vessel fleet, and\n            provision of village access roads and water supply to help\n            traditional fishermen in three leading fishing districts in\n            Andhra Pradesh. More than 75,000 subsistence fishermen would\n            benefit from the project. The main risks are possible\n            overharvesting of shrimp resources, potential difficulties\n            to negotiate the shallow bar at Nizampatnam, and delays in\n            completion of Project works. Various safeguards have been\n            provided to reduce these risks."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
