assist\n            the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) in:  (a)\n            alleviating power shortages; (b) improving the growing\n            demand for electricity; (c) improving the efficiency and\n            reliability of the EEA interconnected system; (d)\n            strengthening the EEA finanical position; and (e) improving\n            the technical and managerial skills of EEA staff.  The\n            project consists of:  (a) the supply and installation of a\n            dual fuel-fired thermal power station at Kureimat with a net\n            installed capacity of 1,200 MW; (b) the supply of material\n            and equipment for about 162 km of a 20-inch diameter natural\n            gas pipeline interconnecting the power station with the gas\n            grid; (c) the supply and installation of about 150 km of\n            500-kV and about 90 km of 220-kV transmission lines, and\n            line loss reduction equipment; (d)  the rehabilitation of\n            Tanta substation; and (e) technical assistance to help EEA\n            with engineering supervision at the power station, providing\n            training to EEA staff, completion of energy data bank and\n            management information system, computerization of EEA\n            finanical management system and introduction of efficient\n            load management system by procurement of special meters for\n            industrial and bulk consumers."}, "docdt": "1992-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
