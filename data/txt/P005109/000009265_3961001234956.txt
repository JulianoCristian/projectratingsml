MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TE.E PRESIDENT OF
THK IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE EGY)TIAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
FOR THE KUTREIMAT POWER PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Egyptian Electricity Authority for
US$220.0 million equivalent to help finance the Kureimat Power Project. The
proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years maturity,
includine a 5-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.  The
project would be cofinanced by the African Development Bank (US$350 million),
the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (US$125 million), the United
States Agency for International Development (US$193.8 million) and the
Government of Saudi Arabia (US$50 million) for a total amount of US$938.8
million equivalAnt. The Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) and the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) would contribute the remaining US$447.4
million equivalent of the financing plan.
2.          Background.  The Arab Republic of Egypt has the largest population
and the second largest economy (after Saudi Arabia) in the Middle East. The
annutal GDP growth rate was about 6 to 7 percent during FY83-85. Since then
the annual GDP growth rate declined to about 2 percent in FY91 and is
estimated to be about 1 percent in FY92. To stimulate growth, the Government
has recently embarked on an ambitious Economic Reform and Structural
Adjustment Program (ERSAP). Economic recovery is expected to be led by the
manufacturing and agricultural sectors, and an assured and reliable
electricity supply is essential to underwrite this economic growth. To meet
the growing demand for electricity and to replace about 750 MW of ageing
generating units, it is estimated that during FY92-99, EEA needs to install a
minimum additional capacity of about 4,400 MW: 4,000 MW in conventiona'
thermal plants; 300 MW in combined cycle plants; and 100 KW in hydropower
plants.
3.          Issues in the Energy Seccor.  The main issues in the energy sector
are: (i) energy pricing; (ii) the financial health of the petroleum and power
subsector institutions; and (iii) the need for energy conservation, a
reduction in line losses and the introduction of load management systems.
Despite substantial price increases of energy products in current terms during
the last seven years (ranging from 400 to 500 percent), the weighted average
petroleum products price (including the price of bulk natural gas) remains at
64 percent of the internationally traded equivalent, and the weighted average
electricity tariff is about 59 percent of the tariff based on long-run
marginal costs (LRMC).  As agreed under the &AL approved by the Board in June
1991, the Government intends to adjust the weighted average domestic prices of
petroleum products and natural gas to reflect their internationally traded
equivalents and to adjust electricity prices to cover long-run marginal costs
(LRMC) by June 1995. For petroleum products, the Government intends to adjust
nominal petroleum prices by June 1992, to reach 67 percent target of
international prices. Further, the Government agreed that the weighted
average price as a percentage of international equivalents will be increased
by an additional 11 percentage points by May of each following year (1992-1995
inclusive). The price increase applied to bulk natural gas supply will be



-2-
equivalent to that for domestic fuel oil prices, For electricity prices, the
Government agreed that the weighted average price as a percentage of LRNC will
be increased by about 10 percentage points at least annually to move the
pr'.ces already announced for May 1991 (59 percent of LRNC) to 100 percent by
June 1995. During 1991, the Government has taken all necessary actions to
increase energy prices as agreed under the SAL.
4.          The energy pricing actions already taken and as envisaged would,
in turn, assist the institutions responsible for the petroleum and power
subsector improve their financial health. Further, the rationalization of
energy prices wouild induce energy users to focus their attention on energy
conservation. EEA has made significant progress in energy conservation by;
(a) reducing the average fuel consumption per kWh generated in its thermal
power stations from 345 gms/kWh in FY82 to 254 gms/kWh in FY91; and
(b) reducing the transmission line losses from about 10 percent in FY82 to
7 percent in FY91 by installing line loss reduction equipment.  The proposed
project would assist EEA in its energy conservation efforts.
5.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The Bank
group has been involved in four projects in the power subsector. The main
lessons that have been learned are that: (a) it is unrealistic to use project
lending to achieve energy pricing reforms, as such reforms have broad cross-
sectoral impact; (b) financial performance targets and operational
methodologi.as for calculating these targets should be clearly defined; and
(c) the activities of different contractors at the project site should be
closely coordinated to avoid disputes and implementation delays. These
lessons have been taken into account in designing the proposed project and
pursuing the ernergy price adjustments under the SAL.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's continued Involvement
in the power subsector is important to: (i) support the Government in its
resolve to increase, by FY95, the weighted average electricity prices to
reflect LRMC-based tariffs; (ii) ensure rational investments in the power
subsector; (iii) help the Government mobilize foreign financial resources for
power subsector development through effective cofinancing; and (iv) ensure the
effective institutional development of EEA, which is essential for a reliable
and efficient supply of electricity in Egypt. The Bank's country assistance
strategy gives high priority to lending in the energy sector as the sector's
development is crucial to improving both the balance of payments and GDP
growth.
7.          Project Origi- and Objectives.  The project idea of a coal-fired
power station was developed in a feasibility study carried out in 1985 when
oil prices were high. The fall in oil prices in 1986 and the restricted
availability of natural gas for power generation prompted the revision of the
feasibility study in 1989. The revised study, which compared the costs of
installing fuel oil, natural gas, coal and combined-cycle power station at
each of the five potential sites, recommended the installation of a dual fuel-
fired (fuel oil and natural gas) thermal power station at Kureimat as the
lowest-cost solution to meet the expected demand for power in FY96/97. The
objectives of the proposed project are to assist EEA in: (a) alleviating



-3
power shortages and meetlng the growing demand for electricity; (b) improving
the efficiency and reliability of the EEA interconnected qystem; and
(c) strengthening the EEA financial position anc institutional capabilities.
8.          Project Descrigtion.  The project would consist of:  (i) the
supply and installation of a dual fuel-fired thermal power station at Kureimat
with a net installed capacity of 1,200 M4W (two units of 600 MW each); (ii) the
supply of material and equipment for about 162 km of a 20-inch diameter
natural gas pipeline interconnecting the power station with the gas grid;
(iii) the supply and installation of 500-kV and 220-kV transmission lines and
line loss reduction equipment to assist EEA in its efforts to reduce the line
losses to about 5.5 percent by FY99; (iv) the rehabilitation of the 220-kV/
66-kV Tanta substation, which is a part of the EEA interconnected system, to
improve the reliability of traismitting electric power to the load centers;
and (v) technical assistance to help EEA with engineering supervision at the
power station, to improve the operational and managerial skills of EEA staff
and to assist EEA in its energy conservation efforts. Schedule A gives the
estimated project cost and the financing plan. Schedule B gives details of
the project components, the summary of the proposed procurement arrangements
and the loan disbursement schedule. Schedule C presents a timetable of the
project's key processing events and a list of relevant PCRs and PPARs, and
Schedule D gives the status of the Bank group operations in Egypt.
9.          Prolect Im2lementation.  Except for the supply and erection of the
natural gas pipeline, for which EGPC would be the implementing agency, the
borrower, EEA, would be responsible for project implementation. To ensure the
timely completion and commissioning of the power station, engineering
consultants would assist EEA with supervision during preccnstruction and
during the construction of both the Kureimat power station and the 500-kV
transmission lines linking the power station with the electrical system. EGPC
and EEA have adequate experience in installing natural gas pipelines and
transmission lires, respectively, and, therefore, no engineering assistance to
EGPC or EEA is required for either activity.
10.         Proiect Sustainability.  EEA is a well-established institution
whose financial performance has gradually improved during the past six years.
The agreed rationalization of energy prices (para. 3) would help in
maintaining a satisfactory financial condition of EEA. Further, EEA has
adequate administrative experience in project implementation and in the
operation of power stations with 1,200 MW capacity. Accordingly, the project
is financially and administratively sustainable.
11.         Envtironmental Aspects.  The project falls under the environmental
screening category "A". The final Environmental Impact Assessment Report
(EIAR) was submitted by consultants in July 1991, after incorporating comments
from the Bank, USAID and EEA. The report and the recommendations of the
consultants, that the Kureimat site is environmentally acceptable for the
location of the dual fuel-fired power station, were found te be satisfactory
by the Bank.  No resettlement issue is involved regarding the land acquired
for the power station and the colony. Egyptian law requires that compensation
be determined according to the fair market value of private land to b-e



-4
acquired and that the amount so determined by the Egyptian Survey Authority
(ESA) be open for judicial review. Accordingly, EEA has deposited with ESA
the amount determined by LSA as necessary to compensate all 96 farmers for the
agricultural land acquired for che power station. ESA has issued a public
notification regarding the compensation on December 14, 1991 giving a period
of two months for receiving any objections for payment of compensation to the
96 farmers. Soon after cne expiry (on February 14, 1992) of the two-month
waiting period required by law to ensure that the compensation is paid to the
lawful occupiers of the land, ESA expects to complete the payments to the
farmers.  In addition, EEA has agreed to give preference to these farmers and
their children for emnloyment at the Kureimat site. Water reguirements for
the power station and the colony would be drawn from the river Nile. The
measures proposed for the discharge of circulating water and for the treatment
of wastewater prior to discharge in the Nile were found to be satisfactory and
would comply with the standards acceptable to the Government and the Bank.
According to the results of the dispersion model, ambient air quality would be
maintained within acceptable standards even under the worst-case scenario of
burning fuel oil to cover 100 percent of the fuel requirements for the power
station. Stack emission standards relating to nitrogen oxides (NO.) and
sulphur oxides (SO,) would be adequately met (while using.fuel oil available
in Egypt or only natural gas in the boilers) with an appropriate design for
the boilers. However, Particulate emission standards, acceptable to the Bank,
would not be met if fuel oil alone were used to cover 100 percent of the
requirements of the boilers. To comply with the Bank standard for particulate
(and after considering the variation of sulphur in fuel oil available in
Egypt), it has been agreed to incorporate a clause in the subsidiary loan
agreement to be signed by EEA with EGPC, requiring EGPC to supply natural gas
to the power station to cover at least 50 percent of the fuel requirement,
estimated at 3 million ma per day, for the lifetime of the power station. To
ensure that background pollution measurements are taken for at least one year
prior to the start of construction and to carry out environmental activities
during the operation of the power station, EEA has agreed to establish, by
December 31, 1992, an Environmental Monitoring Unit as an integral part of the
power station organization. Further, starting in October 1993, EEA agreed to
furnish to the Bank, for its review, semi-annual reports on the background
pollution data gathered at the power station site.
12.         Agreed Actions.  In addition to the agreements reached on the
environmental and project implementation issues (paras. 11 and 14), agreement
was reached on the financial covenants related to debt service and self-
financing ratios. It was also agreed, during negotiations, that the following
actions would be conditions of loan effectiveness: (i) the conversion by the
Government of about LE 1.14 billion of its debt, to ensure compliance with the
self-financing and debt-service covenants and, thereby, improve the financial
condition of EEA; and (ii) the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank, for the money on-lent by EEA to EGPC for the natural
gas pipeline component.
13.         Project Benefits.  Project benefits would include:  (i) an
increase in the efficiency and reliability of electricity generation, enabling
EEA to meet the future electricity demand in Egypt; (ii) an improvement in the



-5
reliability of the EEA interconnected system for transmitting electric po-*er
to the load centers; (iii) an improvement in EEA financial performance and,
consequently, facilitating EEA to generate adequate cash to Me3c the future
local -urrency requirements of its investment plan; and (iv, an improvement in
the operational and managerial skills of EEA staff.
14.         Justification and Risks.  The project, which forms an integral
part of the agreed least-cost EEA investment plan for FY92-99, is required to
meet tht demand for electricity in FvQ6/97.  The internal economic rate of
return (IERR) on the EEA investment 1..sn required to meet the electricity
demand for FY92-99 is about 10 percent. It only includes revenues due to
incremental electricity sales and is more an evaluation of adequacy of
electricity tariffs than the true economic worth of the investment plan since
the benefit difficult to quantify are excluded. The IERR is highly sensitive
to changes in the electricity tariffs and underscores the importance of the
Government carrying out the electricity price increases agreed under the SAL.
There are no major risks associated with the project. To reduce the risk of
project implementation delays, agreement was reached with EEA that it would
employ engineering consultants to assist EEA in procurement, installation and
commissioning activities related to the Kureimat power station. To ensure
that the environmental impact from the power station operation is within
acceptable limits, it has been agreed that: (a) EGPC would supply adequate
quantities of natural gas to the Kureimat power station to cover at least
50 percent of its fuel requirements for the lifetime of the power station
(para. 11); and (b) in the design of boilers, adequate space would be kept for
the installation of particulate collecting equipment such as electrostatic
precilitators to comply with environmental standards in case EGPC is unable to
supply the required quantities of natural gas. The risk of project cost
overruns is minimized since the project cost estimates (including price
contingencies) are spread over a period of eight years, even though a similar
project could be completed in five years. EEA is familiar with the technology
used in the project and has had a number of 300 MW units in operation in the
system since 1985. To ensure the smooth introduction of the first 600 KW unit
size in the EEA system, provisions would be made in the contract with
equipment suppliers to provide offshore and onshore training to the EEA staff
responsible for the operation of the power station.
15.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
