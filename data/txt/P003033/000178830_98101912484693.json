        phases: a four month establishment phase to set up the\n            implementation agency and a twenty month phase which would\n            include the following main components: (i) establishment of\n            a training and extension system for the Project area; (ii)\n            development of a cattle-breeding ranch; (iii) establishment\n            of supporting services and infrastructures for marketing and\n            agricultural credit; (iv) applied research and studies; and\n            (v) technical assistance for the Ministry of Planning. The\n            principal benefit of the Project would be institution\n            building. Because of the experimental nature of the Project,\n            no significant increase in agricultural production can be\n            expected in the short run. However, if successful, the\n            Project could lead to broad-based, comprehensive projects\n            for agricultural and livestock development in Kwango-Kwilu.\n            The institutional arrangements could be ultimately\n            replicated in other agricultural development projects in Zaire."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
