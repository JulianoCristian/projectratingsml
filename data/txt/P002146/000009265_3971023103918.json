Some of the lessons learned from the Project\n            are: (1) institutional deficiencies are the source of\n            National Electric Power Authority (NEPA's) technical\n            and financial problems and any project that attempts a\n            technical solution without a major institutional change that\n            guarantees autonomy in operations will produce results that\n            are not sustainable and waste scarce investment resources.\n            Therefore the priority for any follow on project should be a\n            restructuring that will allow the company to manage its\n            physical plant and financial resources efficiently and\n            provide reliable electricity service to its customers\n            according to sound international utility practice; (2) in\n            co-financing arrangements for power system rehabilitation\n            projects, or other projects which have components that are\n            not interdependent, conditionality that requires all\n            agreements to be in place before the project as a whole can\n            be counter productive. In the case of the Power VII Project,\n            the delay in the conclusion of one agreement caused a\n            year's delay in the entire project, and constrained the\n            project from taking the emergency actions for which it was\n            designed; and (3) for a state-owned power company in a very\n            weak technical and financial position, the partnership with\n            an experienced, efficiently managed utility should be\n            considered an investment in improved power system\n            performance in all areas."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
