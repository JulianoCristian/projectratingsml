World\n            Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory overall.\n            Specifically Bank supervision was unsatisfactory: Frequent\n            turnover of Bank staff handicapped continuity in\n            supervision, with six task team leaders over the life of the\n            project and frequent turnover of other supervision staff.\n            Insufficient time in the field by supervision staff was\n            another characteristic until late in the project, in part as\n            a result of the very difficult travel conditions in the\n            project area. Year-to-year variation in Bank supervision\n            budgets was also a factor during much of the period, and at\n            times no IDA staff were available to participate in field\n            visits, which were then conducted by the Swiss Agency for\n            Development Cooperation (SDC) alone. Overall performance was\n            initially quite weak (especially in financial management,\n            procurement, afforestation efforts, and social forestry\n            implementation) but steadily improved during the course of\n            the project, during the last few years operational\n            performance improved significantly, most notably at the\n            level of the project facilitation office, which has\n            developed a critical mass of technical and site management\n            skills which represent the core achievement of the project.\n            This also represents the major element of the project's\n            positive achievements with regard to sustainability and the\n            potential for wide replication of the methodology\n            demonstrated during the project. On this basis overall\n            borrower performance is rated Satisfactory, though other\n            aspects of borrower performance had significant\n            shortcomings. Lessons learned for each project component\n            involved: 1) lack of sector work; insufficient market/demand\n            analysis; the need for cost-sharing among beneficiaries in\n            infrastructure investments; and the consistent\n            overestimation by preparation teams of forest production\n            potential (forest management); and 2) too much time taken to\n            reach consensus on social forestry policies; the necessity\n            of developing a national grazing policy through a\n            consultative process; resort to central government approval\n            for community forests when decentralized approval is\n            allowed; loss of credibility among local communities when\n            the social forestry approach is not implemented in a timely\n            manner; and when providing free seedlings, private nurseries\n            may be inappropriate (social forestry); furthermore, 3) land\n            for reforestation is often subject to other uses by local\n            communities and therefore plantations have proven\n            unsustainable in the absence of meaningful involvement of\n            current users; 4) weak financial management skills should\n            have been addressed up-front; institutional development\n            specialists should have been included in the design team;\n            training investments should be based upon a sound needs\n            assessment, backed by a covenant to ensure compliance in the\n            credit agreement; and all training is consistent with an\n            established training program (subject to the project\n            agreement). Finally, 5) co-financing should be co-determined\n            for the project component(s); should provide a greater focus\n            on shared \"core concerns\" and exclusion of\n            \"non-core\" components (e.g.,\n            afforestation/reforestation); and should increase\n            effectiveness by providing a shorter project duration and\n            concrete intermediate targets (with consequences for non-fulfillment)."}, "docdt": "2003-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
