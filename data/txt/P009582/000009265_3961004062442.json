The principle project goals are to: (a) adopt\n            multiple-use management of forest lands; (b) involve local\n            people in managing the forest to meet their basic\n            requirements, as well as in increasing the level of economic\n            activity through social forestry practices; (c) rehabilitate\n            degraded forests to maintain their economic and\n            environmental benefits; and (d) improve the planning and\n            implementation capacity of government organizations. The\n            project consists of four components: (i) national forest\n            management involving the planning and management of selected\n            forests by the government; (ii) social forestry involving\n            rural communities in managing forest areas allocated to\n            them, and improving farm output by introducing tree planting\n            on private lands; (iii) afforestation/reforestation\n            involving rehabilitation of degraded forests on government\n            lands; and (iv) institutional strengthening including\n            support for improved planning and policy development,\n            training and capacity building of the Department of Forestry\n            (DOF) at the field as well as central level."}, "docdt": "1993-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
