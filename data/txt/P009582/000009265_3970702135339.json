Forestry III is an opportunity for the Royal\n            Government of Bhutan (RGOB), The World Bank (WB), and the\n            Swiss Development Corporation (SDC) to cooperate in\n            developing sustainable forestry alternatives for the Eastern\n            Zone of Bhutan.  It is particularly important that Forestry\n            III will begin to focus on the sustainable management of the\n            most threatened of Bhutan's forests: broadleaf forests\n            in subtropical, warm temperate and cool temperate climate regions."}, "docdt": "1992-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
