The revised PRSP has four strategic\n            pillars: a) accelerating broad-based growth; b) promoting\n            access to social services; c) increasing employment and\n            income-generating activities for the poor; and, d) promoting\n            good governance. As did the previous operations in the\n            series, PRSC-5 supports the PRSP implementation under three\n            components consistent with these four pillars: 1) growth and\n            employment creation; 2) human resource development; and, 3)\n            good governance. Under the growth and employment creation\n            component, the PRSC-5 supports reforms in the cotton, rural\n            sector, telecommunication sector, energy sector, and the\n            labor market. The objective is to lower factor costs,\n            increase productivity and favor new investments. The second\n            component includes policies in the education, health, social\n            protection, and water sectors to build infrastructure, lower\n            the cost of services, and improve service quality. The third\n            component encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget\n            formulation, execution, procurement, and control, public\n            sector performance, decentralization, and environmental\n            management. The proposed operation is an integral part o f\n            the Bank's strategy presented in the 2000 CAS, and\n            updated in the 2003 CAS progress report. However, risks for\n            the operation arise from the country's weak\n            institutional capacity, still fragile fiduciary progress,\n            natural disasters (drought, locust invasions), commodity\n            prices and currency shocks, and regional instability. The\n            different risks are mitigated under the credit through the\n            approval of two Bank projects to address the institutional\n            capacity issue; the integration in the reform program of key\n            fiduciary reforms; the approval of a project to help prevent\n            and fight locust invasion, and Bank readiness to provide\n            further financial support when needed; a strong track record\n            of the government in adapting to external shocks, through\n            adjustment of non-priority expenditure; an independent\n            monetary policy with a strong record of low inflation; the\n            willingness of the external community to deliver additional\n            credit as needed; and, regional initiatives to solve the\n            political crisis in Cote d'Ivoire."}, "docdt": "2005-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
