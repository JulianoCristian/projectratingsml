                          implementation under three components consistent with the four pillars o f the
                          PRSP: (i) growth and employment creation;                (ii)human resource
                          development; and (iii)    good governance. Under the growth and employment
                          creation component, PRSC-5 supports reforms in the cotton, rural sector,
                          telecommunication sector, energy sector, and the labor market. The objective
                          i s to lower factor costs, increase productivity and favor new investments. The
                          second component includes policies in the education, health, social
                          protection, and water sectors to build infkastructure, lower the cost o f
                          services, and improve service quality. The third component encompasses
                          policy measures to strengthen budget formulation, execution, procurement,
                          and control, public sector performance, decentralization, and environmental
                          management. The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's
                          strategy presented in the 2000 CAS and updated in the 2003 CAS progress
                          report.

Benefits                  The proposed operation would support the Government to pursue its policy
                          objectives laid out in the revisedPRSP and its accompanying Priority Action
                          Plan (PAP) within a structured macroeconomic framework by providing
                          sound financing for the execution o f the government's 2005 budget. It would
                          also provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and
                          institutional reform to strengthen the overall performance o f the economy and
                          contribute to poverty alleviation. Over the period 2004-2006, it i s expected
                          that the reform program under the series of three annual PRSCs (PRSC-4,
                          PRSC-5 and forthcoming PRSC-6) would help the government inachieving a
                          6 percent reduction o f poverty incidence, increase private sector participation
                          inthe cotton, telecommunication and energy sectors thus accelerating growth
                          through higher investment and improved competitiveness. It would also help
                          the government in making progress toward reaching some key MDGs,
                          namely, increase school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and
                          maternal mortality, increase access to safe water, and strengthen the

Risks              The risks for the operation arise from the country's weak institutional
                    capacity, still fragile fiduciary progress, natural disasters (drought, locust
                    invasions), commodity prices and currency shocks, and regional instability.
                   Risks for program implementation remain due to important capacity
                    constraints in conceiving, executing, monitoring, and evaluating government
                   programs, particularly decentralization and programs budgeting. Fiduciary
                    risks have been reduced significantly through reforms under previous PRSCs,
                    but some residual risk remains due to the limited capacity of ex-post control
                    agencies inverifying the application of laws and regulations governingpublic
                    expenditure, especially as regards procurement contracts. Burluna Faso's
                    vulnerability to external shocks, notably the fluctuation o f export and import
                    prices, or the drift in the exchange rate between the dollar and the Euro to
                    which the CFAF i s pegged at a fixed exchange rate, could undermine
                    macroeconomic growth and stability, and threaten the achievement of
                    program objectives. Regional instability i s related to the political crisis in
                    Cbte d'Ivoire where several hundred thousands o f BurkinabC live, and a
                    significant humanitarian, social and economic crisis i s possible if the political
                    situation then worsens. The different risks are mitigated under the credit
                    through the approval o f two Bank projects to address the institutional
                    capacity issue; the integration in the reform program o f key fiduciary
                    reforms; the approval o f a project to help prevent and fight locust invasion,
                    and Bank readiness to provide further financial support when needed; a
                    strong track record o f the government in adapting to external shocks through
                    adjustment of non-priority expenditure; an independent monetary policy with
                    a strong record o f low inflation; the willingness of the external community to
                    deliver additional credit as needed; and regional initiatives to solve the
                    political crisis inCbte d'Ivoire.

                                  I. INTRODUCTION

1.     This program document proposes a fifth Poverty Reduction Support Operation(PRSC-
5) for Burkina Faso, to be presentedto the Executive Board on April 28, 2005. PRSC-5 - for
a total amount o f US$60 million    - would be the second in a series o f three single-tranche
PRSCs that supports the implementation o f the revised full PRSP in 2004-2006. The new
PRSP, formally adopted by the Government o f Burkina Faso inNovember 2004, identifies the
framework for government policies during 2004-2006. The PRSP and its Joint Staff Advisory
Note (JSAN) are considered by the Executive Boardjointly with the PRSC-5.

2.     PRSC-5 focuses on key measures to attain the government's foremost objectives under
four PRSP pillars-accelerating       equitable growth; improving social service delivery;
increasing employment and income generating activities for the poor; and promoting good
govemance. These measures are organized under three components consistent with the four
PRSP pillars: growth and employment creation; human resource development; and good
govemance. PRSC-5 i s an integral part o f the March 2003 CAS progress report which updates
the 2000 CAS for an interim period o f 18 months ending in FY05. A new CAS to be
considered by the Executive Directors in June 2005 will define Bank support for the revised
PRSP duringFY06-09.



                               11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

3.      Burkina Faso i s a landlocked country o f about 12 million inhabitants with a narrow
natural resource base. Per capita income i s less than US$250 and social indicators compare
poorly to the average in Sub-Saharan Africa: in 2003 literacy rate was about 20 percent and
life expectancy at birth was 43 years, compared to, respectively, 35 percent and 46 years for
Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the 2003 household survey, poverty i s widespread with 46
percent o f the population below the national poverty line. Rural poverty accounts for 95
percent o f national poverty. In 2004, the sizeable fall in intemational cotton prices, high oil
prices, a locust invasion, and political instability in the neighboring Cote d'Ivoire were key
reminders o f Burkina's vulnerability to external shocks. Other recurrent external shocks
include rainfall conditions inthe Sahel zone and its adverse effects on agricultural production;
and lack o fpredictability o fdonor resources.

4.      Against the backdrop o f the difficult initial conditions and environment, Burkina Faso
has demonstrated great resilience and remarkable track record o f sound policy
implementation. The political environment in Burkina Faso has remained stable, and the
country has made considerable progress in macroeconomic stabilization under three
successive programs supported under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). A fourth PRGF is implementing well too. The growth rate o f gross domestic product
(GDP) has averaged 5.8 percent between 1994 and 2003, relative to population growth rate
which stood at about 2.5 percent. Burkina's economic growth remained strong in2004 at 4.8

percent.     Consequent to good fiscal discipline, Burkina managed to realize a stable
macroeconomic environment with low inflation. Burkina Faso was among the first countries
inSub Saharan Afnca to present a full PRSP in2000, and one ofthe few to have completed a
full revisedPRSP. Since 2000, there has been significant progress inimplementingthe PRSP,
as laid out inthree PRSP progress reports to date. Burkina i s also among the first countries to
reach the HIPC completion point. However, despite these gains and the track record, there
remain important challenges that need to be addressed so as to devise strategies that help to
attain long-term the MDGs.

5.      The year 2005 may test further the capacity o f the BurkinabC authorities. Presidential
elections are scheduled for November 2005. The incumbent President, in power since 1987
and previously elected in 1991 and 1998, i s expected to present himself for a new 5-year
term.'   Inaddition, the political situation in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire should be monitored
carefully as a key element o f Burkina's external environment in 2005. Lastly, developments
in the cotton sector and international oil prices are also expected to have key impact on
Burkina's development path in 2005. The country has been hit hard by a large decline in its
terms o f trade, and should the negative trend continue, government's ability to pursue PRSP
implementationwill be overwhelmed.

Growth and Prices

6.      Burkina Faso faced several extemal shocks in2004, which had an adverse effect on its
economic performance: a commodity price shock; natural disasters as a locust invasion and a
mild drought; regional instability and; a large appreciation of its currency against the U S
dollar. Prices o f cotton - Burkina's main export commodity - fell by about 30.0 percent in
2004, while oil prices rose by 31.0 percent during the same period. Developments in the
cotton and oil sectors are discussed inmore detail inannexes 8 and 9, respectively. The locust
invasion and a mild drought also took a toll on the agriculture sector which was stagnant in
2004, after increasing by 10.7 percent in2003.

7.      The protracted political and economic crisis in neighboring CBte d'Ivoire continues to
strain the Burkinabe economy through frequent cut off o f the supply lines, higher
transportation costs, loss o f markets, and lower workers remittances. In September 2004,
renewed tensions in CBte d'Ivoire temporarily halted power supply to Bobo Dioulasso, the
second largest city of Burkina Faso. Importing power from Cdte d'Ivoire is the main element
of the government strategy for reducing electricity costs in Burkina, and the latter
development underlined Burkina's vulnerability to its extemal environment.                          Lastly, the
CFAF, the local currency, appreciated by about 7.1 percent, compounding the domestic
impact of downward trend ininternational cotton prices. Table 1 summarizes the main impact
of these adverse shocks on growth and key prices.

8.       Real GDP grew by 4.8 percent in 2004, in contrast to the initial projection o f 5.3
percent. The relatively muted impact o f extemal adverse shocks i s due to several factors.
First, most o fthe shocks occurred inthe second half o f the year and their impact will take full
effect only in2005. Second, since the first outbreak o f the crisis inCote d'Ivoire inlate 2002,
Burkina Faso has made several adjustments: liberalizing transports; opening up new markets
and new supply lines in Togo, Ghana and Benin. Third, cotton production reached a record
level o f 540 thousand tons following the producers' production decision on the basis o f
favorable price announcement made in the first quarter 2004, before the collapse o f
international prices. The secondary sector and the services sector (transport) benefited from a
strong demand resulting from the exceptional cereal production (+17 percent) and cotton
production (+23 percent) in late 2003. These two sectors grew at the rates o f 6.9 percent and
6.8 percent, respectively.

9.       Inflation measured by changes in the consumer price index was -0.8 percent, which
was realized as a result o f several factors: prudent fiscal and monetary policies, the decline in
food prices following the record cereal harvest in the end o f 2003, and the appreciation o f the
currency against the dollar which lowered the prices o f dollar-priced imported goods.          The
low inflation level helped Burkina Faso to mitigate the impact on the real effective exchange
rate o f the appreciation o f the CFAF against the U S dollar. The CFAF appreciated by 7.1
percent against the dollar in 2004, and by about 30 percent since 2002, but the REER
appreciated at a lower pace. Despite unfavorable effects on the external sectors, overall
Burkina was still able to maintain most o f the competitiveness gained with the devaluation o f
the CFAF in 1994. As a result o fthe large swings ininternational cotton and oil prices, terms
o f trade deteriorated by 2.7 percent, in contrast to initially projected improvement o f 4.3
percent.

FiscalDevelopment

10.      The 2004 budget was executed broadly in line with the financial program agreed with
the IMF2as the fiscal impact of the adverse external shocks remained relatively limited. In
September 2004, the parliament adopted a supplementary budget to take into account
spending related to the organization o f international summits and major investments in the
infrastructure and transport sectors including the purchase o f a new presidential plane. The
total additional spending was financed by a reduction in other expenditure items, excluding

basic education, health and agriculture sectors. The Government received additional grant
financing that offset a lower than expected domestic financing. The remaining gap o f CFAF3
billion in the 2004 financial program was covered by an accumulation o f commitments not
paid: in late 2004, the Government increased commitments on priority capital projects linked
to the HIPC debt relief. The slow pace o f project execution led to a lower than programmed
reduction intreasury commitments (CFAF8 billion instead o f CFAFl1 billion).

ExternalDevelopments

11.     The increase in exports, including cotton exports (from 4.8 percent o f GDP in 2003 to
6.0 percent of GDP in2004), was partially offset byhigher import growth, comprising the rise
in oil imports (fkom 3.1 percent to 3.8 percent o f GDP). The balance of services also
deteriorated because o f higher transportation cost following the disruption o fthe Cote d'Ivoire

                                                         - 4 -

supply lines and the opening of longer and more expensive routes to Togo, Ghana and Benin.
As a result, the current account deficit (excluding grants) slightly deteriorated from 11.O
percent o f GDP in2003 to 11.6 percent o f GDP in2004. Foreign financing as a share o f GDP
has remained stable, resulting in an overall surplus o f 0.4 percent o f GDP in 2004, down from
1.0 percent o f GDP in 2003.          Nevertheless Burkina was still able to contribute to the
accumulation o f internationalreserves at the BCEAO (the regional Central Bank).

Monetary Developments.

12.     Burkina Faso i s a member o f the Zone Franc and monetary policy i s implementedby a
regional Central Bank consistent with the peg to the Euro. Prudent monetary policies have
resulted in a good record o f low inflation, including -0.8 percent in 2004. Money supply
increased by 8.5 percent 3 in2004 as a result o f an increase o f 2.0 percent innet foreign assets
and o f 6.5 percent in net domestic assets. The latter was mostly driven by an increase of the
credit to the private sector, reflecting the strong economic growth in 2003 and 2004, notably
the rise o f crop credits as a result o f recordcottonproduction.


POVERTY     DYNAMICS

13.     On the basis o f a comparable welfare indicator, Burkina Faso experienced a substantial
reduction inpoverty, without significant changes ininequality, between 1998 and 2003 (Table
3 below). This i s in line with output growth as well as non-monetary poverty indicators, such
as literacy rates and health indicators.     The poverty headcount went down from an estimated
54.6 percent in 1998 to 46.4 percent in 2003, and both the poverty gap and its severity
declined. The reduction in poverty was more pronounced in rural areas, where the headcount
fell from 61.1 percent in 1998 to 52.4 percent in2003. The reduction o fpoverty inurban areas
was substantially smaller, and not statistically significant. Inequality remained unchanged
between the two surveys (Gini Index o f 0.444), and was systematically higher inurban (0.484)
than in rural areas (0.376). The findings as regards the variation inpoverty hold for a broad
range o fplausible poverty lines, as evidenced by stochastic dominance tests.

14.     The results above differ from past official accounts o f poverty trends inBurkina Faso.
Main sources for measuring the level o f poverty inBurkina Faso are the three priority surveys
conducted in 1994, 1998, and 2003. As for other countries, Burkina Faso has improved the
design o f these surveys over time, and placed efforts in generating an improved poverty
profile based on the most recent and reliable information. However, apparently innocuous
changes in survey design, such as the change inthe recall period, has triggered substantial and
spurious changes inreported consumption, and has ledto issues o f comparability. Inaddition,
the change inthe timing o fthe survey has had a substantial impact on poverty trends giventhe
large differences inconsumption inthe lean (pre-harvest) and the post-harvest seasons.

15.     Inorder to lay the foundation for consistent analysis of the poverty dynamics, World
Bank staff worked with the Burkinab6 authorities to review the comparability o f survey
features and construct a comparable aggregate o f household consumption for 1998 and 2003
to measure changes in poverty over time. The construction o f comparable welfare measures
for evaluating poverty dynamics, taking into account the changes in survey design, i s


 Changes in monetary aggregates are measured as annual changes inpercent o f stock o f M2 of 12 months earlier

presented in detail in a Poverty Assessment report4.                               The Poverty Assessment report
summarizes the normative choices made in constructing the comparable welfare indicator and
presents the rationale for these choices. Similar conclusions on poverty dyanmics were found
in a country case study on Burkina Faso as part of the "Operationalising Pro-Poor Growth
(OPPG)" work program, a joint initiative o f AFD, MBZ, GTZ, KfW, DFID and the World
Bank. The latter study estimates that poverty headcount has declined from 61.8 percent to 47.2
percent between 1998 and 2003.

MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                         OUTLOOK


Growth and Prices Outlook

16.     Major determinants o f the economic outcome in 2005 are international cotton and oil
prices. Current indications are that low cotton prices along with highoil prices may cause the
terms o f trade to fall by 11.6 percent in 2005. This will mark a significant decline inthe terms
of trade since 2002. This i s a significant external adverse shock as the total cost o f the terms
of trade deterioration in 2005 alone would be equivalent to more than [2] percent o f GDP. In
addition, the pass through o f international cotton prices into domestic producer prices could
result ina disaffection o f cotton growers and a collapse o f cotton productionwith trickle down
effects on the secondary and services (transport) beyond the year 2005. On the basis o f the
aforementioned breakdown, the originally projected real growth rate of 5.3 percent in 2005
has beenreviseddownward bythe authorities to 3.5 percent.

17.     Inflation i s projected to rise in 2005 because o f the inflationary pressures from higher
oil prices and a rebound in food prices after the decline which resulted from a record cereal
production at end-2003. However, with the maintenance o f sound fiscal policy, price increase
will remain modest at 1.8 percent, consistent with the inflation in the Euro zone. The low

inflation will limit the appreciation o f the real effective exchange rate despite a further
appreciation o f the CFAF against the US dollar. Nevertheless, ifthe slide in the exchange rate
with the U S dollar continues, the decline in competitiveness will hamper growth prospects in
the tradable sector and may discourage potential investors.

18.     Sustaining high growth rates in the medium-term will crucially depend on raising
productivity and investment rates. Intheir draft PRSP for 2004-06, the authorities target more
than 6 percent growth in 2004-06 to significantly reduce income poverty inthe medium term.
However, these growth rates will be difficult to attain without significant increases in
productivity, especially in the rural sector, and will require higher private sector investment
rates. Recently, growth in the primary sector has been driven to a large extent by the
expansion o f agricultural surfaces in light o f improved rainfall, as exemplified by the
development o f cotton production that resulted predominantly from larger surface areas.
These growth rates cannot be sustained over time unless they are accompanied by
mechanization and higher fertilizer use to increase productivity and maintain soil fertility.
Overall, the economy would need to generate higher investment rates to accelerate growth,
and given the already high share o f government investment, these higher rates would need to
come from more private investment activity.


2005 BudgetandFinancingRequirements

19.     The National Assembly approved the 2005 budget in December 2004. Overall, the
budget reflects the priorities o f the PRSP and respects the MTEF allocations for PRSP priority
sectors. Budget allocations for key ministries such as basic education, health, agriculture and
infrastructure, match or exceed those in the base case o f the MTEF. The budget includes
appropriations for increased subsidies to SONABEL because o f higher oil prices and
subsidies, for butane and lamp oil, and for fertilizers in the cotton sector to offset higher
transportation cost. It does not include any support to the price mechanism in the cotton
sector.

20.     Residual financing requirements o f CFAF89.8 billion for 2005 (Table 4) would be
covered by the proposed fifth PRSC (CFAF30.1 billion), disbursements under the IMF's
PRGF(CFAF8.6 billion), and program support byother multilateral andbilateral donors for a
total o f CFAF49.9 billion, including the European Union (EU), the African Development
Bank (AfDB), France, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.

3.       External and Monetary Projections

21.      The trade deficit i s expected to widen on account o f higher oil costs and declining
export revenues for cotton after the fall in international prices. After taking into account the
grants and the balance o f services and income, the current account deficit may also widen
fiom a surplus o f 0.4 percent of GDP in2004 to a deficit o f 2.9 percent o f GDP in 2005. The
current account deficit would be fully financed by foreign disbursements, debt reliefunder the
HIPC Initiative, private capital inflows, and by drawing down international reserves. Money
supply will increase by 4.5 percent, in line with increase in the nominal GDP. Credit to the
private sector will expand twice as fast as credit to the government.


4.       External Debt Indicators After HIPC Debt Relief

22.      Burkina Faso reached its completion point under the original and enhanced HIPC
Initiatives in July 2000 and March 2002 respectively and was accorded expected to receive
debt relief o f US$195 million and US$229 million inNPV terms respectively. An additional
US$129 million in NPV terms was approved as topping up assistance at the second
completion point. Creditors holding 76 percent o f Burkina Faso's debt have started to provide
enhanced HIPC relief. Of seven non-Paris Club creditors, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have


                                                             - 8 -

    agreed to provide debt relief in amounts lower than envisaged under the HIPC Initiative.
    ECOWAS has indicated that it will not provide its share o f assistance. Financing assurances
    for topping up have been obtained from the World Bank, the IMF, the AfDB, BADEA,
    BOAD, the IsDB,the OPEC Fund, the EU, and Paris Club creditors.

    23.       At end-2004 the updated NPV o f debt-to exports ratio increased to 207 percent,
    relative to 150 percent at end-2001, above the level o f 192.5 percent projected at the time o f
    completion point. The increase i s mainly due to higher world interest reference rates, the
    depreciation o f the U S dollar against the Euro, and the incidence o f the extensive fall in
    intemational cotton prices. During the discussions for the review o f the PRGF in November
    2004, the authorities stress the increased difficulty o f reaching the MDG goals while relyng
    on budget restraint alone to offset the impact o f these exogenous adverse shocks on the debt
    profile. The extemal vulnerability and the narrow resource base imply that Burkina Faso will
    depend on considerable extemal assistance for the foreseeable future.         Grant or highly
    concessional financing will ensure that Burkina Faso's debt levels will remain sustainable but,
    given the limits to intemational assistance in the long term, it will be important that this
    support i s used to lay the foundation for long-term economic development, including
    expanding the export base.

    Adequacy of the macroeconomic framework

     24.      The macroeconomic framework i s adequate for the purposes of the proposed PRSC 5.
     This assessment is based on the solid track record o f growth and low inflation. Real GDP
     growth increased to more than 5 percent on average during 2003-2004, up from 4.7 percent
     duringthe 1996-2002 period and 3.5 percent per year duringthe 1990-95 period. Inflationwas
    kept below 3 percent in the past several years. Fiscal policy improved generally, with the
     overall fiscal deficit contained at a level consistent with existing flows o f concessional
     financing. The Government has systematically protected priority spending when resources
     level were inadequate. Monetary policy i s being implemented by a supranational Central
    Bank. As explained above, Burkina's extemal debt i s expected to be sustainable over the
    mediumterm.

    under a SDR24.08 million (about US$35.5 million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
     (PRGF) arrangement, the IMFnoted that macroeconomicmanagement remains strong and the
     authorities have established a good basis for coping with the extemal shocks that emerged
    during the second half of the year 2004. The three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on
    June 11, 2003, by the Executive Board o f the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF) to support

the government's economic reform program for 2003-06. The first review was successfully
completed on March 19, 2004. Since 1993, Burkina Faso has satisfactorily implemented four
PRGF-supported programs associated with the conduct o f sound macroeconomic policies and
significant structural reforms.



                      111.   BURKINA FASO'S SECOND FULL PRSP

26.     The revised PRSP was adopted by the government o f Burkina Faso in November
2004. It builds on the achievements under the first PRSP, and further improves the quality o f
the poverty reduction strategy by strengthening the participatory base, introducing a regional
dimension, and designing a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system that addresses the
issues identified in the first PRSP. The logical framework o f the revised PRSP, including a
description o f the policies and programs to be implemented in 2004-2006, i s presented in
annex 2. The revised PRSP, its accompanying Priority Action Plan (PAP), the 2004 PRSP
progress report prepared by the authorities, and a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) prepared
by the staff o f the IMF and the Bank are presented to the Executive Directors inparallel with
the proposed PRSC-5. The JSAN presents in more detail the strengths o f the revised PRSP,
and outlines the steps and policy directions needed to help the authorities address gaps in the
poverty strategy.


THESTRATEGY

27.     The second PRSP builds on the same four pillars as the original PRSP: (i)accelerate
equitable growth; (ii)  ensure that the poor have access to basic social services; (iii)   expand
opportunities for employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and (iv) promote
good governance. Under the first pillar, government's program i s to ensure macroeconomic
stability, increase the competitiveness o fthe economy and reduce factor costs, provide support
to productive sectors and accelerate development in rural areas where the majority o f poor
live. Under the second pillar, government aims at improving the access and quality o f
education, health and nutrition, potable water and sanitation, housing and social protection.
Under the third pillar, public programs will seek to reduce the vulnerability o f agricultural
activities, modernize agriculture, provide support to producers' organizations, increase and
diversify rural income, and open up rural areas. Under the fourth pillar, governance issues
would be tackled along four dimensions: political, administrative, and economic and
decentralization. The proposedoperation will support the implementation o f all four pillars.

28.     The new PRSP expands the number o f priority sectors which now include - in
addition to health, education, and rural development which were listed in the first PRSP -
food security, access to potable water, HIV/AIDS, environment, development o f small and
mediumenterprises and industries, including small-scale mining, security, and ICT programs.
The expanded list o f priority sectors - a result o f the large consultations duringthe revision o f
the PRSP - poses new challenges for the financing of the strategy and the government's
capacity to implement it.

PRSPIMPLEMENTATIONIN2003-2004

29,     The fourth PRSP progress report provides a comprehensive assessment o f PRSP
outcomes in 2003-2004. Overall, the PRSP implementation has remained satisfactory in
Burkina Faso as illustrated by the 8 percent reduction o f poverty headcount in2003 compared
to 1998.

30.     Under the first and third PRSP pillars (creating the conditions for sustained growth
and employment opportunities), the government has maintained a stable macroeconomic
environment and has implemented reforms to improve the investment climate. In2003, both
inflation and growth targets were reached. Real GDP growth was 8.0 percent, compared to a
PRSP target o f 6.5 percent, and inflation was 2.0 percent, within the PRSP ceiling o f 3
percent. In2004, real GDP growth was short of the PRSP target (4.8 percent instead o f 6.0
percent) but the achievement i s commendable given the sharp decline inthe terms o f trade for
Burkina. Inflation in2004 was -0.8 percent. The cotton sector was opened to private investors
in 2004. The sector of the retail distribution of petroleum was opened to two new operators,
and it has become more competitive. The government liquidated seven public enterprises in
2003. It reduced the delay to process payment o f services and goods delivered by the private
sector from 75 days in2001 to 48 days in2003.

31.     In the education sector, the implementation of the ten-year basic education
development plan (PDDEB) has allowed the training of 5,000 teachers and the hiringo f 2,550
for the school year 2003/2004. The government continued to implement the mechanism to
subsidize school supplies in the 20 provinces with the lowest school enrolment rates. It also
continued to waive school fees for girls. However, there were delays in some areas, notably in
school construction and the transfer o f responsibilities o f hiring teachers to the decentralized
levels (region). The objective of the PDDEB to build about 2,300 classroom each year was not
achieved in2002/2003 (1000 classrooms) and in2003/2004 (2000 classrooms).

32.     With regard to health, after a worsening trend inthe 1990s, most key health indicators
improved from 1999 to 2003, as did most service coverage indicators. Use o f key preventative
and curative services increased, including child vaccination coverage (BCG 72% to 81% ,and
DTCP3 from 41% to 57%), antenatal care (CPN2 from 55% to 64%), and average number o f
new contacts per year (0.21 in 2000 to 0.32 in 2003). The percentage o f men using condoms
during their most recent high-risk sexual contact increased from 59% to 69% from 1999 to
2003, and the HIV prevalence rate among young women (aged 15-24) attending urban
antenatal clinics declined from 3.9% in 2001 to 1.9% in 2003. But child malnutrition has not
improved despite the apparent decline in rural poverty. While malnutrition has multiple
causes, and improvements in nutrition indicators can lag per capita income improvements,
furtheranalysis is necessaryto better understandtrends andpropose appropriate interventions.

33.     Infant and under-five mortality rates decreased during the 1998-2003 period, in part
due to increased coverage of primary health services. This i s a particularly important trend
reversal for infant and under-five mortality rates, which had deteriorated between 1993 and
1998.5 In 2003, the infant mortality rate reached 83, and the under-five mortality rate 184
deaths per 1,000 live births. Nonetheless, despite these decreases, infant and child mortality


 DHS and official statistics differ starkly inabsolute mortality rates butbothshowthe same trend.
                                                       -11 -

rates remain among the highest in the world, and are higher than for the average o f low-
income countries. This reversal alone and a continuation o f the current trend would likely not
be sufficient to meet the mortality MDGsby 2015. Significant improvements have also been
made in increasingthe supply o f drinking water, and almost 70 percent o f the populationhave
now access to safe water, compared to 42 percent in 1998, puttingBurkina Faso on track for
the respective MDG.

decentralization o f public services. The PER (FY04) shows that priority spending has risen
under the PRSP and priority sectors have been protected to a much larger extent than in the
past from budget cuts. Treasury accounts balances are now available on a monthly basis, and
the budget execution reports through 2003 have been evaluated by the Supreme Audit Court
and the National Assembly. In addition to public expenditure reforms, the government
reinforced governance aspects by establishing a High Authority for the Coordination o f the
Fightagainst Corruptionin2002 that became operationalin2003.

LINKTOCAS

35.     The proposed PRSC-5 i s part o f the base case lending scenario o f the March 2003
CAS Progress Report (CAS-PR). The CAS-PR assesses the progress made in implementing
the PRSP and the FYO1-03 CAS6, and confirms that the strategy set out inthe latter remains
appropriate, while proposing an extension o f this strategy for the next 12-18 months to cover
the period until the PRSP i s updated and a new CAS i s prepared. The central objective o f the
CAS and its progress report i s to support the Government's efforts to achieve sustained high
growth rates, to reduce the high incidence o f income poverty, and to improve the nutrition,
health, and education o f rural inhabitants, the poorest segment o f the population. More
predominantly, the CAS seeks to help the Government reduce the poverty headcount ratio by
at least 2 percentage points per year during 2000-2005, focusing on the four strategic areas
specified in the PRSP: (i)accelerating broad-based growth; (ii)           ensuring that the poor have
access to basic social services; (iii)    increasing employment and income-generating activities
for the poor; and (iv) promoting good governance. Overall, the progress achieved on
implementingthe CAS and the CAS-PR has been satisfactory'. PRSC-5 i s also fully aligned
with the new CAS that will bereviewedbythe Executive Directors inJune 2005, and that will
provide support to the PRSP implementation inFY06-09.


COLLABORATIONWITHTHE IMFAND OTHER DONORS


Collaborationwith the IMF

36.     IDA partnership with the IMF in Burkina Faso's development strategy has been
excellent over the past few years. The Bank and Fund Boards endorsed the PRSP in June
2000, as well as the first (December 2001), second (November 2002), and third (March 2004)
annual progress reports. Bank and IMF staff executed joint work on HIPC, PER, CFAA and
the PRSP. IDA and IMF staffs have continued to carry out joint missions at least twice a year
for macroeconomic policy dialogue with the Government. The effectiveness o f the policy
changes under the PRSCs presumes that the macroeconomic situation remains consistent with
the medium-term macroeconomic program articulated in the PRSP. Parts o f the PRSP,
especially those with significant macroeconomic implications are incorporated in a parallel
Poverty Reductionand Growth Facility (PRGF).

37.     The Bank used the analytical work, developed by the IMF's Africa Technical
Assistance Center (AFRITAC), to define some o f the measures under the PRSCs, pertaining
to the monitoring o f external assistance. The IMF has relied on the Bank experts inthe areas
of privatization o f the energy and telecommunications sectors and removal o f administrative
obstacles to the creation o f enterprises and private investment. IMF and Bank staffs have
worked jointly in the cotton sector, with IMF staff focusing on the impact of the sector on
government finances and the banking sector, while Bank staff took the lead on the sector's
structural reform agendaunder the series o f PRSCs.

Bank-FundCollaborationin Specific Areas

38.     Cotton sector and energy sector. The Bank and Fund staffs jointly follow
developments in the cotton sector because o f its importance for macroeconomic aggregates
and rural incomes. The Fund staff focuses on the overall financial management o f the cotton
sector in order to limit spillover effects for government finances and the banking sector. The
Bank i s supporting the government's structural reform agenda in the sector under a series o f
PRSCs. These reforms aim at creating a more competitive environment for the sector. Inthat
context, two private operators have signed concession agreements in 2004 and have began
operations. The cotton sector reform i s safeguarding the historical achievements o f a prudent
financial management and the involvement o f producer organizations in decision-making
processes, including the setting o fproducer prices.

39.     Public finance management and good governance. The Bank and the Fundclosely
collaborate insupporting the government's reforms inthe areas o fpublic finance management
and good governance. Important elements o f the reform program are enshrined in the
government's own action plan for the improvement o f budget management and incorporate
the main recommendations o f the HIPC Assessment and Action Plan preparedjointly byBank
and Fund staff. Recently, the Bank's PRSC focused on the creation and operationalization o f
the Auditor General Office, resumption o f regular submissions o f budget audit laws to the
Auditor General Office and the National Assembly, and revisions o f procurement laws and
regulations. The Bank's PRSC i s also supporting extensions of the computerized expenditure
circuit to deconcentrate budget execution and, together with sector-specific projects, i s
assisting with the preparation for the political decentralization. The PRGF-supportedprogram
included measures to ensure the effectiveness o f the Auditor General Office, and the Fundhas
given technical assistance in the area o f tax and customs administration. Both the Bank and
Fund staffs have followed jointly the government's anticorruption policies, including the
creation o f the HighAuthority to Fight Corruption. The Fundis focusing its support under the
PRGF on tax administration and tax reform issues while the Bank i s supporting expenditure
management andcontrol reform under the PRSCs.


Collaborationwith Other Donors

40.     Burkina Faso enjoys broad donor support, primarily due to its political stability and a
solid track record o f strong policy performance. A large number o f bilateral and multilateral
aid agencies and a significant number o f local and international NGOs provide aid flows
estimated at 13 percent o f GDP (about the same as government revenue). In the past few
years, some 90 percent o f annual public investment program was externally financed. To
improve the coordination o f aid, the government and the donors initiated a conditionality
reform exercise in 1997. This was intended to help build a consensus on a common set o f
performance indicators to be used as a basis for decisions regardingdisbursement o f financial
assistance, preferably inthe form o f budget support. As an outcome o f this exercise, as well
as a series o f follow-up donor meetings, donors agreed to provide more support through
budgetary assistance and to better streamline their operations around the PRSP. The PRSCs
have been part o f that concerted effort to provide a larger part o f assistance through
programmatic support with a view to enhance ownership and reinforce the country's capacity.



                                               - 14-

41.     The update o f the PRSP in late 2003 allowed the govemment to give further impetus
to the coordination o f donor support by deepening the policy content o f the strategy and
strengthening the evaluation and monitoring framework to achieve common buy-in from all
donors. In particular, the updated PRSP is accompanied by a Priority Action Plan, a set o f
measures and results indicators providing a unique framework to assess progress made in
implementing policies and achieving results. InJune 2004, the Government took the lead and
established a task force to formally define the relationship between the emerging enhanced
budget support group and the government in the context o f a revised memorandum o f
understanding (MOU).

42.     The revised MOU was signed in January 2005 by the Government, the Bank, the
A h c a n Development Bank and all former members o f the SBC-CSLP group. The framework
i s centered on the government's priority action plan (PAP) that accompanies the revised
PRSP. All donors providing budget support will draw their disbursement criteria from the
PAP measures and indicators as well as the assessment o fthe adequacy o f the macroeconomic
framework.     The new framework overcomes the previous conflict between policy-based
disbursement criteria used by the World Bank and the African Development Bank and
indicator-based criteria used by bilateral donors by placing them under a unique and coherent
framework. The proposed PRSC-5 i s aligned with the revised donor harmonization
framework. The new MOUi s presented in annex 7.


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

43.      The linkages to other Bank operations are discussed in the description o f the policy
areas for this proposed operation. In summary, the CAS and the CAS-PR recognized the
PRSCs as the main instrument o f the Bank for providing support to the implementation o f the
PRSP, but they also stated that complementarity o f efforts between programmatic support and
investment lendingwas key to making efficient use o f Bank resources. As an illustration, in
the education sector, the PRSC i s the primary instrument for the discussion o f the national
education budget and its link with the PRSP as well as long-term priorities, while the Bank-
financed Basic Education Project targets investment and capacity building for the ten-year
basic education development plan.       Thus, the investment project lays the foundation for
increasing the resource flow through the budget in the latter part o f the ten-year plan. In the
health sector, the PRSCs have become the main instrument for the health policy dialogue with
the authorities, with the expectation that that the funds provided under the PRSC could serve
as an effective substitute for the continuation o f the performance based contracting o f health
districts under the closed IDA Health andNutritionProject.


LESSONS    LEARNED

Lessons from the Implementation o f the First Series o f PRSCs

44.      The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) o f the first series o f three annual
PRSCs was prepared inDecember 20048. The ICR observed that the PRSC series has greatly
reinforced the importance of the budget and the country's own engagement in the success o f
govemment policies. The PRSCs have steadily strengthened the focus on the budget as the

  BurkinaFaso.ImplementationCompletionReport ofPRSC-3.ReportNo. 30330-BUR. December 29,2004.

                                              - 15 -

main instrument for PRSP implementation and have clarified the government's own role in
defining a programmatic agenda to achieve its objectives. The importance o f the MTEF in
formulating the government's budget has grown substantially. Moreover, expenditure systems
were expanded and controls were reinforced. Inthe social sectors, the PRSCs have resulted in
a process o f reorientation to program budgets to translate priorities expressed in long-term
sectoral programs into budgetary allocations. PRSCs also successfully supported a number o f
cross-cutting reforms. These reforms included the application o f deconcentration policies in '
budget and personnel management, which are part o f the policies to improve social service
delivery. Inthe cotton sector, the opening o f two zones for private investors involved several
ministerial departments in setting up the new regulatory framework and defining the roles o f
the new and old stakeholders.

45.     Despite these achievements, the ICR noted that a number o f challenges remain for the
PRSC instrument. In particular, a further reinforcement o f capacity is necessary to underpin
the move to program budgets and ensure that the latter are closely aligned with the executed
administrative budget and fully integrated in the evaluation and monitoring mechanism o f
each ministry's planning department.

46.     Other challenges - discussed below - are reflected in the design o f PRSC-5, notably
the continuous emphasis on growth and employment creation, the improvement o f PRSC-
related sectoral dialogue through the development o f sectoral MTEF for the health and
education sectors for 2005-2007 (a trigger for the proposed operation in the case o f health
sector), and alignment with the budget cycle as disbursement under PRSC-5 i s planned at
around the government's mid-fiscal year. Furthermore the Bank is addressing the issue o f
capacity and shortcomings in the M&E system by adopting and implementing companion
projects o f statistical capacity building and public sector capacity building. Lastly, the
proposed operation and future PRSCs will operate within the unified framework budgetary
support, an assurance for greater harmonization and reduced transaction costs.

47.     Stimulating growth. The PRSC series has addressed issues regardingservice delivery
and public sector performance. However, Burkina Faso faces difficulties in attracting private
investment as a result o f low skill levels and high costs o f production factors. The growth
agenda o f the PRSP should therefore be an additional important area for support under future
PRSCs. The shift of emphasis has started with PRSC-4, and is being pursued under the
proposed operation.

48.     Improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue. There i s currently no specific
sectoral investment operation in the health sector (except for the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS
project) and initially the ownership o f the PRSC-supported reform program by the Ministryo f
Health was weak. The transition from project to programmatic support was difficult because
of the required changes in instruments and the new focus on the budget. The Bank's PRSC
team, with the health experts taking the lead, has attempted to advance the dialogue through
greater involvement in health sector budget discussions, in particular the design o f program
budgets. In particular, the preparation o f a MTEF for the health sector in line with the
Government's health development plan (PNDS) and the MDGs - a trigger for this proposed
operation -was fulfilled.




                                              - 16-

49.     Aligning budget support with the budget cycle. The time necessary for policy
implementation and complicated government credit approval procedures have hampered the
alignment o f the first series o fthree annual PRSCs with the budget cycle. The implementation
o f reform measures under the first series o f PRSCs took about 12 months and all credits were
approved inthe months of July-August. As a result o f time-consuming approval procedures on
the side o f the government, they were often not disburseduntil October-November, toward the
end o f the government's budget year. Bank resources have hence not beenable to alleviate the
beginning-of-year cash shortages that are constraining investment spending. The Government
and Bank staffs have already taken corrective measures and PRSC-4 was approved in May
and disbursed in July. The proposed PRSC-5 will follow a similar timetable closer to the
budgetcycle and PRSP implementation.

50.     Reinforcing capacity. The capacity o f the administration to formulate and execute
programs remains weak. The preparation and implementation o f program budgets can only
advance further ifthe capacity of the civil service is improved. Inthis respect, the Bank has
prepared a PER in fiscal year 2004 to give guidance for further improvements in the budget
process, especially as regards program budgets. Inthe area o f public sector management, the
Bank approved a capacity building project in fiscal year 2005 to accompany and complement
future PRSCs. The project aims at giving technical assistance for capacity assessment,
establishing a work program, streamlining public administration, modernizing personnel
management, enhancing the poverty focus o f expenditure, and strengthening policy
formulation. In the statistical area, the Bank finances a statistical capacity building credit
(STATCAF').

51.      Improving the link between policy actions and the monitoring and evaluation
framework. The link between PRSC measures and the PRSP impact indicators was at times
tenuous as a result o f certain weaknesses o f the 2000 PRSP, which did not include a matrix o f
policy actions and only contained a narrow set o f indicators. In preparing the revised full
PRSP, the government undertook a substantial body o f work as part o f the UNDP-financed
Poverty Observatory (ONAPAD) to improve PRSP indicators. ONAPAD's enhanced
indicator list was discussed with the donor community and was a first step for establishing the
monitoring framework o f the revised PRSP. With the revised PRSP, the government
integrated objectives and government policies by preparing a Priority Action Plan, a matrix o f
costed policy actions and intermediate outputs that are linked with PRSP outcome and impact
indicators. In addition, the PAP i s expected to adjust to any potential changes in the strategy
and priority deemed necessary in the APR, thus ensuring coherence between policy actions
and the M&E framework. The recently adopted capacity building project will also give the
means to reinforce the capacity of planning directorates (DEP) to evaluate policy outcomes
and make more effective use of available poverty statistics and result indicators under the
PRSP process.

52.      Staying the course. The move from project-aid to budgetary support i s a major
transition. It i s important to recognize the magnitude o f these changes and time should be
given to government and donors to adapt to this environment. Budget support undoubtedly
constitutes a desirable mode o f extemal assistance, but patience i s required as the necessary
adjustments are being made for greater effectiveness. Government should increase
accountability and transparency inpublic resources management. Donors must also accept that
the government i s inthe driver seat, which implies some loss o f control.
                                               - 17-

53.    Improving inter-ministerial coordination. The quality of program coordination at
the central level was adversely affected by the split o f the previous Ministry o f Finances,
Budget, Economy and Development, into two separate ministries. As a first step to improve
coordination, PRSCs implementation should be monitored by a committee including high
level representatives o f the Ministry o f Finances and Budget, the Ministry o f Economy and
Development, and Ministries and public institutions under the sectoral coverage o f the
PRSCs.


ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

54.     The PRSP process and the series o f PRSCs continue to benefit from a variety o f
analytical work. Several analytical reports were completed in FYOl-FY03, including sectoral
public expenditure reviews (infrastructure, rural development); household surveys; a
participatory poverty assessment; a competitiveness and economic growth report; a Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR); a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA); ajoint Bank-IMF H P C Accountability Assessment and Action Plan (AAP);a study
on health personnel incentives; and studies on electricity sector reform. This series o f
analyticalwork has been instrumental inthe design o f PRSP and the PRSCs. For instance, the
Government has successfully used the comprehensive analysis o f shortcomings o f public
expenditure management systems in these reports to design its own detailed action plan to
improve budget management (PRGB). The PRGB, adopted by the Council o f Ministers in
July 2002, lays out key measures, a timetable for their implementation and performance
indicators. Implementation o f the PRGB i s a key element o f the recently agreed Unified
Framework for budget support.

55.     The Bank has also continued its technical assistance in macroeconomic modeling in
2003-05, in collaboration with the German technical assistance agency (GTZ). Several
members o f the Burkinabk PRSP team were trained in using the model PAMS. To support
the process o f revising the PRSP, a Bank team usedthe model PAMS to undertake economic
simulations to assess the links between macroeconomic policies and poverty levels and
evaluate the impact of different growth paths on poverty levels. The Government will use the
tool in the future to analyze the consequences o f different policy actions on growth and
poverty reduction.

56.    Recently completed works include a public expenditure review (FY04); a poverty
assessment (FY05); a risk and vulnerability assessment (FY04); an investment climate study
by FIAS (FY04); a pro-poor growth study (FY05); a gender assessment (FY04), a Health and
Demographic Survey (FY05). In addition, the Bank and the IMF worked jointly with the IMF
to update the Accountability Assessment and Action Plan (AAP)on the tracking of poverty
expenditure under the Heavily IndebtedPoor Country (HPC) Initiative was prepared (FY05).

57.    A new country procurement assessment report (CPAR) is plannedinFY05. A country
economic memorandum (CEM) and an Integrated Framework study are scheduled in FY06.
On the request o f the Government o f Burkina Faso, the World Bank i s also conducting a labor
market study in2005-06. The main purpose o f the study i s to deepen the understanding o f the
causes and consequences o f poor employment performance in Burkina Faso, with particular
attention to the linkages between policy, growth, job creation and poverty reduction. The
study to be conducted by Burkinabe and Bank teams would help the Government revise its
existing employment strategy by placing employment at the heart o fthe fight against poverty.



     V.       THE PROPOSEDPOVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION

PRSC-5 DESCRIPTION

Rationalefor and Objectives

58.    The proposed poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-5) i s the second in a series
of three annual operations supporting the implementation o f the revised PRSP in 2004-2006
in Burkina Faso, in line with the Bank's 2000 CAS and the 2003 CAS progress report.
Achievements under the previous PRSCs are positive as illustrated by an 8 percent reduction
of poverty incidence between 1998 and 2003. In addition, the newly revised PRSP builds on
the achievements o f the first PRSP while improving the latter on several dimensions: it i s
grounded on a stronger participatory basis, has a more effective M&E system, and benefits
from improved donor coordination through the adoption o f an unified budget support
framework.

59.    PRSC-5 will support PRSP objectives o f : (i) growth and equity in a stable
                                                        raising
macroeconomic environment, to reduce the incidence o f poverty; (ii) increasing access to and
quality o f basic social services; (iii)
                                       improving employment and income opportunities for the
poor; and (iv) improving govemance with a particular emphasis on public sector management
and budget management reforms.


Scope

60.    The proposed PRSC-5 has three components consistent with the four PRSP objectives:
(i)growth and employment creation; (ii)human resource development; and (iii)good
govemance.

61.    Under the growth and employment creation component, the proposed operation
supports reforms inthe rural, telecommunication, and energy sectors as well as on investment

                                             - 20 -

climate (labor market, regulatory framework) to lower factor costs, increase productivity and
favor new investments.

62.    The second component includes policies in the education, health, social protection and
water infrastructure, to lower the cost o f services, increase access, improve service quality,
and reinforce monitoring and evaluation.

63.    The third component encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget formulation,
budget execution, procurement, budget management and ex-post control, public sector reform
and decentralization, and environmental management.

64.    Annex 3 presents the medium term objectives o f PRSC-5, the policy actions to be
undertaken, and the monitoring and evaluation framework, comprised o f the base year
indicators, the benchmarks, and a description o f the various institutions in charge o f
implementing the M&E system. Annex 4 presents the measures implemented under the
PRSC-5 framework. Table 7 below summarizes the status o f the prior actions for PRSC-5.
Overall, Burkina has maintained a strong pace in reforms even if the progress was partial on
two triggers. In addition to measures agreed under PRSC-5, it is worth mentioning that the
unmet trigger o f PRSC-4 as regards to the implementation o f governorates was fulfilled in
August 2004.


Benefits

65.    The proposed operation would support the Government to pursue its policy objectives
laid out in the revised PRSP and its accompanying Priority Action Plan (PAP) within a
structured macroeconomic framework by providing sound financing for the execution o f the
government's 2005 budget. It would also provide the incentives to implement key economic,
social and institutional reform to strengthen the overall performance o f the economy and
contribute to poverty alleviation. Over the period 2004-2006, it i s expected that the reform
program under the series of three annual PRSCs (PRSC-4, PRSC-5 and forthcoming PRSC-6)
would help the government in achieving a 6 percentage points reduction o f poverty incidence,
and increase private sector participation in the cotton, telecommunication and energy sectors
thus accelerating growth through higher investment and improved competitiveness. It would
also help the government in making progress toward reaching the MDGs, namely, increase
school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to
safe water, and strengthen the sustainability o f development efforts.

PolicyAreas

66.     The policies supported by PRSC-5 and their implementation status are described in
annex 4 under the following headings: (i)growth and employment creation; (ii)human
resource development; and (iii)  good governance.


1.      Growth and EmploymentCreation

67.     The Government has realized that accelerating economic growth i s critical for poverty
reduction. In2001, it commissioned a comprehensive study o f competitiveness and long-term
sources o f growth in Burkina Faso that identified several major constraints to growth
including: (i)weak infrastructure, high input costs; and (iii)the limited size o f the formal
private sector. The PRSC-5 supports key policies aiming at reducing constraints for growth
and investment and promoting employment creation, notably in rural areas. With a view to
make progress toward income-poverty MDGs, these measures would help to direct some o f
the growing income to rural areas and support new investment inurban and semi-urban areas.

a.      Cotton Sector

Description

68.     The cotton sector in Burkina Faso encompasses about 200,000 producers, and i s a
major source o f income for about 17 percent o f the population. Cotton production increased
sharply during the last five years, from 276 thousands tons in 2000101 to over 560 thousands
tons in 2004/05. The sector now represents about 6 percent o f GDP and 60 to 70 percent o f
exports earnings.  I




Challenges

69.     A higher impact ofthe cotton sector on growth andpoverty reduction is constrained by
several issues including the extreme volatility and declining trend o f international cotton price
and issues related to land availability andpoor soil fertility.

70.     Cotton prices are volatile, creating uncertainties for producers, ginners, merchants,
financial institutions and governments. The volatility i s due to many factors, ranging from
weather changes in cotton producing regions to government policies.           Subsidies paid to
producers in the US, Europe and China increase global supply and depress cotton prices.
Adjusted for inflation, cotton prices have declined steadily and they collapsed in 2001/02 to
their lowest level ever. The elimination o f these subsidies would allow producers inWest and
Central Afkica to better use their comparative advantage, promote growth, and reduce poverty.

71.     To mitigate the impact of price volatility, cotton stakeholders have established a two-
stage mechanism for the determination o f seed cotton producer paid. First, a base price i s
announced before planting. The base price i s relatively stable: in the revised multi-year
agreement between the ginning companies and the producers, it i s set at CFAF175 until
2007/2008. Second, this base price is supplemented by a bonus equivalent to 50 percent o f the
netprofits -ifany-o fthe previous agricultural campaign.


                                              - 24 -

72.     Another challenge for the cotton sector i s land availability and soil fertility. The recent
increase inproduction was driven mostly by the expansion o f surfaces as yields remain stable
at about 1 ton o f seed cotton per hectare, and this may not be sustainable. There are concerns
that in some regions, this extensive mode o f production has contributed to soil.degradation to
the point they are no longer suitable for agncultural production. Inseveral other regions, the
expansion o f surfaces may not be possible other than on marginal lands with poor fertility.

Government Actions

73.     The Government o f Burkina Faso has supported the development o f cotton sector by
allowing a private management and the participation o f farmers, promoting liberalization and
providing targeted support to increase yields.

74.     The Government i s a shareholder in SOFITEX         - the previous monopoly until the
liberalization in 2004  - but has allowed the company to be privately managed. As a result,
SOFITEX has maintained a prudent management and a rational commercial policy, balancing
the use o f spot sales and term contracts, and keeping production costs low. SOFITEX was
able to well manage the impact o f the sharp decline in cotton prices since mid-2001, and has
not needed public subsidies in the past few years. SOFITEX has also made considerable
efforts to improve the quality o f inputs and intensify agricultural extension services, resulting
inahighquality ofraw cotton. In2001, the InternationalCottonAdvisory Committee (ICAC)
ranked Burkina Faso 4th worldwide as regards quality o f cotton fiber, with more than 80
percent o f the production corresponding to the highest standard. In early 1999, the
Government transferred 30 percent o f the shares o f SOFITEX to UNPCB, the producer
organization, thus becoming a minority shareholder (35 percent), along with DAGRIS               - a
French company - (34 percent), and a commercial bank (1percent).

75.     The Government o f Burkina Faso has also promoted increased liberalization in the
cotton sector. Since 2004, two new private ginning companies, SOCOMA and FASOCOTON
are active alongside with SOFITEX. The liberalization o f transport services has also ledto the
entry o f more efficient private transporters, including foreigners, and the diversification o f
supply and export routes. The fertilizer market was also liberalized with about ten competing
companies. The Government has been encouraging the use o f fertilizers      -  to prevent a decline
inyields -  byproviding limited subsidies inthe range o fCFAF2-3 billion.

Bank's Assessment and Recommendation

76.     Policies spearheaded by the Government o f Burkina Faso have been instrumental in
transforming the country into a leader in cotton production in Sub-Saharan Africa.               To
consolidate progress, these policies should be pursued, notably the liberalization o f the sector,
the participation of producers in the management o f the sector, a prudent pricing mechanism
for seed cotton and increased productivity.

77.     The liberalization o f the cotton sector should be strengthened by putting in place the
right incentives to foster the efficiency of cotton companies, and minimize costs. This could
be achieved by eliminating the monopoly o f one company that supplies 80 percent of the
market and expanding the scope for competition between the three existing companies. As a
result, public competitive bidding has not resulted in low fertilizers price. The pesticides


                                              - 25 -

segment i s also controlled by a monopoly. Reforms are still needed in that area to promote
more efficiency and reduce costs. Existing national or regional antitrust policies should be
usedto investigate possible collusionpractices.

78.    Farmers participation in the cotton sector management, a unique arrangement in the
sub-region, has helped to improve the overall efficiency o f the sector. However, there i s
considerable scope for increasing the effectiveness of farmers participation by strengthening
their capacity. In addition, the participation of producers in the capital of the new ginning
companies i s yet to be finalized. Financing should be identified for UNPCB to acquire its
shares in SOCOMA (20 percent) and FASOCOTON (10 percent).

79.     Cotton stakeholders need to maintain a prudent pricing mechanism for seed cotton. A
key element for that i s that the base price should not be guaranteed and should not be set at a
level inconsistent with trends in international cotton prices and exchange rates between the
Euro and the dollar.

80.     A more intensive production scheme should be encouraged as an alternative to the
expansion o f surfaces. Yields could be improved by a more efficient fertilizers and pesticides
markets, the adoption o f new technology, mechanization, new varieties o f cotton, and the
possibility o f small-scale irrigation.

Measures supported by the proposed PRSC-5

81.     PRSC-5 has supported the liberalization o f the cotton sector through the transfer of the
assets o f SOFITEX inthe central and eastern zone to two new private companies. The transfer
was finalized in September 2004. Subsequent PRSCs will support the creation o f a new inter-
professional association for the cotton sector as well as the definition o f the regulatory
framework governing the sector. In that context, a series o f analytical work and thematic
reports are underway that will provide inputs indesigningthe policy agenda for the next series
o f PRSCs.

a.      AgricultureSector

Description
82.     Agriculture remains the dominant sector o f economic activity in Burkina Faso,
accounting for about 30 percent of GDP, providing employment and income to more than 80
percent o f the rural population, and generating 60 to 70 percent o f export earnings. Faster
agriculture growth will have several beneficial effects: on poverty reduction: through an
increase inrural producers' incomes; improved trade balance through higher exports earnings
and reduced food imports; improved equity because agriculture i s the main income source for
food-crop producers, the poorest group inBurkina Faso, and more than 90 percent o f the poor
live inrural areas; on overall economic growth through positive externalities andspillovers on
non-farm sectors andjobs (transport, trade, food industries etc). Box 1 o f this report outlines
the findings o f a report on operationalizing pro-poor growth strategy in Burkina Faso,
emphasizing the keyrole for the agriculture sector.

Challenges



                                              - 26 -

83.      In the revised full PRSP (PRSP-2), including Box 6, the Government discusses the
determinant of poverty in rural areas o f Burkina Faso, focusing on the constraints to stronger
agriculture growth:

84.      Water resources are scarce. Rainfall i s low and irregular and poses a serious risk for
farmers. Analysis o frainfall over the last thirty years shows that the trend has been downward
at many weather stations. Rainfall i s often unevenly spread over successive years or in the
course o f a single rainy season. This situation pushes them to adopt extensive farming
techniques that contribute to soil depletion. In addition, PRSP-2 notes a report on water
resources that stresses the lowering o f the water table and the danger o f intensive use o f
groundwater. The difficulties o f water management have hindered the development o f
irrigated agricultural, severely limitingpossibility o f crop diversification;


85.      Human capital development i s low and production methods are archaic. The high
illiteracy rate inrural areas hinders efforts to disseminate new technologies. The proportion o f
farms with plows and draft animals i s under 27 percent. The low level o f mechanization
contributes to the low level o f net per capita income per hectare. Experiences in few villages
have shown than yields per hectare when animal traction i s provided by a pair o f oxen are
nearly twice as highas with manual tilling.

86.      Lnfi-astructures and support services (transport, storage, processing, marketing, and
agricultural extensions) are inadequate, and inputs costs are high. The weak network o f
passable rural roads, especially during the rainy season, poses a major constraint for the
development o f commercialized, modern agriculture, given the importance o f timely
deliveries o f seeds and fertilizers. A study on facilitating trade o f agricultural products, carried
out in 1999 by Logistics Consulting Group o f Denmark, indicated that the share o f transit cost
inCIF cost price rangedfrom 25 percent to 88 percent for main agriculturalproducts. Therate
o f fertilizer i s low, with an average of 9 kglhectare versus more than 50 kghectare in LDCs
and 100Kghectare inAsian countries.

87.       Soil fertility i s becoming a serious issue. According to PRSP-2, population pressures
have shortened fallow periods which are no longer adequate to ensure renewal o f soil fertility.
PRSP-2 also notes that signs o f land degradation and soil depletion are very visible in the
north and central regions, and there are pockets o f fairly severe land degradation in the west
and southwest regions (including the cotton areas), where most o f the country's agricultural
land reserves are located. In severely degraded areas, the combination o f soil depletion,
poverty, and food insecurity i s creating a vicious cycle.

88.      Rural farmers are not well integrated to markets. A reason i s that the great majority o f
farmers engages in subsistence farming and grows very few cash crops. Therefore, they sell
little agricultural produce (only 15 percent o f the grain crop i s commercialized) and purchase
little fertilizer and agricultural equipment. However, PRSP-2 also indicates that producing
surplus requires the existence o f markets for such surplus and accessto these markets (roads).
PRSP-2 points to the strong price fluctuations within and between years for agricultural
products as evidence of imperfect markets. PRSP-2 and Box 1 o f this report suggest that a
price stabilization mechanism could support the development o f crop production. The JSAN



                                                 - 27 -

of PRSP-2 warns on such suggestions and encourages the development o f efficient MIS
(market information system).

89.     Land access is limited and the security of land tenure is poor. The land institutional
framework i s deficient and there i s virtually no rural land register, leading to problem o f land
ownerships rights. PRSP-2 indicates that growing population, domestic migration and
increase o f livestock herds are exacerbating the competition for land with frequent conflicts
and insecurity o f land tenure. Despite existing laws, including the Agrarian and Land Tenure
Reorganization, access to land for poor and women i s still a distant hope.

90.     Gender bias limit women access to land, production equipment, productive assets,
financing and extension services. Women are less educated and have a heavy workload that
prevents them to develop their own productive activities.

Government Actions
91.     Government programs to ensure sustainable rural development are based on more
intense cropping, protection o f natural resources, and correction o f gender inequalities. These
programs - described in PRSP-2 - focus on seven strategic goals: (i)reducing the
vulnerability o f agricultural activity, (ii) intensive and more modem farming, (iii)
                                           more                                            raising
and diversifying rural incomes, (iv) reducing the isolation o f rural areas, (v) supporting
producer associations and collective infrastructures, (vi) improving living and working
conditions for rural women.

Bank's assessment and recommendation

92.     The Government's strategy to pursue the divestiture o f productive and marketing
activities, while strengthening its role in providing support and advice to private operators
(extension, research and development, information on market conditions) and undertaking
efforts to develop sector-related infrastructure (transport, water etc) and improve the quality o f
human resources (basic education, technical andcommercial extension) addresses issues that
are relevant (see JSAN o f PRSP-2).

93.     Burkina Faso can realize substantial gains with respect to growth in productivity and
agricultural output by reducing transport costs and improving services, by implementingwater
management and irrigation techniques, bybetter educating the labor force.

94.     Government's strategy to support professionalization o f the agricultural sector through
a legal fi-amework conducive to the emergence o f agricultural professional organization based
on an approach that involves the participation o f producer representatives seems also
adequate.

Measures to be undertaken as part o f the PRSCs and overall Bank support

95.     PRSC-5 is complementing several Bank-financed investment projects for agriculture
development. The ongoing Community Based Rural Development Project aims at reducing
poverty and promoting sustainable development inrural areas. It builds local capacity to plan
and implement rural development projects, accelerating the pace o f public transfers for
decentralized rural development,         and supporting implementation o f the country's

                                               - 28 -

decentralization framework. The Second National Agricultural Services Development Project
that closed inDecember 2004 provided assistance to: (i)agricultural and farmers' incomes; (ii)
improved natural resource management; and (iii) promotion and empowering o f farmers'
                                                    the
organizations. The Private Imgation LIL supports provision o f the demand-driven services
necessary for the development o f an efficient, sustainable small irrigation subsector inBurkina
Faso.

96.     The GEF Partnership for Natural Ecosystem Management Project focuses on
providing support to rural communities in protected areas which have demonstrated
commitment and willingness to engage in large-scale conservation. It aims to strengthen the
capacity o f these communities, the foredwildlife administration and the private sector to
generate revenues from conservation activities. The GEF Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem
Management focuses on the conservation and efficient use o f natural assets across the entire
rural domain. It provides support to strengthen rural communities' capacity in assessing,
planning and managing their natural resources and local development, and empower them for
decision making and dialogue with Government and other partners.

97.     A Rural Intensification and Market Diversification Project currently under preparation
will focus on improving the rural sector commodities' productivity and competitiveness on
local regional and international markets, promoting efficient supply chains, capacity building
to professional organizations and private operators, and improving rural financial and market
institutions. The objectives o f the ongoing Transport Sector Project include lowering transport
costs and improving mobility for the rural population. The project concentrates on rural roads
as the rural economy i s the main source o f income and employment for 80 percent o f the
population

98.      Under PRSC-5, the Government has prepared a text consolidating and
harmonizing the principles and rules of the execution of missions transferred or
delegated to regionalagricultural chambers (CAR), producers professionalorganizations
(OPA), the inter-professions, and the private sector, including the modalities and
conditions for such as transfer:the new text aims limitingthe State to supervisory functions
and transfer other functions to other stakeholders inthe sector. The text clarifies the roles and
responsibilities for agricultural development. It i s expected that the larger role o f producers
will improve the economic performance o fthe sector.

99.      The Government has finalized the institutional audit of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Water, and Fisheries (MAHRH): The implementation o f the audit
recommendations will help improve the efficiency and quality o f basic services o f the
Ministry.

100.     The Government has continued the implement actions plans for cereals: The
action plans aims at creating favorable conditions for improving the profitability o f cereals
production, a key element for food security, poverty reduction (cereal i s grown by the poorest
producers), and for agricultural diversification.

101.    In the next PRSCs, starting with PRSC-6, the Government will follow up on the
measures undertaken during PRSC-5, and will adopt new measures to enhance growth
prospects inthe rural sector. The measures that are envisioned include:

                                              - 29 -

102.    Adopt the texts on the principles and rules on the execution of missions
transferred or delegated to CRA, OPA, inter-professions, and the private sector.

103.    Reduce vulnerability of agricultural activity through the building of manure pits
and hydro-agricultural installations. A joint study by the Ministry for the Environment and
the Center for Economic and Social Research and Documentation (CEDES) at the
University of Ouagadougou has shown that soil restoration and fertilization with stone
cordons and organic manure has a positive impact on agricultural productivity. Organic
manure i s also more accessible to the poor than chemical fertilizers. Future PRSCs will also
support ongoing government programs on small irrigation systems and rural water systems.

104.    Improve access to rural areas through the building of rural roads and the
maintenance of departmental roads:

105.    Elaborate an action plan to implement the recommendations of the institutional
audit of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Fisheries (MAHRH), in consultations
with stakeholders, including the private sector, and begin its implementation.

106.    Implement action plans for cereals, cowpeas, and oilseed. Specific actions are the
definition o f standards and labels for oilseeds products (sesame, cashew nut, shea) and
cowpeas streams.


107.     Support the emergence of professional exporters within the Oilseed Council of
Burkina Faso and the actors of the cowpeas streams.


108.    Begin implementation of an action plan for fruits and vegetables:

C.      Livestock Sector

Description
109.    The livestock sector represents about 12percent o fthe GDP and slightly more than 10
percent o f exports earnings. Livestock provides incomes (partially or totally) for 86 percent o f
the population. The most vulnerable producers and socioeconomic groups o f the sector
represent the largest contributors to the sector. Smallholders are producing about 95% o f total
meet production, 95% of total milk and 60% o f eggs. It is also among these smallholders
groups that the highest potentialities for improvement are found.               Financially and
economically, the sector i s performing well both on local market and on export. Indirect
contribution includes exports o f hides and skins, food industry, animal traction and organic
fertilizers for the agricultural sector. The sector has the potential to play a major role in the
diversification o fthe economy, exports growth, food security and poverty reduction.

Challenges

110.    Despite its relatively good performance, the livestock sector i s facing a number o f
issues among which the more important are: (i)a deteriorating security in access and
sustainable use of pastoral resources and increased difficulties for pastoralists to access

                                              - 30 -

agriculture land; (ii)inequities and difficulties in accessing feed and inputs; (iii)a
preoccupying animal health situation and a high risk o f emergence o f major epizootic and
zoonotic diseases despite recent improvements; (iv) a lack o f genetic resources management;
(v) a lack o f public sector capacity in providing an attractive environment and in adapting to
new challenges and priorities such as poverty reduction, decentralization and private sector
development; (vi) a weak structure, organization and capacity o f an associative sector; (vii) a
lack o f appropriate mechanism to prevent, and efficiently manage, external shocks such as
animal diseases or pests (locust), droughts, or economic breakdown.

111. Projections are showing an increasing gap between domestic demand and supply in
animal products. Growing urbanization and rising per capita incomes, with a target o f 4
percent annual growth, has lead to stronger domestic demand, coming on top o f export
demand. Supply has not coped well with the rising demand, and live cattle exports have
declined steadily since 1995, despite the rise in market prices observed in neighboring CBte
d'Ivoire and Ghana. The average carcass weights stand at 110 kg for cattle, 9 kg for sheep,
and 8 kg for goats. Average milk yield stands at 110 liters per 180-day lactation and per cow.
These performances are lower than the potential performances and lower than the possibilities
for improvements. Closing the supply gap will require: increased productivity per hectare
(extensive system) or per animal (intensive system) through improved nutrition, improved
breed and animal diseases control. In addition to the quantity issues, o f equal importance are
the food safety aspects for both domestic and export market (sub-regional, regional and , in
the longer-term, international) with the required condition, for the latter, to comply with the
sanitary and phytosanitary standards o f WTO based on OIE (live animals) and Codex
Alimentarius (Animal products) recommendations.

112.    An important gap is also predictable at the level of the pastoral resources availability.
Increased difficulties on resource access together with good marketing prospect will
undoubtedly act as a catalyst for hrther intensification, but will also have, if no appropriate
measures are taken, collateral impacts such as: (i)increased severity o f poverty among
vulnerable groups (mainly pastoralists and short-cycle species producers, shepherds, women
and children, small actors o f marketing chains); (ii)reduction o f the comparative advantages
o f locally produced animal products; (iii)    increased sanitary risks; (iv) increased natural
resources degradation.

Government Actions

113.    Government's specific strategy for the livestock sector i s described inthe PAPISE - a
national framework for livestock action plan and investment programs prepared by the
Ministry on Animal Resources in2000 - and inthe revised full PRSP. The Government has
set the following objectives to stimulate development o f the livestock sector and produce
maximum socioeconomic benefits: (i)      increasing productivity by emphasizing improvements
in genetics, feeding, healthcare, and rational herdmanagement for each species (ii)   achieving
substantial growth o f livestock production by adapting to the agricultural and ecological areas
and promoting choices with regard to these areas and production systems that are appropriate
to resources; (iii)improving and controlling the quality and wholesomeness o f animal
products and products o f animal origin sold on markets; (iv) developing mixed farming
through optimum management o f natural resources and an increase inanimal and plant yields;


                                              - 31 -

(v) promoting professional skills o f players through greater support for training and the
establishment o fbreeders' associations, particularly for women.

114.    Recent activities implemented by the authorities have aimed at reducing the
vulnerability o f livestock raising: (i)a center for African swine fever was established in the
province o f Kompienga; (ii) percent o f cows were vaccinated against contagious bovine
                                23
pleuropneumonia; (iii)   5 percent o fpoultry were vaccinated against avianpseudoplague; (iv) 8
new cattle raising zones and pasture areas covering more than 200,000 hectares were
instituted.In2003, with a view to improving planning o fproduction activities, the Ministryo f
Animal Resources undertook the second national livestock survey (ENEC 11).

Bank's Assessment and Recommendations

115.    The PAPISE was not well integrated into the 2000 PRSP and as a result did not
generate interest among major donors. In addition, the PAPISE did not include key aspects,
notably: (i)  a description of the current and potential contribution o f the sector to poverty
reduction; (ii) a description of the current and potential access to market for animal and their
products; (iii) the economic performance, the competitiveness and the perspective for growth
for the main livestock streams;(iv) the access to, and sustainable management of, pastoral
resources; and (v) the respective roles and functions o f the public, associative and private
actors o f the sector

116.    While the PAPISE was experiencing these issues, the Bank was actively promoting
what i s now L i v e (African LIVEstock, a regional multi-stakeholders partnership on the
livestock sector in Sub-Saharan Africa)           and had just completed in Mauritania a
comprehensive livestock study with a new approach, the IEPC (French acronym for 'Initiative
Elevage-Pauvretk-Croissance') - a highly participative and comprehensive livestock study -
that was attracting interest from both the Government o f Mauritania (the study
recommendations were integrated into the PRSP and in various national policies and
strategies) and Donors (EU and GTZ used the findings and recommendations o f the study to
finance their investments). This i s inthat context that the MRA requested in2002 the support
from the Bank for the implementation o f an IEPC inBurkina Faso.

117.    The IEPC - now completed        - recommends to focus on seven major priorities: (i)
assure a sustainable growth of locally produced animal products with a priority to be given to
short-cycle species, small-scale milk production and to production systems less consumer o f
space, having positive impact on increasing off take; (ii) secure animals nutritional needs; (iii)
secure sustainable access to resources including access to agricultural land for pastoralist; (iv)
preserve and improve competitiveness o f products and marketing chains; (v) assure sanitary,
safety and marketing quality o f animal products and inputs; (vi) protect household and
vulnerable socioeconomic groups against majors risks and the risk o f having their
vulnerabilities increased; and (vii) assure to producers and others actors o f the sector an
efficient delivery of services coherent with the objective o f poverty reduction. In fact, the
preparation o f the revised full PRSP (PRSP-2) benefited from the findings of IEPC

118.    Considering the current dynamics, individual potentialities, and the social and
economic perspectives of the different production systems, the action planproposes activities
organized around six components targeting the following specific objectives: (i)   strengthening

                                              - 32 -

o f the public services capacity; (ii)strengthening o f the associative and private services
delivery; (iii)improvement o f the social and economic environment; (iv) improvement o f the
access to financial services (credit and financial products); (v)          improvement o f the
infrastructures and equipment for marketing and processing, animal feed production and
pastoral hydraulics; and (vi)strengthening o f the prevention and management capacity for the
major shocks (diseases, climate, and others).

119.    Recent Bank supports to the livestock sector include the Second National Agricultural
Services Development Project (PNDSA-2 completed December 2004). An Agro-pastoral
Products Diversification, Intensification and Market Competitiveness Project (PAFASP) i s in
preparation. PNDSA-2 supported two specific elements: (i) so-called specialized systems
                                                                the
o f production, extensive pastoral and semi-intensive poultry and pigs systems; and (ii)     the
animal health service delivery system with support to both public and private sectors. The
results was rather positive in terms o f supporting the stakeholders in rethinking and refining
their policy on critical issues such as the institutional partnership between the public and the
private sectors, the vulnerability aspects o f the sector, the competitiveness o f the different
systems and streams, the access to land and water and the controversial issue o f pastoral
resource management.

120.    The PAFASP will include livestock activities built on the IECP action plan, under the
three proposed components: support to market-related equipment and infrastructure; capacity
buildingand support services; support to institutional strengtheningwith a matrix definingthe
needs and activities for the main streams (redmeat, milk, sheep, goat, pigs, poultry meat and
eggs, apiculture, inputs).

Measures to be undertaken as part o f the PRSCs

121.    The PRSCs are providing support to the livestock sector by complementing PNDSA-2
and PAFASP, mainly through the operationalization o f the IEPC, with a number o f measures
raning from the adoption and implementation o f an action plan to increase the efficiency o f
the MU, the promotion o f poultry and meat exports (definition o f standards, label,
conditioning, and training o f professional exporters), and increased protection against the
Newcastle disease and the contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia.

Reforms in the Telecommunication and energy sectors:

 122.   Government involvement in commercial activities through public enterprises (PE) is
one o f the cause o f low access to and high cost of infrastructure services inBurkina Faso. The
Government i s still involved in 11 large-scale enterprises that are fully owned by the State,
including all public utilities. State-owned enterprises suffer from insufficient equity due to
the limited fiscal capacity o f the State to contribute to investment needs, limiting the capacity
to expand services. In addition, management teams within the PE sector lack incentives to
improve efficiency. However, electricity supply i s also constrained by the small scale and
scattered production in Burkina. To achieve its growth and poverty reduction objectives, the
Government o f Burkina has rightly embarked to rolling back govemment intervention,
improving its overall business environment as well as the quality o f its infrastructure, and
ensuring the maturation o f its indigenous private sector while attracting supplemental foreign
direct investment.

                                               - 33 -

a.      Telecommunication

123.    Despite the positive impact inthe provision o fmobile services due to the liberalization
measures taken by the government,              the population still   has limited access to
telecommunications services.     Rural and remote communities (where 80 percent o f the
population lives) have a telecommunication penetration ratio o f less than 0.25 lines per 1,000
people. Exclusivity over basic telephone services. To lower factor costs and entice
investments in the sector, the government will pursue the privatization o f the
telecommunications operator. A first attempt to bring ONATEL to the point o f sale was not
successful because pre-qualified bidders did not find favorable the terms o f the privatization.
InJuly, the government revisedthe terms o fthe privatisationbutprogress hasbeenslow since
then. UnderPRSC-5, the Bank has supported government efforts to further improve the terms
of the privatization by providing for an outright majority to potential bidders. On March 16,
2005, the Government agreed to that suggestion and the privatization is being resumedwith
the State now keepinga minority share o f 23 percent

b.      Energy

124.    The electricity network i s inadequate (servicing only 9 percent o f households) and
electricity prices are high compared with neighboring 'countries with similar GDP size and
smaller populations. This i s due to a number o f factors, including the high cost o f generation
due to an inadequate power system planning and the poor performance o f the "Societe
Nationale Burkinabe d'Electricite" (SONABEL), which i s responsible for electricity
production and distribution. Per capita consumption is 22kwh inBurkina Faso, compared with
100kWhin Cameroon, 200 kWh in Senegal and 270 kWhinCote d'lvoire. The average tariff
i s higher than in neighboring countries, i.e. about 23 cents per kWh for industrial consumption
and 21 cents per kWh for households, while these tariffs are at least 50 percent lower even in
neighboring Togo and Benin.

125.    To reduce electricity production costs and tariffs, and reduce the cost o f petroleum
products, the government has adopted a legal and regulatory environment for introducing
private participation in the energy sector, and bring additional production capacity into the
power sector. A private partner will be selected for the management o f the electricity sector,
and the petroleum distribution company will be partially opened for private participation. The
work on the power line interconnecting Ouagadougou with Bobo-Dioulasso and CBte d'Ivoire
will begin in 2005 and is expected to be completed in early 2007. PRSC-5 supports these
measures in complementing the IDA'Scompetitiveness and enterprise development project
and the energy reform project.

InvestmentClimateand Labor Market Reforms

126.   The Government has started to address some issues pertaining to business
environment by reducing the formalities needed to register a business. T o create a company in
Burkina Faso, a small entrepreneur currently has to fulfill numerous steps and pay fees o f up
to 20 percent o f its capital before it can start business activities. FIAS has assisted the
Government in simplifying and reducing the number o f registration procedures. Before the
FIAS technical support, 15 administrative procedures were required to register a company.
With the leadership o f the Ministry o f Commerce, the administrative procedures to set up a
company were reduced to 8, and administrative requirements to operate as a merchant were
reduced from 11 to 9. Moreover, six administrative procedures were simplified in terms of
documentationrequired or the level o f decision-making. Despite this progress, a recent survey
on the cost o f doing business inBurkina Faso shows that there i s still a large number o f issues
that need to be addressed in order to have an enhanced business-friendly environment.
Moreover, other important issues such as those pertaining to administrative barriers to
investment, to the improvement o f the services provided by the one-stop shop center (guichet
unique) and other private sector-support organizations still need to be addressed.

127.   With the support o f PRSC-5, the government has taken a variety o f actions to improve
labor markets, cut red tap, and strengthen the business environment. The government revised
the labor law in September 2004 to reduce labour costs. It i s preparing a comparative study on
labor laws and regulation that will result in the alignment o f the practices in Burkina with
international standards. Moreover, the government has reviewed a variety o f texts to facilitate
commerce and reduce administrative hurdles. In particular, the government has provided
adequate resources to the one stop service center for new investors. It has also strengthened
Fasonorm and training to the staff o f the Trade point. The regulation for wholesale and
external commerce was also reviewedto streamline it.

                     Box 1: Operationalize Pro-poor Growth Strategy in Burkina Faso

Much has been written in the past 15 years on what should be done in Burkina Faso to accelerate social and
economic development and most o f the advice given has still its legitimacy. However, past studies were less
focused on pro-poor growth and the distributional impact o f policy reforms, set seldom priorities and were based
on a biased ex-post poverty assessment.

We think that Burkina Faso's development in the next 10 years should be based on rural development, because,
first of all, still most o f the poor are situated in rural areas. Inaddition, indirect growth effects through growth in
other sectors were found to be very low at least at this stage. Our analysis also shows that rural growth is more
pro-poor within itself than growth in other sectors, i.e. growth in the food-crop sector transfers best into higher
household income o f households employed in that sector. Finally, agricultural development has also positive
effects on the urban (informal) poor, since it decreases prices o f food staples mainly consumed by the poor, it
increases the demand for locally (informal) produced goods and decreases the pressure o f rural-urban migration
on informal wages.

Rural development policies should not only address cotton farmers but also and especially food crop farmers and
livestock producers. The most critical point in fostering broad-based rural development is to further invest in
agricultural production but with more emphasize on staples as well as non-farm income activities to diversify
rural incomes to further reduce the income risk o f farmers and to invest even more than currently done in rural
infrastructure to integrate markets. Policies could also consider to temporarily and cautiously stabilize prices o f
certain products the poor produce and consume or to subsidize agricultural investments and inputs. But, even if
we think the country's development cannot solely be based on cotton exports, a reduction o f the cotton subsidies
in the U.S.A., China and the E.U. can make a non-negligible contribution to a further poverty reduction in
Burkina Faso.

For urban areas, where the challenge i s to prevent a further increase o f poverty, likewise we consider investment
in infrastructure and measures which reduce the risk o f those engaged in the informal sector as the most
important issues in the next years. Long term policies should aim to increase the formal secondary sector by
developing value chains and by creating the appropriate legal framework, which makes the transition from the
informal to the formal sector more beneficial for urban enterprises. Investments ineducation and health should be
pursued and even intensified, but they should not crowd out investment in productive infrastructure.
Infrastructure is a prerequisite for private investment and without private investments the return to increased
humancapital as well as the demandfor social infrastructure will be low.

Of course, our suggestions might raise the question how these investments couldbe financed.
However, we think that a more efficient system o f taxation and redistribution and a reallocation o f investments
should deliberate non-negligible resources, Le. existing resources (including the current level o f foreign aid) if
better allocated should allow to improve productive public infrastructure. In addition, a further effort has to be
made to use the HIPC resources more efficiently. Inthe past, resources could not be absorbed because o f missing
investmentprojects and institutions being too weak to realize the existing ones.

Finally, the elaboration o f this study has prominently shown how important reliable National Accounts and
household survey data are. The current data availability is surely much better than in many other Sub-Saharan
African countries, but it is worth to improve the data quality on all levels.

2.         HumanResource Development

128.      Under the human resource development component, the government has pursued
sectoral policies in education, health, social protection and water management to accelerate
progress toward the education, maternal and child mortality, and water-related MDGs

a.      Education
Description
129.    Despite significant progress in recent years, educational attainment in Burkina Faso
remains low, and the country faces enormous challenges as it strives to achieve universal
primary education by 2015. Education in Burkina Faso i s characterized by low enrollment
rates in primary and secondary education, high illiteracy rate among the adults, and persistent
regional and gender inequalities ineducational attainment.

130.    The primary school enrollment rate in Burkina Faso increased from 35 to 52 percent
between 1994 and 2004, but it still remains one o f the lowest in SSA. Enrollment in secondary
education inBurkina Faso i s also very low, with large differences across gender, location and
income groups. On average, just 16 percent o f children o f the secondary school age attend
schools. The 2003 household survey shows that literacy rate was as low as 32.3 percent in
2003. The situation i s even more severe inrural areas where only one out o f five menand only
one out o f fourteen women are literate.

131.    Poor quality of education: academic achievement i s also low: standardized tests o f
learning achievements show that only 25% o f sixth-grade students perform at that level in
French and mathematics. Inaddition, students lack appropriate pedagogical materials. Despite
the efforts made inthe past years to ensure one textbook for 2 students and to reduce the cost
o f teaching materials, only 40% and 22% o f students have one textbook for their own use in
reading and mathematics, respectively.

132.     The efficiency of the Education System is poor: With the poor quality o f education
at all levels resources are wasted due to the high repetition rates and drop out rates within the
system. At an average repetition rate o f 18 percent at the primary level, the actual cost o f
educating a student through the six years o f primary i s 3.5 times more than what it would be
had there been no repetition. Similarly, educating a student at the lower secondary level
(BEPC) costs 4.4 times, and at the upper secondary (BAC) it i s 3 times.

Challenges

133.     A key issue inthe sector is the financial sustainability o f expanded services given the
existing cost structure of primary education. Teachers costs are relatively high, and represent
several time the GDP per capita. School construction costs are also a key issue to the financial
sustainability o f the program. The Government i s already channeling a large share o f public
resources to the education sector. In addition, the sector is already highly dependant on
external assistance and Burkina Faso is one o f the countries that were selected under the fast
track initiative o f the EFA to receive additional funds. Inthat context, although measures to
improve efficiency and access could increase intake to some extent, the government would not
be financially able to meet the investment and costs requiredby the targeted enrollment rate o f
70% unless lowering construction and teachers costs. As part o f the latter effort, the
Govemment opted to expand community schools where teachers are recruitedby communities
on contract and paid (with public financing) less than civil service teachers.

134.     As stated above, the relatively high construction costs as well as the lack o f local
capacity to build classrooms stand in the way o f rapid expansion o f the supply o f primary


                                              - 37 -

education. This i s a real obstacle the Government i s attempting to address by involving NGOs
inschool construction.

Government Actions
135.    The Government's strategy for the development o f the education sector i s outlined in
its Education Policy Letter o f May 2, 2001 (see Annex 13 o f Project Appraisal Document o f
the Basic Education Project, Report N o 22618-BUR). Under the Education Policy Letter,
basic education i s maintained as a national priority. The enrollment effort i s pursued and
intensified to reach an enrollment rate o f 70% and an adult literacy rate o f 40% by year 2011
and to improve both the quality and cost-effectiveness o f education. As outlined in the
Education Policy Letter, the MEBA prepared a Ten-year Plan for Basic Education (Plan
Decennal de Developpement de 1'Education de Base). The Ten-Year Plan presents specific
objectives and programs and outlines implementation arrangements and time frames.

136.    The main development objective o f Phase Io f the Ten Year Program i s to lay the
foundation for accelerating the development o f basic education, while ensuring adequate
quality and financial sustainability. The first phase is involving communities and NGOs to
develop programs to: (i)   increase access to basic education by intervening on both the supply
and demand side; (ii)improve the school-learning environment by offering programs and
instructional materials ; (iii)strengthencapacity for decentralization and budgetary support by
strengthening financial and procurement management and monitoring the education system.;
(iv) continue to increase the public resource effort to finance basic education according to the
HIPC targets, and improve the equity and cost-effectiveness o f the expenditure by increasing
non-salary expenditure.

 137.   Key program targets and monitoring indicators o f the first phase o f the Program were
developed and adopted during the SPA (Special Program for Africa) exercise on reformulated
conditionality led by European Union inBurkina Faso in2000. They are described inAnnex 1
of the Project Appraisal Document o f the Basic Education Project (Report No 22618-BUR).
They include indicators of access, quality, and management o f basic education. They have
been retained by the Ministry o f Basic Education and the donor community as stretched
targets to motivate the Government to do as much as possible.

Bank's Assessment and Recommendation.

 138.   The overall performance of the education system has been improving slowly but
steadily during the past five years, but the challenge still remains interms o f coverage, quality
and efficiency. Over half the school age children are out o f school. Those who are enrolled are
receiving low quality education, resulting in high repetition rates and large waste o f the
limited resources available for the sector. There are also serious inequities in coverage
between urban and rural areas, between boys and between the poor and rich. While the current
sectoral strategies and action plans highlight some o f these issues, it i s important to ensure
budget allocation, execution and management need to be better geared towards better
education outcomes. The following are the keyrecommendations:

 139.   Improvebudget planningand execution. Furtherimprovements inbudget planning
and executionmay include the following: (i) the entire education sector a priority sector,
                                               make
not only basic education; (ii)  greater involvement of the regional departments in the budget

                                              - 38 -

planning process to ensure their needs are reflected inthe budget; (iii)greater transparency in
budget discussions through the disclosure o f information and larger participation o f the
relevant departments in the center and the regions; (iv) simplification of procurement
procedures and credit-related regulations in MESSRS to avoid unnecessary delays in budget
execution; (v) address constraints with donor-financed projects, possibly by simplifying and
unifyngdisbursement procedures.

140.    Improve budget decentralization and monitoring, and the efficiency of resource
allocations within the sector. Given the success of the delegated credit system under
MEBA, budget decentralization could be further improved by: (i)extending the delegated
credit system to secondary and higher education. (ii)   reinforcing the capacity of both MEBA
and MESSRS at the regional and provincial levels to manage the implementation o f
provincial action plans for improved planning, execution and monitoring o f budgets, through
greater skill development and a simplified system o f budget management and monitoring o f
results; (iii)
             Strengthening the accountability of the schools and EPAs through a system o f
information recording, and audits to ensure appropriate use o f funds; (iv) Improve the
efficiency and equity of resource allocations within the sector through: better management of
recruitment and deployment of teachers and inspectors.

141.    Improve the quality of education. It i s necessary to strictly apply the measure
regarding sub-cycles and extend it ifpossible to the first grade o f secondary education. While
the system i s in place, it needs to be strengthened. Sufficient financing should be made
available for school-based activities to improve quality, and teaching and leaming hours
should be increased.

142.    Better integrate primary and secondary education. An emerging issue, as
enrollments in primary are rising, i s greater pressure on lower secondary. The education
system needs to address this in a timely manner not only in terms o f the financing needs, but
also interms o fmanagement and organization o f the sector as a whole.


143.     Scale up the Public-private partnership. Such approach was piloted in secondary
education under the Post Primary Education Project and was quite successful (see ICR o f the
PEPP, Report No 31668-BUR). It may also be worthwhile to study whether the approach
could be applied to primary education.

Actions to be undertaken as part o f the PRSCs

144.    PRSC support to the education sector in Burkina Faso i s complementary o f the Basic
Education Project which remains the main instrument for Bank's assistance to the
implementation of the Government's Basic Education Ten-Year Program (PDDEB). The
Basic Education Project also aims at buildingthe capacity o f the Ministryo f Basic Education
(MEBA) with particular attention to the areas o f financial management, budgeting,
procurement, monitoring, evaluation and donor coordination, to prepare for a shift from
project to programmatic support.

145.    Finalize the sectoral MTEF, including secondary education including the
resources to attain the PDDEB objectives and MDGs:Inprinciple, the education sector is


                                             - 3 9 -

has been implementing a program-based budgeting since 2001. In practice, these program
budgets are not comprehensive: for example, personnel expenditures are not reflected in the
program budget for the basic education. Inaddition, the link with MDG and PDDEB objective
i s tenuous and they lack a consistent medium-term framework. As part o f PRSC-5, the
Government has finalized a MTEF for the basic education sector, and has completed a PER
for the secondary education sector. These elements will serve as a basis to complete the
MTEFcovering bothlevel o feducation.

146.    Continue the policy of subsidizing schooling in the 20 provinces with the lowest
school enrollment rates:The ability of a household to pay for education determines if a child
from that household goes to school or not. For poor families, the costs o f education can be a
critical deterrent to participation in education. Demand factors are also important. According
to the 1998 Priority Survey, 24% o fpeople aged 7-24 do not attend school due to its highcost.
Although fees are not mandatory for primary education in Burkina, the cost o f supplies and
other expenditures weigh heavily, as do the opportunity costs, particularly for poor families
where children contribute importantly to the family economy. It is estimated that children
contribute to between5 and 35 percent o f the total householdconsumption.

147.    Prepare a study on effective teaching hours: The study was carried out. It shows
that effective teaching hours are 660 hours on average, and compares poorly to the short-term
objective o f 800 hours and the medium term objective o f 900 hours. An action plan i s being
prepared to follow up on the short-term recommendation o f 800 teachindlearning hours.
Improving teaching hours will be the best way to improve the quality o f education at low cost.

148.    Evaluate the execution of expenditure and the availability of school materials
using existing administrative statistics and INSD tracking surveys prepared for PRSP
monitoring: The annual tracking survey has been prepared since 2002 to ensure that
resources reach front-line services providers. The 2004 tracking survey report from INSD i s
available. It shows a significant increase o f resources to education facilities at the
decentralized level in2003.

149.    The next PRSCs will provide support to Government actions inthe following areas:

150.    Strengthen the program budget for the sector and finalize the sectoral MTEF,
including secondary education including the resources to attain the PDDEB objectives
and MDGs.

151.    Update the PDDEB: The first phase o f this ten-year program will be completed in
2005. The Government will work with local stakeholders and the donor community to draw
lessons from the implementation o f the first phase and design the second phase o f the program
for 2006-2010

152.    Introduce Delegated Credits for the secondary education: the delegated credit
mechanism introduced to MEBA i s a positive development that makes local actors
accountable and enhances the transparency o f the budgeting process, as well as the efficiency
o f the supply o f educational services. For secondary education, the resources for decentralized
units (DRES) come inthe form of a budget allocation for equipment expenditures within the
Appropriations Law, and they are managed at the central level. The centralized ordering


                                               - 40 -

system poses many problems with delivery to the site. The equipment often arrives late
because the DRES has no budget for transportation, and often these materials are dispatched
with significant loss or damage.

153.     Continue the policy of subsidizingschooling in the 20 provinceswith the lowest
school enrolment rates.

154.     Adopt and implementan action plan to increase teaching hours: This action is a
follow up to the measure undertook under PRSC-5, and will help improve the quality o f
education.

b.       Health

Description

155.     Communicable diseases are the main causes o f morbidity and mortality. Malaria alone
accounts for one-third o f child deaths, followed by diarrhea disease (12 percent), and acute
respiratory infections (11 percent). Burkina Faso has one o f the highest HIV prevalence rates
inWest Africa, with an estimated 4 percent of adults infectednationally in2003, with higher
rates in urban areas. HIVIAIDS has contributed to the reemergence o f tuberculosis and other
opportunistic infections. While vaccination coverage has improved since the late 1990s, the
past few years have seen a resurgence o f epidemics o f measles and meningitis, with the latter
second only to malaria as the leading cause o f child deaths in health facilities in 2002 due to
emergence of a new meningitis strain.

156.     The major source of modem health care for the rural and poor majority o f Burkina
Faso remains the public health system, which i s organized into primary, secondary, and
tertiary levels. Health districts, primarily through a network o f centers for health and social
promotion (CSPS) provide primary care. The district hospitals (CMA) serve as referral centers
for the CSPS. Nine regional hospitals (CHR) and three national hospitals (CHN) in
Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso provide the second and third levels o f care.
Administratively, the ministry o f health i s organized into three levels: the central ministry o f
health, 13 RegionalHealth Directorates (DRS), and 55 health districts, which are administered
by a district health team (ECD). The University and regional hospitals all enjoy a degree o f
managerial autonomy, and receive their budgets through a direct transfer from the central
government.

157.     The number o f government health facilities has increased over the past decade, but
geographic access remains a constraint in many rural areas. About 58 percent o f the
population lives within 5 km o f a health facility, and 19 percent live 10 ktnor more-with     an
average distance to a health center o f nine kilometers. Physical access i s determined not just
by distance to the health facility but time, including availability o froads and transport. Health
facilities are inaccessible for many villages during rainy season, and there i s a shortage o f
reliable transport both at rural health facilities and within villages themselves. Traditional
medicine continues play an important role in health care and treatment, particularly for the
rural majority, for reasons of culture, cost, and ease o f access below). Nongovernmental and
religious organizations operate health centers and district hospitals under a framework
agreement with the ministryo fhealth.

Challenges

158.     While it is important to further increase the resources allocated to the health sector, the
equity and efficiency of existing health spending (both public and private) must be improved,
as well as the quality and financial accessibility o f health services, in order to accelerate
progress toward the health objectives laid out in the PRSP and the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs).




Government Actions
159.     The Ministry o f Health's 10-year health strategy (Plan National de development
sanitaire (PNDS), 2001-2010) identifies key priorities and program objectives for the health
sector, including increased accessibility o f health services, improved quality, increased
financial  access for the poor. The eight priority programs for the PNDS are: increase
geographic coverage o f health services; improve the quality and utilization o f health services;
strengthen the fight against communicable and non-communicable diseases; reduce HIV
transmission; improve the quality and distribution o f human resources in the sector; increase
financial accessibility for the population; increase health sector financing; and strengthen
capacity inthe sector.

Bank's Assessment and Recommendations
160.     Establish results-basedbudgeting and monitoring system for the health sector.
The MTEF has the potential to become the basis for results-based financing system, and to
strengthen the Ministry o f Health's ability to negotiate for additional resources from Finance
and intemational partner. But other reforms will be necessary to make the system fklfill its
potential.

161.     Improve the level, efficiency and equity of resource allocations within the sector,
particularly to ensure adequate financing for MDG priorities. While resources for the
health sector are limited, existing resources could be more efficiently allocated to accelerating
progress toward the MDGs.

162.     Improve equity and financial accessibility for preventive and curative services.
Recent efforts to reduce margins on medicines and provide key preventative services for free
appear to have improve utilization o f health services by the poor, but financial accessibility
remains a barrier to use o f health services by the poor, particularly for emergency and curative
services.

163.     Improve the timeliness, flexibility, and reliability of sector funding. While trends
are positive, funds from both government and partners are often unreliable, amving late, or at
less thanbudgeted amounts, and making it difficult to manage and execute programs.

164.     Strengthenaccountabilityfor funds at district and community level. The Ministry
needs to put in place a system to annually record receipts, expenses, and account balances at
the district and community level (including district drug depots). The Ministry has also
initiated for the first time global audits o f accounts at health districts, which should be
continued and expanded to other levels o f the health system. The texts governing COGES also

                                               - 42 -

need to be revised in order to strengthen accountability to and participation o f communities,
expand membership (particularly women and youth), and strengthen their role in financing
preventiveand public health services.

165.     Improve accountability and performance management of hospitals. The
government currently transfers resources directly to national and regional hospitals without a
clearly defined performance agreement, but it also imposes various unfounded mandates on
hospitals.

166.     Improve distribution and motivation of health personnel. The inequitable
distribution o f health personnel i s a long-standing problem in the health sector, which will
require a multi-pronged approach, including: (a) strengthening incentives for practice in rural
and poor areas, including possible financial incentives, and priority for training and
professional advancement; (b) decentralization o f recruitment and budgetposts to the regional
and district level; (c) strengthen systems for human resource planning, training, and
management, including making the human resources software system operational.

Actions to be undertaken as part o f the PRSCs

167.     Elaborate a sectoralMTEF for 2005-07, in linewith PNDS objectivesand MDGs:
Although health is a considered a priority sector in the PRSP, this fact has not been fully
reflected in the budgeting process. While the Ministry o f Health was involved in overall
MTEF preparations, the M O H had limited influence on the process. Due to the absence o f an
institutional mechanism for systematically updating the list o fprograms and annually updating
their cost, the M O H was not able to present a strong argument regarding the budgetary
requirements to achieve health objectives under the PRSP, or to provide detailed information
on the number and the cost o f new programs to be proposed. For similar reasons, the MOH
has had difficulties defending its allocation during the budget arbitration process with the
Council o f Ministers and before parliament. The preparation o f the MTEF under PRSC-5 i s
helping to tackle these issues.

168.     Implementthe monitoringsystem for the rCgies d'avance (includingMinistriesof
Health and Finance): Cash advance accounts (regies d'avance): In order to impart greater
flexibility to executing some delegated appropriation lines, cash advance accounts were
established for all health regions and districts in November 2002. This reform was partly in
response to the closing o fthe World Bank-financedPDSNproject, which had financed district
action plans through local private bank accounts. With the transition to budget support, the
Ministry of Finance did not want to put public money into private bank, so the "regies
d'avance" were proposed to function similar to a private bank checking account" for districts,
butusingpublic funds.

169.     While the health ministrywelcomed this reform, it experienced a number o fproblems
and delays in the first year. First, while the account managers ("regisseurs") were named in
March 2003, they did not assume office until November 20, 2003. Moreover, training did not
extend to other members o f the district health teams and regional treasury officials, who did
not fully understand this new mechanism. Second, while the advances funds were created to
facilitate the execution o f fungible expenditure-equipment     maintenance, petty expenditure,
personnel support other than health care, maintenance o f computers and peripherals-many

                                              - 43 -

districts assumed that they had to use these accounts to cover all delegated appropriations,
even though "normal" procedures were better adapted for large orders o f medicines or
supplies.

170.     Third, the rules governing the accounts were unduly rigid: (a) only one-sixth o f the
total delegated credit was advanced at a time; (b) districts were not allowed to expend more
than one-sixth o f any given budget line, making it impossible to purchase suppliesinbulk; (c)
the list o f eligible expenditures was seen as too narrow; (d) to qualify for account
replenishment, receipts had to be sent to Ouagadougou (except in the one region that had
decentralized the treasury function).

171.     Despite these problems, most districts were able to execute over 90 percent o f their
planned delegated budget, but with significant delays. Moreover, most district and regional
officials interviewed remained positive about the reform's potential, and that performance has
further improved in2004.

172.     Develop a system of subsidies for obstetrical emergencies: In the late 1990s, the
government added a specific budget allocation for emergency care in the financing for all
referral hospitals, but the use o f these funds was not comprehensively monitored. Thus the
continued relative highcost o f services and the lack o f adequate exemption mechanisms mean
that despite substantial government subsidies, hospitals largely do not play a social safety net
role for the poor. A recent survey found that only 2 percent o f patients seeking urgent surgical
care (including cesareans) were provided free or subsidized treatment. This lack o f financial
access i s clearly a contributing factor to maternal mortality. The poor often thus either avoid
hospital services entirely or present too late. Late amval (either during or after difficult
deliveries) explains in part why there were 450 matemal deaths at Yalgado hospital in 2003,
equal to about 10 percent o f all births at the same hospital. In response, the government
created a technical working group and commissioned a study on development o f a subsidy
system for emergency obstetrical care. The recommendations o f the study and working group
were discussed and validated at stakeholder workshop in March 200, and the financing
implications integrated into the MTEF for the sector.

173.     Revise the fee structure for physicians and hospital services: With the launching o f
the Bamako Initiative in the early 1990s, the government introduced cost recovery for health
services, and introduced an essential drug policy based on low-cost generic drugs. The
national drug procurement agency (Centre d'Achat des Medicaments Essentiels Generiques
(CAMEG)) was established in 1992 to procure and distribute generic drugs, with a system o f
regional and district level pharmaceutical depots. The cost recovery approach significantly
improved the availability o f drugs in health facilities, including inrural areas, but despite the
relatively low prices for consultation and generic drugs, cost emerged as a barrier for the use
o f health services by the poor. The current fee structures for hospitals are outdated with little
correspondence to the actual cost o f services, and inpractice fees vary considerably from one
hospital to another. The government commissioned a background study (financed through the
budget) to review current costs and fee for services, and to make recommendations for
revisions and exemptions for the poor.

174.     Revise the texts of local health management committees (COGES), stressing
community participation in decision making, public health, and fees: Community

                                              - 44 -

management committees (COGES) were established to manage the proceeds o f revolving
drug funds, and to strengthen the participation o f communities inhealthcare. The COGES are
managed by a Board of six elected members.However, the election i s not always transparent,
and there have been cases o f corruption. Strengthened community oversight and electing
women to the COGES offices could help reduce embezzlement. Because the question o f
revising COGES texts i s closely tied to the ongoing process o f decentralization, the Ministry
o f Health initiated a consultation process among key departments in the Ministry and other
stakeholders, including the ministryresponsible for decentralization. Draft revisedtexts were
developed in early 2004, and a weeklong workshop was convened in March 2005 to revise
and finalize the texts. A stakeholder validation workshop s planned for April 2005.

175.    Develop a contracting system for hospitals on the basis of actions plans and
performance indicators: Beginning in 1999, the Ministry of Health introduced a
performance-based contracting system, in which district were given money directly in local
bank accounts, and prepared annual action plans based on a limited number o f key indicators.
Although there are neither rewards nor sanctions for good or poor performance, it was the first
time districts prepared annual plans based on agreed indicators, and were given liquid
financing to implement the plans. The systemwas initially piloted using funds from the World
Bank Health and Nutrition project, and i s being camed forward through the Dutch-sponsored
PADS project. In the past two years, districts have been encouraged to incorporate a wider
range o f indicators, and to integrate donor, government, and cost recovery funds into their
plans. While the allocation o f funds among districts through the PADS project i s based on
standard criteria (district population, etc.), there i s no criterion - either population, poverty,
disease burden- for government budget allocations among districts.

176.     Conversely, while public hospitals enjoy a degree o f administrative autonomy with
regard to management o f financial resources, there is no performance contract or performance
monitoring agreement between the central ministries and hospitals. Transfers from central
government to referral hospitals vary significantly among referral hospitals, but are not based
on any clear criteria. Government hospitals distribute a proportion o f proceeds fi-om cost
recovery to health personnel (e.g., about 10 percent on average, but up to 20 percent at many
regional hospitals), but this creates incentives to maximize cost recovery, and disincentives to
provide exemptions to the poor. Faculty from the medical school represents the majority o f
specialists at the referral hospitals, but they are entirely paid by the Ministry o f higher
education (MESSRS), and receive nothing directly for their hospital service. This reduces
accountability to hospital administrators and contributing to highrates o f absenteeism among
senior specialists, reducing the quality o fhospital care.

177.     Inlate 2004, the government approved a new statute for public hospitals, which will
facilitate the development o f internal and external contracting arrangements. InJanuary 2005,
the Ministry integrated hospitals for the first time into the PADS project, which requiredthem
to prepare performance-based action plans. The MOH has been working to improve its
approach to and policy fi-amework for contracting, with technical support from the World
Bank Institute. Performance contracts governing budget transfers to hospitals have not yet
been implemented,but are expected to be developed by the end o f 2005.

178.     Continue the policy of free vaccination: Despite the government's longstanding
commitment to the principle o f cost sharing under the Bamako Initiative, there i s now

                                               - 45 -

widespread recognition that financial accessibility has emerged as an important barrier to
health service by the poor. To address this situation, the MOHinFebruary 2002 sent a circular
notifying all health regions that consultations for prenatal and infant care should be provided
free o f charge, as well as well as syringes, vaccination cards, and iron supplements for
mothers, choloroquine for children and health cards. The direct cost o f vaccines had been
financed through the PPTE since 2001. This policy has clearly been among the factors
contributing to the increased vaccination since 2001. The MOH has developed a long-term
strategy for vaccine program sustainability incollaboration with the Global Vaccine Initiative.
These costs are integrated into the health MTEF.

179.     Adopt an action plan for the application of recommendations regarding health
worker motivation:inequitable distribution ofhealthpersonnel is a long-standingproblem in
Burkina Faso. The distribution o f student-employees i s carried out based on the needs
expressed by the regions and the personnel available, with positions to be filled ("new
measures") designated in advance. New staff i s allocated among health regions, and the
regional health directorates are responsible for distributingstaff within the region. The HIPC
personnel-who      are recruited as contractual staff-are  assigned automatically to the regions
they designated when registeringfor the recruitment competition.

180.     There are several problems with the current system. The first i s the willingness of
health personnel to relocate to remote areas. Second, although staff recruited to a givenregion
and are expected to remain there for a least three years, inprinciple staff frequently succeed in
being transferred back to urban areas despite not having fulfilled the minimum. Even those
who remain the minimum requirement frequently spend the rest o f their careers in urban
facilities. Third, and related, the "budget posts" are associated with the civil servants
themselves rather than the health facility or district (with the exception o f HIPC-recruited
staff), so that staff who transfer out o f a rural facility take their salaries with them. The
centralization o f recruitment results inmany other problems with transporting newly assigned
staff to their duty posts. As the DRSs have no budget line for this purpose, it may take 6 to 7
months before staff reports to their posts.

181.     With technical support from the World Bank, including WBI, the M O H initiated in
early 2004 a participative process to develop an action plan for human resources inthe health
sector, involving M O H staff, representatives o f the ministries o f finance and civil services,
and representatives of health workers' unions. The action plan was drafted in late 2004,
revised during a stakeholder workshop, further refined at a regional workshop on human
resources in health (sponsored by WBI), and was officially adopted by the "Comitt de Suivi"
o f the PNDS in March 2005.           The action plan includes priorities for reforms (e.g.,
decentralization of budget posts), technical support and capacity building, as well as
recommendations to improve staff motivation (including a proposal for additional payments
for health staff working remote zones). The costs have been estimated and integrated into the
MTEF, but the more costly measures may be modified during the budget arbitrage process.
The majority o f recommendations are not costly, but those recommendations with impact on
the aggregate wage bill will need to be validated by the Ministry of Finance and Budget and
reviewedby the IMF.

182.     Conduct a study on the basis of household data, DHS on the increase in
child/youth malnutrition and its regional variation, and develop and action plan: The

                                              - 46 -

profile o f nutrition in the Ministry has been increased somewhat by the elevating the former
department o f nutritionto a Directorate o f Nutrition. Most activities and funding to date focus
on micronutrients, including vitamin A. While important, more needs to be done to combat
protein-energy malnutrition, including through community-level interventions. Despite the
positive trends in reducing poverty and increasing cereal production in the past five years,
recent household surveys have shown that child malnutrition, having deteriorated in the
1990s, has at best stagnated and possibly worsened since the late 1990s. The government and
partners therefore have initiated a process o f analyzing these date to better understand trends
and reasons for regional variations, usingdata from both the poverty surveys (1998 and 2003)
and the Demographic and Health Surveys (1998/99 and 2003). Terms o f reference have been
finalized, but initiation o f the study was delayed by later than expected availability o f the D H S
2003 data. This analysis will form the basis for an action plan to be validated prior to the next
PRSC

C.      Social Protection

183.    The PRSC-5 action plan includes the preparation o f a strategy for orphans and
vulnerable children (OVC) as part o f an overall Government plan to prepare a comprehensive
Social Protection Strategy.

d.      Water

184.    PRSC-5 has accompanied the design o f a new water management framework,
involving private-public partnerships, the definition o f the investment and financing plan to
reach the MDGs, the revision o f the framework for the reforms and equipment maintenance in
semi-urban areas will be revised, and the preparation o f an adequate action plan to improve
efficiency in that area. Under PRSC-5, the Government has also continued the review o f
public sector water bills and usage to reduce public water bills. A detailed account o f the
implementation status o f measures water related measures are described inAnnex 4.


3.      Good Governance

185.    Under this component, PRSC-5 continues the support to a variety o f public sector
reform measures to reinforce programmatic budgeting, increase public sector efficiency, fight
corruption, and bring services closer to beneficiaries.

a.      Budget Information

186.    The government has continued its efforts to link budgets closely to PRSP objectives by
adopting the 2005 budget in line with sectoral ceilings o f the 2005-07 MTEF and with the
priorities o fthe PRSP

b.      Budget Execution

187.    A major reform in that area is the improvement o f the accounting and monitoring o f
externally-financed investment spending by clarifylng the role o f different ministerial
departments involved in the process, designing a recording and information sharing system,
and constituting a project data base. Inaddition, the Government has pursued the preparation

                                               - 47 -

o f a computerized revenue management system. The government has also evaluated budget
deconcentration and has prepared recommendations to increase its efficiency.

C.      Procurement

188.    The procurement agenda under previous PRSCs was completed through the
nomination o f a reform committee, the adoption o f a decree regulating concessions and
leasing in line with best intemational practice, the development of a computer application for
the monitoring of procurement processes, and the adoption o f regulatory text for the issuance
and withdrawal of accreditation for public works. Inaddition, the government would continue
the systematic ex-post controls on procurement contracting.

d.      BudgetManagementand Control

189.    Measures include the satisfactory implementation o f an accounting system for
government property to verify the efficient use o f equipment and avoid fraud. The government
has continued the regular submission o f accounts to the Supreme Audit Court, and further
reinforce staffing o f the ex-post control services.

e.      Public Sector Reformand Decentralization

190.    In this area of civil service reform, the government will expand the use of the
electronic personnel management system to line ministries, and will continue the
implementation o f the performance-based evaluation system. Government's               revised
decentralized framework i s described in Box 1. The authorities will finalize the accounting
software for local communities, adopt the judicial framework for the regions as
deconcentrated entity, and begin with the transfer o f resources and competencies to local
communities. They will pursue efforts to strengthen the management o f the agricultural and
livestock ministries and develop better professionaltraining for the rural sector.

 The ((CodeGeneral des Collectivites Territoriales au Burkina Fason(the Code) adopted by Parliament on December 21,
 2004, replacesthe previous Textes d'Orientation de la Dkcentralisation (TOD) introduced in 1998 as the new framework
                                ((                                           ))
 for decentralizationreform in Burkina Faso.

 1. Confirmation of the new territorial system of Burkina Faso. The first positive key change with the 1998 TOD is the
 final clarification of the status of the "province", which will remain adeconcentrated level. This lifts the uncertainty and ends
 a long and distracting debate as to whether or not the "province" should remain a "collectivite decentralisie" (like the
 communes) as well as a "circonscription administrative", as originally envisioned by the govemment (1 998 TOD, Art.1 and
 maintained as such in the "Loi Modificative" of July 2001) despite the opposition of the parliament and the mayors of
 existing communes.
 Therefore, the configuration of Burkina Faso temtorial system i s now the following:
      Collectivit&s De`centralisees(or local govemments) levels: (i)The Region, (ii) Commune
                                                                                       The
      Circonscriptions Administratives (or deconcentrated administration) levels: (i) T The Region, (ii)The Province, and the
      Departement
 Another important change is the requirement for the rural communes councils to establish a "Conseil Villageois de
 Developpement" (CVD, village development council). However, the composition, organization and functioning of the CVD
 will have to be defined by a Decree issued by the Cabinet (Articles 223 and 224). Furthermore, the CVD will not be
 responsibledirectly to the rural commune mayor and his deputies.
 2. The transfer of competencies and resources
 The Code does state, as the TOD did, that "all transfers of competencies must be accompanied by the concomitant transfer of
 resources required for the normal exercise of the new competencies transferred to them" (Art. 61 of the ToDs, Art. 36 of the
 Code). Art. 62 of the TOD and Art. 37 of the new Code state that the required new resources will come from three sources:
 fiscal transfers, grants or a combination of both. The TOD also stated (art. 64 and 65), like the Code in its art. 40 and 41, thal
 any transfer of competencies must be accompaniedby the permanent or temporary transfer of all or part of the corresponding
 "services", formally exercised by the local branches of sector ministries.
 A key change from the TOD is the creation of a permanent "Fund" (Code, Art. 141) to assist the collectivites. Its mission
 size and criteria of eligibility will be specified by aDecree.

 3. The operationalimplementationof the reformand modalitiesfor the transfers
 The new Code (Article 73) states that:
 "The establishment o f the regions and communes councils must be effective in 2007 at the latest. In the meantime, and unti
 such a time their mandates be exercised by the "dklegations speciales rkgionales", composed of central govemmen
 appointees from various ministries' under the authority of the govemors, for the regions and the prefets for the communes.
 Moreover, and regarding more specifically the pace of the transfer of competencies and resources, Article 75 indicates tha
 for the region, this transfer must be effective three years after the establishment of regional councils (planned for 2007). FO
 urban communes, the transfer in sectors such as health, basic education, illiteracy, youth policy, culture, sport anc
 recreational activities, must be effective in 2005 at the latest. For rural communes, Article 77 indicates that the transfer mus
 be effective three years at the latest after their establishment in2005.
14. ConcludingRemarks

 Most important are the issues of transfers of competencies and resources. All ministries are confronted with thi
 rationalization of their structures and the deconcentration of their human and budgetary resources. Another important aspec
 i s the challenges facing the MATD in building, almost from scratch, the human and technical capacity in all of the nev
 entities in order for them to be able to properly assume their new responsibilities.
  In addition, in the absence of the implementing decree, and in respect to the transfer of resources, it is too early to sa:
 whether the creation of a permanent "Fund" for the investments needs of the collectivites locales will work. But this i s ,
 major innovation of the new Code, The Fund will be funded from two major sources: the national budget and the pooling o
  some donors funding, some o f whom are already funding the "Fonds de ddveloppement des Communes " (FODECOM) an(
 the "Fonds d 'Investissements des Communes"(FIC0M).

 192.   The envisioned PRSC-6 i s an integral part o f a series o f three annual PRSCs -starting
 with PRSC-4 - to assist the govemment in implementing the revised PRSP in the period
 2004-2006.      As such, the policy framework for PRSC-6 was described in the program
 document o f PRSC-4 and inAnnex 3 of this program document.

 Beyond PRSC-6

 193.   PRSC-7 will be underpinnedby the third full PRSP for the period 2007-2009, andby a
 series o f analytical work planed in FY05 and FY06, including a CPAR (FY05), a CEM
 (FY06), a social protection and labor market study (FY06), a Trade Integrated Framework
 (FY06), and other AAA planed inthe forthcoming CAS. It i s expected the three main areas o f
 the current series o f PRSCs (growth andjob creation, access to social services, governance)
 will remain relevant but more emphasis would be given to the growth andjob creation agenda
 (investment climate and diversification, including taking up reforms initiated in the recently
 closed mining project) given the pro-poor nature o f growth in Burkina (cf. Poverty

Assessment Report); the decentralizatioddeconcentration policy and program, including the
possible integration o f urban sector's work; and a gender dimension.

194.      Gender issues. Women represent 52 percent o f the population and they play an
important role in Burkina Faso's social and economic system. In rural and informal sectors
women provide about 60 percent o f the labor force. However, the gender gap i s significant in
Burkina Faso. In addition to the literacy gap, results o f the 2003 household survey suggest
that households having a female head are associated with significantly lower levels o f per
capita consumption and income and assets. For instance, inrural areas, per capita expenditure
i s lower by 21 percent and per capita income lower by 34 percent for female-headed
households. They have less access to land (average o f 0.5 ha, in contrast o f 2.5 ha for men),
and credit (for lack o f collateral). Women lack time to pursue personal opportunities and
development because o f household chores (fetching water, wood fuel etc). Women also have
limited political representation, representing only 8 percent o f the Parliament and 4 percent o f
the mayors.

195.      The first PRSP clearly identified women's vulnerability to poverty and included gender
specific actions. The first series o f PRSCs has supported the PRSP objectives o f closing the
gender gap in access to social services (lowering education costs for girls, and subsidizing
obstetric care). With the revised PRSP which identifies gender as one o f the key principles
underpinning government's strategy to promote growth and reduce poverty, and with the
benefit o f several ongoing or planed analytical work on gender issues, it i s possible to step up
the gender agenda, with the goal to achieve higher growth with equity, and increased access to
social services. The analytical work PRSP and the next series PRSC-7 could draw from
include thejoint Bank-Netherlands initiative on budget and gender.

196.      Under the Bank-Netherlands partnership program, a gender-responsive budget
outreach and learning program (GRB-OL) i s currently implementing in Burkina Faso. The
initiative i s intended to afford a mechanism by which Governments, in dialogue with civil
society, donors and other partner agencies, can integrate a gender analysis into public
expenditure policies and budgets. It i s expected that the GRB-OL will build greater awareness
of, and capacity to implement, GRB work and its potential strong impact on country poverty
reduction strategies and on meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
expected outcomes o f the task in FY06 include a GDB Actions Plan which likely scope is
outlined inthe box below.

                               Box3: Gender-responsiveBudgetAction Plan

  The Country GRB Action Planwill typically provide for undertaking the following: (a) a synthesis o f gender
  issues relevant for the budget exercise; (b) a review o f the experience and practice to-date inthe country in
  conducting GRB work, withparticular focus on understanding the gender-differentiated impact o fbudget
  policies (using benefit-incidence analysis o f public spending inkey sectors and other analytical techniques); (c)
  a summary o f the existing budget process inthe country, including the preparation o f sectoral strategies and
  budget framework papers, including inrelationto country-level decentralization activities, and identification o f
  key entry points for GRB inthe country; (d) identification    o f [two] priority sectors inwhich to focus the GRB
  work inthe next 1-2budget cycles; (e) specification o f key steps for the GRB work, including filling identified

                             VI.     PRSC 5 IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

197.    It is expected that the reform program supported by PRSC-5 would improve the living
conditions o f the poorest segment o f the population. Drawing from the findings o f the Risk
and Vulnerability Assessment Report" , PRSC-5 i s introducing social protection measures
(OVC) in the policy matrix o f the series o f PRSCs. A critical analytical underpinning for the
proposed PRSC-5 i s also the Poverty Assessment (PA) which exploits the household data
fkom 1998 and 2003 data to study the links between growth and poverty in 1998-2003 and
under possible future growth paths and based on this analytical foundation - explore options
                                          -
to enhance the poverty impact o f growth, and respond to macroeconomic shocks.

198.    The PA findings as regards the trade-off between growth, poverty, and inequality,
provided additional rationale for PRSC-5 focus on a growth path driven by improved
productivity in the rural and cotton sector, and broader private sector participation in the
secondary and tertiary sectors, including in the utilities sector. Lndeed, the PA shows that
growth has a significant impact on poverty and that the growth-inequality trade-off i s fairly
small in Burkina Faso. A one percent growth results in a 2 percent decline inthe poverty gap,
the average distance between the poor and the poverty line. A one percent increase in
inequality, measured by the Gini index, would need to be compensated by about 1.4-1.5
percent more growth in Burkina Faso, a number that i s small compared to several other
countries that have previously been studied. Ln rural areas 0.8-1.1 percent more growth would
suffice to compensate for a one percent increase in inequality, but in urban areas it would
require 3.3-3.4 percent more growth.

199.    Under a baseline growth scenario building on long-term real GDP growth of about 5
percent, drivenpredominantly by secondary and tertiary sectors, the PA demonstrates that the
MDG target o f halving poverty by 2015 could be achieved, but sustaining growth o f five
percent under the baseline scenario would be predicated on increases in cultivated land use or
agricultural productivity, and significantly higher private investment than in the past in the
secondary and tertiary sectors. Variations to the baseline scenario show the importance of
cotton and agricultural production for accelerating poverty reduction and changes in
inequality. A 20 percent increase inthe level o f cotton production in2004 would give rise to a
4 percentage point decline in the poverty headcount accompanied by rising inequality since
cotton producers are a relatively small group o f the population. A 20 percent increase in the
level o f nontradable agricultural production would reduce the poverty headcount by about 9
percentage points by 2015 and reduce inequality as a larger population group shares in the
additional income created. Finally, a growth scenario with the same overall growth rates but a
different composition-a    larger contribution from the primary sector-reaffirms      the previous
findings, namely that participation o f the rural population ingrowth is crucial for accelerating
poverty reduction andreducing inequality.

SUPERVISION

200.     The ministry o f finance and budget (MFB) will be responsible for overall
implementation o f the proposed PRSC-5. The Secretary o f the Permanent Secretariat for the
Monitoring o f Financial Programs and Policies (SP-PPF) in the MFB will lead the
government technical team with representatives o f the Ministries o f Finance and Budget;
Economy and Development; Health; Basic Education and Literacy; Secondary Education,
Higher Education and Scientific Research; Environment and Living Conditions; Agnculture,
Water and Fisheries; Commerce, Enterprise Development, and Artisanship; Energy and
Mines; Decentralization; and representatives o f public enterprises.

201.     Bank's supervision effort will be aligned with the government-led monitoring and
evaluation system underpinning the revised PRSP, the Priority Action Plan, and the Unified
Framework for Budgetary Support (UFBS). The specific benchmarks and outcomes to be
monitored under PRSC-5 (see annex 3) are extracted from the government overall
development program (annex 2), thus providing significant benefits in reducing transaction
costs for the Government. The PRSC-5 team will work with the authorities and the other
donors under the UFBS to ensure that coordination o f the supervision efforts will not
undermine aid alignment with the budget cycle and/or increase unpredictability o f aid. In
assessing the implementation o f the PRSPIPRSC, the UFBS will take into account factors
outside government's control that may alter the underlying assumptions for a successful
PRSP. Such factors include declining terms o f trade, weather-related disaster, shortfalls in
external assistance, regional instability etc.


FIDUCIARYASPECTS

202.     Public financial managementsystem. The latest CFAA and CPAR were key inputs
in the preparation o f the government's budget management reform program (Programmede
Rtiforme de la Gestion Budge'taire, PRGB). The PRGB i s supported by most donors
providing budgetary support, and i s a core element o f the UFBS. The government i s also
implementing annual audit procedures recommended by the CFAA. Under PRSC-1 to PRSC-
4, most recommendations o f the CFAA and CPAR have been successfully implemented.
PRSC-5 i s building up on the achievements under the first PRSCs by supporting the further
strengtheningof ex-post audits, and by including further measures to enhance transparency of
budgeting and timeliness o f accounting (see annex 3). Overall, the team's assessment is that
Burkina's fiduciary framework i s adequate to receive the proceeds o f the credit.

203.     Safeguard assessment of the CentralBank". The Central Bank o f the West African
States (BCEAO) i s the common central bank o f the west African states, which includes
Burkina Faso. IMF carried out an on-site safeguards assessment o f the BCEAO and proposed
specific remedies to alleviate vulnerabilities: (i)Financialreportingframework. Fundstaff
recommended that the BCEAO formally adopt International Accounting Standards (IAS) and
publish a complete set o f financial statements, including detailed explanatory notes. It was
agreed between the BCEAO and Fund staff that the BCEAO will strive to improve its
financial and accounting reporting by aligning its practices with those recommended by IAS,
as adopted internationally by other central banks; (ii)  Internal controls system. IMF staff


  IMF- EBS/04/178,December 22,2004.
                                              - 53 -

noted that the absence o f oversight o f the bank's governance, financial reporting, and internal
control practices by an entity external to the management o f the BCEAO represented a
significant risk. It was agreed between the BCEAO and Fund staff that, after seeking the
opinion o f the external auditor (Commissaire ContrGleur), BCEAO staff will propose to the
BCEAO Board of Directors that it adopt a resolution whereby the external auditor will be
required to apprise the Board o f Directors, during its annual review and approval o f the
financial statements, o f the state and quality o f intemal controls within the bank.


DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                  AND

204.    Disbursementand Implementation Arrangement:It is proposed that the financing
of US$60 million equivalent be disbursedimmediately upon effectiveness. The untiedbudget
support will be disbursedagainst satisfactory implementationo f the development program and
not tied to any specific purchased and no procurement requirements will be needed. Once the
financing  becomes effective, the proceeds o f the financing will be deposited by IDA into a
Government account at the Central Bank at the request o f the Borrower, and appropriately
credited to the government's budget management system. If, after depositing in this account,
the proceeds o f the financing are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development
Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to either: (a) apply the corresponding
amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refundthe amount directly to IDA.N o dedicated account i s
required. The administration o f this financing will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finances and Budget. .


ENVIRONMENTAL NATURALRESOURCESASPECTS
                    AND

205.     The Bank has determined that the specific actions supported under the proposed
PRSC-5 are not expected to have a significant effect on Burkina's environment and natural
resources. As noted in annex 13, the potential environmental and social impacts o f the series
of PRSC-4-6 stem from its sectoral coverage. However, these impacts, which are mainly
linked to the measures for rural development, privatization o f ONATEL and reform o f the
energy sector, as well as to investments in education and health, should not be extensive; nor
will they be irreversible.

206.     Furthermore, there i s a close and direct link between PRSC-5 and the sectoral
investment projects as regards compliance with environmental and social safeguards, and
these   accompanying sectoral investment operations have their own environmental
management plans (EMPs) formulated to offset the main environmental and social impacts
identified during their evaluation. These sectoral EMPs are the basis to guarantee compliance
with Bank requirements and policies, and can be found in the Environmental Assessments
(EAs) o f the respective projects. These projects are: (i)the Community-based Rural
Development project; (ii)   the Basic Education Sector project; (iii) Response to HIV/AIDS
                                                                        the
project; (iv) the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development project; (v) the Energyproject;
and (vi) the Urban Environment project.

207.    PRSC-5 i s also providing support to measures aiming at strengthening government's
capacity for environmental and natural resource management: (i)         implementation o f the key
measures in the capacity-building plan developed under PRSC-2 in the budget for 2004 and

                                                - 54 -

2005 and inclusion o f the measures in the 2005-2007 MTEF; (ii)       ongoing creation o f cells in
sectoral ministries in order to strengthen compliance with national regulations; (iii)  improved
supervision o f the management o f ligneous forest resources by means o f effective
improvements and promotion o f biomass energy; (iv) supervision o f other IDA projects and o f
implementation o frecommendations for IDA projects already visited.


RISKS  AND RISKMITIGATION

208.    The risks for this operation include: (i)weak capacity at the central and decentralized
level; (ii)fiduciary risks; (iii)commodity and currency rates risks; and (iv) regional instability.

209.    Weak Capacity is a medium risk. The capacity of the administration to formulate
and execute programs remains weak. Continued weaknesses in implementation capacity,
particularly in line ministries, may hamper improvements in service delivery. The preparation
and implementation o f program budgets can only advance further if the capacity o f the civil
service i s improved. In this respect, the Bank has prepared a PER in FY04 to give guidance
for further improvements in the budget process, especially as regards integrating the budget
and PRSP process and objectives. In the area o f public sector management, the Bank i s
financing a capacity building project approved by the Board on March 22,2005 to accompany
and complement PRSC-5 and future PRSCs. Over time, the project aims at giving technical
assistance    for capacity assessment, deconcentration and decentralization in order to
strengthen service delivery, streamlining public administration, modemizing personnel
management, strengthening the poverty focus o f expenditure, and strengthening policy
formulation. In the statistical area, the Bank finances a statistical capacity building project.
PRSC-5 will also step up the competence o f monitoring resources transfers from the central
Government to the municipal, regional levels and deconcentrated public services providers.

210.    Fiduciary risks are low but should be monitored. The Government's continued
efforts to strengthen financial management and procurement systems are reducing fiduciary
risks with regard to the use o f public funds, but they remain not negligible. To mitigate the
risk, the Government must continue to push forward on implementingthe recommendations
and reform measuresoutlined inthe most recent CPAR, CFAA and PER. The PRSC program,
as well as the Bank's continuing analytical work in these areas, i s providing assistance to the
Government inthis endeavor.

211.    Commodity prices and currency shocks are high risks in 2005. Burkina Faso is
heavily vulnerable to fluctuations o f world prices for cotton and oil, and to the appreciation o f
the EURO - to which the CFAF is pegged at a fixed rate - against the US$. Highoil prices
drain intemational reserves, and increase petrochemicals, electricity and transportation costs
with adverse impact on the overall economy. Since cotton is the main export product o f the
economy, the prevalence o f low international prices hurts the country's performance and
sternly affects about 2 millionpersons inrural areas where most o fthe poor live. The potential
fiscal impact o f continuous low cotton price i s also significant. The continuous depreciation o f
the U S dollar i s also a threat to the competitiveness of the economy. Under this operation, the
Bank i s promoting reforms to improve efficiency in the energy sector, including privatization
and regulatory reforms. The Bank also helps the Government in implementing far-reaching
cotton sector reform policies through the PRSC series. The Bank has also a flexible approach
inthe amount ofPRSC financing to respond- ifneeded-to external shocks. Regardingthe
                                                - 55 -

currency shock, support under the PRSC will provide the authorities with non-inflationary
deficit financing, thus helpingto keep the real effective exchange rate at an adequate level.

212.     Political risks for PRSC implementation arise from the presidential elections
scheduled November 2005. The government may bepressuredto delay or partially implement
certain reforms or jeopardize its prudent fiscal stance around the election date to enhance its
re-election prospects. For example, if international oil prices continue to rise, the government
may be tempted to suspend the pass through into domestic pump prices to satisfy the powerful
urban constituency. Similarly, should international cotton prices continue to fall, there could
be non orderly attempts to provide public support to the producer price mechanism. Lastly,
postponing privatization or increasing the wage bill may please public sector employees but
would have long-term costs. The political risk i s mitigated by the Government's solid track
record o f commitment for reforms, the participatory process that led to the revision o f the
PRSP and guarantees a strong ownership of the reform program throughout the administration
and civil society. Embedding PRSC reforms in a medium-term framework and conditioning
credit approval to prior implementation o f reforms measures reduce the risk o f backtracking
and the influence o f vested interest to hold up reforms.

213.     Risks of regional instability are medium.Burkina Faso being a landlocked country,
it totally depends on its neighbors for delivery of goods to and out o f the country, and this
geographical dependence makes the country's economy vulnerable to any political instability
in the region. Recently, the political and security context in neighboring CBte d'Ivoire has
been a concern. So far, the negative impacts o f the crisis have been mainly economic - trade,
transport linkages and Government revenues. The humanitarian and social impacts of large
numbers o f displaced people have been relatively limited although this could change if the
situation deteriorates in light o f the close economic and social links. If large numbers of
BurkinabC return from CBte d'Ivoire, it will put a severe strain on the delivery o f social
services, which i s already weak and stretched

214.     The risks posed by the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire are being somewhat mitigated by the
adjustment already made by the economy when the crisis first eruptedinlate 2002, notably the
opening o f new routes to Benin, Togo and Ghana. The risk i s also alleviated through a
regional response to the impacts o f the crisis on neighboring countries by the African Union
and regional bodies. Membership in regional integration organizations, including ECOWAS
and the CFA Zone arrangement, not only provide mediation opportunities but also generate
pressure for a prompt resolution o f conflicts. Moreover, it is expected that the Government of
Burkina Faso will continue to demonstrate its commitment to the peaceful resolution o f this
conflict through continued support to the implementation o f the Linas-Marcoussis peace
agreement. Ifthe situation inCote d'Ivoire deteriorates with more BurkinabC returning home,
the Bank could consider increasing PRSC financing to provide timely support to the
Government and host communities.

Unofficial translation of the French original

Mr.James WOLFENSOHN
President
The World Bank
1818 HStreet, N.W.
Washington, D C 20433
U.S.A.

Subject: Letter o fDevelopment Policy

Mr.President:

1.      The aim o f this Letter o fDevelopment Policy (LDP) is to outline recent developments
in Burkina Fasols economic and social situation and the related prospects over the next two
years. This LDP i s based on the revised poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) and the
priority action program (PAP) associated with it. The Government adopted the PRSP by
decree in October 2004. The LDP focuses on the implementation o f the Government's
program o f key reforms, which i s supported by the poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) o f
the World Bank.

1.      STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRSP:
        THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PRSCs

2.      In 2004, the implementation of the PRSP continued to be the Government's
fundamental objective. Poverty incidence remains high with 46.4 percent o f the population
living below the poverty line in2003. However, recent analysis based on comparable welfare
indicators from the two household surveys o f 1998 and 2003 show that poverty declined by 8
percent points between these two years, down from an estimated level o f 56.4 percent in 1998.
This positive outcome i s the result o f continuous efforts in PRSP implementation, with
targetedprograms inpriority sectors.

3., The links between the central government budget, regarded as a major instrument for
implementing key reforms, and the PRSP were strengthened. Infact, as a result o f the process
o f using the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to allocate resources, PRSP
priorities were more effectively targeted in the budget law. Overall, based on budget law
appropriations, allocations to the social sectors (basic education and literacy, health, social
action, and national solidarity) in 2004 accounted for 25.4 percent o f the budget, excluding
debt service, tax exemptions, and external financing, compared to 22.6 percent in2003.

4.      Against the backdrop o f the uncertainties that characterize the economic, sub-regional,
and intemational environment (ongoing crisis in CBte d'Ivoire, low cotton prices, leap in oil
prices, drought in the north o f the country, and a the locust invasion in the Sahel), the
Government has stepped up the reform o f the budget and o f the sectoral programs supported
by the PRSC o f the World Bank. In fact, despite these adverse external shocks, the

                                             - 57 -

Government has maintained macroeconomic stability, and this resulted in the successful
completion - on February 2 2005 - by the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) o f the second and third reviews o f Burkina Faso's economic performance under a
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement.

5.      In2004, after the strong growth of 8.0 percent achieved in2003, the pace ofeconomic
activity slowed down as the GDP increased more moderately by 4.8 percent. The main
advances achievedunder the four PRSP pillars during the year are outlined below.

1.1.   Accelerating broad-based growth

6.      With a view to accelerating economic growth and ensuring that its benefits were
shared more broadly, the Government pursued the implementation o f measures aimed at
enhancing the competitiveness o f the agricultural and agro-alimentary production streams. A
major reform carried out in that regard was the transfer o f the assets o f the cotton company,
SOFITEX, in the eastern and central cotton-producing zones, to two private bidders. The new
companies FASOCOTON and SOCOMA have already started operating. A progress report
submittedto the Government served as basis for drafting a text reinforcing and reconcilingthe
principles and rules pertaining to cooperation betweenthe State and the private sector.

7.      A number of other activities were carried out in2004 inorder to improve the business
climate and raise the competitiveness o f the Burkina Faso economy. They included
accelerating the reforms undertaken in the telecommunications and energy subsectors,
adopting a new labor code (in September 2004), and privatizing the companies still owned by
the State. The ongoing liberalization o f the mobile telephone segment led to further rate
decreases and enhanced access to telephone services. The number o f mobile-telephone
subscribers increased by 67 percent, Le., from 239,590 in 2003 to 399,981 in 2004. ,The
outlook for ONATEL's privatization, which should reinforce the trends toward lower rates and
more subscribers, i s brighter since March 16, 2005, when the Council o f Ministers adopted a
new strategy, providing for private ownership o f most o f the company's capital by reducing
the State's share to 23 percent.

8.      In the energy sector, the participation of private operators in the subsectors of
electricity and hydrocarbons i s expected to lead to better management and, in the medium
term, reduced electricity-production costs. A new stage was reached when, on March 23,
2005, the Government adopted a draft law revising the legal and regulatory framework
regarding power supply in the country. The proposed framework i s in line with the electricity
sector strategy adopted in 2004.. The bill provides for the establishment o f an electricity
subsector regulatory body whose responsibilities, organization and operation will be
determined by a decree after enactment o f the law.

1.2.   Promoting access to basic social services by the poor

9.     The Govemment, aware o f the importance o f human capital development for
sustainable economic growth and job creation, made that component the second pillar o f the
PRSP. In view of the weak level o f relevant indicators and the considerable volume o f
resources required in order to speed up progress toward attaining the millennium development


                                             - 58 -

goals (MDGs), the Government gave top priority to basic education and health with regard to
resource allocation and drew up consistent sectoral programs taking into account the most
vulnerable social groups.

10.     The share of these two sectors in the budget remained substantial and increased
significantly over earlier years. As a result o f improved budget procedures, involving stronger
links betweenthe budget and the PRSP, the shares o f basic education and health inthe central
government budget, excluding debt service, tax exemptions, and external financing, increased,
respectively, on the basis of budget law appropriations, from 12.4 percent and 9.4 in 2003 to
14.4 and 10.2 percent in2004.

1.2.1. Access to basic education services

11.     In addition to government efforts aimed at providing the education sector with
substantial resources in line with the commitments made under the ten-year basic education
development plan (PDDEB), other initiatives were undertaken in order to enlarge
infrastructure and recruit additional teachers to make the new facilities operational. As a
result, basic education indicators clearly improved: According to the statistical yearbook o f
the Ministryo f Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA), gross admission rate to the first grade
in school year 2004-05 leaped by 4.5 percentage points, attaining 71.1 percent and 64.7
percent for girls.

12.     Gross enrollment rate in the 20 provinces with the lowest enrolment rates increased
from 28.6 percent in 2001 to 38 percent in 2004 as a result o f intensive government efforts
undertaken since PRSP implementation and aimed particularly at building infrastructure in
those areas. The achievement i s significant, but progress needto be stepped up given the still
unacceptably low enrolment and the gap with the millennium development goal for 2015. The
situation calls for reviewing the approach adopted and taking into consideration the specific
shortages o f education supply and demand in each community. An educational map will be
drawn up to serve as a basis for corrective measures.

13.     In order to improve the process o f resource allocation within the sector, an
experimental MTEF for the MEBA was validated in October 2004. The next step i s to extend
the procedure to the Ministry o f Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research
(MESSRS) in order to address post-primary education, by providing an overview o f linkages
throughout system, according to the provisions o fthe education policy law.

1.2.2. Access to basic health services

14.     The Government implemented various activities and reforms aimed at developing a
health system beneficial to the poor. To make the use o f resources allocated to the sector more
efficient, an experimental sectoral MTEF, consistent with the goals o f the national health
development program (PNDS) and the MDGs, has been drawn up for the period 2005-2007.

15.     To the same end, the Government has prepared a system o f subsidies for obstetrical
emergencies in order to reduce significantly the direct financial costs o f childbirth and
obstetrical treatment throughout the country with a view to lowering maternal mortality and


                                               - 59 -

morbidity. In addition, a framework for monitoring advance payments has been designed and
implemented in the Ministry o f Health and the Ministry o f Finance and Budget (MFB), The
policies o f free vaccination and o f reducing the prices of essential generic drugs (EGDs) were
further pursued.

16.     The steps taken by the Government have produced significant results in terms o f
improving the health system. Vaccination rates have increased through relevant programs,
including the distribution o f vitamin A supplements to children under five. In 2004, the
DCP3, BCG, yellow fever (VAA) and measles (VAR) coverage rates were respectively 88.39,
110.50, 76.02, and 78.34 percent.

1. 3.   Increasingemployment and income-generating activities for the poor

17.     Increasing employment opportunities and income-generating activities for the poor on
an equitable basis constitutes the third pillar o f the PRSP and the related program o f priority
reforms.

18. In 2004, the Government continued to promote cotton sector reforms by concluding
contracts for the transfer o f the eastem and central cotton-producing zones to new operators.
Moreover, initiatives were developed in order to strengthen the relevant regulatory
framework. To that end, a draft text reinforcing and reconciling the principles and rules
pertaining to the execution o f missions transferred or delegated to regional agricultural
chambers (CRAs), producer organizations (OPAs), interprofessions and the private sector was
drawn up. The final report o f the study will be validated at a workshop to be held at the end o f
March 2005. With regard to the institutional framework, an audit o f the Ministry o f
Agriculture, Water and Fisheries (MAHRH) was carried out. The results are presentedin two
documents, one containing the assessment and broad recommendations and the other outlining
organizational and operational schemes for institutional reforms.

18.     Regardingagricultural diversification, a unit was set up to manage the plan o f action
for the cereal production stream, and activities for implementingthe plan were launched.

19.     As a result of the reforms undertaken by the Government, cotton production in 2004-
05 shows a 13 percent increase and the volume o f cotton exports improved accordingly.
However, the fall in internal cotton prices compounded by the depreciation o f the dollar
resulted in low exports revenue. Inaddition the drought in the north o f the country and the
subsequent locust invasion in the Sahel caused a significant (18 percent) reduction in cereal
production, thereby impairing the attainment o f food security objectives.

1.4.    Promoting good governance

20.     In 2004, strengthening democracy and the rule o f law and improving public finance
management mechanisms continued to be top priorities for the Government.

21.     The 2005 budget, prepared on the basis o f the 2005-2007 MTEF sectoral envelops, is
consistent with PRSP priorities. The monitoring o f external financing was significantly
improved, particularlyby establishing inthe Directorate General for International Cooperation


                                               - 60 -

(DGCOOP) a project database and a table o f existing grants agreements in order to facilitate
statistical follow-up. A series o f texts were adopted to clarify the role o f the various actors
involved in the extemal financing process, in accordance with the recommendations o f the
West AFRITAC mission o f January 2004. In that connection, the Directorate o f information
processing services (DSI) was tasked in September 2004 with assessing all existing
information processing systems inthe MFB. Subsequently, the decision was taken to monitor
extemal financing under the public debt management electronic system (SYGADE) created by
UNCTAD. The relevant practical details are beingdefinedthrough an MFB circular that will
specify the roles o f the various actors, a steering committee i s being established and a plan o f
action for organizing the monitoring o f external financing under the SYGADE will be ready
bythe end o fApril 2005.

22.      With a view to improving budget reporting procedures and public accounting,
measures were taken to introduce an accounting system for government property. The bidding
process for the procurement o f the necessary software i s in the terminal phase o f publication
o f the results. Personnel training in government property accounting procedures and software,
and a scheduled physical inventory o f State moveable assets were delayed by a complaint filed
with the settlements committee by one of the tenderers after the publication o f the results of
the evaluation. The dispute was settled, the contract definitively awarded, and these activities
will now take place.

23.      However, in view o f the passage o f responsibilities to local authorities in the
framework o f decentralization, the Government conducted a physical inventory o f State assets
to be transferred in the areas o f basic and preschool education, health, sport, entertainment,
culture, and tourism. In the same vein, the Government has finalized the software for the
integrated accounting system for local communities (CICL). The software i s already in use in
four local communities.

24.      To complete existing public procurement procedures, the Government adopted on
December 15,2004 a decree containing general regulatory provisions on concession contracts.
Inthe same meeting,it decided to establish anationalcoordination andmonitoring committee
to follow up on reforms in the public procurement sector. That committee will replace the
working group set up under the 2003 decree to oversee the reform o f the public procurement
code.

2.       OUTLOOK FORTHE PERIOD 2005-2006

25.      The Government will continue to take action to further PRSP operationalization and to
improve dialogue with all stakeholders.

2.1.     Economic growth

26.      At the macroeconomic level, the Government plans to pursue the program o f reforms
in order to better underpin a stronger and shared economic growth, focusing on the
contribution o fthe private sector.




                                               - 61 -

27.     To enhance the competitiveness o f the economy and promote the private sector, the
Government will complete cotton industryreforms. Studies will be carried out with a view to
setting up an interprofession, establishing mechanisms for setting pi-ices and ensuring the
security o f payments to producers, and defining the role and functioning o f a standing
secretariat responsible for monitoring the industry after liberalization. These structures are
fundamental to the management and sustainable development o f the cotton industry and the
Government will ensure that they are operational bythe 2005-06 harvest.

28.      Efforts will be made to ensure a diverse source for growth through a support to
productive sectors as described in the priority action plan o f the PRSP. Exports o f oleaginous
products, cowpeas, fruits and vegetables, meat and poultry - for which action plans are
available  -will beparticularly stressed.

28.      The Government will accelerate the privatization program in 2005, with progress
expected in the privatization of ONATEL, SONABEL, the electricity company, and
SONABHY, the monopoly for imports o f petroleum products The completion o f these
privatization will contribute largely to improve the competitiveness o f the economy, through
expected lower factor costs. The privatization o f the ONATEL has beenjust resumed with the
adoption o f a new strategy envisaging the immediate transfer o f the majority o f the capital to
the private investor. In addition, a call for tenders for the management o f SONABEL was
already issued. The works on the power line interconnecting Bobo-Dioulasso and
Ouagadougou has started. These measures are expected to lead eventually to reduced cost and
significant supply increased.

2.2.     Development o f human resources

30.      Government policy aims at increasing substantially the resources allocated to the
social sectors. In 2005, allocations to these sectors (including for water, electricity and
projects counterparts) account for at least 26 percent o f the central government budget,
excluding heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) assistance and external project-financing.
Over and above ongoing social programs, these appropriations will fund targeted wage
increases for health- and education-staff in the rural areas and incentives designedto improve
its efficiency.

31.      In education, steps will be taken in 2005 to strengthen the existing program-based
budgeting and update the PDDEB. Moreover, subsidies to schools in the 20 provinces with
the lowest school enrollment rates will continue. Furthermore, to improve the quality o f the
educational system, the Government will develop a plan o f action for increasing the number
o fhours o f actual teaching.

32.      With regard to health, a system will be developed and set up inthe period 2005-2006
for a comprehensive monitoring o f resources allocated to hospitals, health districts, district
repeat deposits, and community health center (CSPS) management committees. The
management o f health resources will improve through a strengthening o f the program-based
budgeting.     Steps will be taken to implement the system for subsidizing obstetrical
emergencies and reducing the cost o f assisted birth. The expected significant reduction of the



                                              - 62 -

direct financial costs o f childbirth and obstetrical treatment throughout the country will
contribute to lowering maternal mortality and morbidity.

2.3.    Job creation

33.     The Government's job creation priorities for the period 2004-2005 consist in
professionalizing the actors involved in the various agricultural production streams. To that
end, provisions concerning the execution o fmissions transferred or delegated to CRAs, OPAs,
interprofessions, and the private sector will be adopted. The action plans regarding the fruits
and vegetables production stream will be implementedinthe same period

34.     The above measures will contribute to the creation o f acceptable jobs and the
significant increase o f income inthe rural areas.

2.4.    Promotion o f good governance

35.     At the political level, the Government i s aware o f the need o f reinforcing democratic
process, an essential prerequisite for national institution building and social stability. Inthat
connection, 2005 will be devoted to the organization o f fair and transparent presidential
elections.

36.     Regarding local governance, the Government i s committed to the effective
implementation o f decentralization. It plans to strengthen that process, particularly by
finalizing the framework for transferring resources and responsibilities to the communities
and the effective deployment o f the software for the integrated accounting system for local
communities (CICL) to all regions. The Government will also continue to expand the
delegation o f credit initiated in 2003, with the objective to include all regions by 2006.

37.     The improvement of economic governance is a constant objective o f the Government
which, accordingly, plans to reinforce budget management by providing the MFB with a
policy document aimed at the definitive implementation o f the budget management reform
plan (PRGB).

38.     The Government is currently undertaking a review o fthe nationalprocurement system,
recommendations o f which will be translated in an action plan to improve the existing
settings. Besides that action, priority will be given to budget preparation procedures to
establish a closer links between the PRSP process and the budget. Government activities in
that area will therefore aim at disseminating the use o f budget programming tools (global and
sectoral MTEFs, and program budgets) in the sectoral ministries. In addition, the efforts will
be made in 2005 to ensure a better monitoring o f external financings through the
hnctionalities offered by the software SYGADE. Within this framework, it i s envisaged that a
steering committee will be established to supervise the adoption and implementation o f an
action plan, including the following key measures in 2005: adaptation o f the software to the
needs for the various agencies involved in the process, development o f an interface with the
computerized circuit o f the expenditure and the integrated accounting system o f the State, and
training o frelevant staffs to the use o fthe software



                                                - 63 -

39.    The Government plans to continue the development o f the integrated revenue circuit
(CIR), to implementing its first module. The Government will also finalize the software o f the
accounting system for government property, and will carry out the physical inventory o f
Government property.

40.    The Government firmly believes in the effectiveness o f the initiatives and measures
outlined above. They have been designed with a view to implementing the program o f priority
actions under the PRSP and promoting subsequent PRSCs. Their implementation i s expected
to contribute to strengthening the macroeconomic framework and to favor a more robust and
sustainable economic growth, necessary for a significant reduction o fpoverty.

   IMFExecutiveBoard Completes Second and Third Reviews Under BurkinaFaso's
            PRGFArrangement and Approves US$10.5 Million Disbursement

1.      On February 2, 2005, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the second and third reviews o f Burkina Faso's economic performance under a
SDR 24.08 million (about US$36.6 million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement (see Press ReleaseNo. 03/52). The completion o f the reviews enables the release
o f a further SDR 6.88 million (about UScSl0.5 million), which will bring the total amount
drawn under the arrangement to SDR 13.76 million (about US$20.9 million).

2.      Incompleting the reviews,the ExecutiveBoardgranted awaiver ofthe nonobservance
of two structural performance criteria and agreed to extend the three-year arrangement by two
months to August 2006 from June 2006.

3.      Following the Executive Board's discussion o f Burkina Faso, Anne 0.Krueger, First
DeputyManagingDirector and Acting Chair, stated:

4.      "Burkina Faso's economy performed well during 2004. Economic growth remained
robust and inflation low, and fiscal revenue and expenditure targets were met. However,
several challenges to sustaining economic success lie ahead, especially in the face o f a sharp
fall inworld cotton prices, a rise inoil prices, and worsening debt indicators. These challenges
need to be addressed decisively if Burkina Faso i s to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment
Goals and debt sustainability.

5.      "The authorities' emphasis on price flexibility and on steps to strengthen
competitiveness i s well placed. If the world price o f cotton does not rebound in the coming
months, all parties-including       the govemment as shareholder in the largest ginning
company-are     encouraged to discuss ways to increase the pass-through of world prices to all
participants in the sector. Inthe electricity sector, the gradual move toward pricing based on
cost recovery as well as the ongoing investment program will increase efficiency and improve
the competitiveness o f the economy. With regard to labor market reform, the decrees and
regulations that accompany the recently passed labor law should be issued expeditiously, as
the new regulatory framework will help improve labor market flexibility and reduce the cost
of doing business inBurkina Faso.

                                              - 102 -

6.      "The authorities will continue to focus on poverty-reducing, pro-growth policies while
reducing the external debt ratios in the medium term. The reorientation o f public spending in
key social sectors i s welcome, and the planned increase in the wage bill i s rightly targeted
primarily to the priority health and education sectors. The wage increase i s consistent with the
overall spending limits under the government's economic program. The projected fiscal deficit
i s expected to be financed with net donor flows in the form o f grants, debt relief, and highly
concessional borrowing. The external debt burden i s projected to decline in 2005, and a
further reduction o f the highdebt burden remains a key priority over the medium term. Inthis
regard, critical policy priorities will be to maintain prudent fiscal policies, obtain more grants,
and continue the outward-oriented and efficiency-enhancing reform agenda.

7.      "Ongoing efforts to strengthen good governance should be bolstered by a swift follow-
up on the findings of the report o f the High Authority on the Coordination o f the Fight
Against Corruption," Ms.Krueger said.

                             Annex 10: Recent Cotton Prices Developments

8.       Internationalprices o f cotton fiber - measured by the Cotlook A Index12- plummeted
from US$76 cents inJanuary 2004 to US$48 cents per pound inDecember 2004. The impact
of intemational prices i s compounded by the appreciation o f the CFAF against the U S dollar.
Estimated average pnce in2004/2005 i s US$52 cents per pound, down from US$68.3 cents in
2003/2004 (see table 1 below). The drop in prices was fueled by record world production
which outpaced world consumption. According to the International Cotton Advisory
Committee (ICAC), world ending stocks in 2005/2006, would be equivalent to 45 percent o f
world consumption.

9.       International cotton prices have fluctuated considerably in the recent period, but
current market conditions suggest that the adverse shock on prices may not be temporary,
although prices could occasionally reboundincertainyearsI3.The factors behindthe increased
world supply are likely to remain in the next few years, thus continuing to depress prices.
World production i s currently driven by subsidies in the United States, the EU and China, as
well as by new cotton production areas inChina, Brazil and Turkey, and byproductivity gains
from genetically engineered ~ o t t o n ' ~ .Available estimates indicate that removal o f US
subsidies could increase world price by about 12 cents per lb.15 However, progress in the
negotiations to remove the subsidies inthe United States, China and the EUare slow16.

l6 August 2, 2004, the WTO General Council reached a decision on the frameworks to proceed with
    On
agricultural negotiations. The decision included the "cotton initiative" by the four West African countries and
emphasized that it should be addressed "ambitiously, expeditiously, and specifically." On September 8, 2004, the
WTO's Dispute Settlement Body posted its ruling on the cotton dispute brought by Brazil. According to the
ruling, the U S is under obligation to "take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects ... or withdraw the
subsidy."    On March 2005, the WTO upheld that decision after the USA filed an appeal Source: The World

10.     The drop in international prices i s putting significant stress on the domestic producer
prices mechanism.       Domestic prices o f seed-cotton are composed o f a floor price o f
CFAF175kg and a bonus (ristourne) representing 50 percent o f the pre-tax profit from the
previous campaign. According to existing arrangement, the floor price is a breakeven price
for the ginning companies. The floor price was kept constant at CFAF160 per kilo from 1999
to 2001. It was increased to CFAF175 in 2001. The mechanism i s backed by a support fund
@rids de soutien) created in 1998 and managed jointly by the producers and the ginning
companies. The fund was initially endowed through the transfer o f the then Stabilization
Fund, and is replenishedby farmers on a voluntary basis out of their profits. Untilrecently,
this mechanism has worked reasonably well with no need o f public subsidies, an exception
across Africa. Even in 2001/2002, when international prices reached a low US$42 cents/lb
for cotton fiber, the cotton sector did not need public subsidies. This time, the combination o f
low international prices and the depreciation o f the dollar i s creating an additional burden on
the mechanism.

11.     When SOFITEX announced in March 2004 a bonus of CFAF35 for the crop season
2004/2005, resulting in a overall domestic price o f CFAF210/kg7intemational prices were
still high. The bonus was based on the record profits o f CFAF26 billion in 200312004 as a
result o f strong international prices (US$68 centsllb) and highproduction (203 thousands tons
o f fiber). The announcement was the basis o f producers' planting decision and it i s being
honored by SOFITEX. Preliminary indications are that the ginning companies will suffer
significant financial losses in 2004/2005, although the variance between final outcomes and
current estimates could be quite large given the uncertainties on international cotton price.

12.     As of February 2005, SOFITEX had sold only 40 percent of its production. It sold
above the market price because o f a good management o f forward sales. Assuming the
remaining o f the production will be sold at the latest Cotlook indices o f US$54 cents, the
losses o f the three ginning companies (most o f the losses for SOFITEX which i s financing the
bonus on the entire production) could be estimated at about C F A F l l billion in 2004/2005
(about 0.2 percent o f the 2005 GDP). SOFITEX could entirely finance the losses through its
profits in 2003/2004, and its capital gains from the sales o f its assets in the Eastem and
Central regions. The challenge will remain for the sector to cope with larger losses if low
international prices and weak dollar continue during the 2005/2006 crop season. The
challenge i s evenbigger now that the sector i s ina more fragile financial situation.

13.     This pricing scheme will be effective until December 2005. Producer prices for
2005/2006 will be negotiated in April 2005 between farmers' organizations and the three
ginning companies although the ginning companies have already indicated they could not pay
a bonus in2005-06. Duringthe discussion with the IMF inthe context o f the second and third
review o f the PRGF17, the Government has indicated that if world prices do not rebound,
these negotiations could result in a producer price that might have severe poverty implications
for farmers or result inunsustainable financial losses for the companies. Should this scenario
materialize, the Government would expect farmers and companies to absorb a major part o f
the required adjustment, and also to consult with the development partners to find a way
forward.

14.       In 2005, the impact of cotton developments on GDP will ultimately depend on the
acuity o f producers on the prices and their response to the disparities. Deplorable level o f
producer price would be a disincentive to plant cotton and could even trigger a halt o f
production. If the producer price i s high enough to generate only a modest adverse supply
shock, the cotton sector's contribution to overall GDP growth will remain positive through
spillovers on other sectors o f the economy generated by the marketing and transportation o f
the record production in2004-2005, and by the CFAF214 billion gross incomes distributed to
producers in 2004-2005. Available estimates indicate that the growth multiplier o f the cotton
sector i s 1.88.

15.       The producer price in 2005 should also have an impact on poverty. Table 3 provides
estimations o f this impact under different producer prices. The analysis i s carried in a very
simple way: we measure the income obtained from cotton production by households, assess
the difference in income that would follow alternative producer prices, and assume that this
difference in income translates into an equivalent difference in the consumption per
equivalent adult of households used to measure poverty. More sophisticated methods could
be used to measure the "general equilibrium" effect o f a drop in cotton producer prices, but
such simulations require a much larger number o f assumptions which are subjected o f debate.
The estimations given here provide "first round" poverty effects from lower producer prices,
assuming that households can't compensate their cotton income loss through other activities".

16.       The simulations are implementedusing the household survey for 1997-1998, because
in the 2003 survey, we observe only a fairly small number of cotton producers, so that the
survey may not be representative enough for this population group. The headcount index of
poverty is simply the share o f the population with a level o f consumption per equivalent adult
below the moderate poverty line. The poverty gap takes into account the distance separating
the poor from the poverty line. The squared poverty gap takes into account the square o f that
distance (and thereby the inequality among the poor). The poverty line i s that used in the

`*Work by World Bank staff on Burkina Faso using data for 1996-97 and 1997-98 seasons suggests that the
ability of cotton producers to compensate for losses inrevenues (inthat year, due to a drought) i s fairly limited.

    latest World Bank Poverty Assessment for Burkina Faso. To interpret the results, note that in
    1997-1998, we find a modal price o f 180 Fcfdkg in the survey, which i s close to the current
    price around 175Fcfdkg. The share o f cotton producers inpoverty, at 53.9 percent, i s similar
    to that observed for the population as a whole (54.6 percent in 1997-98). . Note also that
    although the level o fpoverty observed inthe 1997-98 survey i s significantly higher than inthe
    2003 survey (see table 3 and paragraph 15 in the main text o f this document), the impact on
    poverty o f changes in producer prices i s likely to remain roughly similar over time. Table 3
    below suggests that a 20 Fcfa/kg reduction in price would lead to an increase in the share o f
    producers in poverty of about 3.5 percentage points, which i s significant. For poorer
    producers, who may be less diversified, the negative impact could be even larger, and the
    resultingincrease inpoverty could also have negative impacts for other indicators interms o f
    education- and health-related MDGs.

    17.       Intable 4, which provides basic data on cotton production by decile of consumption
    per capita in the 1997-98 survey, the total production of cotton observed in the survey is at
    607,213 tons. In other countries, subsidies to producers are considered on an exceptional
    basis in case world prices are very low. Who would benefit from such subsidies in Burkina
    Faso? Table 4 suggests that cotton production i s higher among richer deciles, with the bottom
    half o f the population (which represents the poor) accounting for less than 40 percent o f total
    production. This implies that richer households would receive a higher share o f price support
    mechanisms in Burkina Faso. Still, the share o f potential support to producers that would be
    provided by the Government under very low world price would probably still compare
    favorably with the corresponding shares ofpublic spendingthat reach the poor inother sectors
    (such as education and health). This being said, rather than providing uniform quantity-based
    cotton subsidies incase o f low world prices, it would be better to consider ways to target such
    potential subsidies, or to find better ways to protect poor producers from cotton price shocks,
    so that an even larger share of the measures implemented for such protection mechanisms
    would benefit the poor.

18.    The shock. Oil prices increased by 31.5 percent in 2004, from US$28.9 per barrel to
US$39.0 per barrel" as a result o f a strong demand. The Development Prospects Group
(DPG) at the World Bank forecasts a gradual deceleration o f prices in 2005 and 2006 given
new sources o f supply and reduced oil intensities in the world economy. Despite the
deceleration, prices should remain high in 2005 and 2006 at US$36/bbl and US$32/bbl,
respectively.     DPG wams about the upside risks in prices development because o f the
sensitivity o f oil markets to localized disruptions in production and, the fall in OPEC excess
capacity from 4.6 million barrels per day in 2001 to only 1.4 million barrels per day in 2004.
Moreover, DPG observes that further hikes would not be unprecedented because oil prices
remain well below past peaks: corrected for inflation and expressed in 2003 dollars, oil prices
averaged $72 in 1980, and evenreached $100 inNovember 1979.

19.     The impact. Burkina Faso is a net oil importer and the prices hike is taking a heavy
toll on the extemal sector, on consumers, on government finances and on the economy. Oil
imports increased in 2004 to US$190.2 million, up from 134.2 million in 2003. Oil imports
as a share o f GDP i s increasing from 3.1 percent in 2003 to 4.2 percent in 2005. Assuming
the 2003 oil price as the baseline, the additional burden due to the prices hike i s about
US$42.3 million, equivalent to 0.8 percent o f the GDP. Additional burden in 2005 will be
US$59.9 million, equivalent to 1.1percent o f GDP

                    I/IMFstaff report,EBS95/05. December 22,2004. IMF forecast for oil price in 2005 is higherthan the projection of
                   US36 by the Bank. The price of USS41.8hbl is consistent with other figures in the table.


20.     Consumers are bearing the brunt of the domestic adjustment to high international
prices.   Retail prices for petroleum products are adjusted monthly to fluctuations in oil
international prices. Although the domestic impact o f the rising intemational oil prices has
been mitigated by the appreciation o f the CFAF against the U S dollar, there was a steep
increase in retail prices in 2004. High consumer prices may lead to higher poverty. Table 4
provides data on per capita expenditures for various oil-related products.                                       While such
expenditures represent a lower share of total spending for poorer households, this share is not
negligible. Intable 4, simulations are provided for the impact on poverty o f various levels o f
increases in the price of oil-related products. For example, a 50 percent increase in prices
would lead to an increase in the headcount index o f poverty o f about 1.2 percentage points.

However, this represents only the impact o f higher prices for oil-related consumer goods.
Higher transportation and energy costs would also create an extra burdenon firms and on the
overall economic activity, which may dampen employment and lead to inflation in the
production costs of other goods, so that we would witness price increases for these other
goods as well. Inother words, it i s likely that the impact o f higher oil prices on poverty could
be substantially higher than suggested intable 5.

1.      CONTEXT AND JUSTIFICATION

1.      By adopting a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in2000, which was revisedin
2004, the Burkinabe Government affirmed its desire to situate its work in this area within a
coherent framework, in order to strengthen its impact. The PRSP outlines the Government's
poverty reduction strategy, for which the Priority Action Program (PAP-PRSP) serves as the
implementation mechanism. The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework i s the budgetary
allocation mechanism (sectoral and intra-sectoral) for budgetary resources, in accordance with
the priorities set forth inthe PRSP.

2.      Using, among other things, the main conclusions o f the test conducted between 1997
and 2000 on the reformulation of the conditionality applied to Burkina Faso, a number o f
technical and financial partners decided to support PRSP implementation through non-
targeted budgetary assistance. This form of assistance, which has been expanded since 2000,
has necessitated adaptation of intervention mechanisms and assigns responsibility to the
Government for the management and allocation o f resources, based on the priorities outlined
inthe PRSP andreflectedinthe annualbudgetlaws.

3.      Assumption of this responsibility has given rise to the Government's assumption o f
greater accountability as regards both the public and its partners as regards the use o f
resources. For this reason, the Government has implemented (i)    a budget management reform
plan, adopted in July 2002, intended to enhance on a sustainable basis the transparency,
reliability, and efficiency o f budget management; and (ii)a Priority Action Program to
implementthe PRSP, adopted inOctober 2004, outlining the quantitative results expected and
the keymeasures for achieving them.

4.      This agreement, which i s in keepingwith the spirit o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper, sets forth the principles and procedures for the formulation and implementation o f
budgetary assistance programs to support PRSP implementation in Burkina Faso, as well as
the mutual commitments o f the Government o f Burkina Faso ("the Government") and the
technical and financial partners ("the partners").      It is called the General Framework
Agreement for Organizing Budgetary Assistance to Support Implementation o f Burkina Faso's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (CGAB-PRSP) [Cadre generale d'organisation des appuis
budgetaires en soutien au cadre strategique de lutte contre lapauvrete, CGAB-PRSP].

5.      The CGAB-PRSP was prepared owing to the realization that the myriad procedures o f
the partnersand the lack of harmonization o f conditionalities and alignment of programs with
the PRSP and budget cycles are imposing great constraints on the Government and are
noticeably curbing the effectiveness o f budgetary assistance provided. This agreement draws
on the lessons learned from the implementationof the memorandum o f understanding onjoint
budgetary support for implementation o f the PRSP, the practices in effect in this regard in
other countries, and the main initiatives conducted both nationally and intemationally, in
particular, within the framework of the Strategic Partnership with Afiica (SPA) and the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and in light of developments related to the
February25,2004 Rome Declarationon Harmonization.

6.      The CGAB-PRSP will be supplemented by individual agreements between each
technical and financial partner and the Government. The partners guarantee compatibility

                                            - 114-

between the substance of their financing procedures and the spirit and provisions o f the
CGAB, which is annexed to the bilateral agreements on budgetary assistance or the country
assistance strategy documents.

2.       OVERALL OBJECTIVESAND PRINCIPLES

7.       The overall objective o f the CGAB-PRSP i s to support implementation o f the PRSP
through non-targeted budgetary assistance while enhancing its effectiveness and reducing its
management costs.

8.       The following are the specific objectives o fthe CGAB-PRSP:

   Contributing to greater involvement by the Government indefining and implementing the
   poverty reduction strategy;

   Improving dialogue betweenthe Government and partners through the establishment o f a
   meaningful partnership, with emphasis placed on the effectiveness o f government policy;

   Makingmedium-termresources more predictable and ensuring that disbursement i s
    synchronized with the budget cycle;

   Achieving greater harmonization o fthe practices o fpartners with respect to the
    implementation o fbudgetary support and the determination o f the conditionalities for
    disbursement;

    Improving coordination among partners throughjoint and coordinated missions, studies,
    audits, and assessments;

    Fostering capacity-building among the parties concerned (partners and Government).


         The Government and partnershave agreed on the following basic principles:

    The Government will spearhead coordination o f budgetary assistance and implementation
    o f the CGAB;
    The CGAB will constitute the joint framework for determining and implementing the
    budgetary assistanceprovided for PAP-PRSP implementation;
    The PRSP, PAP-PRSP, and the latter's annual implementation reports will underpin all
    the supporting components o f budgetary assistance, whether they pertain to policy
    measures, results indicators, or the budget management reform program and its annual
    implementation reports.
    Budgetary assistance will be disbursed in the form o f non-targeted budgetary assistance.
    This assistance will be used to finance expenditures appearing in the annual budget law
    and will be in line with national procedures ineffect.

10.      The partners will follow the principles guaranteed by the CGAB by drafiing bilateral
agreements that are consistent and compatible with the provisions o f the CGAB. The CGAB
will take the form o f an annex to bilateral agreements or country assistance strategy
documents. These bilateral agreements will stipulate mainly the specific terms governing
each form o f assistance, that is, the total amount o f budgetary assistance provided, as well as

                                              - 115 -

information pertaining to tranches, namely the timetable, criteria, and procedures for
disbursement o f each tranche. Each partner will reserve the right to include a number o f its
own specific terms, but will keep them to a minimum.

3.      MANAGEMENTPROCEDURESAND DISBURSEMENTCRITERIA

11.     Provisions will be made by the Government inthe initial and amended budget laws for
budgetary assistance tranches scheduled to be disbursed annually, following consultation with
the partners.

12.     Assistance will be disbursed annually in one or several tranches, based on an
assessment o f the progress made inthe macroeconomic, poverty reduction, and public finance
management spheres. Although joint assessments and evaluations will serve as a basis for
disbursement, actual disbursementdecisions will be made by eachpartner.

13.     The disbursement criteria for the tranches related to the macroeconomic component
will be based on the pertinent evaluation performed by the International Monetary Fund
(MF).

14.     The disbursement criteria for the tranches related to the poverty reduction strategy will
be based on the PRSP Priority Action Program and its annual updates, as part o f the relevant
annual review and evaluation processes. The criteria jointly agreed upon in this area will be
summarized in a matrix, to be updated annually.

15.     The disbursement criteria for the tranches related to public finance management will
be based on the Priority Action Program for the budget management reform program and its
annual updates, as part o f the relevant annual review and evaluation processes. The criteria
jointly agreed upon inthis area will be summarized ina matrix, to be updated annually.

16.     The partners undertake to use the disbursement criteria derived from the documents
mentioned in items 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 above. The Government will prepare reports that are
sufficiently detailed and precise to permit the partners clearly to identify and evaluate
disbursement criteria, as well as the extent to which they have been applied, in order to make
a decision related to disbursement.

17.     The criteria set forth in items 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 above must be realistic, attainable
by the Government, and limited innumber. Assessment o f the extent of execution o f policy
measures and results achieved, which constitute disbursement criteria, will take exogenous
factors into account.

18.     Inthe event of exogenous shocks that have a major impact on economic and social
conditions and consequently on the Government's ability to meet a number o f the
disbursement criteria outlined in items 3.3., 3.4, 3.5 above, the Government may enter into
discussions with the partners on the effects of these shocks and request the elimination o f one
or several criteria. The Government will be responsible for providing all the information
neededto substantiate its request, which will be used by each partner concerned as a basis for
making individual decisions regarding whether or not the Government's request will be
granted.


                                             - 116-

19.     The occurrence of various unexpected events that are likely to: (i)threaten
macroeconomic stability; (ii)   make achievement o f poverty reduction objectives unlikely; or
even (iii) jeopardize the sound management o f public affairs, could lead one or several
partners to undertake discussions with the Government and the other partners in order to
remedy or mitigate the impact o f such situations.           These discussions may lead to the
identification o f corrective measures, the implementation o f which may go so far as to make
the disbursement of budgetary assistance tranches in progress or scheduled for a later date,
subject to conditions.     In such situations, the justification for such action will be clearly
outlined by the partner(s) in question.

20.     The Government will provide partners with the number o f the public treasury account
opened in the name o f the Central Accounting Officer (Agent comptable central) o f the
Treasury (ACCT) listed on the books o f the Central Bank o f West African States (BCEAO) as
beingauthorized to receive budgetary support payments when thejoint agreement takes effect.

21.     The funds disbursed for each tranche will be deposited and posted on the value date o f
notification o f the recording o f funds by the BCEAO. The exchange rate used will be the rate
agreed upon with each partner inthe budgetary assistance agreement. The BCEAOwill credit
the account indicated above o f the Central Accounting Officer o f the Treasury with the
equivalent amount in CFA francs o f the currency in question on the date of receipt o f each
tranche.

22.     The Government will inform the partners, as soon as possible, o f the amount, dates,
and terms o f the transfers received in the account mentioned pursuant to item 3.8. Budgetary
assistance tranches paid out annually will be recorded in the general balance o f Treasury
accounts and reflected inthe annual budget settlement law.

23.     At the end o f each budget year, an audit will be conducted o f the financial flows o f
budgetary assistance provided through the treasury account opened in the name o f the ACCT,
mentioned in item 3.10. This audit will be performed by an outside auditor who will be
recruited and remunerated as agreed by the Government and partners.

4.      FRAMEWORKFOR EVALUATINGPROGRESS


24.     Underlying the CGAB is a series o f joint poverty reduction reform and performance
objectives agreed uponby the Government and partners which are based on the PRSP.

25.     The Government and partners will use the various evaluation frameworks, described
below, when implementing budgetary assistance, in order to limit parallel reviews by each
partner.

26.     To evaluate the progress made inthe macroeconomic sphere, the partners, recognizing
the role and expertise o f the IMF, will use the results o f the work done bythat institution. The
Government will organize, at the start o f each macroeconomic mission, a meeting to present
the objectives o f the mission to the partners and, upon completion of the work, a feedback
session on the results o f the mission.




                                               - 117-

27.     To evaluate the progress made in the area o f poverty reduction, the partners will rely
on the national mechanism in place, specifically the annual PRSP review, based on an
examination o f the annual report on its implementation.           Sectoral policy reviews will
supplementand cover ingreater depth a number o f areas covered inthe annual PRSP review.

28.     The annual report on PRSP implementation for year N, which will look forward to
year N+1,will cover:

   An overview ofyear Nfocusing on the various pillars ofthe PRSP, linkingreforms and
    strategic decisions made, financial resources used and results obtained, and projections
    covering a three-year period (N+1to N+3);
   An overall and sectoral budgetoverview for year Nandbudgetprogrammingcovering
   years N+1to N+3,which are consistent with PRSP thrusts;
   A timetable o f activities linkedto annual PRSP monitoring, including those activities
    involving state institutions and civil society, inkeepingwith the budget cycle;
   A matrix o fPRSP indicators and priority measuresthat shows the achievements for year
   N,basedonthematrix agreeduponduringthe previousreview andthe objectives set for
    years N+1to N+3.

29.     In order to evaluate progress made in the area of public finance management, the
partners will rely on the national mechanism for monitoring the budget management reform
program, inparticular the annual session to review the overall report on the implementationo f
this program for the year ending. A number o f analyses and evaluations o f the practices and
progress in the area of public finance management, such as periodic reviews o f public
procurement and public expenditure, may be used to supplement this report or obtain more
details, usinga basis agreed upon annually by the partnersand the Government.

30.     The annual report on the implementation o f the budget management reform program
will include:

    An overview o fexecutionofthe program's priority actions, including an assessmento fthe
    results obtained inrelation to the objectives set, and the outlook for the year ahead, with a
    clear indication o f the objectives to be achieved and the resources to be implementedin
    order to achieve them.
    A matrix ofindicators and priority measurespertainingto public finance management that
    shows the achievements for year N,based on the matrix agreed upon duringthe previous
    review and the objectives set for years N+1to N+3.

31.     The Government and partners will agree each year on a timetable o f the main CGAB
events, as well as the number o f evaluations and the frequency o f conducting them. The
partners will make endeavor to ensure that their concerns inthis regard are taken into account,
inorder to reduce to a bare minimumthe number o f individual evaluations that take place in
the context o fbilateral agreements.

32.     This process will enable the partners to evaluate the extent to which medium-term
objectives set by common agreement have been achieved, as well as the progress made with

                                               - 118-

specific measures in the macroeconomic sphere, PRSP implementation, and public finance
management.      Each year, the partners will submit an aide-memoire to the Government
providing their assessment and recommendations at the end o f the annual PRSP review. The
progress made will determine the appropriate level o f financing to be earmarked inthe budget.

33.     However, should the quality o f the information provided be found wanting, the
partners and Government will jointly establish a timetable and determine the assistance that
the partners are positioned to provide in order to build the capacity necessary to obtain this
information.

5.      UNDERTAKINGSOFTHE GOVERNMENT


34.     In accordance with its laws, regulations, policies, and procedures, and subject to the
availability o fresources, the Government undertakes to:

    Demonstrate the determination to reduce poverty inthe process o f sectoral allocation o f
    all resources and expenditure, and inthe preparationo f the annual budget law;

    Resolutely combat corruption in order to strengthen good economic governance.

35.      The Government undertakes to produce documents and reports related to
macroeconomic management, poverty reduction, and public finance management that are
sufficiently detailed and precise to permit the partners to identify their disbursement criteria
andperiodically assess the extent to which they havebeen achieved.

36.      The Government will provide the partners with the documents and reports agreed upon
for monitoring the implementation o freforms and results achieved inthe areas of:

5.      UNDERTAKINGSOFTHE DEVELOPMENTPARTNERS

37.     The partners will work with the Government to support and facilitate PAP-PRSP
implementation, in the context o f the budgetary assistance covered in this framework
agreement and o f the supplementary assistance provided through their development programs
and projects, inparticular inthe area o f capacity-building.

38.     In keepingwith the spirit o f this agreement, and taking into account the thinking in
international circles on these issues, the partners undertake to:

    Make their medium-term assistance more predictable by:
        *      Informing the Government o f the indicative commitments relatedto budgetary
               assistance for the next two or three years inorder to facilitate the Medium-Term

6.       CGAB MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROCESS

39.      Regular dialogue i s essential to ensure proper implementation o f the CGAB-PRSP.
The parties will meet every six months to monitor and evaluate jointly the status o f execution
and the extent to which CGAI3-PRSP objectives have been achieved, as well as the extent to
which CGAB-PRSP stakeholder commitments have beenmet.

40.      The annual timetable for monitoring/evaluation meetings and the activities pertaining
thereto are established at the start o f each year on the basis o f the indicative timetable annexed
hereto. Additional meetings may be organized o n an ad hoc basis by the Government or
partners on any matter related to CGAB-PRSP implementation, where necessary. However,
the number o f these meetings will be limitedas much as possible.

41.      The Government and partners may use the services o f external experts to assist with
the CGAB-PRSP evaluation exercise. The procedures for recruitment and remuneration o f
the expert will be agreed uponbetween the Government and partners.

42.      The parties will accord great importance to the CGAB-PRSP results, which should
facilitate more in-depth dialogue between them and, as necessary, lead to the strengthening o f
a number o fprovisions o f this agreement.

The procedures related to the CGAB-PRSP monitoring and evaluation process will be set
forth inrules o fprocedures agreed upon by the signatories.

7.       CAPACITY-BUILDING

43.      The partners will work with the Government to assist with buildingcapacity among all
the stakeholders involved in the various areas involved in the implementation of the joint
framework agreement.      Other than their budgetary assistance, partners who so desire may
support the institutional capacity-building activities o f the steering and management entities o f
the ministries and institutions involved in PRSP implementation and in the budget

                                               - 121-

management reform program. Inso doing, they will endeavor, insofar as possible, to use local
expertise (including government agencies) to conduct certain studies that are essential to
attainment o f the objectives set forth inthejoint framework agreement.

44.      The partnerswill ensure the joint and coordinated formulation and implementation o f
their assistance, on the basis o f Government proposals. This assistance may extend to civil
society entities, with a view to enhancing their dialogue with the Government on poverty
reduction issues.

45.      Capacity-building may extend to the personnel o f the partners incertain areas, inorder
to facilitate a better understanding o f the main aspects o f budgetary assistance as well as the
objectives and activities to be carried out within the framework o f this agreement.

8.       PARTICIPATION, AMENDMENT, WITHDRAWAL, CANCELLATION

46.      This agreement, concluded betweenthe signatories, is open to all partners wishing to
become parties thereto, and who accept the terms and conditions for provision o f their
budgetary assistance. Being a party to the agreement does not imply a commitment by the
party thereto to provide resources on a systematic basis each year. It does, however, guarantee
that the main principles o f this agreement will be observed.

47.      The CGAB-PRSP may be amended by exchange o f letters, in accordance with the
terms agreed uponby all the partners and by the Government.

48.      Inthe event of a proposalto suspend or withdraw budgetary assistance for the PRSP,
in whole or in part, the Government and the partner concerned will also consult the other
parties to the framework agreement. Should a partner request palliative measures or should
the support o f a partner no longer be available, the Government will review the technical and
budgetary implications inconsultation with the other partners.

49.      Any dispute related to implementation o f the CGAB-PRSP shall be settled through a
process o f dialogue and cooperation between the partnersand the Government.

10.      CONTINUITY

50.      The CGAB-PRSP represents a significant shift in the focus o f the dialogue between
the Government and the partners, as well as in the coordination between same. The partners
and the Government undertake to develop and improve the procedures adopted for budgetary
assistance in accordance with the principles set forth and taking account o f international
developments inthis regard.

Introduction

1.       This document analyzes the potential environmental and social impacts o f the reforms
supported by the fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-5) for Burkina Faso. Since
PRSCs take the form o f a series o f successive operations, the analyses contained in this report are
based extensively on the contents o f the environmental assessment (EA) report for previous
PRSCs.

Generalcontext and descriptionof projectobjectives

2.       PRSC-5 i s the fifth operation in a series o f credits and grants to support implementation o f
the poverty reduction strategy adopted by the Government o f Burkina Faso. It supports the
government objectives of maintaining a sound macroeconomic environment and accelerating
growth, through budget support. In particular, the operation i s designedto strengthen short-term
macroeconomic management and promote the creation o f the necessary economic and
institutional environment in order to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency o f public
expenditure and achieve sustainable improvement o f key social indicators.

3.       Like its predecessors, PRSC-5 will continue to support the reform program adopted and
implemented by the Government. For example, in addition to sound budgetary management, the
operation will also support improvements in delivery o f basic services, particularly inthe areas of
education and health, and stimulate growth sources through structural reforms and increased
investment in rural development. In brief, PRSC-5 emphasizes reforms designed to accelerate
growth, develop human resources and promote good governance. Its principal activities and
objectives are described below.

1. Accelerating growth and employment creation. PRSC-5 supports the implementation o f
several measures to increase productivity and reduce factor costs. In particular, under PRSC-5,
the Government has continued its efforts to increase' agricultural productivity and create
employment in the rural sector. The agriculture sector i s the main source o f employment and
income for about 80 percent of the population o f Burkina Faso. It also generates considerable
growth and employment links with the potentially dynamic sector represented by the non-
agricultural rural economy. The agriculture sector i s also the main source o f growth for the
economy, contributing 90 percent o f export earnings. Despite the relatively good performance of
Burkina Faso at the macroeconomic level, the incidence o f poverty remains high, particularly in
the rural areas where 51 percent of the population lives below the poverty income threshold.
There is an urgent need to reduce the pressure exerted by rapid demographic growth on the
limited and fragile resources o f the land. In particular, intensification o f farming and rapid
technological change are perceived as a means o f increasing the productive potential o f the land
and o f improving living conditions in rural areas. The Government has prepared strategic
guidelines for the agriculture sector covering four topics:


    0    Modernization o f agriculture (improved seeds, water management, fertilizers, agricultural
         equipment).
    0    Soil fertility management.
    0    Support for producer organizations.
    0    Capacity building.
Inthiscontext, the Government adopteda global ruraldevelopment strategy at the end of2003.

Key issueso f safeguards and mitigatingmeasures

17.      The potential environmental and social impacts o f PRSC-5 stem from its sectoral
coverage. These impacts, which are mainly linked to the measures for rural development,
privatization o f ONATEL and reform o f the energy sector, as well as to investmentsin education
and health, should not be extensive; nor will they be irreversible. At this stage, the potential
environmental and social impacts can be described only in general terms.

18.      PRSC-5 will deal with the environmental issues mentioned below and will be based on
the national regulation requiringan environmental impact study for qualified investments, on the
ongoing sectoral investment projects supported by the Bank and on the EA capacity-building
activities supported by PRSC-5.
19.      Rural development: The reform measures envisaged under PRSC-5 relating to rural
development fall into two categories. The first category concerns activities likely to encourage
agncultural diversification. The second category relates to activities connected with opening o f
the cotton subsector.

20.      Diverszjkation. The potential environmental impacts related to the activities mentioned
above are diverse in nature but not irreversible. Agncultural diversification could improve soil
fertility management and reduce the need for pesticides, but it could also result in more intensive
cultivation methods. Efforts to intensify agncultural production may result in better soil fertility
management (for example, by addition o f nutrients) but may also lead to increased and
inappropriate use       of pesticides,   with possible adverse (and sometimes          catastrophic)
environmental and social impacts.
2 1.     The potential environmental impacts related to the intensification of agricultural
production are being tackled by two main types o f government intervention. The first i s the
promotion o f conservation practices that help to maintain the production capacity o f the resource
base. Soil and water conservation activities have long been the core o f national efforts to
encourage the adoption o f sustainable agricultural practices. During the three years o f PRSP
implementation, significant progress has been made inthis area under the auspices o f the national
soil fertility initiative (supported by HIPC resources). Labor-intensive soil and water conservation
arrangements have been introduced. The creation o f village resource conservation groups helped
to accelerate these efforts during the second year o f PRSP implementation, although no
quantitative evaluation i s yet available.

22.      The second type o f intervention was designed to mitigate the adverse environmental
impacts o f agricultural intensification, such as pesticide-related pollution and dangers. The most
significant efforts in this area concern pesticide registration. In addition to the national policy
initiatives, these efforts are helping a regional pesticide registration initiative supported by a
number of donors through the ComitC Permanent Inter Etats de Lutte Contre la SCcheresse au
Sahel (CILSS). Pesticide management and pest management efforts have expanded in recent
years in Burkina Faso. However, integrated pest control initiatives in the country have so far
achieved only very limited success.

23.      Through the decentralized rural development operation financed by IDA, the Government
will support the promotion of alternative and complementary pest management methods, in
accordance with the provisions of the Bank OP on pest management (OP 4.09) and with the
Burkina Faso regulations issued in articles 42 to 46 (dealing with problems o f pesticide and
fertilizer management) of the Environment Code (see also document E377). The application o f


                                                - 125 -

these policies and rules will require the adoption of specific measures for the handling, use and
conservation o f products, sensitization and training o f stakeholders. The rural community
development operation financed by IDA i s supporting the diagnostic tool that will help to identify
and mitigate any adverse social and environmental impact related to community investments.

24.     Opening of the cotton sector. The transfer of two cotton-growing zones, including ginning
plants, may raise environmental impact issues,             particularly concerning environmental
responsibility in connection with this privatization. In order to reduce the impact o f the
privatization and establish investors' responsibility in the context o f the transfer o f part o f the
assets o f SOFITEX (the cotton firm), an environmental audit o f the ginning plants was conducted
in order to ascertain the scope of the problems and potential environmental responsibilities and
decide how to take them into consideration in the privatization transactions. The results o f this
environmental audit were made available before the financial bids were submitted so that the
costs related to mitigation o f potential environmental and social problems could be taken into
account. The final audit report recommends for each region an environmental and social
managementplan geared to the following items:


    0   plan for mitigation and optimization o f impacts.
    0   list of environmental and social parameters to be monitored.
    0   list of methods for tracking and periodic monitoring o f such parameters.

    0   definition o f stakeholders' responsibilities.
    0   estimate o f the cost o f the plan for mitigation and alleviation o f the impacts identified
        duringthe audits.

Inaddition, the auditors made recommendations to ensure better implementation ofthe measures
set out inthe recommended environmental and social management plan.

25.     Privatization of ONATEL. The privatization o f ONATEL may raise questions
concerning the responsibility o f the new owner for environmental questions, either as regards
existing installations or as regards investments to be made in the future. The privatization o f
ONATEL was accompanied by an IDA technical assistance credit for competitiveness and
enterprise development (PCDE). This project financed an environmental audit o f the firm before
the start o f the privatization process, in accordance with environmental annex E530 o fthe project.
The audit recommendations concerning the management o f environmental responsibilities were
included in the bidding documents and implementation o f the recommendations i s supervised by
the IDA project.

26.     Energy sector reform. The reform o f the energy sector raises the issues o f the
environmental responsibility o f potential investors. In addition, the investments in the
construction o f the interconnecting line between Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou and the
construction o f a new 14 MW power station raise environmental impact questions. The reform o f
the energy sector is accompanied by two IDA projects : the above-mentioned PCDE and a project
for energy sector reform under preparation. The various environmental audits have already been
conducted. The audit o f SONABHY was prepared in the context o f the PCDE. Under the energy
sector reform project, the investment component envisages the purchase o f a 14 MW power
station and construction o f a line interconnecting Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou. For this
purpose, the following environmental studies have been made:


    0   Evaluation o f environmental and social protection under the reform.

                                                 - 126 -

     0  Environmental impact study o f the 14 MW diesel station at Kossodo.
     0  Environmental impact study o f the project interconnecting Bobo-Dioulasso and
        Ouagadougou.

27.     Inaccordance with existing arrangements and with the'schedule drawn upwith the World
Bank for the presentation o f the Burkina Faso energy file to the Board o f Governors, these studies
were officially presented at a ceremony held on February 9, 2004. On Tuesday, February 10,
2004, a press announcement was made in the principal newspapers in Burkina Faso. In it, the
public was told where the various environmental assessment reports could be consulted for the
purpose o f expressing opinions and submitting amendments, observations, comments and
counter-proposals.

28.     The different audits address the environmental responsibilities o f potential investors,
which will be included in the specifications, and propose mitigating measures for the investments
for the interconnection. Implementation o f the recommendations i s supervised by the two IDA
projects.

29.     Health sector development: In general, the reforms supported under PRSC-5 in the
health sector concern capacity building and decentralization o f services delivery, and upgrading
o f human resources. More specifically, PRSC-5 continues to give priority to improving access by
the poor to basic services (by abolition o f fees for preventive care and reduction of prices for
essential medicines), maintaining adequate budget allocations for primary health services and
developing a better policy o f staff motivation. Essentially, these PNDS-based activities will have
only a small number o f adverse and irreversible environmental impacts. The main environmental
concern i s the management o f dangerous medical waste (including needles) and the disposal o f
dangerous substances, human body parts, etc.

30.     Dangerous medical waste i s a source o f concern to the authorities. Specific measures
consisting mainly of packaging and disposing o f such waste (by incineration) were taken as part
o f the management and administration o f all health care centerslservices. These arrangements are
part o f the present ten-year national plan. Here too, the IDA support operation for efforts to
combat HIV/AIDS has formulated and adopted a national plan for medical waste management,
which will serve as a guide for the executing unit inprocessing such waste (see document E715).

31.     Development of basic education: The main activities planned under the proposed PRSC-
5 are continued support for the poorest families in the form o f subsidized school supplies,
increase in the number o f schools and capacity building in the Ministryo f Basic Education. The
only potential environmental impacts linked to these activities could result fi-om the construction
o f school buildings and o f related sanitary infrastructures.

32.     Through the Ten-year Basic Education Development Plan (PDDEB), PRSC-5 would
ensure compliance with Bank requirements and policies in the context o f school infrastructure
construction. The PDDEB has prepared a framework that conforms to Bank requirements.

Linkage between PRSC-5 and supplementary sectoral investment projects as regards
compliance with safeguards

33.     As will be apparent from the above analysis, there is a close and direct link between
PRSC-5 and the sectoral investment projects as regards compliance with environmental and


                                                 - 127-

social safeguards. Since these accompanyng sectoral investment operations have their own
environmental management plans (EMPs) formulated to offset the main environmental and social
impacts identified during their evaluation, it i s more rational to use these plans as a basis in order
to guarantee compliance with Bank requirementsand policies.

34.      Since the Task Team Leaders o f these investment operations are members o f the PRSC-5
team, they are responsible individually (at any rate, more than the PRSC-5 team) for ensuringfull
implementation o f the EMPs o f the operations, which they lead. The details o f these
Environmental Management Plans can be found in the Environmental Assessments (EAs) o f the
respective projects. For information, the sectoral investment operations covered by the PRSC-5
environmental and social safeguards are:


    0    The Community-based Rural Development project.
    0    The Basic Education Sector project.
    0    The Response to HIVIAIDS project.
    0    The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development project.
    0    The Energy project
    0    The Urban Environment project.

Readinessof the borrower to deal with safeguards issues

36.      Like many other IDA countries, Burkina Faso prepared a National Environment Action
Plan (NEAP) at the beginningo f the 1990s. Unlike in the other countries, however, the NEAP o f
Burkina Faso was not reflected in a coherent investment program, which could have included
capacity-building components. The result was delays in creating the regulatory framework, a lack
of experience and limited capacity in certain areas o f environmental management, particularly
environmental assessment. The current regulatory framework for the country's environmental
management i s the result o f a slow but steady development o f environmental law, including land
law, forest law and mininglaw.

37.      Under previous PRSCs, the Bank had an opportunity to verify the country's readiness to
apply the environmental assessment to development projects. This work focused on the
institutional and technical capacity o f the government agencies involved in supervising
environmental assessment (EA). Most environmental policies and practices in Burkina Faso are
based on the Environment Law enacted in 1997. Articles 17 to 24 o f this law describe the
situations in which an environmental assessment o f development activities i s required, as well as
the procedures to be followed for its preparation. Typically, the law requires that any
development activity likely to produce major adverse environmental impacts should be the
subject o f an environmental assessment, which must be endorsed by the Ministry o f the
Environment. The law also requires that a public consultation should be organized with the
affected partiedcommunities to discuss potential impacts and ways to mitigate them.

38.      The assessment found that Burkina Faso has the necessary regulations pertaining to
environmental assessment but that compliance with such regulations was weak. There were three
main reasons for this situation. The first one was the very recent enactment o f these regulations
(1997) and the late adoption o f the implementation decree (June 2001). The second reason was
the lack of clarity in the responsibilities of the institutions responsible for ensuring compliance
with these regulations. Finally, the lack of technical capacity and awareness both within the
Government and in the non-government sector for applying EA to development operations

                                                - 128 -

constituted a major obstacle to obtaining a higher level o f compliance with the regulations
enacted. On the basis of this assessment, it was agreed that EA capacity building would be the
focus o f the measures proposed to deal with environmental issues inthe PRSCs. Inaddition, it has
been found that overlapping responsibilities within these institutions and unclear mandates are an
obstacle to effective application.

Arrangements to enable the Borrower to deal with safeguardsissues

39.     A long-term capacity-building commitment will be required in order to remove the
constraints preventing effective compliance with Bank safeguard policies and EA requirements in
Burkina Faso. On the basis o f the revisions o f the country's environmental policies and practices,
it was agreed between the Bank and the Borrower that long-term EA capacity building at the
national level (national agencies, consulting firms, NGOs, civil society, etc.) i s the best way o f
ensuring effective compliance with Bank safeguards in PRSCs. The arrangements to enable the
Borrower to deal with safeguards issues consist o f two types o f activity and are designed to
enhance due diligence while permitting the development o f local capacity to the level at which
national agencies can ensure effective monitoring and suitable application o f EA requirements.
The first type o f activity consists o f measures to supplement those adopted and implemented
under PRSC-3 and PRSC-4 and in the preparation o f PRSC-5; the second type involves enhanced
supervision o f Bank operations under way in the country. The goal i s to ensure full compliance
with plans for management o f the environmental and social safeguards adopted at the time when
these operations were assessed.
