A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Project would assist the Department of National Planning (DNP) and the Ministries of Social 
Protection (MSP) and Education (MEN) to improve their knowledge, develop effective instruments, and 
strengthen their ability to carry out reforms supported by the Programmatic Labor and Social Structural 
Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL). 
Specifically, the Project’s main development objectives include the promotion of results-
based management of reforms and the strengthening of: (i) MSP’s capacity to implement 
a
coherent social protection reform that encompasses employment, training, health and 
social assistance for the poor and vulnerable; (ii) MEN’s ability to better implement 
education decentralization reforms mandated by Law 715, analyze primary and 
secondary school integration and evaluate the school readiness of 5-year old children; and 
(iii) DNP’s capacity for institutionalizing periodic evaluation and monitoring of national 
social programs for citizens’ oversight and feedback. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The Project would improve the ability of the Ministries of Social Protection and 
Education as well as the DNP to monitor and evaluate and manage for results the various 
reforms for which they are responsible. Moreover, the expected incorporation of the 
knowledge, ideas, and tools developed and implemented by staff with support of external 
TAL consultants would significantly contribute to institutional capacity building. 
 
Page  2
The 
key performance
 indicators of the Project would include completion of agreed 
analytical, advisory, and consensus-building activities in support of the above-mentioned 
labor and social reforms (Annex 3).  As an indicator of capacity building, the Project 
would also monitor measures actually taken by DNP, MSP, and MEN to systematically 
monitor and evaluate their programs and to use the monitoring and evaluation results to 
inform policy and program decisions.  
 
The loan would finance the analytical, advisory and consensus-building activities of the 
following three main Project components: technical assistance to the Ministry of Social 
Protection (Component 1), technical assistance to the Ministry of Education (Component 
2) and technical assistance to DNP (Component 3). These activities include, 
inter alia
,
design of information systems, data collection and analysis, staff training, expert advice 
on needed regulations/decrees/policy documents to advance the reforms, piloting 
innovative schemes, workshops to disseminate findings and recommendations among 
public and private stakeholders, building  partnerships with civil society, and adoption of 
the new institutional mechanisms to be financed under the TAL operation. 
 
Although the size of the proposed loan is small due to limited fiscal space, the TAL is 
adequate for the purpose of complementing related activities supported by the Bank and 
its partners through other operations (see Annex 2 and Sections B.7 and C.1). Together, 
the TAL and these other operations would contribute to building the institutional capacity 
of MEN, MSP and DNP to develop the labor and social sector reforms and to manage 
those programs with the goal of improving outcomes. The planned operations include: (i) 
the data collection and analytical work that the Bank and IDB are funding in parallel (e.g 
Red de Apoyo Social
 (RAS),  
Sistema de Selección de Beneficiarios
 (SISBEN) updating, 
and evaluation studies); and (ii)  the PHRD-supported activities (see Table 2.1, Annex 2) 
which the TAL would continue to support. A brief description of each TAL component 
follows; details appear in Annex 4. 
 
Component 1
:
Technical Assistance for MSP (US$1.1 Million).
 
The Social Protection 
System, as envisioned by the MSP, has four key areas that this component would cover: 
(i) labor market policies such as training, wage subsidies, and social assistance to the 
unemployed; (ii) social assistance to vulnerable groups including young children, 
adolescents and the elderly poor; (iii) a financial model of the Social Protection System 
(SPS); (iv) regional dimensions of the SPS; and (v) monitoring and evaluation systems. 
Coordination of all these programs is an enormous institutional challenge for the MSP, as 
most of these programs are run by separate semi/autonomous agencies like ICBF, SENA, 
the wo
rkers’ family assistance program
 (Cajas de Compensación
 
Familiar)
 and other 
non- governmental institutions. 
 
This first component would provide technical assistance to MSP to ensure timely, 
sustained, and effective implementation of health, labor, training and social assistance 
reforms.  Specifically, it would finance the hiring of consultants who would work with 
the DNP, MEN, and MSP to : (a) develop the implementation strategies and instruments 
needed to implement reforms of ICBF, SENA, the 
Cajas de Compensación Familiar 
and 
other institutions; (b) undertake diagnostic studies and develop alternative institutional 
Page  3
arrangements for the training and social protection programs, including early child 
education, programs for adolescent and unskilled youth, and support for the elderly who 
have no formal social assistance; (c) develop a system of output-based indicators for 
following progress in the achievement of agreed social protection system targets; and (d) 
establish an impact evaluation system for the main social protection programs under the 
MSP and develop household surveys to allow these impact evaluations. The TAL would 
complement other Bank and GOC operations in the monitoring and the evaluation of the 
actual employment results of Law 789. 
 
The technical support to the MSP would help it improve coordination between large 
programs such as SENA, ICBF and 
Cajas de Compensación Familiar 
by establishing 
working agreements based on the new division of responsibilities in which the MSP 
assumes policy making, coordination and supervision roles , and by developing the 
information systems and channels to achieve coordination. The MSP would develop 
mechanisms for verification by analyzing databases of program beneficiaries to ensure 
that all programs follow targeting criteria established by MSP.  
 
Finally, the TAL would help the GOC address some intersectoral issues between the MSP and the MEN.  
For example, the TAL would  help clarify and advance implementation of the new roles of MSP and MEN 
in the new National Skills Formation System as proscribed in the recent CONPES document. 
1
In this 
framework,  the MSP assumes the role of policymaking and certifies training programs that were 
previously made by SENA, and the MEN oversees the technical aspects of training. SENA would be 
charged with providing specified training under certain conditions and regulations.  
 
Component 2
:
Assistance to MEN (US$450,000). 
 
The objective of this component is 
to support MEN’s capacity to implement four key reform activities supported by the 
PLaRSSAL program (Annex 4 describes details of those activities). The first activity is 
implementation of the education reform provisions of Law 715, which transfer resources 
from the central to state and municipal levels largely on the basis of enrollment.  While 
this allocation scheme is a sound approach for increasing efficiency, for improving equity 
across territorial entities, and for promoting rationalization of the teaching force, this 
activity requires good auditing and control systems to minimize fraud and to ensure the 
accuracy of obtained information. Initial auditing activities have already been done 
successfully in a few selected municipalities using resources from the Japanese PHRD 
Grant. The second activity, to be done jointly with DNP, supports analysis of the new 
revenue sharing system between the national and local government. Specifically, it 
reviews the impact on equity, patterns of resource utilization, education outputs and 
utilization of the teaching force in different areas of Colombia. The third, to be conducted 
separately for different types of schools, is to evaluate the organizational and pedagogical 
effects of the integration of primary and secondary schools and to propose actions for 
improvement.  The fourth is to evaluate the abilities in language, mathematics, natural 
science and civic of five year old children beginning Preschool education. The aim is to 
improve educational policies and programs according to the development and learning 
needs of those children. 
 
Component 
3
:
Assistance to DNP (US$450,000).
The TAL would support the effort of 
1
CONPES No. 81 from July, 26, 2004 
Page  4
DNP’s Public Policy Evaluation Unit (formerly SINERGIA) to strengthen citizen 
monitoring, evaluation, transparency and social accountability.  To this effect, the Project 
would support, in conjunction with other activities, the following: (a) an evaluation study 
of  the general participation system (revenue sharing) including the adequacy of the 
instrument and formula used as well as the results of their application (this study would 
be undertaken jointly with MEN and MSP).  This study would be co-financed with the 
IDB, which is providing about US$1 million for this study; and (b) support the 
continuation of detailed design, implementation and institutionalization of the social 
control system, DNP is developing based on an adaptation of the successful 
Bogotá,
 
Cómo Vamos? 
program.  
 
The DNP’s Public Policy Evaluation Unit has already made significant progress in 
establishing a system to monitor progress against targets for most central government 
institutions and programs covered in the National Development Plan.  It also has taken 
steps towards the institutionalization of a system for impact evaluation of major social 
programs.  Those steps include carrying out an impact evaluation of the 
Red de Apoyo 
Social 
(RAS) or Social Safety Net program, and the forging of a consensus in GOC to 
include in Colombia’s national Budget Law a requirement for periodic impact evaluation 
of major programs.  This component would further advance a culture of impact 
evaluation and the ability of citizens to give feedback on the performance of government 
programs.  
 
From the institutional point of view, the TAL would permit DNP’s Public Policy 
Evaluation Unit  to undertake more key evaluation studies and to learn from those 
studies, to develop better monitoring and evaluation instruments, and to develop 
institutional support for impact evaluation
