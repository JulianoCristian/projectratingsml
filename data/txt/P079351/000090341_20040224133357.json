(a)\n            improve alternative corridors from Mali to the ports of\n            Dakar and Abidjan by rail and road respectively; and (b)\n            sustain accessibility to the Northern region of Mali, one of\n            the poorest regions in the country. The project has the\n            following three components:  Component A: Rail component.\n            Sub-component A I : Social and compensation plan. The\n            sub-component will support implementation of the social and\n            compensation plan to mitigate the impact of the\n            concessioning of rail services to a private operator on\n            staff declared redundant. The plan includes the following\n            activities: (a) financing of severance payment; (b)\n            technical advisory services and operating costs of the unit\n            created to provide support to redundant staff in evaluating\n            training needs, finding a new job, and preparing personal\n            business projects; (c) measures aimed at facilitating\n            reinsertion of redundant staff; and (d) technical advisory\n            services to monitor the social impact of redundancies during\n            and after the period of implementation of the social and\n            compensation plan. Component B: Road maintenance component.\n            Sub-component Bl : Periodic maintenance of road network. The\n            sub-component will include: (a) periodic maintenance of (i)\n            the 154 km section of the road between Bamako and Bougouni,\n            which is part of the road linking Bamako, the capital city\n            of Mali, to the ports on the West African Coast (Abidjan in\n            Cote d'Ivoire, Tema in Ghana, and Lome in Togo); and\n            (ii) the 558 km section of the road between Sevare and Gao,\n            which is part of the only road giving access from Bamako to\n            the Extreme North of Mali; (b) technical advisory services\n            for supervision of works; and (c) measures to protect the\n            environment, to improve road safety and to prevent the\n            spread of HIV/AIDS resulting from the presence of civil\n            works contractors in the villages along both roads.\n            Component C: Project management: The component includes: (a)\n            technical audit of the works carried out and the goods\n            provided in components A and B (review of procurement\n            procedure, quality of works, compliance with contracts); (b)\n            technical advisory services for fiduciary aspects of project\n            coordination (financial management specialist, accountant);\n            (c) financial audit of project accounts; and (d) operating\n            costs of the project coordination unit."}, "docdt": "2004-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
