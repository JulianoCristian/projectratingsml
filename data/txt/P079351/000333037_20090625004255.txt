Project Paper- .Mali Transport Corridors ImprovemellJ. Project



Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval ofthe Regional Vice-President for Africa to
introduce the following changes in the Mali Transport Corridors Improvement Project
(Credit 3869 :tv1Ll and Grant H075 :MLI) and any accompanyingamendmetJ.ts to the
project's legal document: (i) reduce the scope of the works on Sevare - Gao road to 85
km, (ii)extend the project closing date to December 31, 2009, and (iii) reallocate the
ProjectCredit and Grant proceeds.

2.      The main reasons for the proposed changes are to: (i) fund   fl.contract overrun on
BamaJto - Bougouni road works, whlch are being successfully executed; (li) reduce road
works on Sevare - Gao from 407 kID to an aggregate 85 Ion of the most deteriorated
sections to continue to meet the objective of providing land access to the Northern
Region; (iii) extend the Project Closing Date to complete the works on Sevare - Gao road
agreed within the restructured Project.

Background and reasons for restructuring

Objectives, design and scope

3.      The objectives of the Project are to· (a) enhance intemationaltransport throug11
improvexp.ent of transport corridors linking Mali to the coastal countries of West A.frica
by·rail and road, respectively. and (b) sustain accessibility ofthe northern regioll,S of the
Borrower's territory. The Project was approved by the Board ofDirectors on March 11,
2004 for a total credit amount ofSDR 22.2 million and a total grant amount ofSDR 10.8
~on. The Development FinancUlg Agreement for the Project, between the Republic of
Mali (the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the Association)
was sigd.ed on March 18,2004 and declared effective on September 16,2004. The initial
Closing Date of the Credit is on December 31, 2008.            As October 15, 2007, the
undisbursed credit and grant amounts were, respectively, SDR 0.5 million and SDR 10.1
million.

4.      The Project includes tbree components: (i) a Rail component including: (a) social
support to former Regie des Chemins de Fer du Mali (RCFM) staff, and (b) rehabilitation
of deteriorated railway track of approximately 134 Ian; (ii) a road component, including.
(a) rehabilitation of 154 Ian on Bamako-Bougouni road, (b) spot improvement of4071an
on S6vare - Gao road, (c) capacity building and environmental impact mitigation; and
(iii) Project management and supervision. The restructuring concerns the road component
only.

5.      Regarding the institutional and implementation arrangemeuts agreed upon, the
Ministry 111 charge of transport oversees the rail component but the concessionaire is the
executing agency of the railway rehabilitation, Transrail. The Project Coordination Unit,
under the Ministry ofEquipment and Transports, oversees the road component.

Project implementation performances

6.          The overall implementation performances have been rated moderately satisfactory
and the Project Development Objectives are unlikely to be achieved without proactive
actions. Jndeed,. the Project has made some significant. progresses regarding tIle
implementation of Bamako - Bougouni road works but mces important delays in the
implementation of Sev8rc§ :- Gao road and .the IaHway investment plan. The
implementationperfonnances per components are summarized as follow:

7.          Road component: The rehabilitation of 154 km ofBamako-Bougouni road which
is one of the most important corridorn to the coastal countries, is being successfully
executed. However, the contract ofthis road faced cost overrun. Indeed, the contract cost
has increased from $US30.07 million to SUS 41.57 million, i.e. 38%,increase due mainly
to three factors: (i) the degradations have been more ,severe thai::l expected; (ii) the
resurfacing thiclmess has been increased in order to support the heavy traffic on the road;
and (ill) the inflation in the country has been high due to the changes in petroleum prices.
For the Sevare - Gao road, the contractor has been selected but the works have yet to
start because the current cost estimate is $US27 million and the IDA grant allocated to
tb:i1i road is not enough to finance the contract in its entirety. The Association requested
evidence from the Borrower to fill the' financial gap before giving its no objection to
award the contract. The Government has provided evidence by allocating additional
:fi.ri:Lds to S6vare- Gao road within its 2008 finance bi.w.                                                 '

8. '        Railway component: While the severance payments and social support to fonner
st~ of the Regie des Chemins de Fer du Mali (RCFM) are being successfully
inlplemented, scant progress has been made in the improvement of service del1very,
rehabilitation oftrack and reducing the cumulative length of slow down. However, since
Apru 2007, there have been promising signs of progress, notably(j) a new majority
 shareholder is in place assisted by a new experienced operator as railway concessionaire;
 (ii) the mvestment plan is being implemented; and (ill) discussions are ongoing With
Senegal for the payments of arrears for passenger service provided. A meeting is being
 organized inParis in December 2007 to agree upon a realistic action plan.

 Proposed changes

 9.         The changes proposed are proactive in line with the current objectives and will
not affect the Project Development Objectives or associated outcome targets. They will
 allow the project to address the issues of: (i) cost overrun ofBamako ..:- Bougouni works
 (for about SUS 11.5 million); and eli) inaccessibility to the Northern Region ofMali by
 rehabilitatingthe more degraded sections on Sevare - Gao road.

 10.        The proposed changes will concern: (i) the scope oft1le works on Sevare - Gao
 road; (li) rea1Jocations of Credit and Grant proceeds; and (iii) extension of the Project
 Closing Date. .

 11.        Scope ofthe works: Four years ago, it was agreed to implement spot improvement

Project Paper - Mali Transport Corridors Improve.ment Project


Because of the delay in the implementation of the works, the degradation has increased
significantly on some sections. The current estimate cost     is $US27 million and the IDA
grant allocated to this road is insufficient to finance the contract in its entirety. Therefore.
the length of the works to be considered will be reduced to 85 Ian (first tranche) where
the degradations are Ill0st severe. However, the scope will still meet the .objective of
proViding accessibility because the· Government has committed in writing (MOU
attached) to :fund the maintenance of the remaining sections which are in fair condition.
The contract size 'Will also be reduced to reallocate funds to cover the cost overrun ofthe
Bamako -Bougouni contract, and its implementation 'Will require an extension oftwelve
months.

12.     The arrangements above have been discussed withthe Government during the last
Association's supervision mission in May 2007. The changes have also been discussed
with the contractor selected to lead the works on S6vare..Gao road and he has agreed to
review the scope of his contract without any changes of unit costs. The minutes. of the
various agreements are attached.

13.     Reallocation offimdJ: The restructuring ofthe Project will include reallocation of
the Credit and Grant proceeds to address the cost overrun of Bamako-Bougouni road
(about $US 20.4 million) and reallocate the remaining IDA funds to the rehabHitation of
the 85 Ian on Sevare - Gao road. The followed changes in annex 1 arc summarized as
follows:

        ·  .Provide additional Credit funds of SDR 800,000 and Grant funds of 760,000
            for category I~C (Works". Part Cl) due to the cost ovemm.

        ·  Provide additional Credit funds ofSDR 150,000 for category 2B (Goods- Part
            C) which was underestimated during the preparation ofthe Project.

        ·  Provide additional Credit funds of SDR 80,000 for category 6 (Operation
            costs) which was underestimated.

        ·  Reduce by SDR 230,000 the Credit amount for the category 3 (Consulting and
            Audit) which has been overestimated.

        ·  Reduce by SDR 5,960,000 the Grant amount for the category l-B (Works 
            Part CI-B) to address the cost overrun issue on Bamako-Bougauni road.

        ·  Reduce by SDR 800,000 the Credit amount and SDR 1,700#000 the Grant
            amount of category 7 (Unallocated) to reallocate to Works category (1) (c).

16.     Extension ofthe Closing Date: The worl{ program under the restructured Project
will not be completed by the current Closing Date ofDecember 31, 2008. Specifically,
the reconstruction of the 85 Jon on S6vare - Gao road will need 14 months to be
completed from November 2007. Therefore, we propose twelve month extension of the
Closing Date of the Development Financing Agreement until December 31, 2009. A
sound new actiort plan has been elaborated by the Borrower and reviewed by the
Association to aHow completion ofthe activities by the new Closing Date of the Project.

17.     A11alysis: The proposed changes will not have major effect on the original
economic and :social aspects of the Project as appraisal because the accessibility to the
Northern Region of the country will be' ensured by removing the bottlenecks on the
Sevare - Gao road. The environmental category will remain B because the changes are
limited on existing road and the restructuring will not involve any exceptions to Bank
policies.

18.     Expected outcomes: The changes proposed are limited to Sevare - Gao road and
win not affect the Project Development Objectives or associated outcome targets. Indeed.
the additional funds from the Borrower to complete IDA financing will allow the'
maintenance ofthe total length (407 Ian) ofthe Sevare - Gao road to sustain accessibility
ofthe northern regions of the Borrower's territory; The IDA funding will be focused on
the rehabilitation of the most degraded road sections (85 km) while the Government will
ensure the light maintenance on the sections in fair condition. However the output
indicator for the S6vare - Gao road will be changed to reflect the reduction in scope.
Thus the number of the kilometers ofroad rehabilitated on Sevare - Gao will be 85 km
instead of407 km.

19.     Bellefit1J and Risks: The main risk which can jeopardize the achievement of the
restructured project DOs or outcome ta:rgets is the lack ofcounterpart funding to maintain
the remaining Sevare - Gao sections in fair condition. To mitigate this risk, IDA has
requested evidence from the Borrower that its financial commitments will be resp,ected.
The Borrower provided evidence during the last IDA supervision mission that the $US 10
million have been approved by the Government and included in its 2008 Finance Law.

20.     There are no outstanding audit reports for this Project.
