   Improvement Project for Mali were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Project Development objective's (PDOs) should be kept\n            simple and modest to the extent possible. PDOs should be\n            realistic in terms of achievements and should only encompass\n            impacts that are consistent with the level of financing and\n            activities directly supported by the project. A high level\n            of due diligence is required from both the Government of\n            Mali (GOM) and the Bank side to ensure quality at entry.\n            This is to ensure that the project is well designed and\n            ready to be implemented which in turn is likely to provide\n            for smooth project implementation. In particular, capacity\n            of implementing agencies must be thoroughly assessed during\n            the appraisal of projects with special attention given to\n            procurement capacity for civil works. Furthermore, delays\n            between when engineering studies are conducted and works\n            commence should be minimized in order to avoid scope of road\n            works becoming obsolete. Consultants tasked with engineering\n            studies for road works should perform a thorough price\n            market study in order to produce realistic cost estimates.\n            The project has helped build a strong commitment toward\n            safeguards compliance, which in turn has led to systematic\n            inclusion of safeguards in all road contracts in Mali."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
