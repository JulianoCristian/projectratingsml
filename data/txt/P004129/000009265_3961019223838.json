There were no major lessons to learn.\n            However two points are worth noting: (a) the development of\n            clear and objective criteria for the inclusion of\n            institutions in the project and for research projects to be\n            financed under the project, resulted in an efficient\n            selection process which was viewed as equitable by the\n            project institutions and also led to a satisfactory level of\n            participation by private institutions; (b) temporary\n            shortages in counterpart funding were met in a timely manner\n            by increasing the authorized allocation to the special\n            account and also, towards the end of the project, by\n            reducing the rate for recovering funds from the special account."}, "docdt": "1996-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
