IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
UNIVERSITIES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROJECT
LOAN 3203-KO
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Universities Science
and Technology Research Project in Korea, for which Loan 3203-KO in the amount of US$45
million equivalent was approved on May 22, 1990 and made effective on November 6, 1990.
The loan was closed on schedule on December 31, 1995. Final disbursement took
place on April 30, 1996, at which time a balance of US$0.57 million was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Omporn Regel, EA1HR, Mr. Sing-Zak Sung,
Consultant, and Mr. Valentine Desa, Consultant, under the supervision of Mr. William Rees,
EA1HR. The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Sven Burmester, Division Chief, EA1HR and Mr. Walter
Schwermer, Project Advisor, EA1DR. The Borrower's comments are included as Annex B to the
ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in November - December, 1995. It is based on material in the project files as well as
information received during the completion mission.   The Borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by conducting a survey of all 37 project institutions to assess the extent to
which the project's objectives had been met. The survey was based on a questionnaire agreed
between the Ministry of Education and the Bank's ICR Mission. The Borrower prepared its
evaluation of the project based on the institutional survey and also commented on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
UNIVERSITIES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROJECT
(Loan 3203-KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives.
(i)         The overall objectives of the project were to assist selected universities in
strengthening their ability to undertake research in science and technology and to strengthen
science teacher education in order to improve the quality of science education in the secondary
schools. This was to be achieved through the financing of specialized research equipment and
related items. The project objectives were consistent with Korea's strategy of technology-
intensive industrialization and the role of the universities in underpinning this strategy as research
institutions and producers of scientific and technical manpower.
Implementation Experience.
(ii)        Overall implementation experience was highly satisfactory. All covenants were
fully complied with. The project was closed on schedule with no cost overrun. Equipment
procurement was very close to target, despite initial delays, with disbursements of US$44.4
million out of loan proceeds of US$45 million. Thus actual disbursements were 98.7% of the loan
amount. There was full compliance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
(iii)       Cooperation between the Bank and the project institutions was highly satisfactory,
which can be attributed to good project preparation by the Government, strong start-up assistance
from the Bank, and the high quality of local implementation officials. Bank staff closely assisted
the borrower in procurement, disbursement and implementation when requested. A change of
management structure in the Ministry of Education (MOE) did not adversely affect project
implementation. Early Bank agreement to the Government's request to re-allocate the funds in
the "Unallocated" category to equipment expedited the implementation process. The Bank's
agreement to increase the deposit in the special account and a reduction in the recovery rate from
50% to 30% of the advance to the special account, lessened temporary shortages of counterpart
funding.
Results.
(iv)   Project institutions received clear instructions from the MOE regarding the preparation
and submission of research proposals. Strict criteria were followed in the selection process of
both project institutions and research proposals.  These activities took somewhat longer to



complete than anticipated due to the thoroughness with which they were carried out. However,
the initial delay was made up and the project was successfully completed on schedule. The
equipment procured was directly relevant to the project objectives and is being well-managed and
maintained. Equipment contracts were close to estimates and there was no cost overrun on
equipment procurement.
(v)    The objectives of the project were met successfully as shown, inter alia, by: (a) the high
utilization by project institutions of over 3,150 items of research equipment supplied by the
project; (b) a large number of completed research projects (1,132) and a publication rate for
research results of 91%; (c) an increase in registered patent rights in the project institutions; and
(d) a significant expansion of practical instruction in the science education departments.
Sustainability.
(vi)   The crucial contribution  of the universities in underpinning Korea's strategy  of
technology-intensive industrialization will continue to be made through expanding research
capabilities and increasing the supply of key scientific and technical manpower.  Within this
context it is likely that the research programs in the project institutions will be sustained in the
future. Research equipment financed under the project is well-managed and maintained and
budget support has been increased to ensure that this situation will continue.  Overall, it is
reasonable to conclude that the project outcomes will be sustained in the future.
Findings and Lessons Learned.
(vii) Project design was consistent with sectoral objectives and the broader goals of
technology-intensive industrialization in Korea. The design focused on the supply of equipment.
This was appropriate in view of the well-developed state of the project institutions which were
well-managed, staffed and financed. Given the straightforward nature of project design and its
successful implementation, there were no major lessons to be learned. However, two points are
worth noting: (a) the development of clear and objective criteria for the inclusion of institutions
in the project and for research projects to be financed under the project, resulted in an efficient
selection process which was viewed as equitable by the project institutions and also resulted in a
satisfactory level of participation by private institutions; and (b) temporary shortages in
counterpart funding were met in a timely manner by increasing the authorized allocation to the
special account and also by reducing the rate for recovering funds from the special account.
(viii) Following Korea's graduation from borrower status in June 1995, there will be no further
Bank-assisted operations in the country.

A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Project Objectives and Scope.
1.          The broad aim of the project was to reinforce the Government's strategy for
technology-intensive industrial development by strengthening the research capacity of selected
higher education institutions. The project financed specialized research equipment, consumable
materials and equipment-related O&M expenditures to strengthen: a) research programs in
graduate schools of natural science and engineering in selected public and private universities; b)
joint research facilities in selected universities to promote the cost effective utilization of advanced
research equipment; and c) selected university departments of science education to improve
research in areas of pedagogy and science subjects, which in turn, would provide a firmer
understanding of science teaching methods and thereby strengthen the base of science education
in the secondary schools.
Sector Development Objectives.
2.          In support of the Government's industrial development policy, the objectives of
the science and technology sector were to:
- develop and utilize technology to the fullest,
- gain continued improvements in productivity;
- expand high value added output which is technologically
sophisticated, energy efficient and strongly export-oriented ; and
- enhance the role of small and medium industry (SMI) in order to reduce
industrial concentration and over-dependence on imported parts and materials.



- 5 -
In line with these priorities, the education sector's objectives were to: develop R&D capacity in
both educational and research institutions; to develop indigenous technology to overcome the
increasing difficulty of importing technology from abroad; and to upgrade and restructure the skill
mix requirements for meeting the demands of an increasingly technology-intensive industrial
sector.
Policy Context.
3.           The Government placed heavy emphasis on the need for restructuring industry
towards more technology-intensive fields as the prospects for further expansion of labor-intensive
industries declined. To achieve this objective, the Government created an elaborate legal and
institutional framework which established an important public sector role in coordinating and
carrying out R&D programs, provided incentives for the private sector to expand investments in
R&D, strengthened and expanded the provision of credit to finance R&D programs in the private
sector and placed special emphasis on developing technology-based small and medium industries.
4.          In response to these policies, total expenditures on R&D have increased rapidly
from 0.6% of GNP in 1980 to around 3% in 1995 and are planned to reach 5% by 2001. The
private sector has responded strongly to the provision of incentives and now accounts for over 70
of total R&D expenditures. In recognition that technological development is ultimately embodied
in people, the education system is playing the key role of supplying the skilled workers at all levels
which are the crucial underpinning of technology. The universities are expected to meet the
demand for the scientists and engineers who will lead the process of technological advancement.
It is planned to increase the ratio of scientists and engineers from 13 per 10,000 population in
1986 to 30 per 10,000 by 2001.
Evaluation of Objectives.
5.           The project was based on more than a decade of previous Bank support for
technology development in Korea, which focused on financing R&D projects through financial
intermediaries, strengthening those intermediaries, enhancing the R&D capacity of the national
research institutes and developing technical and scientific education. At the time of preparation,
the Bank had financed projects in electronics technology, industry promotion and had started to
assist R&D activities in the universities under Loan 2427-KO and in the national research
institutes under the first Technology Advancement Project (Loan 3037-KO).  The project was
designed within a sound policy environment, developed with considerable assistance from the
Bank's two education sector loans (Loan 1800-KO and Loan 2427-KO) which addressed policy
issues in research, and in science and technology education. The project continued the assistance
to graduate programs and basic research in science and technology and the strengthening of
science education, which had started under Loan 2427-KO.
6.           The scope and focus of the project were appropriate since it continued to offer
support in those areas in which: a) the Bank had previous experience and b) the Government had
identified as requiring additional quality-improving investments. The project further strengthened
research capacity in Korea's graduate schools in science and engineering and improved the
capacity of the departments of science education to undertake pedagogical and related research.



- 6 -
The project's design was straightforward and the emphasis given to equipment and related
expenditures was also appropriate. The project institutions were found to be well-staffed by
highly qualified researchers, efficiently managed and adequately financed. Their objectives were
clearly stated and closely related to Korea's education and technology development priorities.
The main weaknesses in the institutions were in the physical aspects of laboratory provision and
these were addressed under the project. Upgraded laboratories were viewed as essential to
increasing the effectiveness of research and teaching staff. The project investment was also timely
as it supported the plan for overall R&D investment to increase from 0.6% of GNP in 1980 to
3% in 1995.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
7.           The project met its objectives of strengthening the capacity of selected universities
to undertake basic research and to improve science education. The project's main achievements
are summarized as follows:
* Research capacity has been expanded during the life of the project. A total of
1,621 research projects were selected and 70% were completed, 27% are on-
going and the remaining 3% are in the initiation stage. The latter projects
lagged due to the delayed delivery of some research equipment.
* Project-financed research benefited industry. The results of 117 research
projects were adopted by private firms. Of these, 67 were conducted by public
universities and 50 by private universities.
* The project resulted in a high level of published research results. Of the
1,132 research projects completed under the project, the results of 1,034 or
91% were published in academic journals or through seminars.
* Of the 160 patent rights registered by researchers during the project
implementation period, 53 or 33% were funded directly by the project. Patent
rights from the 37 project institutions increased from 15 in 1991 to 44 in 1995.
* Equipment procured under the project enabled science education departments
in the participating universities to train their students and provide in-service
training to science teachers more effectively without having to share equipment
with other departments. The share of practical instruction was 37% in 1990
but had increased to 53% by project completion. The overall science teaching
in schools also improved as more demonstration and experimental teaching
methodologies were introduced to the classrooms by graduates of the
departments of science education.
* The project contributed to the production of quality manpower in the fields
of natural science and engineering. The 37 project institutions produced 5,793
masters' and doctoral graduates in 1995 or an increase of 44% over 1990.



- 7 -
Graduates in science education were 1,175 in 1995, an increase of 76% over
1990.
* The equipment procured with the loan proceeds was relevant to the project
objectives and has increased the research capacity at all project institutions. The
loan financed 3,157 pieces of research equipment, virtually all of which
had been installed and were in use at the time the project closed.
Management of equipment usage was excellent as shown by the well kept
log books and high quality maintenance.
* Equipment utilization rate is high. The utilization rate increased by 75% in
graduate schools of natural science and engineering, and by 60% in science
education departments.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
Implementation Record.
8.          Overall responsibility for project implementation rested with the Education
Facilities Bureau (EFB) of MOE - an agency with considerable experience in executing Bank
projects. A high-level Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) provided policy advice and
coordination and also played a major role in selecting project institutions and in the review of
research proposals. Equipment procurement was undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of
Korea (OSROK) in conjunction with MOE and the project institutions. The Borrower prepared
Annex B of the ICR based on a survey of the 37 project institutions.
9.          Project implementation was highly satisfactory. Universities were selected in strict
compliance with the Criteria for Selection of Participating Institutions (Annex 1 of the SAR). The
transparency of the Guidelines for Selection of Research Proposals (Annex 2 of the SAR). also
contributed to the success of project implementation. Demonstrated impartiality in the review of
the research proposals was assured by the PCC through the appointment of carefully selected
experts. In total, there were 38 experts grouped into four review panels: natural sciences - 11;
engineering - 13; joint research facilities - 8; and science education - 6. The approved proposals
were well distributed among national, private and local institutions.
10.         Allocation of loan proceeds generally followed the Guidelines agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank (Annex 3 of the SAR). Private institutions were to be allocated about
20% of loan funds while the actual allocation was 18%. Regional allocation targets were met.
The original allocation to the joint research facilities was exceeded - US$15 million compared
with US$10 million. However, this was not an adverse result as the joint facilities offer a cost-
effective way to use expensive research equipment.  For this reason, the Government is
encouraging the development of such facilities.
11.         Despite some delay in project start-up resulting from: (a) longer than expected
selection process for participating universities, allocation of loan proceeds and selection of



- 8 -
research projects, and (b) the need to reallocate funds in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement, the
project was successfully completed before the Closing Date. There was no cost overrun. Audit
reports, including separate opinions on SOEs, were submitted on time throughout the
implementation period. All covenants were in full compliance.
12.         All the equipment specified to meet the project's objectives was acquired as
planned and within the budgeted loan proceeds. Equipment procurement was carried out by
OSROK with technical support from staff of the participating universities, and managerial support
from the Education Loan Project Division (ELPD) in MOE. OSROK, the Government's central
procurement agency, has had a long and successful experience with Bank projects and therefore
procurement under this project was in full compliance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
Unit costs in equipment contracts were close to or below estimates as a result of keen competition
among suppliers. Over 90% of the equipment was procured under ICB procedures.
13.         Disbursements were satisfactory, although  there were disbursement lags
throughout the implementation period due to the delay in the selection process (para. 11). Total
disbursements reached about US$44.4 million or 98.7% of the loan amount. The amount of loan
cancellation was about US$0.6 million or 1.3% of the loan amount, and this can be regarded as
negligible.
14.         Management of project implementation was fully satisfactory.  The ELPD under
the Education Facilities Bureau functioned as the project implementation unit.  With long
experience of managing Bank-financed projects, ELPD's performance met the Bank's
expectations. In 1995, there was a change in the management structure of MOE. The EFB,
including the ELPD, was abolished, following MOE's decentralization policy. The universities
were given greater autonomy and the management of primary and secondary education was
transferred to the provincial and municipal levels. The change brought about the establishment of
two new bureaus, the University Education Support Bureau (UESB), and the Local Education
Support Bureau (LESB). Within UESB, the University Facilities Support Division (UFSD) was
established to take over the responsibilities of ELPD. This change did not adversely affect
management of the project, due largely to the fact that ELPD's staff were transferred to UFSD.
and continued to serve there.
Factors Affecting the Project.
15.         Category 2 "Unallocated" in Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement in the amount of
$4.5 million was reallocated to equipment and was fully disbursed. The reallocation caused a
minor implementation delay (para. I 1) but did not affect the timely completion of the project.
16.         The original authorized allocation to the special account was $3.0 million. This
was found to be inadequate during implementation and prompted the government to request an
increase. The Bank responded by raising the ceiling to $4.5 million. The Loan Agreement was
amended accordingly on June 24, 1993. This amendment gave the Borrower greater flexibility
and enhanced its capacity to make on-time payments to suppliers.



- 9 -
17.          A change in MOE's management structure (para. 14) did not have any adverse
effect on project implementation and the project was successfully completed on schedule at the
end of 1995.
Consulting Services.
18.          There were no consulting services in this project.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
19.         In view of the national priority for expanding R&D investments in both private and
public sectors as a key input to Korea's strategy of technology-intensive development, there is
little doubt that research programs such as those carried out in the participating universities will
continue into the future. Equipment for use by the researchers is being well-managed and
maintained at present (para. 7) and it is reasonable to believe that this will continue to be so in the
future. Research funding is growing at present, especially in the private sector. University
professors are receiving a growing number of requests from private industry to undertake
research, partly because universities are becoming better equipped to perform such tasks.
Following Korea's graduation as a Bank borrower in June 1995, the Government increased
MOE's budget for university facilities, i.e. for replacement of unserviceable and obsolete
equipment items and for the purchase of new items, to ensure that there would be no gap after the
termination of external financing. Based on the above, it is reasonable to conclude that the
project's outcomes will be fully sustainable in the future.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
20.          The Bank's performance on this project was in general satisfactory. Design and
implementation of earlier education projects led to the development of standardized
documentation for project preparation and implementation. This reduced substantially the number
of staff weeks required for project design, processing and implementation, thus increasing the
cost-effectiveness of project activities. The time spent on the early part of the project cycle, from
identification in early CY89 to loan signing was a satisfactory 42.7 staff weeks. Bank staff
assistance during project implementation (including nine missions) was effective in providing
timely advice on procurement issues and ways to ensure that the project was completed on
schedule. This was achieved with total staff input for supervision of about 17.3 staff weeks
(Table 9). The success of project implementation also reflects the strong cooperation the Bank
received from highly competent local officials. The Bank's estimates for the completion of
equipment procurement and loan disbursement were optimistic (Table 4) but this did not pose a
problem since all project activities were completed by the Closing Date and near full disbursement
was achieved by the end of the four-month grace period.
21.          Highly effective equipment procurement by the Borrower and the waiver of prior
review of documents contributed to the successful performance of this project, as equipment
procurement constituted 100% of loan proceeds. The Bank's prompt response to the borrower's
requests, e.g. the reallocation of funds between categories and the increase in the amount



- 10-
deposited into the special account, also contributed to the positive outcome of the project. The
Borrower experienced a shortage of funding during the period in which the special account
advance was being recovered by the Bank. The Bank assisted the borrower by reducing the
recovery rate from 50% to 30%, thus, increasing the replenishment application from 50% to 70%
of the amount requested. As a result, the fund shortage problem was alleviated.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
22.          In line with a good record in designing, preparing and implementing Bank assisted
education projects, the borrower demonstrated highly satisfactory performance in developing this
project. The high quality of project preparation led to less that average processing time. After
loan signing, the first major task was the selection of institutions to participate in the project,
allocation of loan proceeds and selection of research projects. This took longer than anticipated
due to the thoroughness with which these activities were carried out. However, this approach
ensured a satisfactory outcome from the perspective of both MOE and the participating
institutions.
23.          Despite start-up delays and a structural change within the MOE, implementation
staff were able to complete the project on schedule and achieve near full disbursement. OSROK's
long experience in procurement under Bank projects together with effective support from
implementation staff, resulted in equipment procurement of US$44.4 million being achieved.
There were no cost or time overruns. Work on the ICR was fully satisfactory. Moreover,
cooperation with Bank missions during the whole project cycle was commendable.
24.         In general, the Borrower provided the necessary counterpart funds without major
difficulty. Local funding was enhanced in 1993 by raising the authorized allocation in the special
account (para. 16). A temporary shortage of funds occurred during the closing stage of the
project as the outstanding advance from the special account was being recovered. This was
resolved through a request to the Bank, which was promptly granted, to reduce the recovery rate
from the special account (para. 21).
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
25.          The project outcome was rated as highly satisfactory in the last four supervision
reports and "1" in the first five. Project objectives were fully met. The project assisted in
strengthening science education and enhancing the research capacity of selected universities. In
the longer term, these achievement will help to support Korea's strategy of technology-intensive,
export-oriented industrialization. In view of the priority being given to this strategy and the
recognized role of science education and research in underpinning the strategy, project benefits
are likely to be sustained. An additional positive outcome is that experience gained under this
project benefited the design of follow-up operations which focused on strengthening research and
teaching capacity especially through the application of selection criteria and in relating equipment
needs closely to research and teaching programs.

H. FUTURE OPERATION
26.          As stated in para. 7, project-financed equipment is well-maintained and is being
used increasingly by research staff in response to rising demand for research services. In general,
project institutions are well-managed, and adequately staffed and financed. As noted in several
places above, the key role the universities are playing in Korea's strategy of technology-intensive
industrialization, is likely to result in the project's benefits being sustained in the foreseeable
future. Following Korea's graduation from borrower status in June 1995, there will be no future
Bank operations.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
27.          Given the straightforward design of the project and its highly satisfactory
implementation, there were no major lessons to be learned. However, two points are worth
noting:
(a)    The development of clear and objective criteria for the inclusion of institutions in
the project and for research projects to be financed under the project, resulted in an efficient
selection process which was viewed as equitable by the project institutions and also led to a
satisfactory level of participation by private institutions.
(b)   Temporary shortages in counterpart funding were met in a timely manner by
increasing the authorized allocation to the special account and also, towards the end of the
project, by reducing the rate for recovering funds from the special account.

ANNEX A
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
[BRD PROGRESS REVIEW AND PROJECT COMPLETION MISSION
AIDE MEMOIRE 1/
Universities Science and Technology Research Project
under Ln 3203-KO
1.   The IBRD mission 2/ visited Korea during November 5 and December 3, 1995 to
review the implementation progress of seven projects and, specifically for Ln 3203-KO, to
agree with the Ministry of Education (MOE) on arrangements for the preparation of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). This Aide Memoire is for the project completion
part only.
2.   The Universities Science and Technology Research Project under Ln 3203-KO will be
completed on schedule and the Loan will be closed on December 31, 1995 in accordance
with the date specified in Section 2.03 in the Loan Agreement dated August 10, 1990. As
disbursements are expected to reach about $44.5 million or about 98.9% of the loan amount,
clearly there is no need for an extension of the Closing Date. However, MOE would request
the Bank for granting a grace period of four months to allow for some miscellaneous
disbursements to be made after the Closing Date for the last batch of equipment delivered
before but near the Closing Date. The mission would recommend to the Bank to grant this
request. The Loan Account book in the Bank would then be closed sometime before April
30, 1996 after the entry of the last financial transaction.
If   The views expressed in this Aide Memoire are subject to the review of IBRD
management.
2/  The mission was comprised of Messrs. Sing-Zak Sung, Robert L. McGough,
Ian Irvine and Ms. Irene Travis.

3.   According to Bank's usual practice, the Bank will prepare an ICR in about six months
after the Closing Date. MOE would prepare its own evaluation report for this project for
inclusion into the Bank's ICR 3/. After discussion between MOE's designated staff 4/ and
the mission, the Broad Content of MOE's Evaluation Report (subject to review by MOE
senior management) has been agreed (Annex 1). It was also agreed that this Evaluation
Report will be sent to the Bank before April 30, 1996.
4.   For the purpose stated in the preceding paragraph the Bank mission assisted MOE with
several examples of Project Completion Reports (PCRs) and one example of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Relevant sections of the Bank's Guidelines for
the preparation of PCRs and ICRs were also provided to MOE for reference.
5.   MOE staff and the mission also agreed to conduct a mini-survey on the participating
universities' views on this project 5/. The single aim is to ascertain from the loan recipients'
point of view whether the overall objective of this project has been achieved. MOE staff
would translate the draft questionnaire into Korean language and send them to all the 23
national and 14 private universities for their reply before January 31, 1996. After receipt of
the replies, MOE staff would consolidate the responses into a one or two page summary sheet
to be attached to MOE's Evaluation Report as an Annex.
6.   The mission visited four universities of which three are national and one private, two
are in Seoul area and two are in the provinces. The sample review (about 10% of the total
number of participating universities) showed that:
The equipment received and installed are highly utilized (some at about 100% of
possible operating time) and well maintained (no breakdowns reported so far);
Management of equipment usage is excellent (well kept log books in all cases seen);
Research capacity has been broadened as evidenced by the doubling or trebling of
research topics at the time before and after the project; and
Research capacity has been deepened as evidenced by much higher number of
publications internationally and nationally now as compared to four or five years
ago, as well as more patents now.
3/   Para 9 and para 8 of the Bank mission's Aide Memoires dated July 6, 1995 and
December 3, 1994 respectively provided some more information on this subject.
4/   Mr. Suk, Jin-Bok, Director, University Facilities Support Division,
MOE. will be in charge of the preparation of the Evaluation Report for MOE.
5/   Achievement of project objectives must be affected by, and is the combined result
of, a number of inputs. The bank is aware of this point.

QUESTIONNAIRE
For Participating Universities in Loan 3203 - KO from IBRD
This "Universities Science and Technology Research Project" under IBRD Loan 3203 - KO
will soon be completed. The Ministry of Education (MOE) and IBRD are jointly evaluating
whether the objectives of this project have been achieved. The purpose of this Questionnaire
is, as part of the evaluation work, to seek for answers. Your cooperation will be much
appreciated.
The overall objective of this project is to assist selected universities in broadening and
deepening their basic research programs in priority field in science and technology in order to
strengthen their capacity to support technological innovation. The project also aims to
strengthen science teacher education through enhancing research capacity in this field which,
in turn, would strengthen the base of science education in the secondary schools.
The replies to the questions should be, to the extent possible, supported with quantitative data
as evidences to the changes perceived to have been made before and after the project. While
subjective answers are also acceptable, objective answers are, of course, preferred.
Understandably, from the timing aspect, it may be too early for reliable evidences to surface,
but it is hoped that a glimpse of the success or failure of this project could be seen through
this exercise.
Two questions for  A. Graduate Schools of Natural Science
B. Graduate Schools of Engineering
1. The quantity (or broadening ) question
What changes in quantity of basic research programs have occurred before and after
the project?
For example:
In increased number of fields
In terms of absolute number of research programs initiated per academic year
In terms of number of thesis, number of researchers and number of faculty in
participation



31
Page 2 of 2
2. The quality (or deepening) question
What changes in quality of research programs have taken place and as a result of the
qualitative changes, what have happened?
For example:
Are there research findings being used by industry as technological innovation,
if so, how many, before and after the project?
Are there graduates selected and recruited by industry mainly because of their
research topic and findings?
Are there professors being invited to join industry because of their research
topic and findings?
One question for Departments of Science Education
1. In what way, enhanced research capacity has strengthened science teacher education in
your department?
For example:
On graduates - improved quality of teaching after employment
- higher achievement level (in science) of students taught by
these graduates
On demonstration and experimental work in their classes
On curriculum improvement
Two questions for Joint Research Facilities
I. Are the research facilities provided being jointly used by researchers from different
departments or colleges within universities? Answers in terms of number of departments or
colleges using the facilities, number of papers produced, ete. can provide, directly or
indirectly, indication on the success or failure of the scheme.
2. Did the scheme increase research cooperation between various departments or colleges
within universities?
The completed reply should be returned to Mr. Suk, Jin-Bok, Director, Universities Facilities
Support Division, Ministry of Education, Seoul, preferably before end of January, 1996.

ANNEX B
Summary of Evaluation on the Project Universities' Performances under IBRD/L, No.
3203-KO for the Universities Science and Technology Research Project
The overall objective of the Project was to assist the selected universities in
developing their research capacities in science and technology in order to sup-
port technical innovation in the related industries, and also to train high
quality science teachers through expanding their experimental and practice
training equipment in the science education fields.
The World Bank and the Ministry of Education agreed, in December '95, to evalu-
ate the implemented performance of the Project through visits to, and/or written
correspondence from the Project universities of the Loan, No. 3203-KO.
Both sides concurred on presenting objective figures as much as possible to
raise the reliability on the evaluation of the performance rather than subjective
descriptions.
For this purpose,the Ministry collected the related data through questionnaires
in January and February '96.
To this end, we want to evaluate the performance of the project through presenting
objective data of figures on the implemented project to the extent measuring was
possible though we met limits in getting them.   The objective figures mentioned
above might be the evidence, that is, the changed degree in the ability of research
activities in the project universities.
1. Introduction of the Loan
For a rapid and continued development of the economy in Korea, industries have
made efforts to transform themselves into a technology-intensive production system
beginning from the end of 1980s. To develop the Korea's industrial structure into
a high value-adding production system, ability to make technical innovations has
to be fostered.   To achieve technical innovations, researches in the basic sciences
to be activated, because- the basic sciences are bases of the technology, and their
activated researches are the inevitable conditions for technical innovations.
Universities expected to conduct researches of basic sciences in the main, how-
ever, were not in the conditions to conduct active researches though they had
high-quality manpower.
The universities had few resources for researches such as facilities and
equipment, and fund that were required for activation of researches.
There was limitation in the growth of Korea's scientific and technical capacity
unless improved circumstances were provided to researches of the basic sciences
in the universities that might support native technical innovations.
The Korean Government requested the World Bank to finance a loan to improve the
above situation. After one year s preparation, the Loan Agreement was reached
on August 10th, 1990 to finance USD 45,000,000 for additional provision of
equipment for joint researches in graduate schools of natural sciences, those
of engineering, also in the corresponding undergraduate colleges, and science
education departments.

2. Selection of the Participating Universities
The Ministry sent out quidelines for applying to participate in the project
of the above loan to the universities in order to select the eligible participat-
ing universities. An evaluation conmittee was organized to work on the above
applications submitted from universities.  The committee members were experts
from the related professional fields.
37 universities were selected for the project, and allocation of the loan was made
to them as shown in <Table 2.1>.
<Allocation of the Loan by Field>

3. Procurement of the Laboratory and the Practice Equipment
3.1 The universities applying for participation in the project were requested to
submit research plans and the related lists of equipment together with their
applications for the loan project. The evaluation committee members reviewed,
by research program: adequacy of the related manpower for the research; the rese-
arch plan; relevance of the requested items of equipment, etc, and the project
universities were selected.
The laboratory and the practice training items of equipment procured for the
the loan project in quantity as of March '96 are 3,157 items in total, and
their distributions by field are given in <Table 3.1>.

35                            ANNEX B
3.2 Analyses of the equipment procured for the project show that the average
price of the equipment per unit is USD 14,058 and only a small sized item of
equipment for researches could be bought with such a price.
The average price of equipment per unit procured for the science education depart-
ment was lower than that for the other fields because the former was for experi-
mental and practice training rather than for research uses of professors.
In the on-going project under the loan, No. 3693-KO, the general trend is that
middle or large-sized items of equipment for the project are being procured.
4. Use of the procured equipment
The Ministry investigated basic data on how the originally planned and approved
research programs had been carried out and other matters such as production of
Master's and Doctoral degrees by the participating universities, used hours of
the procured equipment per week, joint usage of them, etc.
4.1 Implementation of the research programs
The research programs approved by the Ministry for the project were implemented
by researchers as originally planned, using equipment procured for such purposes.
Among the 1,621 research programs selected, 1,132 themes were completed, and
1,034 of the latter were published in academic periodicals or at seminars,
etc.<Table 4.1>
The 51 themes not yet initiated mainly due to the delayed delivery of the related
equipment are judged to be initiated as originally planned upon delivery of
their equipment.
The tolal amount input for the research themes of the project is about
USD64,159,00, and about 21% of the amount has been contributed from the related
industries.  <Table 4.2>  A desirable cooperative relationship has developed
between universities and industries.

4.2 Utilization of research results
It is very diffcult to say objectively how much the results of researches of the
project have contributed to the basic sciences and the technical field of the
industry in Korea, because the basic sciences and the technology have been
developed on the results of researches accumulated in them just as in other
academic fields.
Review, however, is made on the present status of the research fruits being
utilized in the industry, and also on the numbers of the patent rights acquired
as results of the above researches, though some of them are partial participations.
4.2.1 The cases of the above researches that have been adopted in the related
industries are 117, or 7.2% of the total research programs.<Table 4.2.1>
In some cases, industrial firms have produced goods developed from the above
researches of the project.
In the case of Seoul National University, one of the project universities, res-
ults of their 20 research programs are being used in the industry, showing the
University's leading role in the related fields as a prestigious university in Korea.

4.3 Production of Master's and Doctoral Degrees
The 37 project universities produced 4,036 Master's and Doctoral degrees in 1990,
the beginning year of the loan project, but the corresponding number in 1995 was
5,793, increasing by 43.5% in the case of graduate schools of natural sciences
and those of engineering.
The high quality manpower is expected to play core roles in the industry, and
their training of laboratories, practices, and researches at higher levels are
definitely required.   Therefore, the using frequency of the equipment is judged

4.4 Joint use of the Laboratory and the Practice Equipment
For a detailed review on the use frequency of the joint-use equipment procured
in the project, we investigated : whether they are located at places convenient
for joint use, and ; rates of used hours elapsed in a week.
In the case of research equipment in graduate schools of natural sciences and those
of engineering, 79.9% of the equipment procured for the project are placed in locati-
ons convenient for joint use, and are being operated.  20.1% of them are located
in individual research rooms of professors, but most of them are computer-related
items of equipment.
Among the research equipment in graduate schools of natural sciences and those
of engineering, 75.2% of the equipment procured for the project are being used for
20 hours or more in a week, and in the case of science education departments,
equipment items used for 20 hours in a week account for 60% of the total items
of equipment procured. <Table 4.4>
The eguipment of the project is being used satisfactorily.

4.5 Experimental and Practice Training in the Science Education Department
In the case of the 12 universities with the Project Science Eduation Departments
under the Loan, they were not required to include research plans in their
applications for participation in the project.
Expansion of the experimental and the practice training equipment required in
training of quality science education teachers was one of the objectives for
supporting the Science Education Departments in the project.
The provision rate of the experinental and the practice training equipment in
the Science Education Departments in 1990 was only 37.1%, but after the Project,
it increased to 53% by the cost amount of the equipment held by them.



ANNEX B
39
In some universities, the experimental and the practice training education of
the Science Education Departments had to be assigned to the related other science
departments in colleges of natural sciences in them due to the shortage of the
related training equipment in the Science Education Departments, but thanks to the
equipment increased from the project, they have come to train students on the
supplied equipment in their own departments.
Another development in the Science Education Departments of the Project is that,
thanks to the new supply of sophisticated equipment under the loan, research circums-
tances of professors in the Departments has improved.
For evaluation of the quality of science education conducted by graduates from
the Science Education Departments, we will need many evaluating devices and long
period of time for observation. It would not be easy to judge such results of
the loan project.
The colleges of education in Korea have conducted in-service training of the tea-
chers as well as the training of new ones. The in-service training of teachers
in the science education related departments includes many experimental and
practice training subjects.
The experimental and the practice training equipment supplied to the pedagogical
disciplinary departments under the loan is being used valuably in the in-service
training, and the in-service trainings given to the teachers of the science
education subjects, and conducted in the project universities from '90 to '95 are
shown in <Table 4.6>.

5. Benefits of the Project
From the end of the 1980s, Korea s industries had exerted efforts to transfer
themselves into a technology-intensive system towards higher value-adding
production. The university system at those days, however, was not in the
circumstances fostered enough for activating researches in them though they
had quality manpower for researches.
The Korean Government, faced by such a limitation in growing strength of
science and technology, introduced the loan of USO 45 million to support
extension of research and practice training facilities for graduate programs of
natural sciences and engineering, joint research facilities to be used among
them, and science education departments.
The Korean Government added USD 61 million equivalent, including additions from
universities' own resources, for the Project fund. For the five years from 1991
to 1995, the Government procured, and installed 3,157 items of equipment in
total for 23 national, and 14 private, totalling to 37 Project universities to
use. Therewith, professors' researches have activated, and students' practice on
the equipment has progressed. Many advanced academic degrees were produced.
The loan has contributed so much to the development of science and technology in
Korea.  The main benefits of the Project are as follows:
1. By utilizing the equipment introduced from the Loan, 1,132 research programs
among the selected research proposals of 1,621, were completed, and the other
programs seem to finish sooner or later. The research themes of 117 among the
total proposals accounting for 7.2 % are already being utilized and materialized
in produced goods in industries.
2. Among the patent rights of 160 in total registered by professors of the
Project universities  during the Project period, 52 rights, or 32.5% of them
were found related to researches of the loan Project.
3. The Project has contributed much to production of high quality manpower in
the fields of natural sciences and engineering. The 37 universities participa-
ting in the Project have contributed to, inter alia, production of 5,793 Masters'
and Doctoral degrees or 43.5% more in 1995 than those produced in 1990.
4. Due to the joint usage of the equipment imported under the Project, the use
ratio of the equipment has increased by 75.2% in graduate schools of natural
sciences and engineering, and by 60% in science education departments with the
equipment items that are used 20 hours or more during a week.
D. Science education departments in some universities had assigned their experi-
mental and practice training to the related departments in colleges of natural
sciences in the same university due to the shortage of the related training
equipment in their own departments. Through expansion of equipment in their
departments from the loan, they are now able to train students in their own
departments. The imported equipment is contributing to the in-service training
of the science teachers, too.
In addition to the benefits mentioned above, the Project's contributuion to the
development of universities, and science and technology in Korea is also recog-
nized. The loan seems to have contributed mucn to the Korea's entry into the
group of semi-developed countries as she is today overcoming the adverse circum-
stances of the latest Korean war. Her development to the level of graduation
from the loan programs of IBRD might  also be attributable to the Bank.
