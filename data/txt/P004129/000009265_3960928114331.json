The overall objective of the\n            Universities Science and Technology Research Project is to\n            assist selected universities in broadening and deepening\n            their basic research programs in priority fields in science\n            and technology in order to strengthen their capacity to\n            support technological innovation.  The project also aims  to\n            strengthen science teacher education through enhancing\n            research capacity in this field which in turn will\n            strengthen the base of science education in the secondary\n            schools. The project will finance : a) equipment for\n            graduate schools to assist in strengthening the research\n            capacity of individual departments of science and\n            engineering; b) equipment for use in joint research projects\n            involving more than one university; and c) equipment for\n            departments of science education to strengthen research in\n            areas of pedagogy and in particular science subjects."}, "docdt": "1990-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
