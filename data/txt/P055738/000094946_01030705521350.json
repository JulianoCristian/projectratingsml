Project, will increase the efficiency, enhance energy\n            conservation, and improve reliability in the city's\n            heating system, through the introduction of decentralized\n            mini-boilers, and, will further promote cost recovery\n            policies, and develop the new heating enterprise -\n            Sevteploservis - which will operate on a commercial basis.\n            The components call for: 1) supply and installation of\n            decentralized, gas-fired boiler plants with auxiliaries.\n            This will require design, and site management work, as well\n            as mobile maintenance units, and tools to maintain the\n            boiler plants. These plants will be connected to the\n            existing gas network, whose relatively new gas network, has\n            sufficient capacity, to reduce gas consumption in\n            Sevastopol, as well as improve the gas network pressure in\n            Crimea; 2) technical assistance for Sevteploservis financial\n            management, which includes implementation support, social\n            assistance support, and, a tariff study. The component\n            includes training, and equipment, and software supply; and,\n            3) incremental financial audits, regarding the initial five\n            year implementation period of Sevteploservis."}, "docdt": "2001-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
