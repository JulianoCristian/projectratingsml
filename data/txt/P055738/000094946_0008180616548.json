Nonetheless, only standards for carbon monoxide,\n            and nitrogen oxides emissions - from small boilers, burning\n            different fuels - are available, and, no standards seem to\n            be available for sulfur emissions, nor does any legislation\n            cover larger boilers. Emissions from the current district\n            heating estimates, are based on the energy situation in\n            1993, and fuel consumption is based on information available\n            from Sevteploenergo. Although, it is expected that fuel\n            consumption will decrease, resulting in improved\n            environmental conditions, mitigation include the change in\n            fuel, from coal to gas, or oil, and the exchange of old\n            boilers, which will improve the district heating system, and\n            allow for consumers' energy savings. Emissions of\n            carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxides into the atmosphere\n            will be reduced, limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases,\n            causing less acidification, while improving also, the local\n            atmosphere. Disposal of insulation materials are of great\n            concern, thus new insulation materials will not contain CFC\n            and HCFC. Though it is believed that asbestos exist, only\n            during rehabilitation works will it possible to accurately\n            minimize risks by containing asbestos material."}, "docdt": "1997-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
