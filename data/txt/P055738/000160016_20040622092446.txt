              SEVASTOPOLHEAT SUPPLY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
                                     (LoanNo 45990-UA)

  1.      This is the Project Completion Note for the Sevastopol Heat Supply Improvement
  Project in Ukraine, for which a Bank Loan o f US$ 28.19 million was approved by the
  Board on March 22, 2001. The Bank Loan was to Ukraine (represented by the Ministry
  o f Finance) to be on-lent to Sevastopol City State Administration (SCSA), the owner o f
  the new heat supply company Sevteploservis. SCSA would, inturn, on-lend the proceeds
  o f the Bank Loan to Sevteploservis. After a lengthy delay due largely to local politics,
  the Bank's Loan Agreement was signed on September 23,2002. However, the Loan did
  not become effective and, at the request o f the Borrower (the Ministry of Finance) dated
  January 22,2003, the Loanwas cancelled.

  2.      The key development objective o f the Project was to increase the efficiency,
  enhance energy conservation, and improve the reliability and service levels inthe heating
  and hot water system in Sevastopol through introduction of decentralized mini-boilers in
 the areas o f worst heating conditions and in key public buildings. The Project would
  further promote sound cost recovery policies and practices and the development o f a new
 heating enterprise, Sevteploservis, which would operate on a commercial basis.         An
 institutional support program included training, equipment, software and technical
 assistance for financial management, project implementation support, advice in
 improving the effectiveness o f Sevastopol's social assistance program, and a heat tariff
 study. The total project costs were estimated at US$ 35.7 million. Apart from the Bank
 Loan o f US$ 28.2 million, Sevteploservis was to provide another US$ 7.5 million
 equivalent out o f its own internally generated funds.

 3.       The proposed Loan was the third Bank operation in the heating and energy
,efficiency sector in Ukraine - the first one being the Kyiv District Heating Improvement
 Project and the second one being the Kyiv Public Buildings Energy Efficiency Project
 (both currently under implementation).       These first two projects were designed to
 demonstrate the benefits from undertaking investments on the supply side and demand
 side, respectively, to improve the existing district heating (DH) system in Kyiv. The
 Sevastopol Heat Supply Improvement Project differed from these projects in that it was
 designed as a pilot demonstration o f introduction o f a new decentralized heating system
 based on gas-fired mini-boilers in individual buildings in an area where DH was no
 longer the least-cost long-run heating alternative. In order to operate these new mini-
 boilers and to ensure that the new heating system would be managed on a commercial
 basis, a new municipal heating enterprise, Sevteploservis, was established, and the
 existing 10 municipal mini-boilers were transferred as part o f the initial capital
 contribution.

4.       After appraisal, the Mayor of Sevastopol, who had been strongly supporting the
Project, passed away, and a new Mayor was appointed by the President. Just before
negotiations, the new Mayor requested that the Bank reconsider the project design and
include solar collectors for hot water supply because they would allow for possible
 savings in gas consumption. The Bank explained that this option had been considered
 during project preparation and excluded due to the possible risk of vandalism and theft,
but agreed to reconsider the request, subject to demonstration o f satisfactory financial and
economic viability which was to be presented during negotiations.               The proposal,
however, was not raised againby the Sevastopol delegation duringnegotiations.

5.       As part o f the conditions for negotiations, SCSA, among other things, appointed
the key personnel for the new enterprise and assisted Sevteploservis to install financial
management systems acceptable to the Bank utilizing a grant from Finland, prepare the
opening balance sheet o f the company, reduce the accounts receivables o f existing mini-
boilers from 6 months to 54 days, prepare an action plan for enforcing collection o f heat
bills, and ensure that heat and hot water tariffs would be at a level sufficient to cover
relevant costs. Fulfilling these conditions under a new City management required quite a
lot o ftime and was the main reason for the delay inprocessing the Loan after appraisal.

6.       Negotiations for the proposed Bank Loan were held among representatives o f
SCSA, Sevteploservis, the Ministries o f Finance, Economy, Foreign Affairs and Justice
o f Ukraine, the Secretariat o f the Cabinet o f Ministers o f Ukraine, the State Committee of
Ukraine on Construction, Architecture and Housing Policy, and the Bank representatives
at the Bank's headquarters in Washington D.C. from January 22-26, 2001. The Cabinet
o fMinisters o f Ukraine approved the negotiated documents on February20,2001 prior to
Board approval on March 22,2001.

7.       In June 2001, a Bank mission to Sevastopol concluded that Sevteploservis and
SCSA had made substantial progress towards fulfilling the Bank's conditions for
effectiveness.    Surprisingly, during that visit, SCSA informed the mission that the
Sevastopol City Council had to formally approve the Project before signing the
subsidiary loan agreements and preparing the legal opinions, despite various earlier City
Council Decisions which included the Project in the development plan o f the City,
allocated local budgetary funds for it and authorized the Mayor to attend the Loan
negotiations. Thus, an Extraordinary Session o f the City Council was scheduled for July
10, 2001 for that purpose. The whole package o f effectiveness documents, including
legal opinions and subsidiary loan agreements, had to be approved before the signing o f
the Loan andProjectAgreements could take place.

8.       The Extraordinary Session o f the City Council was postponed until September 26,
2001. In that session, the councilors affiliated with the Communist Party o f Ukraine
opposed, among other things, the corporatization o f Sevteploservis and the increase in
heat tariffs for residential consumers. It appeared that the City Council was reluctant to
agree on all loan conditions in advance o f the City Council elections to be held inMarch
2002.    The CPU's overwhelming majority (about 75%) in the City Council led to
rejection o f the Project. The Session also proposed that the Mayor o f Sevastopol apply



                                               2

for funding from the State budget to improve the heating system at the expense of rent
obtained by Ukraine from Russia for locating the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.

9.      Despite this decision o f the Sevastopol City Council, during the Portfolio Review
o f World Bank-supported projects in Ukraine held in early November 2001, SCSA
resolved to set up a working group composed o f representatives o f the Sevastopol City
Council, SCSA and specialists o f the city's heat supply enterprises in order to prepare a
new presentation o f the Project to the City Council in December 2001. However, the
City Council did not include the Project in the agenda for that meeting. On January 23,
2002, the Bank received a letter from the Vice Prime Minister o f Ukraine highlighting
that this Project was one o f the best projects prepared incollaboration with the Bank and
requested the Bank to extend the period for signing the Loan and Project Agreements
untilafter the electionof the people's deputies to the Sevastopol City Council to be held
on March 31,2002. The Bank agreed to extend the period for approval o f the Project by
the new City Council until May 31, 2002. A copy o f the letter from the Vice Prime
Minister and the Bank's response are includedinAnnexes 1and 2.

 10.    The local election o f people's deputies to the Sevastopol City Council took place
inMarch 2002 and resulted in a totally different composition of the City Council, with
the share o f councilors affiliated with the CPU reduced from about 75% to about 12%. It
appeared that the heating situation was an important factor in the outcome o f the
elections. The new City Council decided on May 24, 2002 to approve the Project. The
decision o f the City Council i s attached as Annex 3. The Loan and Project Agreements
were subsequently signed inWashingtonon September23,2002.

11.     On December 16, 2002, the Mayor o f Sevastopol sent a letter to the Bank
informing that the project package had not yet been submitted to the Parliament for
ratification and taking into consideration that the Loan effectiveness date was December
22, 2002, requested an extension o f time for fulfilling this requirement. The delay in
ratification was due to the fact that the two subsidiary loan agreements, which had been
signed by the Sevastopol authorities, had not yet been signed by the Ministry o f Finance
due to the need to resolve a number o f issues raised bythe Sevastopol City Council when
it formally approved the Project.      The key issue concerned the more general central
government/local government fiscal relationship, mainly subsidies, and was not directly
related to the Project. The Ministry o f Finance directed the Sevastopol authorities to
reconsider the issues and approve the Project without the additional conditions on the
Ministryo fFinance. The Sevastopol City Council reconsidered the Project on December
11,2002 and formally re-approved the Project, dropping all additional conditions with
the exception o f the key condition related to the provision o f state subsidies for land rent.
The Decision of the City Council is attached as Annex 4. The Bank subsequently agreed
to extend the effectiveness deadline by one month until January 22, 2003 to determine
whether the Sevastopol authorities would be able to resolve their dispute with the
Ministry of Finance over the state subsidies for land rent. The letter of request for
extension o f the effectiveness period and the Bank's response are attached as Annexes 5
and 6.




                                              3

 12.     During the additional month, the problem between the Sevastopol City Council
and the Ministry o f Finance could not be resolved, and on January 22, 2003, the First
Vice Prime Minister o f Ukraine sent a letter to the Bank requestingcancellation o f the
Loan for the Sevastopol Heat Supply Improvement Project. The Bank responded on
January 29, 2003 and confirmed the cancellation o f the Loan. The letters requesting and
confirming cancellation o f the Loan are attached as Annexes 7 and 8.

 13.     The difficulties encountered in meeting the conditions for effectiveness for this
Project demonstrates the types o f problems which can arise when working directly with
municipal governments on the development o f infrastructure investment projects and in
particular how specific projects can be held hostage to issues, such as intergovernmental
transfers between the local and central authorities, which may not even be related to the
project. As a result o f this experience, inthe Country Assistance Strategy for 2004-2007,
the Bank's country management has decided to move away from direct interventionswith
specific municipalities andhas adopted less risky approaches for supportingimprovement
o f essential municipal services. One such approach, the proposed Municipal Credit
Market Development Project', currently under preparation, is helping to develop a legal
and regulatory framework for subnational borrowing. When approved, this project would
allow interested municipalities to come forward with financing proposals for
infrastructure investments to commercial banks, which in turn would receive
competitively-priced,      maturity-matching refinancing from a centralized municipal
development fund mechanism. In addition, political risk analysis has become a required
feature o fproject proposals.

14.     The Bank i s continuing to work towards strengthening o f the system o f
intergovemmental finance including measures under the framework o f the Programmatic
Adjustment Loans (PALS). The reforms have featured adoption o f a Budget Code in
2001 and a formula-based interbudgetary transfer system in 2001 and 2002, which
together with a special subvention fund to finance some centrally-mandated social
benefits in the regions, have narrowed the scope for discretionary bailouts o f local
administrations. This set o f measures, together with commitments to longer-term norms
for tax sharing rules, also created at least a minimal degree o f predictability o f future
financial flows in the regions and localities, thereby allowing for the development o f
financial planning and greater financial responsibility. For the first time, a number o f
local administrations have come to understand the links between their own budgetary
capacity and local tax revenues. The P A L agenda includes further support for:         (i)
development o f the capability by the Ministry o f Finance to assess tax capacity in local
budgets; and (ii)development o f methodology o f a systemic approach for allocating
subventions from the State budget for implementation o f investment projects. These
measures should reduce the types o f disputes over subsidies that arose in the context o f
the Sevastopol Heat Supply Improvement Project between SCSA and the central
government.

15.    The Bank understands that SCSA i s planning to continue to install gas-fired mini-
boilers in selected key public buildings (such as hospitals) in Sevastopol but at a much
slower pace than envisaged by the Project. The gas-fired mini- boilers installed to-date
have brought substantial benefits to Sevteploservis and the consumers, through a
substantially improved and more reliable heating and hot water service, which allows for
better regulation o f indoor temperatures.    The proposed Municipal Credit Market
Development Project, once inplace, may provide further opportunities for SCSA to raise
hndingfor installationofmini-boilers inresidential andpublic buildingsinSevastopol.

DearMr.Barbone,

        Letme exprtss the respectandgratitude to the World Bank for its assistance
to Ukraine. I look fmard to our bilaterally fruitful cooperation to continue
developmentinfurtum.

       As you are aware, preparationof the ScvastopolHeat Supply Improvement
Project was completed inUkraine. The LOMAgnement betweenUkraine and the
h m m t i o d Bank for Reconstruction and Dewelopment for thc Sevastapol Heat
Supply ImprovementProject and the Project Agreement between the International
Bank for ReconstruCtion and Development, the City of ScMstqpol and Sevrrstopol
Municipal EnterpriSe "Sevtaplossrvis" as well as supplcmcntaxy letters for these
agreements were signedonSeptember 23,2002 inWashingtonD.C..

       Incompliancewith Ukrainianlegislation,mDecember2002 the Projectwas
consideredbysessionof the SevastopolCityCouncil. However, the finaldecisionof
the Council does not allow the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine to sign the internal
agnements for theproject

       Taking into Coneideration the above and, therefore, the impossibility to
implementthe inbindgoMnanentprocedurefor theLoanAgreement's effectiveness
at a statedtime, we requestyou to cancelthe SevastopolHeat Supply Improvement
Project

       The Government of Ukraine takes this opportunity to thank you personally
onceagainfor your supportto the constructivecollaborationbetweenUkraineandthe
WorldBank

       The Government of Ukraine looks forward in your support and fixther

Dear Mr.Barbone:

        The MinistryofEconomy and EuropeanIntegration o fUkraine thanks you for the

the commentson it.

        The MinistryofEconomyjointly with the Ministryo fFinance, Ministryof
ForeignAffairs, MinistryofJustice, State HousingCommittee andSevasopol State City
Administartion reviewed the mentionedNoteand confirms the validity,
comprehensivenessand chronology ofthe information regardingthe events which took
placeduringthe project preparation.

       Moreover, as itwas reasonablystated inthe Note(point 13), duringthe
preparationofmunicipal projects certainproblems arised with the approval ofthe
projectsbythe localauthorities at the final stage ofthe projects. To solve this problemin
Ukraine, the governmentofUkrainejointly withthe World Bank initiatedthe Municipal
DevelopmentFundProject. Inthe fiamework o fthis project, the Ukraine Municipal
DevelopmentFundwas developedby the Resolutionofthe Cabinet ofMinisters ofJuly
17,2003 inorder to support socially important projects o fthe local self-govemance
bodiesinthe cities.

       We foresee that the realization ofthe mentionedproject will give a real
possibility to municipalities to usethe MunicipalDevelopment Fund. It will supportthe
financing oflocalauthorities inthe cities andthe enterprises which deliver communal
services andother services connectedwith city development.

       The mentionedpropositions may be incorporated as an amendment to the
SevastopolHeat SupplyImprovement Project Completion Note.

                            Re: Commentsto ProjectCompletionNote
                 SevastopolHeat Supply ImprovementProject(Loan 45990-UA)


Dear Mr.Luca Barbone,

         State Sevastopol Communal Enterprise `Sevteploservice" entirely and absolutely agrees
with the Project CompletionNote. The enterprise has no remarks to it.

        Also the enterprise wants to express the following.

        The fruitful collaboration o f the World Bank and the Government o f Ukraine caused the
development and implementationo f the different typical reforms, one o f which was an approval o f
the Budget code - 2001. It happened so, that the Budget Code came into effect at the same time as
our Project was submittedto the ratification at Sevastopol City Council. So, our Project was a pilot
Project, which had fully corresponded to the Budget Code o f Ukraine. But during the Budget Code
application some inconsistencies appeared in explanation o f the different Code provisions.
Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to solve such inconsistencies, and we didnot cope with
the task before the deadline.

        At the moment, when the Budget Code hadbeing implemented for more thantwo years and
all the inconsistencies with its application had been already solved, "Sevteploservise" requests you
the following.

        Taking into account that this Project i s o f the same importance today as it was at the
moment o f its signingby you and Mr.K.Hryschenko, Irequest you to consider the possibility o f its
regeneration at the same format and the same legal status.

        Imayensureyou,that`Sevteploservice' willmakeitsbesteffortsinordertousesucha
possibility.

        IexpressmysinceregratitudetoyouandMs.Gochenourandhercolleaguesforthefruitful
collaboration on the Project and look forward for its logic completion.


                                               Sincerely,

                                              Sergiy Dorul
