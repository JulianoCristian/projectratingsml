Report 5, Environmental Review
Draft Final
26 May 1997
1. Introduction
Regarding the environmental evaluation the project is a category B project, according to the
guidelines from the World Bank. The existing environmental conditions associated with the
district heating system in its present state of operation and maintenance have been evaluated.
The expected environmental effects of the proposed rehabilitation programmes have been
identified.
2. Environmental legislation
Emission standards of the former USSR is still valid for Ukraine. There are only standards for
CO and NOX emissions from small boilers buming different fuels. There are no standards for
sulphur and particular emissions. Larger boilers are not covered by any legislation.

3. Estimated emissions
3.1 Evaluation of the impact of the existing DH system
The emissions from the existing DH system is estimated based on the energy situation 1993
and the emission factors in Appendix 5.1. The emissions are evaluated based on inventory
results and where data is lacking the emissions are estimated based on fuel analyses and plant
design and operation. Table 3.1 presents the estimated emissions from each district. The fuel
consumptions are based on information available from Sevteploenergo. Data is, however,
lacking especially in district 5 and 6, showing too low numbers.

Table 3.2    The effect of the proposed measures on the annual emissions from each district.
The fuel consumption will actually decrease in all districts. In table 3.2 the estimated fuel
consumption is included for the buildings heated by the combined heat and power plant in
boiler house 534, about 175,000 MWh. This boiler house is not included in table 3.1. The
annual emissions from this boiler is about 64,000 kg NON, 35,000 ton CO2 and 125 kg S. In
table 3.2 about 40 % of the fuel consumption in district 6 is from boilers where data is missing
in the existing DH system.
The conclusion is that the different measures will result in improvements in most
environmental aspects. The measures include change in fuel from coal to gas or oil, exchange
of old boilers, improvements in the district heating system and energy savings on the
consumer side among others. The use of natural resources will decrease. The emissions of
NOX, sulphur dioxide, dust and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere will be reduced, limiting
the emissions of green house gases, causing less acidification and improving the local
atmosphere.
The amount of solid residues, mainly ash from coal combustion, will decline.
The proposed measures are expected to slightly improve the emissions into water.

4. Insulation materials
The handling of new as well as the disposal of old pipe insulation materials are of great
environmental concern. New insulation materials will not contain CFC and HCFC. Other
commercial products exist such as for example CO2 blown foam and will be used.
During the field trips the existing insulation materials have been identified to mostly consist
of stone wool (Rock wool) but there are also some asbestos. According to our contacts
asbestos for insulation is not allowed in Ukraine. We have, however not been able to identify
any official document regarding handling and disposal of used asbestos.
The main problem is if the parts that will be repaired or replaced are containing asbestos.
When people have to come in contact with asbestos they have to follow very strict
regulations. No one should have direct contact with the asbestos or breathe the air where there
could be asbestos particles.
W'hen it is found during the rehabilitation of the distribution net work and the boilers, that
asbestos has been used as insulating material, measures must be taken to minimise the risks
the workers involved in the removal of the containing insulating material asbestos. During
boiler or pipe rehabilitation, asbestos may be freed and measures for its safe removal and
deposition should be taken. These measures mainly comprise sealing off the area with e.g.
plastic sheets, providing tight clothing, breathing apparatuses and washing facilities for the
workers and thoroughly removing all material and dust from the site and packing the material
in air tight bags before deposition. The produced waste should according to Swedish
legislation be put into tight packages and locked up in containers marked "Asbestos". It is
then necessary to ensure safe disposal or destruction.
