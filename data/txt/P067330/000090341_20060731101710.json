Lessons learned from the project:\n            Technically sound research in important program areas can\n            lead to better policies. Successful monitoring of progress\n            with a large-scale priority program of this kind needs much\n            greater attention to data sources, timeliness, and quality.\n            Constant and independent technical guidance is critical for\n            disease control programs. A high level of political\n            awareness and attention is a major asset in reinvigorating a\n            large, and lagging, existing program. Clearly delineated\n            roles and responsibilities of center and states and follow\n            up to ensure that these roles and functions are being\n            adequately executed will ensure better results. Shared\n            vision will strengthen partnership between the government\n            and the development partners. Development objectives must be\n            carefully calibrated to reflect the scope and inputs\n            supported under the project.
