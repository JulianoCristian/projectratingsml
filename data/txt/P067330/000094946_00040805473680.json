The project is the first phase of\n            support for immunization, with a second project anticipated\n            about two years after this project becomes effective. There\n            are three project components. The first helps eradicate\n            polio by supplying polio vaccine and funding social\n            mobilization activities such as orientation and training,\n            transport, information and education, surveys and\n            evaluations, and other activities needed to assure coverage\n            of the target population. The second component improves the\n            quality of routine immunization. It addresses critical\n            weaknesses in program management (such as monitoring,\n            micro-planning, and training) and selectively upgrades cold\n            chain and injection safety equipment, and improves disease\n            surveillance capacity in selected laboratories. The third\n            component supports activities required to develop a\n            strategic framework to deal with vaccine-preventable\n            diseases during the next 7-10 years."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
