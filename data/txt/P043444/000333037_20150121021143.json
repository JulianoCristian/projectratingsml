The last 50 years saw scenic villages dotting the\n            coastline devolve into wastelands, as industrial complexes,\n            including a chemical plant, a cement mill, an iron-mill and\n            a shipyard rose to dominate the landscape. Houses and trees\n            were coated with soot, the blue Adriatic Sea turned dark\n            gray, and pollutants discharging into the water decimated\n            marine life. Local kids, like 12 year-olds Luka and Duje,\n            still spend their summers hanging out on these beaches, but\n            they can\u0092t believe that once, not so long ago, the coastline\n            was pristine and the sea did not give off foul odor. At the\n            request of the Croatian government in 1998, the World Bank\n            provided $36.6 million for a project to reduce wastewater\n            discharges into the bay, and to improve the delivery of\n            drinking water. The project, known as the EKO Kastela Bay\n            project, is restoring beaches along the coastline between\n            Split and Trogir, two ancient Roman towns on the UNESCO list\n            of historic places. The project is building underwater\n            tunnels that will clean sewage water, and pump it out\n            further into the open sea. The main tunnel is designed to\n            restore the bay\u0092s ecological balance."}, "docdt": "2003-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
