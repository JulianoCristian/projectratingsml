outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            improving financial and operational performance is an\n            important objective that needs consistent effort from all\n            sides to be achieved. Objectives need to be realistic, and\n            dialogue with the owners of the utilities, the local\n            governments, is an essential element to ensure the success.\n            Readiness for implementation is one of the key factors of\n            project success. Large infrastructure projects should\n            commence after land acquisition issues are cleared, the\n            final designs and necessary permits (location permit,\n            construction permit) are ready. Public consultation is also\n            an important element to explain the project to the affected\n            beneficiaries. The selection of monitoring indicators and\n            baselines need to be carefully done taking into account\n            existing capacities and applicable standards, and involving\n            institutions that are in place to monitor results. Showing a\n            clear link between wastewater infrastructure investments and\n            their environmental impact has positive demonstrative\n            effects on building acceptance and ownership of the project\n            in the region and the country."}, "docdt": "2008-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
