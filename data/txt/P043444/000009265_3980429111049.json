Kastela Bay that covers the\n            municipalities of Split, Solin, Kastela, and Trogir to\n            reduce the existing high environmental pollution.  This\n            environmental assessment aims at assessing potential\n            environmental consequences of the project; and recommending\n            measures that should be taken in order to maintain\n            conditions for the protection of the marine environment in\n            the sea.  During the construction of the collecting system,\n            the impact of odor will be mitigated by ventilators and\n            filters for air cleaning.  Noise will be reduced by burying\n            the structures under ground and sufficiently apart from\n            residential areas.  When constructing the treatment plants,\n            unpleasant odors and aerosols will be mitigated by forced\n            ventilation of the entire indoor space. Solid wastes\n            associated with the operation of the treatment works will be\n            properly disposed of.  For instance, screenings will be\n            washed, dewatered, and disposed at a sealed landfill site.\n            To prevent fresh and sea water pollution, the submarine part\n            of the outfalls will be protected from wave and anchorage\n            impacts by burying and concreting the pipes to the point of\n            8 meters of sea water depth.  The problem of vibration of\n            the outfalls as a result of air penetration into the pipes\n            will be eliminated by the construction of an appropriate\n            ventilation shaft."}, "docdt": "1996-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
