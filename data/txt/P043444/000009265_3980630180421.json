drinking water in the project\n            area; and c) improve the operational and financial\n            performance of the water and wastewater utility, to make it\n            more attractive for private sector participation in the\n            future.  There are three project components. First, the\n            wastewater component will include reconstruction, expansion,\n            and upgrading of the wastewater collection, treatment, and\n            disposal system for the Split, Solin, Kastela,and Trogir\n            municipalities. Second, the water component will cover\n            reconstruction and upgrading of the water treatment and\n            delivery systems for the Split, Solin, Kastela, and Trogir\n            municipalities. Third, the institutional strengthening\n            component will provide technical assistance to the project agencies."}, "docdt": "1998-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
