                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There has been good implementation progress since the last (mid-term review) mission. Disbursement reaches now 65% on the initial grant and 44% over both grants, against 34,5%
                         et 17% respectively at mid-term. Almost all contracts are now committed, and the start of roadworks represents an additional 27% of commitment of funds. The only large
                         investments yet to be procured are the health center and the rainwater channel cleaning.

                         There has also been good progress with the management of the Community Development Center (CDC) that has benefited from an institutional reform of all CDCs’ management,
                         and is now being used by the population of the area. This needs to be strengthened to ensure sustainability of this investment. Further, adequate management arrangements must
                         also be established for the other community infrastructure that is being built.

                         Following the conclusions of the mid-term review, that highlighted funding shortages and a lack of time for completion, the Government of Djibouti has formally requested a
                         restructuring of the Project that should enable the Project to be amended so that it can achieve its current development objective within the available funding.
