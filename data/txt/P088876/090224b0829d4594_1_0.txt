Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Two supervision missions took place in September and November 2014. Implementation is progressing at a good pace, the project was granted a 9-
 month extension until December 31, 2014, to allow all activities to be finalized and the project to reach its development objective. Disbursements now
 stand at 100% for the first grant and 95% for the second, compared to 78% for both in December 2013. All planned activities are being closed and
 received on time. Those remaining (including the delivery of dredging truck and pickups, OVD software installation, and finalization of children’s’
 playground) are being closely monitored to make sure that adaptable actions are tailored if needed.
 The client was informed that all activities not finalized on time will not be eligible for Bank financing. A weekly monitoring program was developed with
 ADDS to update the Bank team on overall progress of activities. Project lessons learned will have to be properly identified both in the client’ Evaluation
 Report and the Bank’s ICR to ensure that ongoing and future activities are better designed and managed. A new TTL is being assigned to oversee
 project closing and identify objective lessons learned. Delays in project implementation did not affect attainment of PDO.
 DUPREP increased Q7 residents’ access to basic services and social infrastructure. It consolidated the Bank’s ongoing engagement in Djibouti’s urban
 sector dates back to 1984 achieving:
 1.        Improved access to basic infrastructure and community services by constructing, among others, four major roads and associated drains inside
           and outside Q7; a community development center, two sport courts with associated services and commercial spaces, a children’s garden and
           a health center. The project also created more than 15,000 person days of short-term job opportunities, and allowed 50 percent more
           households to have access to an all-seasoned road;
 2.        Enhanced social cohesion and access to social opportunities, mostly targeting women and youth, through numerous literacy programs,
           vocational trainings, capacity building for community associations, hygiene campaigns, and other community development activities; and,
 3.        Increased capacity building of selected institutions by (i) creating a financial and stock management system in OVD; and (ii) preparing the
           Djibouti City urban development plan, among other efforts.
 This said, the sustainability of investments remains a concern, especially with limited resources allocated to facilities O&M. This is more specific to
 roads, and sports and social facilities. The team is working with ADDS to support asset owners with social engineering aspects to improve community
 ownership and kick-start community-led O&M activities when possible. A study on lessons learned was conducted, and its’ recommendations were
 included in DUPREP II, where a CDF was established to fund community-led activities oriented towards the durability of newly built assets.
 Although suffered from delays, certain project management shortcomings, safeguards and fiduciary challenges, most project indicators have been
 attained or exceeded, and the project attained its development objectives. The overall project rating is evaluated to be Satisfactory.
