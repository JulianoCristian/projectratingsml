                         Following the official Government request to fund a second urban project that should still mostly focus on Quartier 7 the Bank team conducted identification and preparation missions.
                         Those resulted in the preparation of a detailed design of the Second Urban Poverty Reduction Project (DUPREP II). This new project is being designed in close collaboration with the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank team is engaged in discussions with the Government of Djibouti on the possibility of extending the closure date by another 6 months. If agreed, an official letter will be sent
                         to the Bank. A weekly monitoring program is being developed with ADDS to update the Bank team on overall progress of activities. A supervision mission will take place last week of
                         January and first week of February.

                         Following the preparation mission in September/October 2013, and the mutual agreement on project content both in terms of physical investments and institutional support, the Bank
                         will prepare a Project Appraisal Document to be shared, completed, and validated with key stakeholders during the Pre-Appraisal mission that will take place last week of January
                         and first week of February.
