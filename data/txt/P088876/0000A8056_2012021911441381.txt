                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This mission was the mid-term review of the project. The mission noted significant progress in project implementation management. Since the last mission (June 2011),
                         implementation pro-activity improved, especially regarding procurement. An adequate solution has been found to deal with the issue of higher than expected street paving costs, and
                         the proposed change of scope has been accepted by the Bank. The corresponding contracts are about to be signed, as well as several other significant contracts for social
                         infrastructure (sports field, etc.). As for the health center, its design is being finalized. This should lead to a large increase in commitment of funds before the next implementation

                         However, at the date of this mid-term review, the disbursement ratio (34,5% on the first IDA grant, or 17% when including the additional IDA grant) remained well below initial
                         forecasts, which calls for sustaining efforts to avoid incurring any further delays. Given the schedule forecast for implementation, and already incurred delays, the mission and the

                         implementing agency ADDS agreed that a 7-month extension of the closing date was needed -- until December 31, 2013.

                         In addition, the mission noted a worsening of the issue of lack of management of the community development center (CDC). Its construction was finished over a year ago, but it
                         remains very little utilized and not maintained. There is thus a significant risk that this project investment could deteriorate rapidly. As promised during the mission, the Government,
                         through the State Secretariat for Youth and Sports has since then issued a decree that defines a new institutional framework to remedy these management issues (which have been
                         affecting a majority of CDCs in the country). A new interim Director for the CDC has also been named following the issuance of the decree.

                         •       Reduce quantities by about 25% for street surfacing
                         •       Adjust project indicators to reflect changes decided at mid-term, in particular regarding the street surfacing and sanitation sub-components
                         •       Allocate the initially non-allocated amount to cope with the likely cost overruns in the various project sub-components.

                         The Djibouti Government will make a formal request for these adjustments.
