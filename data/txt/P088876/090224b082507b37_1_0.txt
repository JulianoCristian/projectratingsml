                         Poverty Reduction Project (DUPREP II) was negotiated in Djibouti on April 7 and 8, 2014. DUPREP II was designed and will be implemented in close collaboration with the French
                         Development Agency (AFD). This project will mainstream Gender, Citizen Engagement and DRM into project design and objectives.

                         Sustainability of investments remains a concern, especially with limited resources allocated to facilities O&M. This is more specific to roads, and sport and social facilities. The team is
                         working with the ADDS to support asset owners with social engineering aspects to improve community ownership and kick-start community-led O&M activities when possible.
                         DUPREP II will fund community-led activities oriented towards the durability of newly built assets.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A 9-month extension of the project was granted to allow proper completion of project activities and reaching its development objectives. The revised closing date is December 31,
                         2014. A weekly monitoring program was developed with ADDS to update the Bank team on overall progress of activities. A supervision mission will take place in September 2014.
                         Sustainability of project assets remains a concern. The Bank team is working closely with the Government and the ADDS to ensure funds are allocated to proper O&M, and that local
                         communities can take ownership and sustain the newly built assets.

                         An appraisal and negotiations mission for the DUPREP II took place from March 23 to April 9 2014. The project is expected to kick-start in September 2014.
