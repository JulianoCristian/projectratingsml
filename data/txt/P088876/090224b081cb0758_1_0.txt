                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation has kept progressing at a good pace since conclusion of the restructuring, and the project should be able to reach its development objective within the available
                         funding. Disbursements now stand at 68% over both grants, against 44% last November. Cut stone paving is underway on the remaining roads. The only large investments yet to be
                         procured are the health center and the rainwater channel cleaning, with the contract for the health center about to be awarded.

                         In the framework of the discussions on the new Country Partnership Strategy, the Government of Djibouti has formally requested IDA to fund a second urban project that should still
                         mostly focus on Quartier 7. Preliminary discussions pointed to the need to continue the urban upgrading of Quartier 7. In particular, while the current project will still broadly reach its
                         development objective, the quantitative reduction in output targets required in the current project due to higher than expected unit construction costs leaves an unmet need for further
                         infrastructure investments. In addition, a second project will focus some of its investments on the poorest part of Quartier 7, the Djaga-Boulgo area, which due to the particular

                         complexity of its urban fabric, could not be addressed in the current project.

                         The new project will likely remain part of the broader national urban poverty reduction program, which several donors have indicated a continued interest to support. It will also
                         leverage a new $500k trust-funded study on a national housing strategy. It was agreed that ADDS will prepare a request for a Project Preparation Facility which will be reviewed with
                         the team during the next mission.
