strengthen the capacity of the Republic of\n            Nicaragua's health system to support the control of the\n            spread and the effects of NHlNl Human Influenza through\n            prevention, monitoring, and treatment of affected\n            populations, with special attention to high risk groups. The\n            grant will help finance the costs associated with the\n            Government's effort to monitor, control, and reduce the\n            number of fatalities and the risk of contraction of the\n            A/HlNl Human Influenza, which has resulted in 2,152\n            confirmed cases of the A/HlN1 Human Influenza registered as\n            of October 30, 2009, and eighteen deaths reported. Given\n            that epidemiologists expect a second wave of the influenza\n            to hit Central America beginning in the Fall, the Government\n            of Nicaragua (GoN) has requested Bank support in\n            strengthening its capacity to manage the spread of the virus\n            (and other influenza viruses as well). The project will\n            assist Nicaragua in improving its epidemiological\n            surveillance system and providing medicines to treat\n            infected individuals, with special attention to high risk groups."}, "docdt": "2009-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
