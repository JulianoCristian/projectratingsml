for the Health System\n            Strengthening and Response to Epidemiological Emergencies\n            Project for Nicaragua were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: emergency projects like this one need to be kept\n            simple, flexible and focused on solving the problem.\n            Therefore the Bank needs to ensure that procurement policies\n            can be used flexibly, and that decisions can be made\n            efficiently. This operation had some problems with timing.\n            The project was able to compensate for the time lost,\n            because of its focus on building long-term capacity for\n            surveillance and prevention. The monitoring and results\n            framework was succinct and appropriate for the emergency\n            operation and covered all development objectives. The\n            project design will have benefitted from including a\n            thorough economic analysis, as well as an impact analysis\n            with data on treatment, service utilization, and\n            effectiveness of the surveillance system. The results\n            framework reflects mostly outputs from project activities,\n            and quantitative data on the status and effectiveness of the\n            surveillance system was not routinely available for\n            inclusion in this report. This lesson should be taken into\n            account for the design of similar projects, where one of the\n            main goals is to build surveillance capacity."}, "docdt": "2012-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
