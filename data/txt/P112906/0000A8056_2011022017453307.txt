                         The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the capacity of the Nicaraguan health system to manage the spread and the effects of A/H1N1 Influenza
                         through prevention, monitoring, and treating affected populations, with special attention to high risk groups.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is being implemented faster than the original plan. After 8 months of effectiveness, the project disbursed about 90% of the funds, and implemented most of the activities
                         included in the entire project.
                         Given the main purpose of this project, the MINSA is accelerating its implementation to strengthen the epidemiological surveillance system and the response to emergencies. All the
                         project intermediate indicators surpass the expected values for this project stage and the Project will be completed long before the original project closing date (June 30, 2012).
