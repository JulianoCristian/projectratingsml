                                   Reallocation of Proceeds

NICARAGUA — Health System Strengthening And Response To Epidemiological Emergencies
                                Project - P112906
             SDR 3.2 MILLION (US$5.0 MILLION EQUIVALENT)

1. This Restructuring Paper introduces changes to the Financing Agreement for the Nicaragua
   Health System Strengthening and Response to Epidemiological Emergencies Project
    (Grant H-530-NI). The total amount of the Grant is SDR 3.2 million (US$5.0 million
   equivalent).

2. The proposed request from the Government of Nicaragua dated March 23, 2011, includes a
   reallocation of the Grant proceeds to cover the overdraft of 150,488 (SDR) in Category 1
   (Goods and Consultants’ services for Part A of the project), reducing funds from Category 2
   (Goods and Consultants services and Non Consultants services for Part B of the Project), and
   Category 3 (Consultant services for Part C of the project).

3. The Government proposed this reallocation due to a substantial reduction in the amount of
   grant proceeds available for project activities due to a difference in exchange rates of the
   Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Despite this situation, the Government has carried out the
   activities established under the MINSA-PAHO Agreement.

4. The above re-allocation will allow the project to meet project’s objectives and complete all
   planned activities before the Closing Date of June 30, 2012.

5. The total amount of the grant has been affected by the change of the currency exchange rate
   since it was estimated at the moment of the project preparation. The change in the currency
   exchange rate substantially decreased the amount of funds available.

6. The project is being implemented faster than the original plan. To date, 90 percent of the
   Grant proceeds has been disbursed and most of the project activities have been implemented.
   The Nicaraguan Ministry of Health (MINSA) has accelerated project implementation in
   order to strengthen the epidemiological surveillance system and the responses to
   emergencies. All of the project’s intermediate indicators surpass the expected values for this
   project stage.
