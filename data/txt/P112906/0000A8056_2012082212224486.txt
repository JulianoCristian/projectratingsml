                         The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the capacity of the Nicaraguan health system to manage the spread and the effects of A/H1N1 Influenza through
                         prevention, monitoring, and treating affected populations, with special attention to high risk groups.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project contributed to mitigate the impact of the A/H1N1 Influenza and strengthen the country's overall epidemiological surveillance system and the capacity to respond to future
                         epidemiological emergencies in Nicaragua. The impact of the epidemic was mitigated with the timely distribution of medicines and medical supplies to SILAIS according to the MOH
                         proposed plan. Thanks to savings on bulk purchases of these medicines and supplies, it was possible to complement with supplementary purchases of vaccines for the country.

                         The epidemiological surveillance and prevention program was strengthened through the certification of 3 laboratories on control of A/H1N1 human influenza and the certification of 27
                         hospitals in infection control and case management. In addition, the project supported the design of education materials, surveillance instruments and the training to front line
                         personnel and health care workers
