The overall outcome of the project is rated\n            highly satisfactory; the performance of the World Bank is\n            rated satisfactory and the performance of the Royal\n            Government of Bhutan (RGOB) was rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from this project are as follows: (i) Legal\n            framework - It is essential for trust funds to have a legal\n            framework to institutionalize collaboration between donors\n            and recipients, make decision making and implementation\n            transparent, and make management accountable. (ii)\n            Benchmarks - Concrete conservation program benchmarks during\n            the first five years served as useful incentives, as clear\n            indicators of achievement, and as mechanisms to mobilize\n            donor support additional to that which was initially\n            provided by the trust fund. It would have been helpful if\n            the benchmarks addressed not only conservation program\n            achievements, but also institutional development of the\n            trust fund entity itself. (iii) Start-up Funding - World\n            Wildlife Fund. U.S. (WWF-US) provided valuable support\n            during the start-up of the benchmark activities, separate\n            from the uncertain investment income. During the initial\n            period of trust fund establishment, it is essential to have\n            reliable funding that does not depend upon investment\n            income. (iv) Donor Support - RGOB's strong reputation\n            for integrity in governance, its demonstrated commitment to\n            conservation, and the small size of the country (with\n            associated support from interested European countries) all\n            contributed to willingness of donors to make relatively\n            large contributions. These conditions may limit the\n            likelihood of replicating comparable levels of support for\n            trust funds in many other countries."}, "docdt": "1998-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
