The first\n            objective is to assist the government in conserving its\n            forestry and preserving the rich biological diversity.  The\n            second is to test the feasibility of trust funds as a\n            mechanism for providing long-term and sustainable support\n            for conservation of biological diversity.  The specific\n            activities supported under the project will include, but not\n            be limited to:  (a) upgrading the Department of\n            Forestry's Wildlife Division to a Nature Conservation\n            Division, providing additional staff and training, and\n            strengthening its capacity to plan and manage a national\n            protected areas system and to monitor changes in biological\n            diversity; (b) establishing a national system of protected\n            areas by identifying areas for protection, designating\n            different protection categories, and prioritizing protected\n            areas for management; (c) gazetting four priority protected\n            areas and developing one detailed management plan that will\n            serve as a model for other areas; (d) strengthening the\n            management of two existing priority protected areas among\n            other things through the provision of additional staff,\n            training inventories and research, and infrastructure\n            development; and (e) establishing, in phases, additional\n            protected areas such as the Black Mountain Reserve."}, "docdt": "1992-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
