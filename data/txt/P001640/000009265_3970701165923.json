  Drought Recovery Program (EDDRP). The objectives of the\n            EDDRP were to broaden economic participation, to enable a\n            sustainable supply response, and to prevent widespread\n            starvation as a result of severe drought through a set of\n            mutually reinforcing policy measures in the following areas:\n            (i) improvement of the environment for entrepreneurial\n            activity and investment in labor-intensive activities; (ii)\n            expansion of access to financial capital and deepening of\n            financial markets; (iii) reorientation of fiscal and labor\n            policy towards human capital development; and (iv)\n            procurement of commercial maize imports. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) with strong government commitment a country can stay on\n            the adjustment course despite large unanticipated external\n            shocks; (ii) adjustment in countries with extremely low\n            income levels like Malawi, is a long-term process and will\n            continue into the next decade; (iii) cross-conditionality\n            with other International Development Association (IDA)\n            projects resulted in \"marginalizing\" some\n            objectives and created supervision problems; (iv)\n            flexibility in the design and implementation of the program\n            to respond to new information or emerging problems during\n            implementation is criticalfor success; (v) irreversible\n            up-front actions enhance prospects for successful\n            implementation; and (vi) timely Balance of Payments (BOP)\n            support to address natural disasters can be extremely\n            important for keeping the overall adjustment program on track."}, "docdt": "1996-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
