Background.    Malawi is a small land-locked country with a total
population of about 8 million (85 W rural). Malawi's agriculturally
based economy is fragile and the resource base is narrow. Malawi is
affected by severe drought for the second time in three years. The new
Government -- in office since May 1994 following the first multiparty
elections in three decades -- has asked the donor community for
additional assistance during this emergency situation. The most
immediate consequence of the drought is the need to import 445,000 MT of
maize (comprising 200,000 MT for targeted free distribution to food
deficit households in drought areas and 245,000 MT to be distributed
through commercial channels) to achieve food security and stabilize
commercial maize markets. The Government needs to provide adequate
levels of commercial maize to help maintain consumer prices at
affordable levels (i.e., at the target consumer price) so that free
maize distribution is limited as a measure of last resort for the very
poor. This policy is consistent with the new Government's strong
commitment to poverty alleviation as the core of the development agenda.
Effective and timely assistance by IDA and other donors -- during the
current drought emergency -- will support macroeconomic stabilization
and will allow the new Government to continue implementing its
adjustment policies.
Project Objectives and Description: The central objective of the
supplemental financing credit is to reduce drought related food
insecurity and help stabilize maize markets. This credit acts as a
supplement to the original Entrepeneurship Development and Drought
Recovery Program (EDDRP Credit # 2396-MAI). The original EDDRP was
approved by the Executive Directors on June 23, 1992, and became
effective on July 7, 1992. The EDDRP provides financing to: (i) prevent
widespread food insecurity, and alleviate the impact of severe drought;
and (ii) facilitate reforms to broaden economic participation and enable



a sustainable supply response consistent with medium-term balance of
payments viability, growth, and poverty reduction.
Environmental Issues: Considering that the supplement is designed, to
provide financing towards reducing drought related food insecurity and
help stabilize maize markets, environmental considerations have no
direct relevance.
Project Implementation: This credit will be disbursed against imports
of maize.
