The core of the adjustment\n            program is a set of specific policy reforms which will\n            remove these contraints. To create an enabling environment\n            for private sector entrepreneurs to respond and invest in\n            physical capital, the program includes regulatory,\n            administrative and policy measures to encourage investment\n            by both small and large scale enterprises and extend trade\n            reform to ensure an outward orientation of the private\n            sector response. To promote access to financial capital for\n            new clients and activities, the program focuses on\n            increasing financial sector competition, including\n            introduction of market-oriented monetary control instruments\n            and open entry of new domestic and foreign institutions into\n            banking activities. To broaden access to human capital and\n            expand employment opportunities, the program includes the\n            reorientation of public expenditures in favor of human\n            capital combined with measures to improve functioning of\n            labor markets. Also, a serious drought has affected the\n            entire Southern African region.
