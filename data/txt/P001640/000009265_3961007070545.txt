REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE
ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND DROUGHT RECOVERY PROGRAM
SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Malawi
Beneficiary:        N/A
Amount:            IDA: SDR 27.6 million (US$40 million equivalent)
Total extenal support under the program amounts to more than US$266
nmillion. In addition to the original IDA allocation (US$120 million) plus
US$10 million in IDA reflows, cofinancing is provided by the
Govermnent of Japan (US$70 million), by the African Development Fund
(FUA 10 million), by the Gennan Government (DM 20 million), and by
the European Union (ECU 30 million).
Poverty:            The cental objective of the supplemental financing arrangement is to
reduce drought related food insecurity and help stabilize maize markets.
Description:        The proposed supplemental financing arrangement under the ongoing
EDDRP adjustment credit is IDA's contribution to help close the
unanticipated exteal financing gap that is the result of drought-related
import requirements (equivalent to US$102 million).
Malawi is affected by severe drought for the second time in three years.
The new Govenmment - in office since May 1994 following the first
multiparty elections in three decades - has asked the donor comnmnity for
additional assistance during this emergency situation. The most
immediate consequence of the drought is the need to import 445,000 MT
of maize (comprising 200,000 MT for targeted free distribution to food
deficit households in drought areas and 245,000 MT to be distributed
through commercial channels) to achieve food security and stabilize
commercial maize markets.
The Government needs to provide adequate levels of commercial maize to
help maintain consumer prices at affordable levels (i.e., at the target
consumer price) so that free maize distribution is limited as a measure of
last resort for the very poor. TIus pokcy is consistent with the new
Government's strong commiutment to poverty alleviation as the core of the
development agenda.
The current unanticipated external supply shock was highlighted as an
inherent risk of the Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board



on June 7, 1994, in conjunction with the Second Institutional
Development Project (Credit No. 2624-MAI). The Government and
Bank are in full agreement with regard to rnacroeconomic and
structural policies, particularly with regard to the Government driven
initiatives on private sector development and poverty alleviation.
Th:tre is a high probability that the Bank mnay shift into the high
lending scenario as Government has already demnonstrated its
commitment to quickly removing structural obstacles to an accelerated
supply response and sustainable poverty alleviation.
Effective and timely assistance by IDA and other donors - during the
current drought emerency - will support macroeconomic stabilization
and will allow the new Govenment to contiue implementing its
adjustment policies.
The original EDDRP was approved by the Executive Directors on June
23, 1992, and became effctive on July 7, 1992. The EDDRP provides
financing to (i) prevent widespread food insecunty, and alleviate the
impact of severe drought; and (ii) facilitate reforms to broaden economic
participation and enable a sustinable supply response consistent with
medium-term balance of payments viability, growth, and poverty
reduction.
IDA released the second credit tranche on September 23, 1993, after: (i)
satisfactory progress had been made in carrying out the reform program;
(ii) monetary and fiscal policies had been tightened to ensure stabilization
of the economy; (iii) sufficient new exnal aid had been mobilized to
ensure that the adjustment program was fillly financed, and (iv) specific
conditions for release of the second trnche were met.
The closing date of the credit has been extended through June 1995, to
facilitate full disbursement of all existng cofinancing arrangments.
The current overall rafing for the credit is "Highly Satisfactory."
Term:              Standard IDA terms; 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.
Commitment Fee:    0.50% on undisbursed credit balance, beginning 60 days after signig.
Staff Appraisal
Report:            N/A for amendment to existing adjustment operation.



INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING ARRANGEMENT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
UNDER THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT
AND DROUGHT RECOVERY PROGRAM (CREDIT NO. 2396-MAI)
1.    I submit for your approval the followMng report and recommendation on a proposed
supplemental financing arrangemet, to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 27.6 million (US$40
nmllion equivalent) under the Entrepreneurship Development and Drought Recovery Progran
(EDDRP; Credit 2396-MAI). The supplemental financing arrangment would be on the same
tms as the main credit, i.e., standard IDA terms with 40-year maturity and a 10-year grace
period. This memorandum (i) gives a short overview of post transition developments in Malawi
and the curren drought which is the cause for additional fnancing needs; (ii) assesses food import
requrements; (iii) outl   the measures already taken to address the drought situaton, (iv)
summarize the medium-term macroecononuc firamework; (v) reviews the credit's history and
progress to date; (vi) highlights the relationship between the Country Assistance Strategy and the
proposed Bank action; and (vii) presents an extemal financing plan for 1994-95.
OVERVIEW
2.    Malawi, one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, has recenty completed a
peaceful political transition from over 20 years under a single party system to a multiparty
democracy. International observers commended the tramsition process, including the geneal
elections of May 1994 which ushered the previous opposition into goverment. This achievement
is all the more inpressive given the economic challenges of 1992-93; including withdrawal of non-
humanrian bilatal donor support because of governance issues and the worst regional drought
on record.
3.    The new Govemment is fully committed to consolidating the econornic stbilization
process and attacking the coumtys pervasive poverty problem. After four months in office, the
new Govermnment's track record with regard to poverty alleviation is impressive; e.g., school fees
for primary education were waived, cntical restrictions on prices and markting in agncultre have
been lifted, and a Social Action Fund (SAF) for community based invesnts in social sectors is
being put in place on a fast track, wih IDA assistance. A Presidential Council on Poverty
Alleviation (with broad based participation of NGOs, traditonal leaders, religious groups, and
political parties) has been put in place to set overall policy direction, mobilize resources, and
sensize the populace at large about poverty issues and programs. The challenges facing a new
Govenment would be formidable even under normal circumstances. In Malawi, the new
Govenmment's credibility and economic managemet are, m addition, being tested by anoter
severe drought.
4.    For the second time in three years, economic managenat is being challenged by a massive
crop failure due to a drought as serious as the one in early 1992. Maize production in 1994'

dropped to 831,000 MT from over 2 million MlT in the previous year. The situation has been
aggravated by the collapse of the agricultural credit system during the months preceding the
general elections. Use of hybrid seed and fertlizer dropped sharply because farners who
defaulted on the previous years' loans could not obtain new credit. The new Govermnent has
already taken effective steps to resuscitate the rural credit system; including the transfer of the
system from direct Government control to an autonomous financial institution (with support from
IDA under another credit). By developing sound operational procedures and lending requirements
the new rural credit system will help prevent future large-scale defaults. The restructured credit
system began operation in October 1994 and will work to ensure credit availability for those
fanners who qualify under the strengthened eligibility criteria and will help increase food supplies
through higher yields in 1995.
5.    The most immediate consequence of the drought is the need to import 445,000 MT of
maize to achieve food security. Out of the total, a mmnmum of 200,000 MT is needed for
distribution as emergency food aid for some 600,000 smallholder families whose crops failed. The
balance of 245,000 MT is urgently required as coumercial food aid to stabilize the market until
the next crop is harvested (May 1995). The Govermnent is particularly concemed to ensure
sufficient supplies of conunercial maize so that consumer prices can be maintained at the targeted
levels and free maize distribution can be limited as a measure of last resort to reach the very poor.
This policy is consistent with the new Govenmment's strong commitment to poverty aDleviation and
support of private sector participation in agricultural marketing.
6.    The additional import requirements inevitably increase the external financing gap for
1994/952. Assuming that all maize can be imported from within the region, the total foreign cost
for maize imports is estimated at US$102 million (at total cost of US$230 per MT). The new
Govemment has asked the donor community for additional assistance to help finance this amount.
Despite a substanial and rapid donors' response through pledges for commercial and relief maize
nd offers to divert existing balance of payment commitmnets to maize imports, the overall
fancing gap cannot be closed without multilateral support. The proposed supplemental
financing arrangement under the ongoing EDDRP adjustment credit is IDA's contribution to
help dose the unanticipated external financing gap and help ensure that external funding
levels are adequate for (i) drought related imports to achieve food security; and (ii) general
import support under the adjustment program.
EMERGENCY FOOD IMPORTS - NEEDS ASSESSMENT
7.    Production. The 1994 production of Malawi's main stable food - white maize - is
estimated at 831,000 MT. This is 60 percent lower than last year's record harvest of 2 million MT
and only slightly higher than the extremely poor crop in 1992 (657,000 MT) when the country was
hit by a devastatn drought which affected the entire southern Afiica sub-region (Figure 1). The
small size of the 1994 harvest mainly reflects the delayed onset of the rainy season, extended dry
spells, and insufficient and poorly distributed rainfal throughout the growing season. The sharp
fal in maize production has resuled in a large food deficit in 1994/95, and substantial maize
imports are needed.

8.    Import Requirements. Due to the unusually large 1993 harvest the Agriculural
Development and Markefting Corporation (ADMARC) started the 1994/95 marketing year (April
1994 through March 1995) with a stock of 1 10,000 MT and a Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) of
180, 000 MT. On-farm stocks from last year's harvest are estimated at 30,000 MT. This amount
combioed with the expected draw-down of the entire ADMARC stocks and 140,000 MT from the
SGR implies total available stocks of 280,000 MT. Hence total domestic availability of maize is
about 1.11 million MT (Figure 2). Tle toal requirement for 1994/95 is estinated at 1.55 million
MT, assuming a trget per capita consumption level of 150 kg of maize for a population of 9.5
million plus allowance for seed, feed and wastage of 138,000 MT. Consequently, the maize import
requirement for 1994/95 is 445,000 MT (excluding the needs of the Mozambican refigees which
are covered through other relief channels).?
9.     Out of the total import requirment some 200,000 MT wil be needed as emergency food
aid for 3 million drought-affected Malawians. The remaiing 245,000 MT are being handled as
program food aid (provided through commercial dhannels) to stabilize maize pnces in the 1994/95
marketing year. In a year of a subsal drop in food crop production coupled vwith a sharp
decline in the production of major cash crops, such as groundnuts and cotton, many rural
households are sufring a significant decline in mcome. This reinforces the need for adequate
maize supply through commercial channels to prevent sharp increases of consumer prices due to
rationing or specuative stockpiling. The consumer price of maize is currently at MK 67 per 90 kg
bag; the official consumer price applicable for the 1994/95 marketing year. Prices so far have
remained stable because markets have been adequately supplied from ADMARC stocks and the
SGR However, to hold prices at this level requires adequate maize supplies through April 1995.
Failure to maintan stocks in rral areas for sale at the official pnce would seriously jeopardize the

effectiveness of the limited relief program and could undermine the credibility of the market
support systms. This was the expenence in 1992 drought relief efforts when ADMARC ran short
of commercial maize supplies and had to impose stringent rationing. The counercial maize
imports will be critical for maintaining price stability.

10.   Logistics. The lessons leamed in the 1992 drought operation will be taken into
consideration during the 1994 drought. The Govemment plans to work closely with NGOs in
coordinating drought relief efforts. This will provide an excellent springboard from which to
launch various programs over the next two months to penrit a successful distribution, including
commnity-based food-for-work activities. However, the local administrative, managal and
technical capacity to undertake such programs is limited. In addition, NGO cpacity has declined
since the 1992 drought and many NMOs have sen key staff into neighboring Mozambique to
taclde problems connected with the retuming refiugees and the demobilization program.
Consequently, free distribution may have to remain ue principal food distribution mehanism for
meeting relief needs in regions where food-for-work schemes cannot cope.
11.   Malawi has a proven capacity to handle and transport 600,000 MT of imported cereals,
and the impor, storage, and internal distribution of 445,000 MT of maize in 1994/95 should not
pose serious logistical problems. During the 1992 drought relief operation, ahmost 300,000 MT of
maize were imported and distributed throughout the country using the storage facilities of
ADMARC and the transport fleet of the local private sector. Commercial imports financed by
IDA added a fiurter 100,000 MT, and the Mozambican refiBgee program imported 200,000 MT.

MEASURES TAKEN To ADDRESS -CURRENT DROUGHT
12.   Drought Preparedness. Drought is a common event in Malawi; extreme weather
fluctuations over the past decade have caused significant shifts in food production. As a result,
achieving food security -- as part of a poverty alleviation program -- is a priority on the
Government's development agenda. Establishment of the SGR has helped the country achieve
national food security in most years, except during unusually severe droughts In the longer
term, Government aims to reduce susceptibility to weather-related shocks by promoting
agricultural and economic diversification, and promoting the development and adoption of
drought-resistant maize varieties and water-conserving cultivation techniques.
13.   An improved price and marketing incentive system for nontraditional smallholder crops
will facilitate diversification away from maize and tobacco, thus reducing drought
susceptibility. The Government is committed to accelerating structural reforms in order to
remove the remaining constraints to production and marketing of agricultural produce and
inputs. In August 1994, Government removed all private sector restrictions on domestic
trading of agricultural products. At the same time, Govermnent lifted export licensing
requirements for all agricultural products, except maize, groundnuts, and beans; the latter two
will be fully liberalized after the current drought year and export licenses for maize will remain
in place for food security reasons. The Government also recognizes the importance of
maintaining adequate and sustainable price incentives for all smallholder crops. Except for
maize, the Government plans to further deregulate crop prices with the 1994/95 crop season so
that prices and marketing arrangements will be determined principally by market forces. In the
medium-term, the Government plans to fully liberalize fertilizer markets, including imports.
14.   Research and extension efforts are geared toward promoting efficient supply and the
use of high-yielding agricultural inputs through a wider delivery of public research and
extension services. These improved services focus on generating and disseminating lower cost
technical methods to strengthen drought preparedness at the farm level. Another aspect of the
agricultural strategy will be the development and implementation of small-scale irrigation
schemes - where economically viabie -- driven by the participation of the benefiting
communities in execution and maintenance. Given the large proportion of resource-poor
households which will not be able to afford the maize hybrid and fertilizer package, the
research and extension system will also be important in promoting more drought-resistant
crops (e.g., cassava), intercropping of maize with pulses, agroforestry, and soil and water
conservation technologies.
15.   Rural Credit System.  The drought-related drop in maize production was aggravated
by the collapse of the rural credit system after farmers did not repay their loans. This collapse
is the result of the politization of the agricultural credit program during the transition period
when most parties used the prospect of "credit forgiveness' as a campaign tool. While credit
recovery rates exceeded 90 percent in the past, they dropped to 15 percent in 1993. As a
consequence, farmers in default on previous credits had no access to credit to purchase
fertilizer and certified seed for the fall 1993 planting season.
16.   One of the first issues on the agenda of the new Government was the re-establishment
of the rural credit system to avoid a continuing downward spiral of low credit, low fertilizer
use, and poor harvest. An Action Plan for addressing the poor rural credit recovery was
agreed upon in March 1994 and consisted of three major actions, which were to be
Repot and Recommedtion of the President



EDDRP                       Supplemental FinancingArrangement                     6
implemented immediately: (i) Govenmment statement on credit recovery policy and
enforcemnent; (ii) restoration of 100¶) repayment policy; and (iii) specific credit recovery
operations including stop-orders and court actions against the largest defaulters. Although the
implementation of the Action Plan was planned to start in early April with radio and newspaper
announcements, it was not until after the ` ;ctions (late June) that the new Governmnent issued a
radio press release and followed up with weekly newspaper press releases. At the same time,
the President's address to members of Parliatnent included a credit policy statement, which
emphasized that credit discipline must be enforced and that all borrowers had to repay their
loans. Since then, a list of defaulters has been compiled and stop-orders against tobacco
producers and payroll deductions against civil servants have been authorized.
17.   The collapse of the rural credit system highlighted some of its inherent structural
weaknesses which had long been a subject of concern; for example, insufficient criteria for
creditworthiness, and lack of autonomy of the Smallholder AgricultumI Credit Association
(SACA). To redress the inherent structural weaknesses, IDA and the Govermnent prepared the
Rural Financial Services Project (IDA Credit No. 2513-MAI; presented to the Board on June
15, 1993). Under the project, the rural credit system (SACA) has been transferred from the
direct control of Government to a new autonomous financial institution, the Malawi Rural
Finance Company (MRFC) which will be privatized within three to four years. As safeguards
against future large-scale credit defaults, MRFC has adopted sound operational and lending
requirements based on commercial principles of creditworthiness and repayment ability;
including 100% repayment on old loans before being eligible for additional credit. Credit
effectiveness was delayed by 15 months pending Government's implementation of the pre-
requisites that would help achieve commercial viability of the Tevised rural credit system. T'he
necessary legal and policy actions were carried out by the new Government and the credit was
declared effective in September 1994; in time to commence MRFC lending operations with the
fall 1994 planting season.
18.   Although the full impact of Governuent's commitment to 100% credit recovery and
joint liability of farmer credit clubs before extending new credit will not be evident for some
time, IDA is satisfied with progress made to date. Moreover, the Goverrnment's clear
determination not to compromise the financial integrity of the new rural credit system and to
give in to popular pressure for credit forgiveness are impressive and bode well for future
progress.
MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OBJECTIVES
19.   The new Government inherited several daunting and inmnediate challenges when it took
office. Fiscal and monetary discipline suffered in the months immediately preceding the May
elections. As a consequence, the economic and financial stabilization efforts that started in early
1994 were not sustained. Instead, excessive borrowing by the outgoimg Government from the
banking system in the first two months of the fiscal year, along with pressures induced by exchange
rate du-preciation, led to an increase in the projected rate of inflation from less than 20 percent to
around 30 percent for 1994.
20.   The new Government is committed to an expeditious reversal of the recent deterioration in
monetary and fiscal aggregates. The broad parameters of Government's medium-term
macroeconomic and structural policy framework were endorsed by a Bank macroeconomic mission
Report and Recommendation of the Pwdent



EDDRP                       SupplementalFinancingArrangement                      7
(in July) with participation of the Fund. Although the new Government had been in office for only
four weeks, they reached agreement with the Fund on a short-tenn stand-by arrangement (starting
in October 1994) which is to be succeeded by a three-year ESAF arrangement (starting in April
1995) to support the Government's comprehensive poverty alleviation strategy. In late September,
another Fund staff visit to Malawi confinned that all prior actions for the stand-by arrangement are
in place. Furthermore, Government Nith the assistance of Bank and Fund, is now in the process of
finalizng details of its medium-term fiscal, monetary, and extemal policies as well as its poverty
alleviation program. Government plans to present this medium-term strategy to the external
parners at the Consultative Group meeting in December 1994.
21.   In the meantime, Govenmnent has already started to implement the necessary
policy changes to achieve financial stability. A brief outline of the medium-tem
macreonomic targets follows:
* Fiscal Policy: The underlying strateg) will emphasize fiscal discipline and the
consolidation and extension of structural fiscal policy refonms. On this basis,
the overall central government budget deficit (before grants) is trgeted to
decline from an estimated 11.9 percent of GDP in drought-affected 1994/95 to
6.6 percent in 1995/96; aRer grants, the deficit is projected to be reduced to
less than 3 percent by 1996/97.
*  The ratio of revenue to GDP is expected to rise from about 17.5 percent
(excluding grants) in 1993/94 to an average of about 20 percent during
1994/95-1996/97. Following administrative strengthening of tax and tariff
revenue collection and strict enforcement of tax compliance, actual tax
revenues have exceeded estimates in the third quarter of FY94/95.
* In view of the pressing need to restore fiscal discipline, the new Govermnent
no longer tolerates unauthorized overspending by line mmistries and will move
to a cash flow budget by November 1994. Expendiue policies are also
guided by the need to reorient recurrent expenditures to provide more
emphasis on outlays in key social sectors and on efficiency in the delivery of
services. For instance, recurrent expenditures were cut in non-priorty areas
(e.g., civil service travel, replacement of official vehicles) to acconmodate
salaries for additional teachers that were hired following the increase in
enrollment numbers after all school fees for primary education were waived.
Within this framework, Government expenditure (mcluding drought-related
operations) as a percentage of GDP is targeted to decline fiom 33.4 percent in
1993/94 to 24 percent in 1995/96.
* The Government plans to introduce a tax-inclusive budgeting system starting
in 1995/96 and adopt a medium-term expenditure framework with the 1996/97
budget. To improve overall budget planning, the Govermnent, the World
Bank and the donors have embarked on a Budget Managment Review which
seeks to identify and accommodate sectoral priority expenditures wtthi the
overall constraints of the fiscal framework.

* External Sector Policy. Exchange rate policies will continue to focus on the
maiatenance of extemal competitiveness and the attaimnent of medium-term
balance of payments viability. In Febniray 1994, the fixed exchange system
was replaced with a market based exchange system. The new Govenmt is
filly committed to the market-based exchange system, and has now put
emphasis on refinmg the new exchange system to redress speculation againt
the kwacha and ensure that export revenues are circulated withn the system.
Specific measures that have been implemented include prudential limits on
foreign exchange holdings by comnmercial banks, 35 percent reserve
reqwirement on private foreign exchange accounts, and complemeing
monetary polices. CoAntinuous supply of foreign exchange, either from export
revenues or from balance of paymet support, is critical for sustinability of
the liberalized exchange system. The evetual objective of the exchange
reform is to move to a free interbank market in foreign excbange by end-
1994/95.
- Monetary Policy. A tight monetary stance will aim at achieving and
sustaining a low rate of inflation consistent with oveall growth and balance of
payments objectives.  Total outsting bank credit to Goverment is
projected to decline substantiay over the medium-term, so releasing resources
to the private sector. In the short-trni, the Reserve Bank will coninue to
pursue a restrictive monetary stance through tight control of the liquidity
position of commuerl banks, maintenance of a market-dermied interest
rate structure, and greater use of market-based intervention policies; i.e.,
appropriate use of the Reserve Bans rediscount and repurchase facilities and
frequent issues of Treasury BiDls at auctions. First results of a tighter
monetuy policy are already observed in the decline of the annualized rate of
monetary expansion from 53 percet in June 1994 to 28 percent in September
1994.
22.   Supported by these policies, the overall macroeconomic noaLs for 1994/95-1996/97 are:
(i) an acceleration of real GDP growth, which after a drought-induced drop by 9 percent in 1994,
should rise to 4.5 percent by 1996-97; (ii) a deceleration in the rate of inflation to 5 percent by
1997; and (iii) a further reduction in domestic and extemal imbalances with a view to attaining a
sustainable balance of payments position by the end of the decade.
PROGRLSS UNDER THE ADJUSTMENT OPERATION
23.   The EDDRP was approved by the Executive Directors on June 23, 1992, and became
effective on July 7, 1992. Tle EDDRP provides financing to:
* prevent widespread food insecurity, alleviate the impact of
severe drought, and help stabilize local maize markets; and
* facilitate reforms to broaden economic participation and
enable a sustainable supply response consistent with medium-

term balance-of-payments viability, grwth, and poverty

24.   Policy reforms supported under the EDDRP seek to: (i) improve the environment for
entrepreneurial activity and investment in labor-mtensive production; (ii) deepe financial markets;
and (iii) re-orient fiscal and labor policies toward developing hunan capital.
25.   IDA released the second credit tranche on September 23, 1993, after: (i) satisfactory
progress had been made in carTying out the reform piogram, (ii) monetary and fiscal policies had
been tightened to ensure stabilization of the economy; (iii) sufficient new external aid had been
mobilized to ensure that the adjustment program was fully financed; and (iv) specific conditions
for release of the second tranche had been met.
26.   The first tranche of US$86 million (including US$6 million IDA reflows) and the second
tranche of US$44 million (including US$4 million IDA reflows) have been fully disbursed. Under
the first tranche US$40 million was used for maize imports to help offset the impact of the 1992
drought.
27.   Total extemal support under the program amounts to more than US$266 million. In
addition to the original IDA allocation (US$120 million) plus US$10 million IDA reflows,
cofinancing is provided by the Govemment of Japan (US$70 million), by the African Development
Fund (10 million FUA), by the German Govemnment (DM 20 million), and by the European Union
(ECU 30 million). The closing date of the credit has been extended through June 1995, to allow
fill disbursement of all existing confinancing arangements.
28.   The current overall rating for the credit is 'Highly Satisfactory". Govemment has
implemented all actions set out under the Development Credit Agreement and the policy actions are
showig the desired impact. The new Govemment continues to deepen and strngthen policy
impleentation to fully achieve and sustain the objectives of the EDDRP. Goverment has enacted
polcy measures to effctively reduce investment delays, accelerate land lease procedures, and
extd trade refonn to facilitate outward onentation of the private sector. Initial contacts with
foreign investors have been highly successfiul; several foreign investors have registered their
companies in Malawi and have signed letters of intent for joint ventures. Goverment has enacted
financial sector reforms to promote wider resource access and mobiliation of additional resources
in a more competitive environent. A major component of this stratW was the restructuring of the
Post Office Savings Bank into an autonomous financial institution, now called the NMlawi Savmgs
Bank. The recent licensing of two new foreign banks reflects Governmnts commtmnt to
enhance competiion in the financial sector. Rationalization of the tariff structure and broadening
of te tax base are well underway, and particular emphasis is given to administrative measures to
protect fiscal revenues. The Goverment has strengthened human resource development through
reorientation of public expenditures in favor of the priority social sectors. The Government has
undertaken measures to improve the functionmg of labor markets, support decenalized employer
and employee wage bargaing, has enacted policies to improve the situation of tenant laborers on
estates, and has sbamlined the minum wage legislation.

JUSTIFICATION OF PROPOSED BANK ACTION
29.   The current unanticipated external supply shocks were highlighted as an inherent risk
of the Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on June 7, 1994. Following the
political transition, the Bank has become a major partner in helping Malawi tackle its day-to-
day economic problems as well as in addressing long-term economic and social issues of
development. There is a high probability that the Bank may shift into the high lending scenario
as Government has already demonstrated its commitment to quickly removing structural
obstacles to an accelerated supply response and sustainable poverty alleviation. The Country
Assistance Strategy is being adjusted to directly reflect Government's emphasis on private
sector development and poverty alleviation.
30.   The Bank has made particular efforts over the past two months to assist Govermnent's
efforts to prepare and launch a SAF. This will be integral to Government's broad-based
poverty alleviation initiative through providing resources for community-based projects,
including schools and water supply. Nevertheless, the adjustment process in Malawi will take
time and the expected supply response could be delayed by negative developments in Malawi's
external environment, such as the current drought. Under such adverse circumstances, the
donor commuwity - including the Bank - should contnue to assist Malawi, especally through
aditional quick-disbursing balance ofpayments support. The proposed supplement under
the ongoing adjustment operation complements the assistance provided by other donors in the
forms of food aid and additional balance of payments support on humanitarian grounds.
31.   Given the seriousness of the drought, Governmes limited financial resources, and the
need for a timely response - and after weighig alternative options for Bank assistnce -a
supplementl finacing arrangement is the most approprate masure to help ensure consoLdation
of the transition process and sustain economic adjustment and stabilization. The present sitation
in Malawi meets the prerequisites under which supplemental financing for adjustment operations
could be considered:
V  Malawi's economic program is proceeding on track and there is ful compliance
with the agreed policy agenda. During a July mareconomic nission of Bank and
Fund teams, the Govermnt negotiated a medium4-tern policy flwework that filly
endorses and even stregths several areas of the fifth PFP(distributed to the Board
on March 11, 1994).4 The zeal of the new Goverment to taclde Malawi's structural
problems is impressive. In addition to taldng over the "driver seat" with regard to
poverty alleviation, Maaawi's structal policy agenda now carres a number of issues
that had been too sensitive to be addressed with the former Government. The new
Government has launched an comprehensive initiative that focuses on private sector
development, privatization of public enterprises, and the need to achieve a sustainable
supply response and diversify the econoic base.
/ The time available is, however, too short for processing a freestanding IDA
operation. Although it is Govemment's wish to accelerate processing of the next
adjustment operation which will focus on privatization of public enterprises and

removal of economic monopolies in the manufacturing, finance, and distribution
sectors, the complexity of issues and likely legal obstacles involved could delay a
freestanding operation. In that case, any balance of payment support would come
too late to be effective during the current drought.
" The drought-related financing gap is unanticipated and seriously jeopardies the
adjustment program.
v  The financing gap has arisen for reasons beyond the control of Government.
I The additional financing requirements wiUl not be met without IDA resources.
I The proposed amount under the supplemental financiDg arrangement is
reasonable. It is equivalent to 15 percent of the overall external support (IDA plus
cofinancing) provided under the EDDRP; it amounts to one third of the original
IDA allocation under the credit.
v  One objective of the EDDRP is to help prevent widespread household food
insecurity, alleviate the impact of severe drought, and stabilize local maize
markets. The proposed supplemental financing arrangement will provide the
necessary foreign exchange to allow Malawi to remain on the adjustment track
and achieve food security.
JXRNAL FINANCING PLAN
32.   Malawi's total external financing requirements for 1994-95 amount to US$1536
million, of which US$102 million are drought-related (assuming import of 445,000 MT of
maize at an average cost of US$230 per MT). Malawi's own resources are estimated to
account for US$850 million: The remainder of US$686 million will have to be provided
through official donor grants and loans.
33.   Before the emergence of the drought, the external financing gap for 1994 had been
closed by multilateral and bilateral donor support; including the envisaged Stand-by Agreement
with the IMF. Following the May elections, donors further upgraded their non-humanitarian
support equivalent to pre-transition levels. In view of the emerging drought crisis, several
donors agreed to allow Malawi to use general import support to procure relief and commercial
maize. While this measure has allowed the Govermnent to immediately start the process of
maize purchasing, it has also resulted in a widening of the external financing gap for general
import support. At this time, incremental donor pledges (excluding the proposed IDA
supplemental financing arrangement) specifically for drought-related operations have reached
the equivalent of US$42 million for relief maize (free distribution) and US$12 million in
balance of payment support for commercial maize imports. Not accounting for the proposed
IDA supplemental financing arrangement, a total external financing gap of US$20 million and
US$64 million would remain for 1994 and 1995, respectively.
34.   With the proposed IDA supplement, the financing gap for 1994 would be fully closed,
and the financing gap for 1995 would be reduced to US$44 million of which US$8 million
would be drought-related and the remaining US$36 million would be for general import

support. The proposed levd of IDA assstance Is equivalent to the assistance provided
during the 1992 drought (when total drought-related imports were of similar magnitude as the
current import requirements). It is expected that the remaining drought-related financing gap
for 1995 will be closed through additional donor support over the coming two months. Under
extrenely adverse circumstances, the Government would have to resort to the "iron reserve" of
40,000 MT that was planned to remain in the SGR. The 1995 financing gap for general import
support is expected to be closed through the envisaged IMF ESAF arrangement (to succeed the
short-term Stand-by) and through additional donor support to be mobilized at the forthcoming
Consultative Group meeting in December 1994.
