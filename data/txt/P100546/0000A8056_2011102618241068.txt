                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has had a slow start over the past two years which is reflected in the low disbursement rate of 16% as of September 2011. However, if key policy decisions are taken in
                         the near term, the project is capable of picking up substantially and completing its activities and achieving its development objectives on time by August 2013.

                         A key policy decision that needs to be taken urgently is that pertaining to the National Aid Fund (NAF) renewal (Component B). Progress at the policy level of the NAF renewal has
                         seen very little advancement in the past 3 years. A Cabinet decision is pending to empower the NAF to proceed with implementation of the new targeting mechanism, including
                         revisions to NAF's mandate. Without this support from the Cabinet, the NAF will not be able to proceed with the new targeting mechanism which will jeopardize the objectives of the
                         SPEP project. In addition, the NAF has been without a Director General for about 8 months which has left a leadership vacuum and has trickled down into the institution translating

                         into turnover of key staff. Most recently some potentially positive developments took place which included: (i) approval of the Prime Minister of an additional 50 staff for the NAF; (ii)
                         and the NAF renewal plan was taken up by the Economic Committee chaired by the Prime minister though decision is pending.

                         On the other hand, very good progress has been made in Component C of the project which aims to improve access to and quality of social work and care services. International
                         standards for social services of Ministry of Social Development are being established. New innovative models are being piloted related to integrated social service centers, resource
                         information centers for people with disability, and family-care based models.
