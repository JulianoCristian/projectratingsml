                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Social Development took an important strategic decision to use (and train) its own staff for the Project Implementation and Support Unit (PISU). This will most likely
                         contribute to institutionalization and sustainability of project outcomes. However, there is a drawback at the outset, as these new staff are on a learning curve trying as they are trying
                         to become familiar with Bank procurement, financial management, and disbursement procedures. The pace of project implementation has slowed down a little, but there are clear

                         The following achievements are noted, including: (i) development of a strategic and human resource plan and considerable IT efforts underway that will result in a full connectivity of
                         all MOSD directorates, centers, and offices with MOSD headquarters; (ii) advancement on defining clearer internal operating procedures, processes, and communications channels
                         within the various MOSD directorates, both at the central and regional levels; (iii) set up of MOSD's new organizational structure which demonstrates MOSD's commitment in making
                         significant changes to improve quality and delivery of services; (iv) development of innovative approaches to social care using the "Family Based Model," the "Integrated Services
                         Model" and the latter model applied to handicapped people ; (v) launch of the baseline survey which would also facilitate the design of basic parameters for solid evaluation and
                         gather empirical evidence to determine the impact of these new approaches and service models that are currently being piloted.
