                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A mid-term review mission took place from February 6-9, 2012. The project has had a slow start over the past three years which is reflected in the very low disbursement rate of
                         21.6% as of June 20, 2012.

                         The MTR mission and a review by an independent consultant highlighted the importance of strengthening project ownership by key stakeholders, particularly by those who are project
                         beneficiaries and its implementers, to improve project performance. While NAF renewal component, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Jordan's main last resort
                         social assistance program, the Project has made limited progress in its key activities under this component. The NAF does not yet have the Cabinet level decision needed to
                         empower it to proceed with implementation of the new targeting mechanism, including revisions to NAF’s mandate.

                         Given the implementation difficulties in almost all components of the Project, a restructuring of the Project is being considered. The counterparts in the Government of Jordan (GoJ)
                         are likely to request the Bank’s approval of restructuring.
