      primarily one objective which will provide Colombia with two\n            elements essential to coal exploration. The first includes\n            an: (a) evaluation and assessment of potential economic\n            exploitation of coal reserves in some of Colombia's\n            most promising coal-bearing areas. Secondly, the project\n            aims to provide funds for the; (b) institutional\n            strengthening of Carbocol to help it discharge its growing\n            responsibilities. In order to achieve these ends, this\n            project plans to incorporate two components: (a) a coal\n            exploration component; and (b) one for technical assistance.\n            The coal exploration component is aimed at identifying\n            thermal coal deposits, evaluating coal reserves and\n            assessing the technical and economic viability of deposits\n            in six areas. The component on technical assistance includes\n            expert advice and assistance on: (a) marketing; (b) coal\n            exploration; (c) financial planning; and (d) contracting for\n            coal development."}, "docdt": "1983-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
