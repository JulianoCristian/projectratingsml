The lessons leaned indicate that Lesotho\n            introduced Free Primary Education in 2000 and unlike Uganda\n            or Malawi, the implementation is phased. The project was\n            able to support the implementation of Free Primary Education\n            (FPE) by constructing classrooms, providing teaching\n            learning materials, training of school management and\n            teachers. The choice of adaptable program loan (APL)\n            instrument was appropriate for the education sector in\n            Lesotho. The instrument allows longer period to achieve\n            overall objectives. This is particularly important to the\n            policy and institutional development aspect of the project.\n            Triggers for APL need to be carefully designed. They need to\n            be more realistic and not be written as if they were dated\n            covenants. Though there is no a formal SWAP approach in the\n            Lesotho education sector, the experience of the project\n            found that informal coordination including information\n            exchange among all partners can still go a long way in\n            achieving solid progress on ground. Be flexible while\n            conducting dialogue with Bank's clients during\n            implementation as long as it is in line with the framework\n            of long-term development objectives and adheres to general\n            Bank procedures. Task team continuity played an important\n            role in the successful implementation. The selection of\n            sites for school construction is often politicized\n            especially in countries where there is still a great need\n            for physical infrastructure. This was the reason why project\n            implementation was initially delayed. Often education\n            projects have components, which involve training of\n            managers, teachers and inspectors through a series of\n            workshops. The initial selection criteria for the Bursary\n            Program were not stringent enough."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
