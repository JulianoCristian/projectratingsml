It\n            consist of four project components. 1) Early childhood\n            development (ECD) will develop policy options to widely\n            increase coverage and improve quality for ECD programs by\n            developing an upgraded and expanded training program for ECD\n            trainers and teachers, and conducting a feasibility study to\n            explore the possibility of attaching community-run ECD\n            centers to primary schools, particularly in inaccessible\n            areas. 2) Primary and secondary education will finance six\n            sub-components to increase access and equity and enhance\n            quality and efficiency of primary and secondary education.\n            The sub-components include: curriculum and assessment;\n            teacher development and support; physical construction;\n            targeted equity-based program; school-level management; and\n            capacity building in planning, monitoring, and evaluation.\n            3) Technical and vocational education and training (TVET)\n            will improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the\n            TVET system in order to better train Basotho to compete\n            locally and in regional niches and to ensure graduates have\n            the skill mix demanded by the national economy. 4)\n            Non-formal education will improve the quality of life for\n            Basotho who have missed out on formal schooling by equipping\n            them with skills."}, "docdt": "1999-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
