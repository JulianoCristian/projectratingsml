                    Terms: IBRD Variable Spread Loan

Operation Type      The operation will be a single tranche DPL. The operation is envisioned to be the start
                    of a programmatic DPL series focused on the financial sector and investment climate.
                    Any future DPLs will be subject to Government financing needs and agreement by the
                    Indonesia Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or “OJK”), which will
                    take up its responsibilities in January 2013.

Main Policy Areas   Financial Sector and Investment Climate

                    The main areas of policy and institutional reform supported under the loan will be: (i)
                    reinforcing financial system stability; (ii) promoting financial sector diversification; (iii)
                    enhancing financial inclusion; and (iv) supporting investment climate regulatory reform.

Key Outcome         The expected outcomes of this operation will be: (i) improved financial system stability
Indicators          through effective supervision and regulation; (ii) increased financial sector
                    diversification through development of non-bank financial institutions; (iii) enhanced
                    financial inclusion for underserved groups and the poor; and (iv) improved investment
                    climate regulation.

                    The key outcome indicators are:
                       • Capital adequacy ratio of banks is maintained or stabilized at current level
                           (around +/- 2 percent of 17.6) as of December 2013.
                       • Non-performing loans are stable or at around 3.8 percent or less at end 2013.
                       • The share of non-bank financial institution (NBFI) assets to total financial
                           system assets is 22 percent as of end-2013.
                       • The number of households that have received PKH transfers through bank
                           accounts is 1.4 million as of end-2013.
                       • The annual disbursement of the KUR program to micro and small enterprises is
                           IDR 25 trillion (USD 2.6 billion) as of end-2013.
                       • The number of days to enforce a contract has been reduced to 500 according to
                           Doing Business as of end-2013.

Development         The objective of the operation is to promote the development of a sound, efficient and
Objective(s) and    inclusive financial sector and support improvements in the investment climate in

                 The GOI recently articulated its vision to turn Indonesia’s economy into one of the
                 world’s ten largest by 2025. A strong financial system that accelerates and supports
                 private sector growth is vital to Indonesia’s continued competitiveness. The move from
                 the current middle-income country status to a high-income country status will require
                 emphasis on further developing Indonesia’s financial sector so it can better provide the
                 products and services that cater to the demands of the vast majority of Indonesia’s
                 population and its real sector at competitive prices.

                 The proposed program is fully aligned with the Government’s agenda for sustainable
                 and inclusive growth. Further, the DPL fully reflects CPS priorities for private sector
                 led growth and competitiveness and its focus on strengthening Indonesia’s institutions.

Risks and Risk   The operation is subject to disruption as a result of several risks:
Mitigation
                 •   Attention of key financial sector decision makers may be focused on establishment
                     of the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or “OJK”)
                     rather than the medium-term reform agenda. In October 2011, the Indonesian
                     Parliament passed a new law that calls for creation of the Indonesia Financial
                     Services Authority. This decision fundamentally changes the financial sector
                     regulatory and supervisory framework in Indonesia. Establishing OJK is a major
                     undertaking, involving all the top financial sector authorities in Indonesia. Given
                     that the attention of key decision makers will be focused on this important task,
                     there is a risk of delays in implementing other medium-term reform measures which
                     are supported under this operation. In addition, this focus on the transition and
                     institutional development of OJK could also result in weaker banking supervision
                     and crisis preparedness during the transition period. Given the current international
                     financial market volatility, weakening oversight of the banking sector, even
                     temporarily, could have adverse consequences. In order to mitigate these risks, the
                     Government has taken important steps to ensure a smooth transition process that
                     protects Indonesia’s current supervisory capacity, to the extent possible, through
                     adequate preparation and by drawing on international experiences. It has also
                     emphasized the importance of continuing to implement its medium-term reform
                     program, drawing on technical expertise of a number of partners, and focusing on
                     the highest priority measures.

                 •   The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities
                     may create a challenge in coordinating and implementing the reform efforts. By
                     their nature, many of the key elements of the financial and investment climate
                     reform agenda involve multiple institutions and ministries. As a result, supporting
                     policy coordination can be one of the most difficult challenges facing the reform
                     program. The risk that this will cause delays in implementing the reform program is
                     partially mitigated by the extensive technical assistance programs and partnerships
                     that the Bank already has in place with the related ministries. In addition, the DPL
                     also explicitly aims to support coordination among the various institutions
                     responsible for related policy development including: the Ministry of Finance, Bank
                     Indonesia, the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS), and the National
                     Team for Poverty Reduction (TNP2K), among others.

                 •   Inconsistent policy making on important investment climate issues could potentially
                     disrupt the Government’s achievement of its medium-term development objectives.
                     Regulatory certainty is a key driver of investment, as firms need to rely on a
                     consistent policy environment in order make decisions on whether to invest or


                                                   ix
                   expand their businesses. As such, it is critical that the Government ensure a
                   consistent policy environment if Indonesia is to meet its medium-term economic
                   development and poverty reduction goals. A key challenge in this area is policy
                   coordination among various Government agencies. In the last year, however, recent
                   policy announcements have raised some concerns about the direction of trade and
                   investment policy making. While the aims of these policies may originate in the
                   development objectives of promoting domestic productivity, jobs and growth, their
                   presentation, which has often been changing, highlights coordination and
                   communication issues. In addition to the uncertain effectiveness of these policies to
                   meet the stated objectives, there is concern that the expansion of such policies could
                   weaken the confidence of investors in the domestic economic outlook.

               •   Continued or increased global market volatility or a financial crisis could disrupt
                   potential to implement reforms in Indonesia both in the financial sector and
                   investment climate areas. Significant and rapid shifts in market sentiment could
                   result in sudden, large and potentially disruptive capital outflows while the external
                   accounts, and growth outlook, remain sensitive to global commodity prices and
                   demand, particularly from China. Changes in market sentiment may be due to
                   external factors, such as movements in global risk aversion, which expose
                   Indonesia’s continued economic vulnerabilities. However, there have been
                   significant improvements in the Indonesian macroeconomic framework in recent
                   years, which have translated into improved resilience to external shocks. The
                   Government has also developed a track record in precautionary and proactive
                   measures during the recent global financial turmoil, which would help limit the
                   impact of turbulence in international markets on Indonesia. Furthermore, the recent
                   PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012, plus the parallel facilities from other
                   development partners, explicitly aim to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the face
                   of a crisis.

                                    I.   INTRODUCTION

1.      This document describes the proposed Financial Sector and Investment Climate
Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM-DPL). The objective of the
operation is to promote the development of a sound, efficient and inclusive financial sector and
support improvements in the investment climate in Indonesia to help the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) achieve its medium-term economic development and poverty reduction goals.
The Government has recently articulated its vision to turn Indonesia’s economy into one of the
world’s ten largest by 2025. A sound and well functioning financial sector and an enabling
environment for business are expected to contribute to the achievement of these goals. The main
areas of policy and institutional reform supported under the loan will be: (i) reinforcing financial
system stability; (ii) promoting financial sector diversification; (iii) enhancing financial
inclusion; and (iv) supporting investment climate regulatory reform.

2.      The proposed operation will be disbursed as a USD 100 million single tranche. The
operation is envisioned to be the start of a programmatic DPL series focused on the financial
sector and investment climate. Any future DPLs will be subject to GOI financing needs and
agreement by the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or “OJK”),
which was established in July 2012. The Government’s recent decision to establish OJK as the
new financial sector regulator has fundamentally changed Indonesia’s financial sector
supervisory framework. Thus, in order to ensure ownership of any future financial sector
operation, the Government has requested that the program be developed jointly with the Board of
OJK, after it takes up its responsibilities in January 2013. As a result, this program document
outlines the first year program and presents indicative triggers for future DPLs to be confirmed
and agreed upon at a later date with the new authorities.

3.     The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance will
serve as the implementing agencies for the operation. Other institutions including Bank
Indonesia (BI), the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS), the National Team for
Poverty Reduction (TNP2K), and the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) will
be closely involved in the work related to the prior actions as well as the monitoring of
outcomes. The Bank has had close consultations with all of the agencies on the proposed policy
matrix and on indicative reform areas for subsequent operations.

4.      In developing the operation, the Bank and the Government considered several
design alternatives, including the possibility of supporting financial sector and investment
climate reforms through a single multisectoral DPL. Following these discussions and in light
of the Government’s deepening engagements with the Bank on several priority areas, the
Government requested a series of three sectoral DPLs in 2012. The sectoral approach aims to
maximize synergies across the Bank’s program in Indonesia, increase ownership of the reforms
by the relevant institutions, and improve targeting of complementary technical assistance
programs. In the case of the FIRM DPL, a sectoral loan was determined to be the most effective
instrument particularly given the timing of implementation of the new OJK Law and the
increased focus on deepening the financial sector reforms beyond the soundness of the banking
sector.



                                                 1
5.     As a result, this year the Bank will support the following three sectoral DPLs for a
total amount of about USD 500 million. These include:

        •   The Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and Investment Development Policy
            Loan (INSTANSI-DPL, formerly named “DPL 9”). This operation will focus on
            strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation efforts
            to improve the quality of fiscal spending.

        •   The FIRM DPL. As described in this document, this operation focuses on the
            financial sector and investment climate.

        •   The Connectivity DPL. This operation supports reforms to reduce domestic logistics
            costs and strengthen inclusive development, by: (i) strengthening national
            coordination and regulation; (ii) strengthening intra-island connectivity; (iii)
            improving inter-island connectivity; and (iv) improving international connectivity.

6.       This operation builds upon Indonesia DPLs 1-8 carried out from 2003-2011, as well
as the Program for Economic Resilience, Investment and Social Assistance in Indonesia
(PERISAI), approved in May 2012. PERISAI was a USD 2.0 billion DPL-DDO aimed to
enhance the Government’s crisis preparedness to address the potential adverse impact of ongoing
volatility in financial markets on Government’s ability to meet its gross fiscal financing needs
from markets. The Government has also secured financing from the Government of Japan, the
Australian Treasury, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which it would draw down as
well only under the same or similar conditions. While the PERISAI operation focused on short-
term measures aimed at enhancing financial crisis preparedness, the FIRM DPL aims to advance
the Government’s medium-term policy and institutional reform agenda. Like many other
developing economies over the past year, Indonesia has had to cope with increased volatility in
financial markets and a slowdown in growth in the developed countries that has significantly
weakened the external environment.

7.     The DPL is fully aligned with the Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy Progress
(CPS) for the period of 2009-2012. Specifically, the report focuses on the core engagement
areas of private sector development and social protection, as well as in its approach to support
Indonesia’s institutions. A new Indonesia CPS is currently under preparation and also includes a
focus on private sector development.

8.      The loan is anchored in the Government’s medium-term reform agenda and is
considered timely and highly relevant given the reforms taking place in the financial sector.
Notably, in late 2011 after more than a decade of consideration, the GOI took the decision to
restructure the supervision of the financial sector by establishing OJK. This decision marks the
most significant change in the supervisory and regulatory framework to take place over the last
decade. While the Government’s decision to establish OJK provides an opportunity to lay the
foundation for more effective financial sector regulation and supervision, it is accompanied by
significant risks, particularly given the ongoing global financial crisis. The DPL also comes after
a decade of improvements to banking sector supervision, when the Government has turned its
attention to a set of second generation reforms aimed at deepening the financial sector,
expanding access of financial services to the poor, including women in particular. Reflecting this
focus, the design of this operation has been informed by gender-aspects of financial sector
development.
                                                2
9.      The FIRM DPL also includes an investment climate component that complements
the ongoing financial sector reforms and reflects the Government’s commitment to
creating an economic environment conducive to private sector investment. Improvements in
this area are considered critical for Indonesia to achieve its medium and long term growth
potential. GOI has articulated its vision in this area both in the Government’s National Medium-
Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2010-2014 and in its Masterplan for Acceleration and
Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development 2011-2025 (MP3EI).

                               II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

10.     Indonesia has made remarkable progress over the past decade in terms of
macroeconomic and political stability. Output growth has been strong and consistent,
averaging 5.5 percent per year over 2002 to 2011. This has been grounded on increasing private
sector investment, strong domestic consumption and generally sustainable external surpluses.
International commodity demand has been supportive, but the non-tradable sectors have
accounted for the majority of output growth. External imbalances have declined rapidly as
corporate and financial sector balance sheets were repaired, although financial markets remain
vulnerable to changes in international investor sentiment. Increasing revenues, combined with
restrained expenditures, have contributed to low fiscal deficits. In an environment of controlled
inflation and rising incomes, Indonesian citizens’ living standards have improved and poverty
levels have fallen, although many remain close to the poverty line. In addition, as the result of a
decade of relatively successful political and institutional reforms, Indonesia in 2012 is a highly
competitive, decentralized electoral democracy. A system of checks and balances between
legislative, judicial, and executive branches is increasingly in place.

11.     Compared with other countries in the region, Indonesia was less affected by the
global economic downturn of 2008-09 and growth has since moved back to, and above, pre-
crisis levels. GDP growth declined from 6 percent in 2008 to 4.6 percent in 2009 but
subsequently recovered to 6.1 percent over 2010 and 6.5 percent in 2011. The social impact of
the crisis was also limited, there were few reports of layoffs, poverty and unemployment rates
continued to fall and households’ spending power was supported by inflation slowing to decade
lows. This relatively strong performance was supported by the health of public and financial
sector balance sheets and the strength of domestic demand, particularly private consumption.
Indonesia’s export mix, focused on commodities, benefited from international price rises and
demand for raw materials from China and other emerging economies. Policymakers also took
proactive measures during the crisis, including a fiscal stimulus package, supportive monetary
policy and a significant contingent support package from development partners in the event of a
worsening of the crisis. Nevertheless, the fiscal deficit came in below target in 2009, 2010 and
2011 which, combined with strong GDP growth, supported the downward trajectory of
Government debt to just below 25 percent of GDP, down from over 90 percent in 2000.
Indonesia’s sovereign ratings have been upgraded and in late 2011 and early 2012 were moved
back to investment grade by Fitch and Moody’s for the first time since 1997/1998. The improved
creditworthiness, along with high relative yields and the levels of liquidity in some developed
economies, contributed to the strong portfolio inflows into Indonesia over 2010 and the first half
of 2011.

    A. The Current State of the Indonesian Economy

12.    Supported by domestic demand, Indonesia’s recent growth performance has
remained robust although, as in other countries in the region, there have been spillovers
from the deterioration in the global economy and volatility in international financial
markets. Growth in 2011 moved up to 6.5 percent year-on-year, the highest annual growth rate
since 1996, from 6.1 percent in 2010 (Figure 1). In the first half of 2012 growth remained solid,
at 6.3 percent and 6.4 percent in the first two quarters, despite the weakness in the external
environment. Domestic demand, particularly private consumption and investment, has continued
to drive growth. However, weakening external demand has subtracted from growth since late
2011, in line with the deterioration in the trade and current account balances discussed below.
Recent growth has also been broad-based across sectors, as the strength of domestic demand
continues to support growth in key services sectors, such as trade, transport and communications.
Within the tradable sectors, non-oil and gas manufacturing has also performed relatively
strongly.

13.     Inflation has remained relatively stable over the past year as food price spikes have
unwound and the likelihood of subsidized fuel price hikes has decreased. Sharp increases in
food prices contributed to rising headline CPI inflation in late 2010. But as these shocks
unwound, inflation declined over 2011 and reached a two-year low of 3.6 percent year-on-year in
February 2012. Since then inflation has moved up gradually, to 4.6 percent year-on-year in July
2012, due mainly to higher food prices. Core inflation has also remained low at 4.3 percent in
July. Expectations of higher prices associated with a potential adjustment of subsidized fuel
prices have also subsided with the reduced likelihood of such a policy change (see discussion
below).

14.    Following strong inflows over 2010 and 2011, overall balance of payments outflows
have been seen since Q3 2011 (Figure 2). These represent the first quarterly deficits since the
end of 2008. Initially, in the second half of 2011, outflows were due primarily to the reversal of
                                                 4
inflows on the volatile capital account. Subsequently, the main driver of the net balance of
payments outflow has been the diminishing current account balance, moving into deficit in the
fourth quarter of 2011 and hitting a record low since the Asian crisis in the second quarter of
2012. As a result of these trends, and with Bank Indonesia taking measures to stabilize the
exchange rate, international reserves have also fallen over 2012, moving to USD 109.0 billion at
end-August 2012, around 2.2 times the level of recorded short-term external debt by remaining
maturity.

15.     In recent years, as in other emerging markets, portfolio capital flows to Indonesia
have been affected by the swings in international investor risk aversion and concern over
global growth prospects. Periods of heightened international risk aversion have contributed to
portfolio capital outflows from Indonesia, primarily of local currency fixed income securities
(Figure 3). Non-resident investor holdings of local assets are relatively high, for example, their
holdings of rupiah-denominated tradable Government securities (SUNs), at USD 23.7 billion at
end-July 2012, accounted for 28.4 percent of the outstanding stock. As discussed below, Bank
Indonesia has introduced a number of measures in recent years to address the risks of short-term
portfolio outflows. Direct investment inflows, attracted by Indonesia’s large and growing
domestic market, its natural resources and relatively low manufacturing labor costs, has been
rising gradually since 2010. Inflows moderated in the second half of 2011 but remained
relatively strong, moving total inflows up to USD 18.9 billion in 2011 from USD 13.8 billion in
2010. FDI continued to be solid at USD 8.2 billion in the first half of 2012 despite slowing from
USD 10.3 billion in the same period 2011.

16.     The trend move into a current account deficit reflects to a large extent the strength
of Indonesia’s domestic demand set against weakening external demand. These factors have
contributed to a decline in the goods trade surplus while there has been a continuation of the
large services deficit and rising outflows on the income balance (in line with strong FDI). Both
declining commodity prices and volumes have also contributed to falling export growth as the
monthly trade balance moved into deficit from April to July 2012. Imports have also come down,
with a lag as in 2009, in part likely because a capital and intermediate goods imports are related
to exports. External debt-to-GDP has been on a downward trend (moving to 27.3 percent at end-
June 2012 from 35.9 percent at end-2006) and is likely to remain stable despite a higher current
account deficit (see IMF 2012 Article IV external debt sustainability assessment). There is,
though, the risk that, in the current fragile external environment, a further widening of the deficit
raises concerns over external financing needs. Should weaker export demand persist, this risk
should be mitigated by a reduction in imports used to produce exports and the impacts of price
adjustment through the weakening of the exchange rate. On the capital account side, it is
encouraging that, as discussed above, FDI has, to date, remained solid (accounting for a rising
share of capital inflows).

17.     The volatility in international capital markets has been transmitted to local asset
prices, although domestic banking sector performance remains solid. As in international
markets, over the past year Indonesian equities have seen sharp swings in prices. The rupiah has
also come under pressure, depreciating 12.9 percent against the US dollar to Rp 9,573 per
USD from the beginning of August 2011 to 30 August 2012. Local currency government bond
yields have risen gradually over 2012 as a mixed consequence of the expectation on higher
future inflation, related to the potential hike in the subsidized fuel price, and then rising
international risk aversion. However, they remain at relatively low levels historically (with the
five-year yields at around 5.5 percent). Overall banking sector indicators have remained solid.
The capital adequacy ratio, while down slightly, remains at 17 percent. Non-performing loans
were down half a percentage point over the year to 2.2 percent. (For further details on recent
performance and policy challenges in the sector see Section D).

18.     Strong growth over the past five years is reflected in a significant improvement in
Indonesia’s poverty and employment numbers. Indonesia’s poverty rate, measured at the
national poverty line, fell from 16.6 percent in March 2007 to 12.0 percent in March 2012. Both
urban and rural poverty rates have been declining and the decline was spatially uniform.
However, the 0.5 percentage point decline since March 2011 is the lowest drop in ten years,
reflecting the slowing rate of poverty reduction evident in the last four years The poverty rates
over this period for male-headed and female-headed households are similar (although female-
headed household poverty experienced considerably more volatility earlier in the decade).
Despite this positive progress, nearly 40 percent of Indonesians live on 1.5 times poverty-line
expenditure (or less), meaning there are many who remain vulnerable to impoverishment. There
remains the challenge of ensuring that GDP growth translates into sufficient creation of quality
jobs. Employment growth of 3.2 percent year-on-year was seen in August 2010, falling to 1.4
percent in February 2012. There were changes in the weighting series between August 2010 and
February 2011 which makes employment growth comparisons for February 2010 and August
2011 difficult. The official open unemployment rate has continued to trend downwards, falling to

                                                                6
6.3 percent in February 2012 from 6.6 percent in August a year before (or 6.8 percent on
February 2011).

   B. The Macroeconomic Policy Framework

19.     Bank Indonesia has shifted its monetary policy stance in line with international
developments and the prospects for the path of administered fuel prices. In anticipation of a
worsening external environment, and with inflation declining, Bank Indonesia loosened
monetary policy at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012. Rate cuts in October, one of the
earliest policy responses in the region, were followed by further reductions in November 2011
and February 2012 respectively. Furthermore, the lower bound of Bank Indonesia’s operational
corridor (the overnight deposit facility rate) was also widened in September 2011 and January
2012, moving it to 200 basis points below the policy rate. With the proposal to raise subsidized
fuel prices, inflation expectations picked up and Bank Indonesia indicated it was ready to shift its
stance, including through measures to manage short-term liquidity. Although inflation
expectations have since receded, in August 2012 Bank Indonesia increased the overnight deposit
facility rate by 25 basis points, in part to support the exchange rate in the face of the current
account outflows. As in other economies, the central bank has also made increasing use of a
range of macroprudential tools. For example, in the context of strong credit growth (above 25
percent year-on-year) it has imposed maximum loan-to-value ratios for housing loans and
minimum down payment on vehicle purchases.

20.     In terms of exchange rate policy, the Rupiah has depreciated gradually over the
year with interventions to manage volatility. In early May 2012 there were reports of
shortages in onshore US dollar liquidity and Bank Indonesia has responded through a number of
measures to support FX liquidity, for example introducing a foreign currency “Term Deposit
Instrument.” These measures follow earlier policy actions aimed at preventing disruptive capital
outflows, such as example, reinstating limits on short-term offshore borrowing of banks and
raising holding periods on SBIs. With the rising demand for dollars given the overall balance of
payment outflows, there has been a gradual depreciation in the exchange rate over the year with
the authorities underscoring their commitment to exchange rate flexibility in the 2012 IMF
Article IV.

21.     Fiscal deficits and debt continue to be conservative but the allocation of spending
could be improved and, with subsidy spending increasing, the deficit is projected to rise in
2012. The realized (audited) 2011 Government deficit of Rp 84.4 trillion (1.1 percent of GDP)
came in well below the revised Budget level of Rp 151 trillion (2.1 percent of GDP), as under-
spending in core Government programs more than offset high spending on energy subsidies. The
revised 2012 Budget increased the deficit for the year to 2.2 percent of GDP, up from 1.5 percent
of GDP in the original budget. The upward revisions to the 2012 revenue and expenditure
numbers were both driven by the increase in the assumed oil price. In light of the likely higher
spending on energy subsidies the Government proposed a one-third increase in the subsidized
fuel price in its draft revised Budget. However, the approved revised Budget authorized the
Government to make such an increase, but only if the six-month average Indonesia crude oil
price was 15 percent higher than the USD 105 assumed in the Budget. The revised Budget also
included additional spending on temporary compensating programs in the event of a fuel price
increase, including a cash transfer to the poor combined with anti-poverty programs at the
community level and public transport subsidies while infrastructure spending also received a
boost. As in most previous years, realization of expenditures on core programs is likely to come
                                                 7
in below budget and revenues continue to grow strongly, although oil and gas non-tax revenue
are lower than initially projected due to lower oil lifting. Latest Government projections are for
the 2012 Budget deficit to come in Rp 179 trillion, slightly below the revised Budget level in
nominal terms but still 2.2 percent of GDP. In terms of budget transparency, the central
Government publishes its annual Budget in a timely manner. It is usually posted on the Ministry
of Finance website within one week after the Budget has been passed.

22.     For 2013, the Government’s recently proposed budget projects a narrowing of the
deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP. The reduced deficit reflects the Government’s intention to
increase revenue to GDP (from 15.9 percent to 16.2 percent) as efforts continue to broaden the
tax base, while at the same time reducing nominal spending relative to GDP (to 17.9 percent of
GDP vs. 18.2 percent in 2012). Despite this conservative overall spending stance, and an oil
price assumption in 2013 of USD 100 per barrel, USD 5 lower than the 2012 assumption, there is
a significant increase in energy subsidy spending, driven by growing consumption and a weaker
exchange rate; the energy subsidy allocation is 62.9 (35.8) percent higher than the level in the
original (revised) 2012 Budget. Total subsidies (rising 29 percent on revised 2012 levels to Rp
316.1 trillion) along with personnel spending (rising 13.6 percent from 2012 to Rp 241.1 trillion)
thus continue to account for the lion’s share of total public expenditure. Capital spending, while
projected to rise a further 15 percent in 2013, continues to run into implementation constraints
and will likely lag infrastructure development needs.

23.     The decision not to increase subsidized fuel prices on 1 April in the approved 2012
Budget was as a missed opportunity. There remains the need to redirect this spending to more
pressing development needs to support medium-term growth and development and to address the
distortions and inefficiencies of the current subsidies. The fall in international oil prices since
early May 2012 made it highly unlikely that the condition for a hike in subsidized fuel prices will
be met. An electricity price hike planned for 2012 that would have limited spending on
electricity subsidies has also been postponed. In the proposed 2013 Budget, there is no indication
of a fuel price adjustment although it is proposed that electricity tariffs be increased by 15
percent on average for higher wattage customers (although details of this mechanism are to be
decided and the proposal is subject to Parliamentary approval). From the perspective of fiscal
sustainability a higher deficit is manageable given Indonesia’s strong initial debt position and
conservative deficits-to-GDP. However, in the case that oil prices move up sharply, the risk of
hitting Indonesia’s three percent of GDP deficit limit could prompt a tightening in spending in
key development areas. Furthermore, it is the opportunity cost of the current spending on
subsidies that is of particular concern given other pressing development needs, along with the
fact the fuel subsidies are an ineffective and poorly-targeted method of assisting the poor (with
the vast majority of the benefits going to richer households who own cars and motorbikes).

24.     Low deficits, budget discipline, prudent fiscal policy and high nominal GDP growth
have enabled Indonesia to reduce its public debt burden significantly. In the past ten years,
Indonesia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to slightly below 25 percent in 2011, from
around 90 percent in 2000. This improvement in Indonesia’s debt position stands out among
other economies in the region and has been possible through a combination of fiscal
conservatism and high nominal GDP growth. Indonesia’s Government debt-to-GDP ratio is
likely to continue falling in the years ahead and the downward debt dynamics appear to be robust
to a plausible range of macroeconomic shocks, in line with those suffered over the past 10 years.
This relatively positive picture focuses on solvency issues rather than liquidity and roll-over
risks, which may occur even if solvency is solid. Indonesia’s financing position is supported by
cash reserves from previous over-financing and the still conservative fiscal deficits. However, as
highlighted above, a sharp tightening in global and domestic financial markets, as seen in 2008,
would potentially limit the Government’s ability to meet gross financing needs on reasonable
terms. Recognizing this risk the Government has raised a sizeable share of financing early in the
year (with gross securities issuance at end-August at 73.4 percent of the full-year target under the
revised Budget) and has put in place contingent financing from donor partners, including the
World Bank’s PERISAI operation.

25.    In response to the deterioration in the current account deficit in Q2 2012, Bank
Indonesia and the Government also announced a number of policy responses. These policies
were designed to adjust the current account deficit to “a sustainable level to support the
momentum of the national economy.” For example, Bank Indonesia will focus on stabilizing the
Rupiah “in accordance with its fundamental conditions” while the measures announced by the
Government include support for boosting exports but appear to be aimed mainly at limiting
dependence on imports and supporting domestic production. It is unclear whether such policies
are likely to be effective, and they could introduce distortions over the medium-term.
Furthermore, it is important not to over-react to the recent current account deficit numbers or
make policy missteps that could adversely impact investor sentiment, thereby actually putting
more pressure on external balances. Allowing for a gradual weakening of the exchange rate, as
has been seen recently, could also facilitate an improvement in the trade balance.

26.    In summary, the overall macroeconomic situation and policy framework warrant
continued support for Indonesia’s structural and institutional reforms through the FIRM
DPL.

   C. Indonesia’s Economic Outlook

27.     Risks to the outlook for the Indonesian economy remain weighted to the downside,
and are likely to remain high in 2013. Global financial markets and portfolio flows to
Indonesia remain volatile, with the global economic outlook highly uncertain, with weaker
growth in high income economies, moderating commodity prices and continued financial market
turbulence. The direct impact of lower growth in the EU on Indonesia’s economy is likely to be
limited, as Indonesia’s exports are relatively diversified by export destination direct linkages.
However, a further deterioration in international financing conditions or in commodity prices and
demand relative to the baseline scenario would be of particular concern. A seizing up of global
US dollar liquidity could have important implications for Indonesia’s financial sector, and
potentially have spillovers to the real economy, through investment and trade financing, and to
Government financing costs. Lower international commodity prices or demand could affect
Indonesia’s GDP growth via their impact not only on trade (with commodity exports accounting
                                                10
for around two-thirds of the value of exports) but through domestic consumption and investment,
as well as lower fiscal revenues. However, a sharp recovery in oil prices, for example due to
supply shocks, could also refocus attention on the cost of Indonesia’s fuel subsidies.

28.     In a baseline scenario of international financial market fragility combined with
relatively weak external, but continued solid, domestic demand, growth of 6.0 percent is
forecast for 2012, moving up to 6.4 percent in 2013. The underlying macro assumptions for
this baseline include a continued weakness in external demand with overall international
commodity prices also projected to moderate.

29.      Under more adverse but plausible scenarios framed around the above external
risks, growth in 2013 could decline to around 4 percent of GDP, the lowest in a decade.
Taking the above downside risks into account, different scenarios can be considered to simulate
the impact of external shocks on Indonesia’s economy (see Table 4 below). The main impact
would be felt in 2013 given the strong performance in 2012 to date. Under a scenario similar to
2009 which assumes a greater growth slowdown due to the real impact of the financial crisis and
credit tightness, as well as a moderate decline in commodity prices leading to a sharp contraction
in the terms of trade, GDP growth is cut to 4.7 percent in 2013 (down 1.7 percentage points on
the baseline scenario), reflecting lower investment and exports. If a financial crisis precipitates,
or accompanies, a significant growth slowdown also in emerging economies as well as a sharp
drop in global commodity prices, growth could fall even further in 2012, down to just under 4
percent.

30.    The outlook for China is of particular importance for Indonesia. A drop in China's
growth down to 7 percent would directly cut Indonesia's major trading partner growth by 0.17 pp
(given a weight in Indonesia’s exports of 11 percent in 2011). The second round effects via
global and regional trading partner growth would also clearly be important. However, the real
concern with a relatively marked slowdown in growth would be if China's growth leads to a
sharp fall in global commodity prices—particularly coal and minerals that form a sizeable share
                                              11
of Indonesia's exports. If significant commodity price declines were sustained then this would
spill over to domestic consumption and investment in Indonesia as household incomes and
corporate investment, and fiscal revenues would also decline. Estimates of the spillovers vary
across studies but, estimates in the September 2012 IMF Article IV report on Indonesia,
incorporating direct and indirect trade effects and global commodity price impacts, suggest that a
1 percentage point reduction in China’s growth could lower Indonesia’s GDP by up to half a
percentage point. The IMF report also highlights there would also be spillovers through the
commodity channel from a shift in the composition of China’s growth from investment to
consumption.

31.     Growth could also move substantially lower if the impact of adverse external shocks
is amplified domestically. Growth would still be above 4 percent in the international scenarios
discussed in the previous paragraphs. This is similar to that seen in 2009, when growth dropped
during the height of the global financial crisis but remained at 4.6 percent. However, it is
important to note that these GDP projections combine the external scenarios with moderations in
the underlying domestic drivers of growth, i.e. private consumption and investment. In the event
that there was a major dislocation to these drivers, for example, due to domestic policy miss-
steps or problems in the domestic financial sector, then the downside risks to growth could be
much greater, and hence the importance of crisis preparedness measures.

32.     There remain a number of challenges for the macro fiscal and monetary policy
framework. Bank Indonesia will need to remain vigilant to potential rising inflation and any
financial sector risks if domestic demand remains robust. The 2012 IMF Article IV report notes
that this will require the usage of traditional monetary policy tools given that macroprudential
measures on certain sectors will “not tackle the underlying condition of easy money.”
Indonesia’s fiscal position is in a strong starting position at the aggregate level and the deficit is
likely to remain conservative. However, flexibility to respond to a downturn in growth is limited
by the disbursement issues in infrastructure and the efficiency of spending is limited by the
continued burden of energy spending. More generally, there is a need to improve further the
quality of the allocation and efficiency of spending, although in the run up to the elections in
2014 the near-term political environment may limit the likelihood of addressing fuel spending
                                                              12
expenditures or limiting the growth of personnel expenditures. Failure to make such
improvements in the medium-term could lower the growth outlook going forward and ability of
the Government to meet its development objectives, notwithstanding the level of resources
allocated.

33.      Although Indonesia is relatively well placed to weather external shocks, it is also
important to further improve preparation for a potential crisis through enhancing the
range of instruments and policies available to deal with increased volatility and improving
the resilience of its economy and public finances. Risks in the global environment remain high
both from developments in the Eurozone, the fiscal cliff in the US and the uncertain impact of
recent quantitative easing on commodity and emerging market capital flows. Indonesia remains
well-positioned to withstand external real and financial shocks due to its continued strong
economic performance and policies, low Government debt levels and significant reserves.
Importantly, the 2013 proposed Budget retains a number of measures to deal with any future
crisis situation that had been introduced in the 2012 Budget. Other elements of the Government’s
crisis preparedness has been the establishment of crisis management protocols and continent
financing facilities with development partners to support financing of critical public expenditures
in the event of an increase in market financing pressures. The World Bank PERISAI DPL-DDO
operation, in addition to supporting short-term policy measures aimed at enhancing crisis
preparedness, provides contingent budget support, which the Government intends to draw down
only in the event of a significant worsening of the financing conditions. The Government has
also secured additional contingent financing of around USD 3 billion from the Government of
Japan (Yen 120 billion), Australian Treasury (AUD$1 billion) and the Asian Development Bank
(USD 500 million).

34.     Sustained progress on structural reforms can also play an important role in not only
enhancing medium-term growth prospects but also in supporting the confidence of
investors in the economy in the near term. A number of recent trade and investment policy
measures or proposals have created a sense of rising protectionist policy making. The measures
include, for example, restrictions on imported horticulture products, an export tax and new
divestment regulations in the mining sector and proposals to limit single ownership in the
banking sector. The objectives of these policies, such as moving up the value chain domestically
and creating quality jobs, are not necessarily the concern but rather whether these policies are
likely to achieve these objectives (and whether they may introduce distortions into the economy
which, in the long-term, could be a drag on growth). In addition, the presentation of these
policies, which is often changing and inconsistent, highlights coordination difficulties across
ministries and limited consultation with stakeholders. In addition to their uncertain effectiveness,
there is a risk that the continuation of such policies, or other perceived “policy missteps” could
weaken some of the confidence of investors in domestic policy making (particularly in the run up
to the 2014 presidential elections). Limiting further such missteps, along with a continuation of
the Government’s ongoing work on crisis preparedness will be important to maintain investor
confidence in a fragile global environment.

35.    Looking towards the medium-term, continued progress on policy reforms and key
investments in infrastructure and skills development will be required if Indonesia is to
move its potential growth rate up towards 7 percent and beyond. The continuation of recent
growth rates of around 6.5 percent appear sustainable over the next few years, supported on the
demand-side by rising incomes and domestic consumption, and on the supply side by Indonesia’s
demographic dividend and strong investment growth rates reflecting the attractiveness of the
                                                13
domestic market, commodity endowment and relatively low labor costs. However, sustaining
such growth rates over the medium-term, or moving them higher, will require investments in
infrastructure and addressing regulatory and investment climate constraints on businesses. For
example, for 2014-2016 the 2011 IMF Article IV baseline potential growth rate is 7.1 percent,
rising to 7.9 percent in an upside scenario in which infrastructure and structural reforms proceed
faster than in the baseline but declining to 6 percent in a downside scenario in which
infrastructure development proceeds slowly and there is little progress on structural reform.
Private and public investment in infrastructure as a share of GDP, at around 4 percent in 2009, is
still significantly lower than prior to the 1997/98 crisis. Infrastructure has been identified by the
Government as a key constraint for growth, leading to large increases in budgetary allocations to
the infrastructure sector as well as efforts to attract more private sector investment.

    D. Financial Sector Structure and Recent Developments

36.     Indonesia’s financial sector is small relative to emerging market peers. The total
assets of the financial sector were below 70 percent of GDP in 2011 (Figure 5 and 6). Its
relatively small size reflects in part the severity of the Asian crisis on Indonesia when well over
half of banking assets and loans were written off. Since that time, the financial sector has been
slow to develop, and continues to be heavily dominated by banks which account for roughly 80
percent of financial system assets. Rural banks account for a mere 1.1 percent of the financial
system. Most commercial banks operate almost exclusively in the domestic market, with some
owning non-bank financial institutions.

37.    The non-bank financial sector remains small and underdeveloped (Figure 7). It
includes insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, finance companies, securities
companies, and pawnshops. The insurance, mutual funds, and pension industries are growing,
but from a low base. The insurance sector accounts for about 5 percent of system assets,
followed by the pensions sector with 3 percent.

38.     Within the banking system, activities are concentrated in a few large commercial
banks. The top three state-owned commercial banks accounted for one-third of the banking
sector asset and deposit base, and the top 15 banks for about 70 percent in 2011. A number of
SOCBs hold dominant market positions in all Government related transactional banking, micro
and rural finance, and mortgage lending. Most of the smaller and mid-sized banks do not have
the capital, know-how and scale to compete with the larger ones. Foreign banks are also
increasingly playing a more prominent role in the Indonesian banking sector, reflecting a host of
factors, including a liberal foreign investment regime where foreign investors can fully own local
financial institutions, in the absence of branch limits.

39.     The banking sector maintained strong fundamentals despite strong business growth
in 2011. Loans increased in December 2011 by 24.6 percent, and total deposits grew by 19.1
percent year-on-year. These resulted in an increase of the Loan to Deposit ratio (LDR) from 75.2
percent to 78.8 percent. In addition, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has remained
reasonable, at less than 2.8 percent as of mid-2011, falling from 3.3 percent in 2009 (Figure 8).
The capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector was also a sound 16.1 percent (Figure 9). Bank
operational costs, return on equity (RoE), return on assets (RoA), have all maintained relatively
stable levels during this time (Figures 10 and 11).

40.     Banking sector efficiency and resource mobilization is also improving. Domestic
credit to the private sector is improving, albeit slowly, increasing from 25 percent in 2006 to 28.8
percent in 2011. The loan to deposit ratio has increased to 81 percent 2011 from 75.2 percent in
2010. Deposit and lending rates are stable at 6.5 percent and 12 percent in 2011. Loan volumes
increased by 20 percent in 2011 with SME lending increasingly prominent.

41.     Indonesia’s capital markets remain small, which constitutes a missed opportunity to
diversify the source of funding for the corporate and financial sectors. Stock market
capitalization, though increasing, remains low, hovering at around 48 percent of GDP. This is
particularly low compared to others in the region. Capitalization in Thailand stands at 74 percent,
and is 139 percent in Malaysia.

42.    The bond market is also small, although growing. Bond market capitalization reached
approximately 13.4 percent of GDP in 2011, a modest increase from 12 percent in 2010. The
market consists of Government debt, corporate debt, bank debentures and SOE debt. The
Government is the dominant issuer, accounting for 85 percent of the bond market, and has
helped spur market development by introducing a benchmark series along the yield curve, and a
regular issuance program. Commercial banks are major investors, holding more than half of
government bonds. The significant presence of government securities in banks’ balance sheets is
partly a legacy of the Government’s purchase of bad debt during the Asian crisis. SBANK
INDONESIA bills also constitute a major part of the debt market, but are issued for monetary
policy purposes by Bank Indonesia and not traded on the exchange. SOEs and banks are the
major issuers of corporate debt.

                                                                                                                16
43.      Indonesia’s insurance industry is growing rapidly, albeit from a low base. As of
December 2011, there were 41 life insurance companies and about 80 non-life insurers including
4 reinsurance companies operating in the country. The total written premia for 2010 was IDR 84
trillion, excluding renewal premia for life insurance. Life insurance remains the most vibrant
segment of the insurance industry with the number of policy holders increasing by 48 percent
from 2009 to 2010. This represents a 24.4 percent increase in assets from 2009 to 2010 totaling
IDR 189 trillion, according to the Indonesia Life Insurance Association (AAJI). The AAJI is
targeting annual growth of at least 25 percent over the coming years to reach IDR 500 trillion in
assets by 2014. Life insurance accounted for about 80 percent of total insurance industry assets
of IDR 237.5 trillion at the end of 2010. The exponential growth in this sector is a result of the
increased levels of education and awareness among the growing middle class.

44.     The responsibility for financial sector supervision is currently shared between Bank
Indonesia and the MOF. However, as mentioned above, the Government has taken the decision
to establish the OJK as the new integrated financial sector regulator. Currently, Bank Indonesia
regulates and supervises deposit-taking institutions, such as commercial banks and rural banks.
The MOF, through Bapepam-LK, regulates and supervises capital markets including issuers,
intermediaries, mutual funds, exchanges, and clearing houses. Bapepam-LK also supervises
multi-finance companies, leasing companies, insurance, and pension funds. Under the new
structure, OJK will carry out both bank and non-bank regulation and supervision (see Financial
Sector Reform in Section III below).

45.    Islamic finance is growing rapidly, although the supervision and regulations
governing this segment need to be tightened. Sharia products are now offered for all financial
services and by both traditional and Sharia-only commercial banks. After 2023, Sharia products
and services can only be offered by Sharia institutions. Bank Indonesia, in an effort to promote
the industry, has set lower levels of paid-in capital for the establishment of Sharia banks even
though the NPL ratio for Sharia finance is slightly above the industry average.

   E. The Political and Social Context

46.     From 2001 to 2010, Indonesia experienced a deepening and entrenching of
democracy and a return to stable and strong economic growth. The beginning of the current
administration’s second tenure saw widespread public disenchantment with weak law
enforcement and high-profile scandals involving the police and the attorney general’s office. Yet
despite political tensions within the Parliament, the coalition structure and consensus-oriented
approach of the ministerial cabinet have been maintained. Policy-making continues to benefit
from the reform-orientation and technocratic background of several key cabinet members as well
as leadership from the President and Vice President. A cabinet reshuffle in the second half of
2011 saw some significant changes, including in the economic ministries, but the overall reform
orientation of the cabinet has remained.

47.     Political positioning can be expected to rise in 2012. Given that parliamentary and
presidential elections are planned for April and July 2014, political tensions and positioning can
be expected to rise again next year. This is likely to give rise to distractions that will make the
Government’s task of implementing institutional reform more challenging, particularly as
coalition members may seek to disassociate themselves from controversial or popular reforms.



                                                17
48.     Some recent policymaking outcomes from the administration have tended to be
protectionist, generating concerns over Indonesia’s overall investment climate and
commitment to reforms. For example, the issuance of a decree that will eventually eliminate
foreign majority ownership of mines could increase the risk of regulatory capture by special
interests, which in turn could undermine economic efficiency. Other controversial policy moves
include: the banning of rattan exports to protect domestic furniture makers; restrictions on
imports of horticultural products; and the tighter rules on establishing retail and restaurant
franchises, in a bid to promote domestic businesses. This protectionist trend and the regulatory
uncertainty that it creates could potentially expand to other sectors, especially if economic
growth slows as a result of the accelerating global slowdown and also as political tensions build
in the run-up to 2014.

49.     Progress in reforming the judicial and law-enforcement agencies continued to be
slow. Recent cases of corruption highlighted the vast challenges in reforming the judicial and
law-enforcement systems in Indonesia. These included allegations of corruption affecting most
political parties, investigators conspiring with a corrupt tax auditor, senior police and Attorney
General Office (AGO) personnel fabricating evidence against two Anti Corruption Committee
(KPK) deputy-chairs, and police officials conducting suspicious financial transactions. Thus far,
progress towards the resolution of these cases remains to be slow.

50.     Instances of sectarian violence against minority groups highlight the need for the
Government to strengthen efforts in upholding the laws concerning the freedom of religion.
The past year has seen an increase in the number of instances of religious violence and
intolerance, primarily on Java. These increased instances of religious violence highlight the need
for the Government to strengthen efforts in upholding the laws concerning the freedom of
religion in the face of violence and intimidation by radical sectarian groups.

51.     Over the past decade there has been considerable progress toward gender equality
in Indonesia, particularly in the area of education, however, persistent gender disparities
remain. Maternal mortality rates remain relatively high for Indonesia’s income level, and as in
other countries, women’s voices in the public domain remains weak. While Indonesia’s female
labor force participation rate increased from around 45 percent in 1980 to about 55 percent in
2008, it still remained below the 70 percent average for the region. Furthermore, women still
earn less than men in all sectors, are more likely to work in the informal sector and are the
majority of unskilled migrant laborers. Gender gaps in wages in the service, industry and
agriculture sectors in Indonesia are among the largest in the region. The important
socioeconomic variations in Indonesia are that urban educated women have higher returns than
men with the same education, while women at the bottom end of the wage distribution (i.e.
among the lowest educated individuals) face the biggest wage gap. Enterprise surveys also
suggest that, within the same firms, women are more likely than men to be temporary workers—
around 25 and 17.5 percent of women workers in exporting and non-exporting firms compared to
less than 10 percent of male workers are on temporary contracts in Indonesia. While female-
owned and managed enterprises are not inherently less productive, they tend to be less
capitalized and operate in less remunerative sectors.

52.    Further, Indonesian women are disproportionally more excluded from formal
financial services than men. The World Bank Access to Finance Survey 2010 and Migrant
Worker Survey 2008 found that women are less likely to borrow, and when they do so, they are


                                               18
more likely to borrow informally. Women are also less likely to enroll in life insurance, asset
insurance or private health insurance than men (see Box 1: Gender Aspects of the FIRM DPL).

                 III.   THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM

53.    The FIRM DPL is designed to support the Indonesian authorities to promote the
development of a sound, efficient, and inclusive financial sector and accelerate private
investment in order to achieve GOI’s economic development and poverty reduction goals.
The GOI has stated its goal to turn Indonesia’s economy into one of the world’s ten largest by
2025. While the FIRM DPL focuses only on policy measures that the GOI is implementing to
enhance the financial sector and investment climate, it is underpinned by a wide-ranging reform
program that the Government has been implementing over the past decade. A range of World
Bank Group (WBG) programs, analytical and advisory services (AAA) and technical assistance
programs have supported these reforms. Key elements of the GOI’s broad reform program are
outlined below.

       A. Indonesia’s Overall Development Agenda

54.      Since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia has come a long way in reinforcing
economic stability and undertaking structural reforms. Within the first five years after the
crisis, overall stability was restored on both the macroeconomic and political front. Lacking the
finances to undertake many needed investments, at that time the Government’s initial focus was
on fiscal consolidation and putting in place the basic legislative framework for the new
Indonesian political setting. On the economic front, the focus was on restructuring the banking
sector, which had collapsed as a result of the crisis, and on restoring the fiscal position of the
Government. Thereafter, to prepare for the end of its IMF program, the Government issued a
White Paper in September 2003 that outlined plans for macroeconomic and fiscal consolidation
and a series of structural reforms to restore confidence in the Indonesian economy and boost
investment. These plans were broadly maintained by the Government led by President S.B.
Yudhoyono who came to power in late 2004, with the plans incorporated into the Medium-Term
Development Plan (RPJMN) 2004-2009.

55.     In 2010 the Government unveiled its Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN)
2010-2014, which outlines the GOI’s development programs and reform initiatives towards
a more inclusive and equitable development. The plan lays out 11 national priorities including:
(i) bureaucracy and governance reform; (ii) education; (iii) health; (iv) poverty reduction; (v)
food security; (vi) infrastructure; (vii) investment and business climate; (viii) energy; (ix)
environment and disaster management; (x) least developed, frontier, outer, and post-conflict
areas; and (xi) culture, creativity, and technological innovation. Most programs under poverty
reduction, education, and health are a continuation or expansion of the existing development
programs, such as the integrated social assistance program including the national insurance
system (Jamkesmas), scholarships for the poor, cash transfers (BLT), conditional grant assistance
for poor households (PKH), School Operational Assistance (BOS), and the expansion of rural
community development programs (PNPM Mandiri). Some new program priorities include
constructing 19,000 km of highway across the five largest islands, increasing electricity
generation capacity by 3,000 MW per annum, building transportation infrastructure based on the
National Transportation System and Transportation Blueprint, introducing a single identity
number to be applied by 2011, reducing the number of least developed areas by 50 districts by

                                               19
2014, developing a national logistic system, and implementing an electronic investment license
and information system. These new priorities reflect the Government’s focus on infrastructure
for the next five years.

56.    Addressing gender issues has become a Government priority. The issuance of
INPRES No. 3/2010, together with some ministerial regulations on gender budgeting and
mainstreaming 1, signify the Government’s serious efforts toward a more equitable development,
involving women and children.

57.     In May 2011, the Government launched its Masterplan for the Acceleration and
Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development 2011-2025 (MP3EI or “the Masterplan”)
as Indonesia’s new, longer-term strategy to become an industrialized economy. The
Masterplan goes beyond the five-year development plan and aims to boost Indonesia’s economic
growth to 7-9 percent during the coming decades, aimed at becoming one of the 10 largest
economies in the world by 2025. It argues that such high growth levels can only be attained by
structurally transforming the economy through higher levels of investments in priority sectors
and especially infrastructure. The new MP3EI is based on three strategies: (i) the development of
six economic corridors aimed at fostering centers of growth by developing leading resource-
based industrial clusters in each major island group.; (ii) the strengthening of national
connectivity, strengthening connectivity and synergies between those centers of growth,
including international connectivity; and (iii) the acceleration of technological and R&D
capacity, to complement connectivity by improving human resources capabilities and increasing
investments in research and development.

58.     Improvement of Indonesia’s investment climate, including its trade and investment
policies, features prominently in the Masterplan. In outlining its vision for economic
development, the Government has attempted to bring provincial and local government, business
leaders and state-owned enterprises into one integrated national development framework to the
issue key challenges in this area.

        B. Reforms Supported by the Development Policy Lending

59.     Since 2003, the World Bank has supported the Government’s reform program
through a series of DPL programs. Specifically, the DPL 1-8 series has followed a
multisectoral approach and supported structural and institutional reform efforts broadly in three
main areas: (i) investment climate and trade facilitation, (ii) public financial management, and
(iii) poverty alleviation efforts and public services delivery. Annex 3 describes the main elements
of the DPL program and the results achieved.

60.     In 2012 the Government decided to request three sectoral DPLs to increase focus on
priority areas. This shift will allow the World Bank to expand and deepen the engagement on
priority reforms in line with Government’s own strategic plans. As mentioned above, the three
planned loans include:

1
 These include MoF Regulation No. 93/ 2011 on ministry/agency work planning and budgeting that requires the
provision of gender budget statement; Ministry of Home Affairs Regulation No. 67/2012 for gender mainstreaming;
and Bappenas decree No.19/ 2012 on Steering and Technical Teams that are mandated with institutionalizing and
accelerating gender mainstreaming in Bappenas.


                                                      20
        •   The Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and Investment Development Policy
            Loan (INSTANSI-DPL, formerly named “DPL 9”). This operation will focus on
            strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation efforts.

        •   The FIRM DPL. As described in this document, this operation focuses on the
            financial sector and investment climate.

        •   The Connectivity DPL. The loan will support reforms that strengthen inter-agency
            policy coordination and advance policies to improve logistics efficiency.

61.      The FIRM DPL expands the investment climate pillar of the previous DPL series,
which historically has included a range of both financial sector and investment climate
reforms. The operation specifically incorporates the reforms that were originally planned to be
included in DPL9. Through a sectoral loan, the Bank is able to support the Government’s reform
agenda more comprehensively through multiple prior actions in areas such as financial sector
stability, inclusion, and diversification. The more focused loan is expected to further deepen the
Bank’s engagement with key ministries involved in financial sector reform such as Bank
Indonesia, Ministry of Finance, LPS, TNP2K, Bappenas, and CMEA and also enhance
coordination between these ministries on policy issues related to financial sector development
and regulatory reform. The sectoral approach is expected to promote better targeting of technical
assistance provided by the Bank and other development partners on the highest priority policy
reforms. The Government’s request also reflects its interest in highlighting the important reforms
being undertaken in the sector with the goal of increasing the competiveness of the Indonesian
economy. Annex 2 includes the list of related prior actions.

62.    The FIRM DPL also builds directly on the PERISAI DPL-DDO (USD 2.0 billion),
which was approved by the Board in May 2012. PERISAI aims to enhance the GOI’s crisis
preparedness to address the potential adverse impact of ongoing volatility in financial markets on
the Government’s ability to meet its gross fiscal financing needs from markets. The operation is
part of a USD 5.5 billion support package supported together by the World Bank and other
development partners (including the Government of Japan, Government of Australia, and the
Asian Development Bank). While PERISAI largely focused on short-term measures related to
enhancing crisis preparedness in the financial sector, the FIRM DPL seeks to support medium-
term reform measures.

       C. Financial Sector Reform

Financial sector stability

63.     The GOI has been working to create a robust financial sector safety net to improve
both crisis prevention and management. This effort has involved Bank Indonesia, Bapepam-
LK (Indonesia’s Non-Bank Financial System Regulator), the Indonesia Deposit Insurance
Corporation (LPS), as well as the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the focus has also been on
reforming the overall legal and regulatory framework supporting financial system stability as
well as strengthening crisis management protocols.

64.    The most significant recent development in the financial sector is the passage of the
OJK Law by the Indonesian Parliament in October 2011. The OJK will take over the current
regulatory and supervisory functions of capital markets and non-bank financial institutions of

                                               21
Bapepam-LK at the end of 2012. This will be followed by the transfer of Bank Indonesia’s
responsibilities for the supervision and regulation of banks at the end of 2013.

65.     While the Government’s decision to establish OJK provides an opportunity for
improved coordination in supervision across the financial sector, it is accompanied by
significant risks, particularly given the ongoing global financial crisis. As a result, managing
risks and uncertainties during the transition remains critical task for the authorities, particularly
to ensure that the transition does not result in a loss of supervisory capacity during the transition
period. As emphasized in the Indonesia FSAP, there are risks associated with changes to
supervisory structures. For example, it is possible that some supervisory competencies or
continuity could be lost in the transition. It will therefore be important to ensure that there is
legal and operational clarity of roles and responsibilities, and in particular that there is clarity and
close coordination between the new authority, which has the responsibility for micro-prudential
oversight, and Bank Indonesia, which has ongoing macro-prudential supervision functions.
These risks call attention to the sensitivity and importance of the transition period.

66.   The OJK Law has several key features that are relevant to the GOI efforts to
maintain financial sector stability:

         •   The Law establishes OJK as an independent institution, responsible for regulation
             and supervision of financial services in banking, capital markets, insurance, pension
             funds, financing institutions and others. In order to carry out this role, the law grants
             OJK the authority to establish rules, regulations, and corresponding policies for
             regulation and supervision, as well as to establish rules regarding procedures for
             investigations and sanctions in accordance with financial services sector legislation.

         •   The Law provides for the maintenance of the stability of the financial system by
             setting up the Financial System Stability Coordination Forum (FSSC). Members
             include the Minister of Finance, the Governor of Bank Indonesia, and the Chairs of
             the OJK and the LPS. Article 45 sets out functions of the FSSC in “normal
             conditions” as monitoring and evaluating stability of the system, making
             recommendations for maintaining its stability. In “abnormal conditions” for the
             prevention and handling of a possible crisis, each member may propose an
             immediate meeting of the FSSC to decide measures for crisis management. The
             FSSC is authorized in the Law to take and implement decisions for and on behalf of
             the institutions represented.

         •   The Law sets out several coordination protocols regarding troubled banks. Article
             41 states that OJK shall inform LPS about a troubled bank’s restructuring efforts by
             the OJK as defined in the legislation. In the case of OJK indicating certain banks are
             experiencing liquidity difficulties or worsening soundness, OJK will immediately
             inform Bank Indonesia to take steps in accordance with its authority. LPS can also
             conduct an examination of the related bank in accordance with its functions, duties
             and authority, and coordinate in advance with the OJK.

67.      While the establishment of the FSSC helps to address important weaknesses in the
current legal and regulatory framework, gaps remain. For example, the Law does not fully
define the mechanisms for information sharing, coordination, and decision making in times of
crisis, particularly with respect to a systemically important financial institution. Most importantly,
                                                  22
the Law also does not address the critical need to strengthen legal protection for supervisors—a
key prerequisite for stronger enforcement and crisis management. As a result, there remains a
need to establish a legal and institutional framework that addresses these issues and also sets
forth the protocols and procedures for dealing with the resolution of failed financial institutions.

68.       The ratification of the OJK Law also presents three main challenges to ensuring
financial system stability and ensuring crisis preparedness. The first challenge is for
authorities to support the effective establishment and the smooth transition of operations from
Bank Indonesia and Bapepam-LK to OJK. This is one of the most critical challenges facing the
financial sector authorities at this time. The most important immediate task for the Government
has been to select the Board members of OJK, so that they are well positioned to take over
management of OJK. Other challenges have included defining the organizational structure for
OJK; setting HR policies including salaries, training and management policies; supporting
institutional development; and designing IT systems. All of this needs to be done in a timely
manner to minimize disruption during the transition period.

69.       The second challenge for authorities is to ensure that adequate near-term
arrangements for systemic risk assessment, crisis preparedness, and potentially crisis
management during the transition to OJK are in place through 2014. Generally, the
objective of a crisis management protocol is to define the decision making authority, operating
procedures and information sharing mechanisms to ensure that, should a crisis occur, the
economic and financial authorities can act effectively to minimize the impact of the crisis on the
financial system and the economy as a whole. Such protocols are intended to specify relevant
institutions, groups and individuals, and their respective roles, responsibilities, and decision
making authorities. The Government’s work in this area builds on the recommendations of the
Indonesia FSAP well as a 2008 Crisis Simulation Exercise that was conducted with the support
of the World Bank and AusAid.

70.     As a result of these efforts, the Government has prepared a National Crisis
Management Protocol (CMP). The protocol sets forth mechanisms for systemic monitoring,
coordination and information sharing on the financial system among the Ministry of Finance,
Bank Indonesia, LPS, and OJK. In addition, it defines the division of tasks and responsibilities of
the members, the scope of coordination between these agencies and the information sharing
mechanisms. The protocol is supported by the issuance of agency-level regulations to further
elaborate on agency-level systemic monitoring and surveillance. These measures are expected to
improve both crisis prevention and management in the short-term until the legal and regulatory
framework is further enhanced. The National CMP is also complemented by a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) on Coordination in Maintaining Financial System Stability between
MOF, Bank Indonesia, and LPS. This MOU provides for information sharing and improved
coordination in the absence of the passage of a broader financial sector law that addresses gaps in
the legal framework. The Government has had such an MOU in place since 2010, and as
supported by this DPL, has recently updated the MOU in order to include important new
provisions that clarify decision making arrangements and provide consistency with the OJK
Law.

71.    In the long term, the authorities will need to design and put in place permanent
arrangements for systemic monitoring and impact assessment, crisis preparedness, and
crisis management (once OJK is fully operational). Further efforts are required to establish
clear guidance on the division of responsibilities in a crisis, and on shared policy views and
                                                23
agreed decision-making criteria (for example, when and how to use public funds to resolve
certain financial institutions). In addition, it remains essential that all Government officials
involved in crisis management need appropriate legal protection. Thus, these long term reforms
will involve updating the legal and regulatory framework, including putting in place certain key
elements found in the draft Financial Sector Safety Net Law, that ensures that in the event of a
bank failure or financial crisis, the Government and financial sector authorities will have a
stronger legal base to promptly and appropriately manage the situation. Other reforms will
include strengthening capacity for risk-based supervision, ensuring that systemically important
banks are subject to state-of-the-art supervision, strengthening the banking resolution framework,
systematically assessing vulnerabilities, and conducting simulation exercises.

72.    As part of the financial architecture for stability and crisis handling, the GOI is also
working to strengthen its deposit insurance system. LPS covers insured deposits and is
responsible for resolving failed banks. In December 2008, the deposit coverage was raised from
IDR 100 million (USD 11,000) to IDR 2 billion (USD 220,000). With the twenty-fold increase in
coverage, the fund’s resources to cover insured deposits have declined relative to the volume of
insured deposits. International experience has shown that when a deposit insurance fund is
undercapitalized there is a tendency to either recapitalize banks or to keep them open beyond the
time that is economically appropriate. Increasing LPS’ capital base and addressing issues
surrounding this are essential. To handle the failure of at least two mid-sized banks, the LPS
would need to increase resources through higher premia or additional funds. Currently, the LPS
Law states (Article 85) that (i) if at any time the capital of LPS falls below IDR 4 trillion, the
Government must cover the deficit; (ii) in the event that LPS encounters liquidity difficulties,
LPS has the right to borrow from the Government. Reinforcing this, the recently enacted Budget
Law (Article 43) authorizes the Government, upon streamlined parliamentary approval, to revise
expenditures or financing sources in the event of an economic or financial crisis. This article
reduces potential for delay in securing funds in the case of LPS liquidity difficulties.

73.     LPS is currently exploring the option of risk based tiered premia and financial
projection models. The Board of Commissioners has very recently taken the decision to adopt
differentiated premia. The Bank is providing technical assistance to LPS in this area with the
goal to improve capacity to perform a more robust risk assessment of the banking system on an
individual and system-wide basis and to develop least cost resolution options against failing and
failed banks. Implementation of a financial projection model would allow LPS to project the
timing and costs of individual bank failures and calculate the reserves required to be able to
resolve failed banks promptly without harming confidence in the deposit market. The first phase
has been training to LPS on implementing such a model. Future work requires efforts to improve
the LPS reporting system and analytical capacity with regard to a risk based premium system, as
well as incorporating the model into risk assessment and bank resolution studies, if needed, with
more granular data.

74.     Recent reforms over the last few years have targeted the banking sector given its
size and importance. Actions by the authorities included amendments of the banking sector
legal and regulatory framework, the recapitalization of state banks and nationalization of major
private banks, introduction of guarantees for all liabilities of banks (commonly referred to as the
blanket guarantee), and establishment of the Indonesian Banking Restructuring Agency to
resolve problem loans and restructure banks. The 2010 FSAP also found that, in recent years,
oversight of the financial system has improved substantially. The move toward full compliance
with PSAK 55 (IAS 39) is expected to help bring greater transparency to business accounting
                                                24
75.    However, despite improvements, gaps in banking supervision remain. Legally
mandated prompt corrective action (PCA) would speed up Bank Indonesia’s actions to resolve
weak banks and make decisions more transparent. Issues with the quality of capital, loan
provisioning rules, and home-host supervision also need to be addressed. Bank Indonesia’s
governance could be improved through a simpler and more transparent process for selecting its
top management.

Financial sector diversification

76.     Despite achievements related to the stability of the banking sector, progress on
reforms has been slow in diversification and inclusion. Diversification of the financial sector
has traditionally been low, and there has been almost no change in the share of the total financial
systems assets since 2000. As noted in Section II, the financial sector is still highly concentrated,
with the banking sector dominating the sector. Indonesia’s bond market development is very
nascent compared to others in the region. Similarly, the role played by pensions, insurance and
other non-banking financial institutions is also minimal for a country of Indonesia’s size and
income levels.

77.     The insurance sector is growing rapidly and has been the subject of recent reform
efforts. From an insurance market development and growth perspective there are two major
areas which require immediate attention: (i) developing a more inclusive insurance market; and
(ii) developing strong and well capitalized insurance companies. Current estimates are that less
than 10 percent of the households have some form of commercial insurance coverage, and a
great majority of them live in urban areas. Insurance penetration in rural areas is very low and
negligible among the low income population. The insurance industry in Indonesia is highly
fragmented with large number of poorly capitalized insurance companies, leading to limitations
of scope in the undertaking of risk and under pricing of products.

78.     Bapepam-LK has begun to place strict capital requirements on insurance
companies. As of the end of 2010, the capital requirement was IDR 40 billion and IDR 25
billion for Sharia insurance companies. This is scheduled to rise to IDR 70 billion and then IDR
100 billion by 2012 and 2014 respectively. Similarly, the insurance regulator is involved in the
process of developing microinsurance regulations to provide the enabling environment for
insurance companies to reach millions of low income households who currently have no access
to insurance service.

79.     In an effort to develop an efficient, competitive, and transparent capital market and
non-bank financial sector, the MOF issued a Capital Markets and Non Banking Financial
Sector Master Plan 2010-2014. The plan has five main objectives, including supporting: (i)
easily accessible, efficient and competitive source of funds, (ii) conducive, attractive investment
climate and risk management; (iii) a stable, resilient liquid industry; (iv) a fair and transparent
regulatory framework which guarantees legal certainty; and (v) credible, reliable standardized
information. Notably, the plan contains working guidelines highlighting the importance of a
securities investor protection fund, the need to establish an insurance guarantee scheme, and
improved supervision of the industry.

80.   In recent years, as part of its financial sector development agenda, Indonesia has
made important efforts to improve the quality of corporate financial reporting.
Considerable progress has been made to strengthen the institutional framework of accounting

                                                 25
and auditing to move towards convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and adoption of International Standards of Auditing (ISA). The 2011 Accounting and
Auditing Report of the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) identified several
recommendations including improving the statutory framework for institutional and policy
development; independent reviews of audit practices; strengthening the profession to ensure
adequate number of public accountants to meet the needs of a growing economy, broader
training programs on practical application of the new accounting and auditing standards; and
continued development of accountancy curricula and teaching in universities throughout the
country. One of the key recommendations was to establish a Financial Reporting Council
responsible for issuing accounting standards and related pronouncements and monitoring and
enforcing applicable accounting standards through financial statement and quality assurance
review.

Financial Inclusion

81.     Despite the overall growth of the financial system, nearly half of the population
lacks access to formal financial services. A nationwide household survey on access to financial
services in Indonesia conducted by the World Bank in 2010 showed that only 49 percent of the
population has access to the formal banking sector and less than 20 percent have ever borrowed
from a bank. When combined with access to formal non-bank financial institutions, only 52
percent of the population is served by the formal financial system. Further, the survey indicated
that 17 percent of the population (or nearly 40 million people) are excluded entirely from the
financial system, both formal and informal. The poor and women appear to be particularly
excluded for a number of reasons (Box 1).

                          Box 1: Gender Aspects of the FIRM-DPL


 By their nature, financial inclusion reforms disproportionately benefit women, increase
 employment opportunities, income and enhance social protection for poverty reduction.
 In Indonesia women are disproportionally more excluded from formal financial services than
 men. The World Bank Access to finance survey 2010 and migrant worker survey 2008 found
 that women are less likely to borrow, and where they do so, women more likely to borrow
 informally. Women are also less likely to enroll in life insurance, asset insurance or private
 health insurance than men.

 The case of Indonesia’s migrant workers highlights these financial vulnerabilities.
 Indonesia has 6 million overseas migrant workers and 80 percent are female. The 2008
 World Bank migrant workers financial inclusion survey showed that these migrant workers
 face challenges to formal financial services which are needed at the different stages of
 migration, such as credit, savings, remittance channels and insurance in the following ways:
         • 27 percent of migrant workers do not have access to savings accounts;
         • 59 percent of migrant workers do not have access to credit;
         • More than 18 percent of migrant workers have neither savings nor credit;
         • Male migrant workers face less financial exclusion; they are more likely to take a
             loan and to work in the better paid formal sector.



                                               26
 These financial vulnerabilities are due in part to gender, with limited formal education and
 low rates of financial literacy.

 The reforms supported under the FIRM DPL can help respond to the particular
 challenges faced by women related to accessing to financial services. The National
 Strategy for Financial Inclusion already includes a number of programs that are expected to
 respond to the particular demands of women for financial services, such as the support of
 financial literacy training for migrant workers. Another significant initiative is the effort to
 bring poor women into the financial system through the PKH program, where women heads
 of household receive conditional cash transfers through savings accounts. Going forward, the
 NSFI also provides an opportunity for the Government to directly incorporate these issues
 into their agency-level programs as the agencies finalize their legally-binding action plans for
 the implementation of the strategy. Key performance indicators are expected to capture
 gender aspects to the extent possible for various programs at the agency level. Some
 agencies, such as the National Agency for Protection and Placement of Indonesian Overseas
 Workers (BNP2TKI), which is responsible for implementing migration policy, already target
 women in their programs and currently monitor gender aspects of their work. Additional
 information on gender disparities in Indonesia is included in Section II E.


82.    Access to finance in Indonesia is also low compared to competitor countries and
others in the East Asia Region. Recent indicators of financial access point to specific areas
where Indonesia falls behind others (Figure 12).

                            Figure 12: Indicators of starting a business




        Source: CGAP Financial Access 2010, data as 2009

83.    In line with the G20 principles on financial inclusion, Indonesia has identified a
number of priority agenda items. These include: (i) launching and implementing the National
Financial Inclusion Strategy which supports the development of more coherent approaches to

                                                  27
promoting financial inclusion and integration with other key Government poverty reduction and
economic growth strategies; (ii) empowering formal financial institutions through improved
access to funding and targeted capacity building; (iii) enacting an appropriate legal framework
for non-bank/non-cooperative (informal) microfinance institutions; (iv) encouraging further
development of venture capital, leasing, and Sharia-based financial products; (v) creating an
enabling regulatory environment to facilitate financial inclusion; and (vi) providing a clear legal
and regulatory framework for innovative/technology-led financial services/products that are key
to affordable and convenient financial service provision.

84.     Against this background, the GOI has recently launched a number of efforts to
increase the array of financial services available for the poor and underserved. This
includes the launch of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy, which is expected to provide an
overarching framework to expand access to finance to the poor. This endeavor has involved a
number of Government agencies including the Vice President’s Office/TNP2K, Bank Indonesia,
CMEA, MOF, and Bappenas. The strategy aims at providing greater access to finance for all,
with a particular attention to three segments of the population (low-income poor, working poor
and near-poor) and three cross-cutting categories (migrant workers, women and people living in
remote areas). Special efforts will be given to monitoring financial inclusion of these groups.
Following the launch of the strategy, the relevant agencies are planning to prepare a detailed
action plan for implementation of reforms. The Bank and IFC are currently providing discrete
technical assistance to support some of the initiatives, such as on agent banking and mobile
based transactions. The reforms and analysis of mobile money issues is particularly important for
Indonesia given that it is an archipelago and the banking sector faces many physical access
constraints.

85.      As part of its financial inclusion strategy, the Government is also scaling up its
flagship People’s Business Credit program, (known as the “Kredit Usaha Rakyat,” or
KUR). The program is currently the primary public mechanism of support to MSME financing
needs. The KUR program reached almost 6.3 million borrowers as of end of April 2012 (an
increase of 1 million since July 2011), disbursing a total of IDR 72 trillion with almost IDR 33
trillion outstanding. The quality of the portfolio is consistently high, at an average NPL of 3.2
percent total loan portfolio (overall banking sector NPL of 2.8 percent). A 2010 evaluation
broadly found that the program has helped to increase access to credit to MSMEs and has
encouraged banks to lend to small enterprises, and especially to micro-enterprises. Despite these
achievements, however, there is scope for improving the effectiveness of the program through
operational and policy changes as the GOI continues to scale up the program throughout
Indonesia. One of the recommendations was to introduce adequate supervision of the
implementation for this multi-agency program. Therefore, the action proposed will help develop
protocols for monitoring and implementing policy and operational changes.

       D. Investment Climate Reforms

86.    From 2001 to 2010, Indonesia experienced a deepening of democracy and a return
to stable and strong economic growth. Hand in hand with this, the Government embarked on a
wide range of prudent regulatory reforms in order to improve competitiveness and encourage
investment in Indonesia. From 2003-2006, the Government issued three economic policy
packages covering investment climate, infrastructure and financial reform. In 2007, it issued a
comprehensive follow-up package detailing 168 specific reform measures to be carried out.


                                                28
87.     As a result of these measures, a number of perception-based and objective
indicators of the investment climate improved, helping investment flows to recover swiftly
after the most recent financial crisis of 2008-2009. In 2010, Indonesia emerged from the
financial crisis with FDI inflows increasing substantially to over USD 13 billion. In addition,
according to the Doing Business Survey 2012, Indonesia saw improvements in the several
categories. In the area of starting a business, improvements reduced the start up time by 70
percent—from 151 days in 2006 to 45 days in 2011—and the number of procedures from 12 to
8. In dealing with construction permits time was shortened by 15 percent—from 186 days in
2005 to 158 days in 2011. The total tax rate was reduced from 37.3 percent of profit in 2006 to
34.5 percent in 2011 while online systems for filing taxes cut the time it takes to pay taxes by
more than half—from 560 hours in 2006 to 266 hours in 2011.

88.     However, recent research indicates that while there have been improvements in
certain areas, Indonesia still has a long way to go to improve the investment climate.
According to the Doing Business 2012 report, firms point to major constraints including skilled
labor shortages, poor infrastructure and an onerous regulatory framework as the three major
bottlenecks to business expansion. The World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys show that Indonesian
firms identify an inadequately educated workforce and high rates of informality as two of the top
ten constrains to firm investment. One of the key causes of this high rate of informality in
Indonesia is the heavy regulatory burden borne by firms. In fact, nearly 30 percent of firms in
Indonesia start operations without being formally registered.

89.    The Doing Business 2012 survey indicates that Indonesia slipped to a rank of 129
from 121, out of a list of 183 economies in terms of the overall ease of doing business.
Indonesia also received a poor ranking in the areas of starting a business (rank 155th), and
enforcing contracts (rank 156th). However, Indonesia compared similarly to several of the other
BRIC countries (Table 5).

              Table 5: Indonesia’s Doing Business 2012 ranking compared to BRICs

                China                                         91

                Russia                                       120

90.     Indonesia’s manufacturing sector also faces numerous challenges in part as a result
of investment climate constraints. The sector, which in the 1980s through 1990s grew at the
same pace as in other countries in East Asia and was one of few leading sectors for
industrialization and job creation, is now largely stagnant. Indonesian manufacturing exports are
also facing tough competition from other low costs suppliers and have not made much progress
in climbing up the value chain. The commodity boom has further shifted Indonesia’s exports
more towards raw materials and resource based products. Research indicates that one of the five
primary constraints to revitalizing growth of a sector, which creates more than 1.5 million jobs
per year, is the investment climate.



                                               29
91.     In recognition of the substantial contribution investment can make to accelerated
growth and poverty reduction, investment climate regulatory reform is a key priority in the
Government’s reform agenda. Research and close dialogue indicate that investments are
constrained by poor coordination between the relevant Government agencies, uncertainty about
the legal and judicial frameworks, infrastructure constraints, and unclear investment policies,
regulations, and procedures. Therefore, the Government’s MP3EI articulates that in the short-
term, improvement of the investment climate will be through debottlenecking regulations,
incentives, and the acceleration of infrastructure development needed by all stakeholders.

Policy coordination

92.     Regulatory certainty is a key driver of investment, as firms need to rely on a
consistent policy environment in order make decisions on whether to invest or expand their
businesses. As such, it is critical that the Government ensure a consistent policy environment if
Indonesia is to meet its medium-term economic development and poverty reduction goals. In the
last year, however, recent policy announcements have raised some concerns about the direction
of trade and investment policy making. These measures include, for example, restrictions on
imported horticulture products and new divestment regulations and processing requirements in
the mining sector. While the aims of these policies may originate in the development objectives
of promoting domestic productivity, jobs and growth, their presentation, which has often been
changing, highlights coordination and communication issues. In addition to the uncertain
effectiveness of these policies to meet the stated objectives, there is concern that the expansion of
such policies could weaken the confidence of investors in the domestic economic outlook.

93.     The RPJMN also places a high priority on harmonizing policies and regulations.
This includes streamlining procedures, promoting customs and trade facilitation, improving
infrastructure, and strengthening the financial sector to support a sound investment climate.
Given the pressure to make Indonesia attractive to investors and achieve the goal set forth in
MP3EI, the immediate challenge is to set up a coordinating mechanism and identify regulation
and policy areas for reform or overhaul.

Business environment challenges

94.     Firms operating in Indonesia, as in other emerging economies, face numerous
challenges related to the business environment. Research shows that relatively more new
firms are created and employment grows when business entry becomes easier. Formal
registration has many immediate benefits for business owners, employers and governments alike.
In Indonesia simplifying business licenses is a particularly important to encourage micro and
small enterprises to become registered. In turn, this is expected to help them get access to
financing and improve their productivity. This factor is crucial particularly for the Indonesia
manufacturing sector, which research has shown has relatively few medium sized firms. The
percentage of small firms, defined as firms with 5 to 19 employees, is very large in Indonesia,
reaching 93 percent versus 37 percent in Brazil, 60 percent in Vietnam, and 65 percent in
Philippines. This suggests a high degree of informality.

95.   Complex licensing procedures have been identified as an important factor
underlying Indonesia’s poor business climate. 2 Starting a new business in Indonesia is more
2
    The definition of business licensing in this note includes licenses and permits.
                                                             30
difficult in Indonesia than in comparator countries in the region. It takes about 45 days for 8
procedures to start up a new business in Indonesia while it takes only 38 days for 7 procedures in
the Asia Pacific region in 2011 (Figure 13). Likewise, business expansion takes about the same
amount of procedures and length of time.

96.     The time and costs of business licensing also varies widely across Indonesian cities
as a result of how many laws and regulations are implemented. The Indonesia Doing
Business 2012 report was the second in a series analyzing business regulations beyond the
capital city, Jakarta. This has allowed a more representative view of business regulations, and
comparisons of local government performance. The report found that starting a business is fastest
in Gorontalo and Palangka Raya with 27 days, but 45 days in Jakarta. However, it is cheapest in
Pontianak, and the overall ease of business ranking, Yogyakarta is first, according to the report.

                                  Source: Doing Business 2012

97.    Complex licensing procedures create difficulties for firms in three ways:

        •   By discouraging registration and thus limiting access to finance from formal
            financial institutions. As in other countries, in Indonesia some licenses for company
            registration are used as collateral for firms to obtain loans. It is estimated that
            difficulties in accessing finance reduce productivity by 6 percent in the
            manufacturing sector (according the World Bank’s 2012 Manufacturing Sector
            Study).

        •   By restraining business expansion. Expansion permits are needed if a company
            would like to produce a new product which is different from the current product. The
            length of time and cost of business expansion in Indonesia can be about the same as
            those of starting a new business.

        •   By limiting job creation and economic growth. Excessive regulation and licensing
            encourages firms to remain small and informal, thereby limiting job creation. This
            issue is particularly detrimental to domestic MSMEs which represent more than 90
            percent of Indonesian enterprises and absorb about 70 percent of the workforce.
            Further, uncertainty in regulations plays a significant role in affecting bribe levels
            which increase the cost of obtaining business licenses.
                                                31
98.    Contract enforcement also represents a key area of investment climate reform in
Indonesia. Effective commercial dispute resolution has many benefits. In particular, where
contract enforcement is efficient, businesses are more likely to engage with new borrowers or
customers. The efficiency of the judicial system in resolving commercial disputes is hence an
important element of doing business. Companies that have little or no access to courts must rely
on other mechanisms, both formal and informal—such as trade associations, social networks,
credit bureaus, and private information channels—to decide with whom to do business.
Companies may also adopt conservative business practices and deal only with repeat customers.
Transactions are then structured to forestall disputes.

99.    Providing excellent investment and trade facilitation services is another important
element of investment climate acceleration. The implementation of eGovernance systems and
the reforms required to be effective are priority items on the Government’s reform agenda.
Innovative work is being undertaken by the GOI on emerging e-Governance systems via the
Indonesian National Single Window for Trade (INSW) and the National Single Window for
Investment (NSWi). These areas are providing important opportunities to improve market
linkages, make regulations more transparent, and reduce the administrative burden on business,
ultimately improving competitiveness.

      IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAM

       A. Links to the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy

100. The FIRM DPL is fully aligned with the Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy
Progress Report for the period of 2009-2012 (CPS), which identifies private sector led
growth as the first of the five core engagements (Figure 14). To this end, the operation aims
to develop a strong financial system and investment climate that accelerates private sector
growth and increases competitiveness. The operation also focuses on strengthening Indonesia’s
institutions, in line with the CPS. Specifically, the operation aims to build the capacity of several
key institutions to improve financial system stability, deepen the financial sector, and support
private sector development through a conducive investment climate.

                 Figure 14: Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy FY2009-2012




101. In addition, the Bank’s technical assistance programs complement this DPL with
funding from other development partners. To date technical assistance for the four pillars
                                         32
have been supported by the Multi-donor Fund for Trade and Investment Climate (MDFTIC), the
FIRST Initiative, AusAid and other partners. The Bank is also discussing the set up of a new
trust fund, to be financed by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), that
would focus on financial sector strengthening and provide resources to support institutional
development and capacity building of the relevant institutions over the medium-term.

   B. Relationship to Other Bank Operations

102. The FIRM DPL represents a direct continuation of the ongoing DPL program and
complements the parallel INSTANSI and Connectivity DPLs. As mentioned above, the
proposed operation builds on and expands the investment climate component that has been
supported with financial sector and regulatory reforms under DPLs 1-8. At the request of the
Government, the Bank has decided to support three mutually-reinforcing DPLs in 2012 in order
to strengthen the focus on key sectors. As a result, the FIRM DPL includes several of the
investment climate reforms originally envisioned under the DPL9 and expands the reforms in
key areas to reflect the Government’s robust financial sector reform agenda.

103. The FIRM DPL also builds directly on the PERISAI DPL DDO (May 2012), which
had the overarching objective of enhancing financial sector stability. While the PERISAI,
focused to a greater degree on short-term critical measures to improve financial crisis prevention
and handling, the FIRM DPL reforms target medium-term reforms. Examples include the work
to outline the new organizational structure for OJK as well as work to strengthen the legal
framework and coordination mechanisms for decision making in the time of a financial crisis.

104. The proposed DPL also complements several other ongoing investment lending and
grant-financed operations that promote financial sector development. These operations
include (i) the Indonesia Infrastructure Finance Facility, and (ii) the PNPM Mandiri which
supports more than USD 800 million in revolving loan funds.

       C. Collaboration with Other Development Partners and the IMF

105. Financial sector and investment climate reform by nature requires coordination
across large number agencies and private partners. The FIRM DPL therefore involves a
partnership of the following: (i) Indonesia’s financial authorities including the MOF, Bank
Indonesia, LPS, Bapepam-LK, and others; (ii) development partners; (iii) the private sector
including a range of financial institutions. These public and private sector partners have shared
their perspectives on the Government’s reform program, which is reflected in the FIRM DPL,
through wide consultations as well as through industry associations.

106. The Bank has maintained a close dialogue with a number of development partners,
throughout the preparation of the DPL program. Key partners that have been involved in
various aspects of the DPL program include the Government of Japan (GoJ), through the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Asian Development Bank, and AusAid. In
addition, SECO, the Government of the Netherlands, and USAID have all been involved in
providing technical assistance related to the investment climate under the Multi-donor Facility
for Trade and Investment Climate (MDFTIC). This harmonized approach to policy-based
lending around the overall DPL program has allowed the World Bank and its partners to build
upon the natural synergies and complementarities that exist across the respective portfolios of
various partners.

                                               33
107. The Bank also has coordinated closely with the IMF in the development of the
proposed operation. Further, the DPL draws heavily on the 2010 joint IMF-World Bank
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report, and the related analysis of Indonesia’s
financial sector strengths, vulnerabilities and reform priorities.

       D. Analytical Underpinnings of the FIRM DPL

108. The design of this operation is based on considerable analytical and technical
assistance work related to Indonesia’s financial sector and investment climate. For the
financial sector pillar, as mentioned above, the joint IMF-World Bank FSAP 2010 report has
heavily influenced the operation. Some of the main recommendations identified in the FSAP are
directly addressed in this operation, particularly those related to financial crisis prevention and
management, strengthening the regulatory environment, improving the soundness of the
insurance sector and improving corporate governance in the capital markets. The FSAP also
recommends market infrastructure improvements and other actions to extend the reach of
banking services, which have contributed to the underpinnings of the financial inclusion
component.

109. Other reports and analytical work (AAA) that have informed the financial sector
pillars include: (i) a financial crisis simulation exercise (funded by AusAid) in 2008; (ii)
Bapepam-LK’s Master Plan for Capital Markets and Non-bank Financial Institutions 2010-2014
which is directly aligned with the diversification pillar, identifying the priorities of improving
investor protection, encouraging good corporate governance, and improving risk management as
key strategies for the development of the non banking sector; (iii) the ROSC on Corporate
Governance and ROSC on Accounting and Auditing; (iv) the Peoples Business Credit (KUR)
Impact Assessment 2011 related to increasing financial inclusion; (v) the Indonesia Access to
Finance Report 2010 which highlights the extent of the access issues, identifies challenges on
demand and supply side, and recommends cost effective measures to lower barriers to access,
and (vi) technical notes on financial literacy for migrant workers and their families which have
shaped the financial inclusion work on financial literacy.

110. For the investment climate pillar, the operation has drawn upon several reports and
analytical works. These include: (i) the annual WBG Doing Business Surveys, which are fully
aligned with the selected prior actions, highlighting contract enforcement and business licensing
as two turnkey challenges to a better climate for business; (ii) the Institute for Social and
Economic Research (LPEM) manufacturing and services enterprise surveys, indicating business
licensing complexities at local government level, transportation, macroeonomic stability and
electricity as persistent constraints; (iii) the Government’s Masterplan for Economic
Acceleration in Indonesia (MP3EI); (iv) MDFTIC policy and technical note series on regulatory
reform, the manufacturing sector, trade and logistics, and other discrete topics; and (vi) the 2012
Indonesia Manufacturing Sector Study conducted by the World Bank.

111. The reforms related to both financial sector and investment climate have also been
supported by technical assistance programs carried out by the Bank and other
development partners. These have been financed, among others, by (i) MDFTIC on issues
related to financial inclusion, diversification and investment climate regulatory reform, (ii) the
FIRST Initiative related to insurance sector reform and Islamic Finance, and (iii) AusAid related
to financial crisis preparedness and also support for the establishment of OJK.


                                                34
       E. Lessons Learned

112. The FIRM DPL draws upon the Bank’s DPL Retrospective of 2009, which
highlights flexibility and customization. In keeping with this approach and as a sectoral
operation, the FIRM DPL aims to achieve a deeper set of reforms in the financial sector and
investment climate than its predecessor multi-sectoral operations (DPLs 1-8). The sectoral focus
has allowed the team to substantially expand the number of related policy reforms and support a
more complex medium-term reform agenda. In particular, this is achieved through inclusion of
reforms related to: (i) strengthening the authorities’ ability to prevent and respond to a financial
crisis, as well as (ii) deepening and diversifying the financial sector. It is anticipated that this
more comprehensive approach, combined with reforms to improve the overall investment
climate, will help Indonesia create a robust, inclusive and competitive financial sector able to
serve the financial intermediation needs of the growing Indonesian economy.

113. The FIRM DPL incorporates lessons outlined in the Bank’s Good Practice Note for
Development Policy Lending of 2011, which provides guidance on designing results-
oriented development policy operations. In particular, the operation includes a results
framework that attempts to clearly identify expected results for each pillar as a whole and
baseline indicators. This results framework is also closely linked to the CPS pillars.

114. The overall strategic approach also takes into account lessons from the Bank’s DPL
and DPL-DDO series in Indonesia. Assessments of these operations have identified the
importance of strong government ownership, among other factors. The most relevant lessons are:

        •   Lesson 1: Strong government ownership and committed counterparts are vital, but
            just as important is ownership over the pace of the reform process. As a growing
            middle-income country, Indonesia can access domestic and international capital
            markets, thus offering it a range of financing choices. While the Bank’s financing is
            attractive, the driving reason for the Government’s engagement with the Bank
            through the DPL program is the utility of the instrument in bolstering, locking in and
            accelerating critical reforms. To succeed, DPLs not only need the commitment of
            Government at the highest level but also that of mid-level officials responsible for
            implementing the reforms and following progress on a daily basis.

        •   Lesson 2: Progress on institutional reforms should not be linear and should be
            sufficiently flexible to allow for modifications as the reform program evolves. What
            is needed in this context is commitment to reform, a continued sense of urgency, and
            preparedness so that when the right opportunity presents itself, reforms that had
            otherwise been apparently slowed, may be advanced rapidly. This approach can
            allow for progress through incremental reform.

        •   Lesson 3: DPLs are only one of the Bank’s instruments of support, and the choice of
            instrument should depend on the issue, political context, and the institutional
            circumstances. The Bank has a broad program in Indonesia and therefore the DPL
            should be noted as only part of its engagement strategy which also includes
            investment lending, analytical work, knowledge sharing, and technical assistance.




                                                35
                            V.    THE PROPOSED OPERATION

       A. Objectives and Rationale

115. The objective of the FIRM DPL is to promote the development of a sound, efficient
and inclusive financial sector and support improvements in the investment climate in
Indonesia to help the Government of Indonesia (GOI) achieve its medium-term economic
development and poverty reduction goals. The operation has four main pillars: (i) reinforcing
financial sector stability; (ii) diversifying the financial sector; (iii) promoting financial inclusion
for targeted groups; and (iv) promoting investment climate regulatory reform.

116. As outlined in Section I, the DPL has been proposed as a single tranche USD 100
million loan. The operation is envisioned to be the start of a multi-year program that would
continue to focus on the financial sector and investment climate. Any future DPLs will be subject
to Government financing needs and agreement by the Indonesia Financial Services Authority
(Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or “OJK”), which was established in July 2012. Therefore, this
program document outlines the specific prior actions supported under the proposed operation,
and identifies some recommended reform measures to be carried out in the medium-term (see
Annex 2).

117. The program has been designed to support Indonesia at this critical time in the
development of its financial sector. The Government’s focus on maintaining and strengthening
the stability of the financial system over the last decade has had demonstrable success. While the
banking sector was at the heart of the 1997-98 economic and political crisis that Indonesia faced,
in the 14 years since, the GOI authorities’ focus on enhancing the stability of the banking sector
has paid off substantially. The landscape of the banking sector has been transformed and, as the
more recent global financial crisis demonstrated, in 2011 Indonesia’s financial sector
experienced relatively minor impact from the Eurozone crisis and financial market volatility.
However, in order to serve the demands of it growing economy over the next decade and
contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth, Indonesia’s financial sector will need to
substantially improve efficiency and promote much broader access to financial services.

118. The loan is considered timely and highly relevant given the major reforms taking
place in the financial sector, and the Government’s emphasis on creating a more dynamic,
inclusive financial sector and competitive investment climate. In late 2011 after more than a
decade of consideration, the GOI took the decision to restructure the supervision of the financial
sector by establishing OJK. This decision marks the most significant change in the supervisory
and regulatory framework to take place over the last decade. While the Government’s decision to
establish OJK marks a new and important opportunity for the GOI to lay the foundation for more
effective financial sector regulation and supervision, it is accompanied by significant risks,
particularly given the ongoing global financial crisis. The DPL focuses directly on the most
critical issues related to OJK transition and establishment.

119. This DPL also comes after a decade of improvements to banking sector supervision,
when the Government has now begun to turn its attention to a set of second generation
reforms aimed at deepening the financial sector and expanding access of financial services
to the poor. This effort is reflected by the fact that GOI has developed for the first time a
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, drawing in a wide range of stakeholders to the reform
effort. The strategy distinguishes low-income poor, working poor/MSMEs and near-poor, as well
                                               36
 as groups with special needs (migrant workers, women and people living in remote areas) as the
 target. This operation aims to support the GOI in implementing this broader agenda through
 involvement of multiple institutions. In addition, the FIRM DPL includes an investment climate
 component which also complements these financial sector reforms and reflects the Government’s
 commitment to creating an economic environment conducive to private sector investment,
 articulated in both the Government’s RPJMN 2010-2014 and Masterplan for Acceleration and
 Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development (MP3EI) 2011-2025.

         B. Prior Actions Supported Under the FIRM-DPL

 120. This section outlines the prior actions supported under the FIRM-DPL (Box 2).
 Prior actions have been chosen for their critical role in achieving substantive institutional
 reforms to address the challenges related to Government’s medium-term policy and institutional
 framework. The expected timing of each and expected outcomes are described below.

                            Box 2: Prior Actions for the FIRM-DPL

The following are the prior actions that have been completed for Board presentation:

Pillar 1: Reinforcing Financial Sector Stability
    • The Financial Services Authority (OJK) Board of Commissioners has been appointed in
        accordance with the Indonesia Financial Services Authority Law and the Financial Services
        Authority (OJK) Preparation Team has prepared a comprehensive organizational plan.
    • The Ministry of Finance, Bank Indonesia and Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) have
        signed a memorandum of understanding on information sharing and coordination in order to
        improve crisis prevention and management.
    • The Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) Board of Commissioners has issued a directive to
        adopt a differential premium rate system.

Pillar 2: Promoting Financial Sector Diversification
    • The Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (Bapepam-LK) has
        strengthened the protection of investors through separation of accounts of brokers and
        investors under Regulation No. V.D.3.
    • The Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (Bapepam-LK) has
        prepared a draft revised regulation to strengthen the financial soundness of insurance
        companies and improve corporate governance, which has been issued under a Minister of
        Finance Regulation (PMK No. 53/2012).

Pillar 3: Enhancing Financial Inclusion
    • National Team on Accelerating Poverty Alleviation (TNP2K): (i) has issued the Indonesia
        National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, including the preliminary action plan; and (ii) has
        implemented a pilot project to provide conditional cash transfers through bank saving accounts
        for beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program (PKH).
    • Bank Indonesia has prepared recommendations for revised guidelines for “no frills” savings
        accounts (Tabunganku).
    • The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) Policy Committee on the People’s
        Business Credit Program (KUR) has prepared standard operating procedures that outline
        mechanisms for supervision of the program.
                                                37
Pillar 4: Supporting Investment Climate Regulatory Reform
    • The Committee on the Masterplan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia Economic
        Development 2011-2015 (MP3EI) has issued an action plan for priority regulatory reforms
        envisioned under such masterplan.
    • The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) has prepared recommendations for
        the establishment of a small claims court through revisions to the relevant legal framework.


          Pillar 1: Reinforcing Financial Sector Stability

 Reforming the financial sector supervisory framework

 121. Indonesian authorities are in the process of carrying out a number of measures
 necessary to implement the OJK Law. It is critical that these are completed smoothly and on a
 timely basis so that the new institution can begin operations by January 2013. This process needs
 to be managed carefully to ensure effective financial sector supervision during the transition and
 at a time of increased market turbulence. To support this transition the MOF and Bank Indonesia
 appointed a Joint Preparation Team, mandated with developing an organizational structure and
 institutional development plan that lays the foundation for long term effective financial market
 regulation, supervision and development. Development of the plan as soon as possible was
 considered essential so that OJK can become functional by 2013 in accordance with the timeline
 set forth in the Law.

 122. Another critical and highly time-sensitive task has been for the Government to
 select the members of the Board of Commissioners of OJK. It is essential that the Board
 members be highly qualified and collectively have the full set of skills to manage the institution.
 This is considered the critical first step to putting OJK on a strong path for development and to
 achieve its mission as the integrated financial sector regulator. Thus, the reform supported by the
 operation is for the GOI to appoint the Financial Services Authority (OJK) Board of
 Commissioners in accordance with the Indonesia Financial Services Authority Law (Chapter IV,
 Article 11) and for the OJK Preparation Team to prepare a comprehensive organizational plan.
 Both of these actions have been completed. The BOC was established and took up operations in
 July 2012 and the Joint Preparation Team submitted the organization structure to the Minister of
 Finance.

 Strengthening the legal and institutional framework for financial crisis preparedness

 123. As mentioned in Section III above, the Government has taken a number of steps to
 reinforce Indonesia’s financial sector stability. First, the OJK Law establishes a high level
 Financial System Stability Coordination Forum which is tasked with maintenance of stability.
 Second, the authorities have prepared a National Crisis Management Protocol (CMP) which aims
 to define the division of tasks and responsibilities of the members, the scope of coordination
 between these agencies and the information sharing mechanisms. It consists of agency-level
 regulations by Bank Indonesia and the MOF (Debt Management, Fiscal Policy Office, and
 Bapepam-LK) to further elaborate on agency-level systemic monitoring and surveillance.




                                                 38
124. The next substantive challenge in developing an effective crisis management
framework for Indonesia is to put in place improved information sharing and coordination
mechanisms among the financial sector authorities through a revised MOU. Through mid-
2012, the authorities relied on an MOU from 2010 did not take into account the changes made as
a result of the OJK Law that relate to crisis preparedness. Therefore, the authorities have
developed a revised draft that allows for improved coordination and information exchange at a
time of crisis. The reform supported under this operation is that the Ministry of Finance, Bank
Indonesia, and Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) have signed an MOU on information
sharing and coordination in order to improve crisis prevention and management. This is
considered a major step toward improving the overall crisis management framework A newly
signed and strengthened MOU will fill a critical gap in the financial sector legal framework,
noted as a vulnerability in the recent FSAP, endorsing the current informal arrangements and
enabling more effective information sharing and coordination among the authorities, as is
required by the OJK Law. Ultimately it is envisioned that the decision making authority would
be clarified in the FSSN Law or other law to be developing in coming years.

125. The agreement on a revised MOU thus represents a critical interim measure to
strengthen crisis preparedness. To that end, the GOI has made extensive efforts to incorporate
good international practices into the MOU and adapt those principles to the extent possible to the
Indonesian political and legal context. In support, in April 2012, the Bank, as well as other
development partners including the IMF and ADB, provided input on the draft MOU.

Enhancing the strength of the deposit insurance scheme

126. The Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) plays a key role in financial
system crisis prevention and resolution. Since its establishment in 2004, LPS has shown good
performance in developing and maintaining an effective deposit insurance program. It has
successfully completed settlement of a few bank closures in 2004 and 2008 and managed the
rescue process of a failed bank in 2008.

127. In recent years, LPS has taken steps to improve the deposit insurance program by
reducing moral hazards embedded in the current deposit insurance program and better
aligning the current insurance premium rate to reflect the risk profiles of banks. Currently,
Indonesia imposes a system of a single non risk based premium. As of this year, the maximum
amount that LPS guarantees is IDR 2 billion (an increase as a response to global crisis in 2009),
with 49 percent total amount of deposits and 99.9 percent of all depositor accounts currently
being guaranteed as of March 2012. Given the substantial increase in coverage from IDR 100
million to IDR 2 billion, consideration of this policy is highly relevant and timely. Further, this
policy option is consistent with FSAP findings which recommended that LPS’s approach would
benefit from a more transparent, market-based ceiling rate on insured deposits, and further,
suggested the measure of a differentiated cap for different bank structures (i.e. rural vs. urban).
Research in the last decade also indicates that many countries are moving towards making these
deposit insurance premias sensitive to the risk exposure of the bank. Thus, the reform supported
by this operation is that the LPS Board of Commissioners issues a directive to adopt a
differential premium rate system. This reform has been completed. The Board of Commissioners
of LPS has taken the decision to adopt the new system, as stated in its 2012 Annual Plan. The
directive is supported by a sound implementation and capacity building plan for assessing bank
risk. In 2012 LPS began preparation work which includes efforts to enhance the capacity of LPS
to assess bank performance and risk.
                                                39
Expected outcomes

128.      The expected result from this policy area will be improved financial system
stability. This will include (i) strengthened capacity of financial sector authorities to monitor,
prevent, and manage a financial crisis through improved crisis management protocols and a
mechanism for information sharing and decision making; (ii) more effective supervision
consistent with good international practices; and (iii) a more effective and financially sustainable
deposit insurance system. Although external risks such as contagion from the Eurozone crisis or
reduction in global demand could potentially affect Indonesia’s financial sector and hence the
outcomes of this operation, the goal is to maintain relative financial sector stability and
Indonesia’s sound financial sector indicators through improved financial sector stability
arrangements. The selected outcome indicators are maintenance of current levels of CAR and
NPL, which would reflect a high degree of stability in the banking sector. Maintaining these
levels is considered to be a quite ambitious target particularly given the unresolved debt crisis in
Greece and other parts of the Eurozone through September 2012. To date, the impact of these
crises has been relatively limited on Indonesia; however, the threat of continued global economic
downturn and greater risk aversion in emerging markets could negatively affect the Indonesia
financial sector. In addition, the FSAP analysis of the Indonesian banking sector indicated that
credit risk is still the main source of risk for banks. Further, the NPL ratio of Indonesian banks is
at its lowest level since 1997/8 crisis, hence maintaining it at this level will be an achievement.
Correspondingly, maintenance of the high CAR will be important because this reflects the
solvency level of banks, and their continuing ability to finance the growth of the economy.
Outcome indicators are:

        •   Capital adequacy ratio of banks is maintained or stabilized at the current level
            (around +/- 2 percent of 17.6) as of December 2013.

        •   Non-performing loans are stable at around 3.8 percent or less at end 2013.

 Policy Area 1: Reinforcing Financial Sector Stability

 The Financial Services Authority (OJK) Board of Commissioners has been appointed in
 accordance with the Indonesia Financial Services Authority Law and the Financial Services
 Authority (OJK) Preparation Team has prepared a comprehensive organizational plan.
 The Ministry of Finance, Bank Indonesia and Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) have
 signed a memorandum of understanding on information sharing and coordination in order to
 improve crisis prevention and management.
 The Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) Board of Commissioners has issued a directive to
 adopt a differential premium rate system.

         Pillar 2: Promoting Financial Sector Diversification

129. This pillar focuses on a set of priority actions related the capital markets and the
insurance sectors. The actions outlined below address primary recommendations identified in
the FSAP, including the need to improve the corporate governance and transparency of
Indonesia’s capital markets and improve the overall soundness and promote consolidation of the
insurance industry. The next phase of the reform program would potentially include actions
related to auditing and accounting (promoting convergence of Indonesian accounting standards
                                                 40
with IFRS), implementation of IOSCO principles, as well as further efforts to address the
vulnerabilities in the insurance sector.

Strengthening protection of investors and customers in the financial sector

130. To support capital market development, Bapepam-LK’s policy reforms have
focused on strengthening the protection of stock market investors, in particular, the
domestic-based retail investors. In this context, significant improvements have been made with
regard to the disclosure of financial statements, accounting and auditing standards, affiliated
transactions for listed companies and tender offer processes, through issuance of new or revised
regulations and enforcement of regulations. More recently, Bapepam-LK has been pursuing
improvement of governance practices for managing investor funds by brokers.

131. Bapepam-LK already requires a separation between assets of brokers and investors;
however, in practice the brokers still have influence over the use of investors’ fund because
this fund is still kept under the broker’s name in custodian banks. There are concerns that
brokers may illicitly use investors’ funds to trade stock for their own profit. In response,
Bapepam-LK issued regulation V.D.3 on 28 December 2010. The regulation requires each
investor to have a single investor ID and a separation of the investor and broker accounts. The
reform supported by this DPL is the satisfactory implementation of the regulation as evidenced
by (i) the number of investors that have opened separated bank accounts and (ii) sufficient
authority and measures taken to monitor the implementation. The implementation of this
regulation will allow the investors to better monitor their securities portfolio and allow the
authorities to know the number of investors in the capital market. In addition, this regulation will
also improve risk management practices of the stock brokers. The Single ID initiative was
completed in 2011 and according to the KSEI (the central custodian) there are now around
260,000 investors with Single IDs. As a follow up, the regulation also requires that investors,
who have active accounts and for whom this is mandatory, open a separate bank account
immediately.

Enhancing soundness and capacity of the insurance sector

132. In recent years, Bapepam-LK has been strengthening regulations to measure
financial soundness of insurance companies. In 2003, the insurance authority introduced the
use of risk based capital mandatory calculation and reporting for insurance companies as a
measure of the solvability ratio. This was formalized through the issuance of Minister of Finance
decree PMK No 424 in 2003. Indonesia is among the first countries in the region to adopt such a
measure. During almost a decade of enforcement of this regulation, the insurance market has
grown strongly and there is a need to strengthen this regulation to make it more relevant to
current market practices and to incorporate lessons learnt during this time. Some specific factors
need to be addressed such as: (i) the growth of investment-linked products; (ii) the emergence of
investment opportunities in certain asset classes which are not recognized as admitable assets;
(iii) incidents of investment made in affiliated parties securities; and (iv) a lack of clear
supervisory remedial actions for inability to meet the targeted solvability ratio. This DPL
supports the issuance of a revised regulation (PMK No. 53/2012) to strengthen the financial
soundness of insurance companies and improve corporate governance of the insurance sector.
The regulation accomplishes this by improving the measure of risk-based capital by: (i) requiring
higher capital for companies offering investment products; (ii) increasing the type of investible
assets; (iii) introducing limitations on business operations and corporate actions for companies

                                                41
unable to meet the minimum capital requirements; and (iv) clarifying limitations of investment
of affiliated parties. This action is complete and the regulation will be effective in January 2013.

Expected outcomes

133. The expected result from this policy area will be increased financial sector
diversification through development of non-bank financial institutions. This will include: (i)
improved corporate governance of the capital markets; and (ii) increased soundness of the
insurance sector through increase capital requirements. The outcome indicator is:

        •   Increase in the share of NBFIs of total system assets (baseline: 20 percent NBFI).

 Policy Area 2: Diversifying the financial sector

 The Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (Bapepam-LK) has
 strengthened the protection of investors though separation of accounts of brokers and investors
 under Regulation No. V.D.3.
 The Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (Bapepam-LK) has
 prepared a draft revised regulation to strengthen the financial soundness of insurance
 companies and improve corporate governance, which has been issued under a Minister of
 Finance Regulation (PMK No. 53/2012).

         Pillar 3: Enhancing Financial Inclusion

Promoting policy coordination and developing innovative financial products targeted to the
poor

134. In recent years, the Government has launched major initiatives on a number of
fronts to promote financial inclusion, including the development of the first National
Strategy for Financial Inclusion. The strategy reflects a growing recognition that enhancing
access to financial services for low-income households and MSMEs in Indonesia is imperative in
order to help the poor better manage their financial needs, build their assets, participate in
economic activities, and mitigate risks. The Vice President’s Office (TNP2K) and Bank
Indonesia have led the development of the strategy drawing on inputs from Bapepam-LK,
Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and other partners. Thus, the reform to be supported in this
area is the GOI’s issuance of the Indonesia Financial Inclusion Strategy, including the
preliminary action plan. The goal of this action is to help enhance the prospect of all individuals,
especially the underserved, to access to savings, credit, insurance, and transaction and payment
services on a sustainable basis. The action is considered a major achievement not only because
the strategy brings together various financial inclusion initiatives under one umbrella, but also
because it promotes coordination among disparate Government agencies and institutions in this
challenging reform area. The strategy was widely disseminated in June at the First ASEAN
Financial Inclusion week, hosted by the GOI and Bank Indonesia in June 2012.

135. As part of this effort and in order to demonstrate its commitment to the program,
TNP2K has also implemented several “quick win” measures under the National Strategy
for Financial Inclusion. In particular, it has launched a major initiative to distribute conditional
cash transfers through bank accounts. The Government first launched the conditional cash
transfer program (Program Keluarga Harapan, PKH) in 2007. PKH assistance is transferred

                                                    42
when families obtain preventive basic health and nutrition services, and send their children to
school. The program reached around 1,116,000 poor households at the end of 2011 and is
preparing for further expansion. In 2012, the Government plans to add another 584,000 new poor
households into the program. Out of those, 300,000 will be targeted to receive assistance
transfers through their bank account as part of this pilot, thus promoting a savings culture and
enhancing access to finance for a traditionally underserved segment of the population. Thus, the
FIRM DPL supports TNP2K to implement this quick win pilot project to provide conditional
cash transfers through bank savings accounts for beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer
Program (PKH). This action was planned for inclusion in DPL9 and was completed during the
year as planned by TNP2K. It is considered an important new measure and step toward
promoting an entry point for the poor to the formal financial system.

136.     In recent years, Bank Indonesia has been developing a range of new products
targeted to the poor and underserved. As a result of this initiative, it has developed
Tabunganku as a “no frills” savings account with no administration fee and a low opening and
minimum balance. Along with 70 commercial banks and more than 1,000 Sharia/rural banks,
Bank Indonesia is intending to reach potential bankable clients to engage and use financial
services offered by the current banking sector branch network (be that commercial, Sharia, or
rural bank network). The reform supported by the FIRM DPL is for Bank Indonesia to issue
recommendations for revised guidelines for Tabunganku. The form of the instruction will depend
on discussions with the banking industry as well. The product serves as an important entry point
to the financial system for the unbanked due. Many of the unbanked demonstrate a high demand
for savings products but have lacked of affordable savings products prior to the launch of
Tabunganku.

137. A 2010 evaluation of the Indonesia’s flagship SME credit program (KUR) found
that the program had helped increase access to credit to micro, small and medium
enterprises. Despite this and other achievements, there remains scope for improving the
effectiveness of the program through operational and policy changes, especially since the
Government has decided to significantly scale up the program. The KUR Policy Committee at
CMEA has taken a number of steps to reform the program to make it more responsive to the
financing needs of target enterprises. These reforms include increasing the number of
participating banks, increasing the maximum loan size, extending the loan tenor, and increasing
guarantee coverage for four prioritized sectors (agriculture, fishery and maritime, forestry and
small industry). In addition, the Government is also promoting the participation of provincial
governments in the implementation of the KUR program.

138. Going forward, an important task is to strengthen the KUR monitoring and
evaluation systems. The reform supported by the FIRM DPL is the preparation of standard
operating procedures by the KUR Policy Committee at the CMEA that outline mechanisms for
supervision of the KUR program. This is considered crucial to the effectiveness of the program
as it will provide continuous feedback to the KUR Policy Committee on implementation
challenges and take more timely and informed action to deal with policy concerns. This was an
action originally envisioned under DPL 9. The Bank has been providing related technical
assistance to CMEA on this issue.




                                              43
Expected outcomes

139. The expected result from this policy area will be enhanced financial inclusion for
underserved groups and the poor. This will be measured by: (i) evidence that Indonesia has in
place a comprehensive, inter-ministerial strategy and action plan to promote financial inclusion
to the poor; and (ii) an increased percentage of underserved households and businesses accessing
saving and credit products. The Government’s financial inclusion strategy also includes a set of
actions designed to increase access to financial services for migrant workers. Given that
approximately 80 percent of these workers are women in Indonesia, it is expected that this group
of beneficiaries will benefit from the implementation of the strategy. Outcome indicators for this
pillar are:

        •   The number of households that have received PKH transfers through bank accounts
            is 1.4 million as of end-2013.

        •   The annual disbursement of the KUR program to micro and small enterprises is IDR
            25 trillion (USD 2.6 billion) as of end-2013.

 Policy Area 3: Promoting Financial Inclusion

 National Team on Accelerating Poverty Alleviation (TNP2K): (i) has issued the Indonesia
 National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, including the preliminary action plan; and (ii) has
 implemented a pilot project to provide conditional cash transfers through bank saving accounts
 for beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program (PKH).
 Bank Indonesia has prepared recommendations for revised guidelines for “no frills” savings
 accounts (Tabunganku).
 The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) Policy Committee on the People’s
 Business Credit Program (KUR) has prepared standard operating procedures that outline
 mechanisms for supervision of the program.

         Pillar 4: Supporting Investment Climate Regulatory Reform

140. Despite its strong economic performance, Indonesia faces many challenges that stifle
private sector development. Improving economic competitiveness by creating a healthier
business climate is one of Indonesia’s national priorities for 2010-2014 as stated by the
Government in its RPJMN. Making it easier to do business also helps promote urbanization,
another of Indonesia’s key national development objectives. Business reforms can facilitate
business start up, encourage investments, and increase employment across the country.

141. Since 2003, through the DPL series, the Bank has supported the GOI’s efforts to
reform the investment climate. The investment climate pillar of DPLs 1-4 sought to improve
investment climate through several important entry areas, including regulatory reform, tax,
customs and trade reform, and by strengthening small businesses. DPLs 5-6 focused on reducing
uncertainties for investors by continuing to support reforms through revision of the investment
negative list, implementation of one-stop shops for investment and roll out of the Indonesia
National Single Window for trade. The series also helped strengthen tax administration through
regulatory reforms aimed at reducing client costs. DPLs 7 and 8 built on these areas, continuing
support for regulatory reform, INSW, business licensing and also financial sector reforms.
Overall, the DPLs contributed to improving certainty in the investment climate, reducing barriers

                                               44
to entry, and enhancing access to finance (see Annex 3 for overall results of the DPL series). The
Bank has closely collaborated with IFC in this area in its analytical work and technical assistance
programs.

142. Against this background, the GOI has requested that the FIRM DPL continue to
support policy and institutional reforms related to improving the investment climate. The
request reflects the view of senior officials that many of the challenges related to investment
climate reform relate to policy coordination across a number of institutions and their confidence
that the DPL can help bolster reforms in this area. While progress in certain areas of investment
climate reform has proved challenging, this remains an area of critical importance to the GOI’s
overall development goals.

143. Policy actions for this pillar have been designed as measures that will help improve
the overall business environment. The operation focuses in two critical areas: (i) improving
policy coordination and regulatory certainty, and (ii) setting up institutional measures to improve
contract enforcement. In addition, in 2012 the Bank is also supporting other aspects of
investment climate reform through its other DPL programs (See Section I), with Connectivity
DPL focusing on critical infrastructure policy issue and INSTANSI DPL focusing on public
financial management. As a whole, these three DPL mutually reinforce each other, working to
address some of the major constraints to the investment climate. The next FIRM DPL will
include an expanded investment climate component that builds on this set of actions.

Improving investment climate regulatory reform

144. In recent years, policy coordination across ministries and institutions has become a
primary obstacle to investment climate regulatory reform. This has become apparent as the
Government has accelerated it efforts to address the constraints identified in a number of recent
enterprise and business surveys, including the Doing Business report. As a crucial first step in
overcoming coordination issues in this area, the GOI has established a Regulatory Review
Committee specifically for the MP3EI, tasked with improving policy coordination and
developing the priority reforms to be addressed in 2012. The Committee has taken the first step
in the reform process by identifying a set of planned regulatory reforms to be carried out in the
medium-term by a wide range of institutions. The regulations relate to special planning, special
economic zones, and business licensing, among other reform areas. As part of this process, the
Committee has identified more than 28 issues related to business licensing and regulations that
affect implementation of the MP3EI projects. This DPL supports the development and issuance
of an MP3EI regulatory reform action plan, which includes the set of laws and regulations that
should be amended in order to help implement the Government’s MP3EI investment and growth
targets. In March 2012 the GOI completed this key action.

Improving contract enforcement

145. Given the importance of contract enforcement to the overall business climate by
creating more certainty in the judicial system to resolve commercial disputes, the GOI has
taken a number of important steps to improve efficiency in this area in recent years. This
has included efforts to improve contract enforcement potentially through the establishment of a
small claims court. Small claims courts typically provide streamlined procedures for the
resolution of suits for small sums where the cost of a full-blown lawsuit is often prohibitive.
They offer the possibility of reducing costs to the Government and to the parties while at the

                                                45
same time enhancing access to justice. The experience with small claims courts in developed
countries has become essential to a growing consumer economy. In developing countries, small
claims courts can provide effective redress in a context where a functioning legal and judicial
system for resolving disputes is often lacking.

146. Modifying the structure of judiciary procedure to allow for small claims courts and
specialized commercial courts is one of the types of reform of contract enforcement that
have proven successful. Several countries with small-claims courts—such as Japan, the United
Kingdom, and New Zealand—recently increased the maximum claim eligible for hearing at the
court. In other countries, such as Botswana and India, local courts deal with small cases and pass
disputes concerning larger amounts to the higher courts. Where the judiciary is least developed,
as in Angola, Mozambique, and Nepal, specialized courts are premature. Instead, reformers
introduce proceedings within general jurisdiction courts or work with specialized judges in the
general court, with a focus on the execution of judgments.

147. In order to address this issue, in recent years GOI partnered with the Government
of Korea for a technical assistance and capacity building program under the APEC-Ease of
Doing Business Action Plan (2010-2015) and associated exchange programs. Through this
project, CMEA, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, the National Law Development
Agency, and the Government of Korea (Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade) have conducted several diagnostic studies on how to improve Indonesia’s contract
enforcement regime. The studies focused on the following areas:

        •   Amending the Civil Procedure Law;

        •   Establishing a small claims court;

        •   Installing an electronic court system; and

        •   Providing guidelines for attorneys’ fee and to reform the attorney code of ethics, etc.

148. Building on these recent efforts, this DPL will support improved contract
enforcement in Indonesia. The reform supported by this operation is for CMEA to prepare
recommendations for establishment of a small claims court through revisions of the relevant
legal framework. This will include measures to improve contract enforcement more broadly as
outlined above. The content and recommendations of the analysis were discussed in June 2012
during a GOI Conference on Small Claims Courts and related Civil Procedure Law amendments.
There is a now consensus that it is important for Indonesia to establish a small claim court not
only to improve the ease of doing business, but also to provide more efficient and affordable
legal services for businesses and individuals and to help reduce the backlog of cases faced by the
court system in Indonesia.

Expected outcomes

149. The expected result from this pillar will be an improved investment climate as
demonstrated by: (i) improved policy coordination for investment climate regulatory reform,
and (ii) more efficient contract enforcement. While the formal revision of the Civil Procedure
Law is likely to be carried out only beyond the life of the project, other measures to improve
contract enforcement are expected to take place in the coming year. The results will be measured
by:
                                                46
        •   The number of days to enforce a contract has been reduced to 500 according to
            Doing Business as of end-2013.

  Policy Area 4: Promoting Investment climate regulatory reform

  The Committee on the Masterplan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia Economic
  Development 2011-2025 (MP3EI) has issued an action plan for priority regulatory reforms
  envisioned under such masterplan.
  The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) has prepared recommendations for
  the establishment of a small claims court through revisions to the relevant legal framework.

         Future operations

150. Future operations would build on the current operation and continue to support the
GOI’s medium-term reform program. The box below presents indicative areas (Box 3).

                   Box 3: Indicative Areas of Reform for Subsequent DPL


Below are indicative areas of reform for a subsequent DPL.

Pillar 1: Reinforcing Financial Sector Stability
    • Enhance the legal protection for supervisors and the framework for decision making and
        resolution of a financial crisis through an effective financial sector safety net law or
        amendments to other relevant laws (i.e. the central bank, capital markets and insurance
        laws.)
    • Amend the central bank, capital markets, and insurance laws to be consistent with the
        new supervisory framework and OJK.
    • Test the National Crisis Management Protocol system through a crisis simulation
        exercise and address weaknesses or gaps as necessary.
    • Increase reserve funds of the LPS to meet the level required by the LPS law.

Pillar 2: Promoting Financial Sector Diversification
    • Prepare long-term supervisory remedial action plan for large/systemically important
        insurance companies.
    • Passing of a Financial Reporting Act providing for the establishment of a Financial
        Reporting Council responsible for issuing accounting standards and related
        pronouncements and monitoring and enforcing applicable accounting standards through
        financial statement and quality assurance review.

Pillar 3: Enhancing Financial Inclusion
    • Implement agency level action plans under the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion.
    • Enact an appropriate legal framework for non-bank/non-cooperative microfinance
        institutions through implementation of the of Joint Decree (SKB) of the Coordinating
        Ministry for Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, the Ministry of
        Home Affairs, OJK, and Bank Indonesia.
    • Issue regulations for facilitating micro insurance development.


                                               47
Pillar 4: Supporting Investment Climate Regulatory Reform
    • Establish an effective high level policy committee on Improving the Ease of Doing
        Business.
    • Implement the small claims court and further streamlining contract enforcement.
    • Following a review of the online investment licensing system (SPIPISE), identify
        implementation plan for reforms which will reduce the cost of starting a business.

              VI.    OPERATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

       A. Participatory Processes and Consultations

151. Democratic consolidation and decentralization of authority in Indonesia have
translated into a political preference for wide buy-in and participatory, consensus-building
approaches to decision-making, not only in terms of regulatory reforms but also planning
and budgeting processes. While this decentralization is believed to have slowed or blunted
some reform measures, it is viewed as mitigating against radicalism, helping to steadily improve
public participation, and contributing to more democratic, accountable, professional and
responsive governance. This commitment has been formalized and endorsed through several
regulations (e.g. Law No. 25/2004 on National Development Planning and Joint Ministerial
Decree 2006 and 2007 on Musrenbang), including those institutionalizing the creation of multi-
stakeholder consultation forums-Musrenbang (Musyawarah Rencana Pembangunan) at all levels,
concerning several time frames. Musrenbang is the principal process for negotiating, reconciling
and harmonizing differences between the Government and non-government stakeholders, and
reaching collective consensus on development priorities, including regulatory reforms and the
2012 budget. While challenges still remain, the instrument is being increasingly adopted at all
government levels.

152. The policy actions supported under the FIRM DPL have been subject to extensive
consultations. The supported policy actions are drawn largely from the Government’s overall
development program, which has been subject to wide public consultations. For example, for the
financial sector, the reforms supported have been articulated as part of the Government’s own
medium-term finance sector development goals, including the emphasis on maintaining financial
sector stability and improving efficiency and access. Specifically, all new regulations issued by
Bapepam-LK, included those supported under the loan related to insurance and capital markets,
have been shared with the public and industry associations (life insurance companies, etc) have
been invited to comment before finalization. In addition, the OJK Law, passed by the Indonesian
Parliament in October 2011, also was widely debated by the public for nearly a decade. The DPL
supports measures to improve financial sector stability, following that decision of the
Government, as well as implementation of the Bapepam-LK Master Plan for Capital Markets and
NBFI Development, and the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion. The development of the
Strategy involved a participatory process that included wide private sector consultations on
proposed reforms, workshops, and pilot projects directly involving underserved populations. In
addition, the content of the Strategy was disseminated widely and discussed extensively at the
First ASEAN Financial Inclusion Week in June 2012.

153. More broadly, the operation supports the Government’s RPJM and the Masterplan
for Economic Acceleration. Both of these plans identify investment climate regulatory reforms
as key elements of its strategy and have benefitted from extensive public consultations.
                                               48
       B. Monitoring and Evaluation

154. CMEA and the MOF are the main counterpart agencies for the Bank and are
responsible for the overall implementation of the FIRM DPL program. The implementation
of the policy actions set forth in the policy matrix has involved technical discussions with these
institutions as well as other implementing institutions such as Bank Indonesia, TNP2K and LPS.

155. A results framework with specific outcome indicators has been prepared to monitor
impact of the operation (Annex 2). The results framework sets out expected outcomes in each
of the four pillars which will be monitored by the Bank team jointly with the GOI counterparts to
assess whether the reforms have achieved or contributed to achieving the desired results. The
indicative triggers that are outlined will be monitored and used to identify the policy actions in
any subsequent DPL.

       C. Environmental, Poverty, and Social Aspects

Poverty and social aspects

156. The proposed policy actions under this operation are expected to have positive social
effects, by helping to create an overall favorable economic environment for growth and
poverty reduction and by supporting specific measures targeted toward the poor and
vulnerable groups. Prior actions to improve financial sector stability, diversification and the
investment climate are part of a broader GOI effort to create a stable economic environment. In
doing so, it will reduce the level of risk of job loss faced by poor and vulnerable households
during times of crisis. In the past, poor and vulnerable households were hurt by the Asian
Financial Crisis in 1997-1998; formal sector employment rates fell steeply as many households
fell into poverty, so that 23 percent of Indonesia’s population was below the poverty line by
1999 (Box 4). The GOI has made important strides since that time in establishing economic
stability, and the FIRM DPL aims to further bolster these efforts.

157. Under Pillar 1, the prior actions to promote financial system stability are expected
to support the creation of a robust and stable financial system—a prerequisite for
economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. Actions focus on enhancing crisis
preparedness, supporting quality supervision, and promoting a more effective deposit insurance
scheme.

158. Under Pillar 2, the prior actions to support financial sector diversification are
expected to achieve indirect effects on poverty. The efforts to deepen the capital markets and
insurance sectors supported are anticipated to help improve corporate governance in the financial
sector, leading to greater stability, growth and the availability of a wider set of financial products
for all including the poor.

159. Under Pillar 3, the financial inclusion reforms are expected to expand the access to a
full range of financial services for the poor, vulnerable groups and particularly women.
This will be achieved through the implementation of the National Strategy for Financial
Inclusion. Without access to such services, including both credit, savings and insurance products,
poor individuals and small enterprises need to rely on their personal wealth or internal resources
to invest in their education, become entrepreneurs or take advantage of promising growing
opportunities. The importance of access to financial services to the poor is clearly reflected in the
Government’s national poverty reduction strategy, which includes a cluster of programs that aim
                                                49
to stimulate job opportunities for poor and vulnerable households by encouraging small and
micro-entrepreneurs. The largest of these programs is the KUR program, which is specifically
supported by Pillar 3. KUR provides small credits to microenterprises, and for most of these
enterprises, the increase of income from additional working capital has made them less prone to
economic shocks, and thus more resilient to falling into poverty.

160. Lastly, under Pillar 4, the investment climate reforms are expected to help create
equal opportunities for businesses and improve the overall ease of doing business, thereby
promoting job creation and inclusive growth. The benefits of the specific actions relating to
enhancing policy coordination under MP3EI and supporting the development of a more effective
contract enforcement system are expected to be realized in the medium-term.

                      Box 4: Recent Trends in Poverty and Social Assistance


During the past decade, overall poverty fell continuously, with the exception of an increase
in 2006 concomitant with high food and fuel prices. The rate of poverty reduction was
relatively slow, from 18.3 percent of the population in 2001 to 13.3 percent by 2010. 3 In addition,
the national consumption poverty line is relatively low, at about PPP$1.20. At PPP$2.00 the
poverty rate would be around 50 percent. The Government has continued to build upon social
assistance programs first established in response to the Asian Financial Crisis, expanding
coverage of both populations and risks. 4
Poverty reduction has been driven by falling poverty in both urban and rural areas, with
the decline being generally similar in both areas. Comparisons are sensitive to start and end
dates, but between 2002 and 2010, both rates fall by about 4.5 percentage points, from 14.4 to 9.9
percent for urban areas, and 21.1 to 16.6 percent for rural ones. The rate of reduction was faster in
urban areas in the first half of the decade, but faster in rural areas in the second half.
Poverty outcomes for males and females in Indonesia have been nearly identical to each
other. The other gender dimension is head of household. When comparing female-headed
household (FHH) poverty rates to those of male-headed households (MHH) the choice of start and
end dates for calculations is very influential. In general, poverty fell for both FHH and MHH
between the beginning and the end of the decade, but while the poverty rate for MHH maintained
a steady decline (except for 2006), that for FHH fluctuated considerably, at least in the first half of
the decade. In 2010, 87 percent of poor females lived in a MHH.
There are a number of possible reasons why trends in FHH and MHH poverty rates may
differ. One key driver is likely to be the risks each group faces and the coping mechanisms they
have available or adopt. FHH may well face either a different set of risks to household income and
consumption, or differing degrees of exposure to common risks. Similarly, FHHs may have
recourse to different coping mechanisms than MHHs, or have different access to common
mechanisms. The significant expansion of social assistance programs and coverage in 2005-06,
which favored FHH, 5 may have contributed to the reduction in FHH poverty volatility seen in the
second half of the decade.

Environmental aspects

161. The policy reforms supported by the DPL program are not expected to have
significant environmental effects. The DPL reforms are geared primarily toward financial and
private sectors where few environmental issues are anticipated to arise and several general
improvements in transparency and regulatory consistency could lead to positive environmental
impacts in the longer term. For Pillars 1-3 related to the financial sector, the DPL is not expected
to have any environmental impact. For Pillar 4 related to the investment climate, the DPL policy
actions support policy coordination for regulatory reforms that benefit the investment climate.
The actual implementation of policy reform actions or investments such as special economic
zones that would be done subsequently in further operations would need to be reviewed in more
detail to ascertain their environmental effects. Annex 5 provides additional details of the
environmental review.

       D. Fiduciary Aspects, Disbursement and Auditing

162. Public financial management is a central policy area for the GOI that is supported
by the Bank’s ongoing DPL series. The Fiduciary Assessment for Indonesia has been carried
out and the Fiduciary Risk is rated as Moderate. This discussion and the conclusions therein are
appropriate for the proposed FIRM DPL.

163. In summary, significant strides have been made in recent years in the way
Indonesia’s public finances are managed and in increasing transparency and independent
oversight. In the last three years, progress has been made in the area of budget execution, with
the development of a unified budget and a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to strengthen the
comprehensiveness and control over spending and cash management. In addition, there have
been improvements in the coverage of fiscal accounts, accounting practices, payroll, internal
controls and fiscal risk management. Notably, the 2009 audit report was the first to achieve a
qualified audit opinion, as opposed to a disclaimer, with around 40 percent of ministries and
agencies achieving unqualified audit opinions. However, improvements are required in several
areas including refinement in performance-based budgeting, strengthening internal and external
audit, improving spending outturns. Weaknesses in financial management and accountability
                                                51
continue to be gradually addressed through the Government’s PFM reform program. The
Government’s PFM reform program is supported by the World Bank through the ongoing DPL
series, including the INSTANSI DPL currently in preparation which specifically supports further
public financial management reform. The GFMRAP project and other initiatives by development
partners add weight to PFM development. Furthermore, the Government has also demonstrated
increased focus on budget transparency by publishing the annual budget in a timely manner,
through the MoF website.

164. The Borrower is the Republic of Indonesia and this operation is a single-tranche
IBRD loan of USD 100 million. The loan will be made available upon loan effectiveness, as the
Bank is satisfied with the progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program and
with the adequacy of the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework. The Government has
confirmed that Indonesia will borrow this amount as a Variable Spread Loan (VSL) in US dollar
currency with an annuity repayment schedule linked to commitments.

165. The loan disbursement will follow the standard Bank procedures for Development
Policy Lending. The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the
borrower at Bank Indonesia that forms part of Indonesia’s official foreign exchange reserves.
The equivalent rupiah amount will immediately be transferred to the General Operational
Treasury (SBUN) account of the borrower that is used to finance budget expenditures, as the
loan is intended to be used to support the general Government budget. The Borrower, within 30
days, will provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer has been completed, and
provide to the Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters, including the
exchange rate of the conversion from US dollars to rupiah, that the Bank may reasonably
request. Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the borrower is required to comply
with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with Bank loan
proceeds, as defined in Schedule 1 to the loan agreement. If any portion of the loan is used to
finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the loan agreement, the Bank has the right to
require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund the amount equal to such
payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank will be cancelled from the loan.

166. The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory.
The country is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia
was last subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy in
2002. That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in
the audit arrangements of Bank Indonesia. The main recommendations have been implemented,
including the establishment of an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the
publication of Bank Indonesia’s audited financial statements. Audited financial statements for
Bank Indonesia for 2011 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by the BPK contained
an unqualified opinion. Given that the foreign exchange environment does not present a
significant risk, a separate annual audit will not be needed for this operation.

       E. Risks

167. Continued strong performance by the Government on its reform agenda and the
achievement of its medium-term objectives are subject to several risks. These can be broken
down into three main categories: institutional and political risks, fiduciary risks, and external
risks.

                                               52
Institutional and political risks

168. There is a risk that attention of key financial sector decision makers may be focused
on establishment of OJK rather than the medium-term reform agenda. In October 2011, the
Indonesian Parliament passed a new law that calls for creation of the Indonesia Financial
Services Authority. Establishing OJK is a major undertaking, involving all the top financial
sector authorities in Indonesia. Given that the attention of key decision makers will be focused
on this important task, there is a risk of delays in implementing other medium-term reform
measures which are supported under this operation. In addition, this focus on the transition and
institutional development of OJK could also result in weaker banking supervision capacity and
crisis preparedness during the transition period. Given the current international financial market
volatility, weakening oversight of the banking sector, even temporarily, could have adverse
consequences. In order to mitigate these risks, the Government has taken important steps to
ensure a smooth transition process that protects Indonesia’s current supervisory capacity, to the
extent possible, through adequate preparation and by drawing on international experiences. It has
also emphasized the importance of continuing to implement its medium-term reform program,
drawing on technical expertise of various partners, and focusing on the highest priority measures.

169. Inconsistent policy making on important investment climate issues could potentially
disrupt the Government’s achievement of its medium-term development objectives.
Regulatory certainty is a key driver of investment, as firms need to rely on a consistent policy
environment in order make decisions on whether to invest or expand their businesses. As such, it
is critical that the Government ensure a consistent policy environment if Indonesia is to meet its
medium-term economic development and poverty reduction goals. A key challenge in this area is
policy coordination among various Government agencies. In the last year, however, recent policy
announcements have raised some concerns about the direction of trade and investment policy
making. These measures include, for example, restrictions on imported horticulture products and
new divestment regulations and processing requirements in the mining sector. While the aims of
these policies may originate in the development objectives of promoting domestic productivity,
jobs and growth, their presentation, which has often been changing, highlights coordination and
communication issues. As well as the uncertain effectiveness of these policies to meet the stated
objectives, there is concern that the expansion of such policies could weaken the confidence of
investors in the domestic economic outlook.

170. The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities
may create a challenge in coordinating and implementing the reform efforts. Many of the
key elements of the financial and investment climate reform agenda by nature involve multiple
institutions and ministries. As a result, supporting policy coordination can be one of the most
difficult elements to achieve in the reform program. The risk that this will create delays in
implementing the reform program is partially mitigated by the extensive technical assistance
programs and partnerships that the Bank already has in place with the related ministries. In
addition, the operation also explicitly aims to support coordination among the various institutions
responsible for financial sector and investment climate policy development including: Bank
Indonesia, the Ministry of Finance, LPS, and the TNP2K among others.

Fiduciary risks

171. Highly volatile international oil prices create uncertainty about the Government’s
energy subsidies costs, hampering overall budget spending. The Parliament just approved the

                                                53
revised 2012 Budget which provides for the possibility of increasing subsidized fuel prices, if
international oil prices are 15 percent above the level assumed in the budget over a six-month
period, combined with cash transfers to the poor. This move presents an opportunity to improve
Indonesia’s subsidy policy, but it is still uncertain whether and when the Government will
implement the fuel price hike given it represents a relatively unpopular policy. The budget deficit
could increase to 3 percent of GDP if the approved fuel price hike is not implemented.

172. Challenges remain to improve Indonesia’s public financial management. However,
in recent years Indonesia has made significant strides in the way its public finances are managed
and in increasing transparency and independent oversight. In almost all areas of public financial
management, changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the
momentum has shifted towards implementation of new practices. The Fiduciary Assessment for
Indonesia has been carried out and the fiduciary risk is rated as moderate.

External risks

173. Continued or increased global market volatility or a financial crisis could disrupt
potential to implement reforms in Indonesia both in the financial sector and investment
climate areas. Significant and rapid shifts in market sentiment could result in sudden, large and
potentially disruptive capital outflows while the external accounts, and growth outlook, remain
sensitive to global commodity prices and demand, particularly from China. Changes in market
sentiment may be due to external factors, such as movements in global risk aversion, which
expose Indonesia’s continued economic vulnerabilities. However, there have been significant
improvements in the Indonesian macroeconomic framework in recent years, which have
translated into improved resilience to external shocks. The Government has also developed a
track record in precautionary and proactive measures during the recent global financial turmoil,
which would help limit the impact of turbulence in international markets on Indonesia.
Furthermore, the recent PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012, plus the parallel facilities from
other development partners, explicitly aims to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the face of a
crisis.

                     Annex 3. Results Achieved Through the DPL Series

The FIRM DPL has its origins in the Bank’s decade-long DPL engagement in Indonesia.
This section describes the key results from the investment climate pillars of these operations. In
addition, it provides the key findings from the 2009 PESF DPL DDO, which focused heavily on
the financial sector. In substantive terms, the FIRM DPL reforms represent a continuation of
these programs and engagements. All of the operations below have been complemented by
extensive technical assistance programs of the Bank and other development partners.

   I.      Results Achieved in the first DPL series (DPLs 1 to 4)

Overall results

The first DPL series was envisioned at a time when the country was transitioning both politically
and economically. Politically the country was moving from autocratic rule to democracy while,
economically, the country’s fundamentals were improving markedly as the impact of the Asian
crisis was left behind. In 2003, the country had successfully graduated from its post-crisis IMF
program, growth was strong and inflation down. The timing was right for the Government’s
economic program to shift from a short-term post-crisis stabilization framework to a longer-term
strategic growth and poverty reduction agenda. It was in this context that the DPL was
established to support the Government’s reform agenda in the key areas of: (i) sustaining
macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving the investment climate; (iii) strengthening public
financial management and governance; and later (iv) improving service delivery. Overall, 54
prior actions were enacted, covering a wide range of sub-areas within the four pillars.

Investment Climate pillar

The DPL sought to improve the investment climate through several key entry areas, including
regulatory reform, tax, custom and trade reform, strengthening small businesses and the financial
sector. The Bank’s contribution to the sector was also supported through an on-going dialogue
and technical assistance sponsored by a trust fund, which funded numerous technical assistance
activities to improve or help implement the prior actions.

Although initially slow to pick up momentum, the Government has made strides in
improving the investment environment. Although full implementation of the investment
packages has yet to take place, the results were encouraging—investment rates increased from
below 20 percent of GDP in 2003 to 25 percent in 2007. In 2006, the Government issued three
economic policy packages covering investment climate, infrastructure and financial reform. In
2007, a comprehensive follow-up package was issued detailing 168 specific reform measures to
be carried out. As a result, business perceptions have improved, a study of manufacturing firms
in mid-2007 indicated improvements in VAT refunds, tax-filing processes, informal payments
and faster import and custom clearance. Labor issues and infrastructure have now replaced
consistency of regulation as the key constraint to doing business. Surveys of foreign investors
also show that perceptions of Indonesia are improving. In Japan’s annual JBIC survey of 600
Japanese multinational companies, Indonesia was ranked as the eighth most promising country
for overseas business.

                                               62
Regulatory reform has streamlined procedures and led to an improved legal framework
supportive of the investment climate. According to Doing Business 2008, the time needed to
set up a business has come down significantly from 168 days to 105 days. 6 The Government has
recently streamlined procedures even further—down to 16 days which is on a par with the
OECD average of 15 days. However, implementation, especially at the sub-national level, is still
needed for it to be fully credited. Another key achievement was the passage of the Investment
Law, which clarified previously arbitrary investment rules. The law focuses on equal treatment
of foreign and domestic investments, removes the forced divestment and limited duration of
foreign investment in the old law, lengthens the time horizon to hold land, liberalizes some
immigration procedures and allows for international arbitration. Additionally, an SME policy
package to empower micro, small and medium enterprises was passed in July 2007, with a focus
on their access to finance. These packages have been supported by the business community.

Tax reform has addressed some of the key complaints from the business community.
Reforms in tax administration have halved the time for VAT refunds and, in addition, more than
IDR 10 trillion (roughly USD 1 billion) in outstanding VAT refunds have been settled. New
procedures have been set in place to issue VAT refunds to export companies within set
timeframes. Standard operational procedures for a complaint management system have also been
issued. The Government also issued a decree on tax audit procedures that allows taxpayers to
delay payment of tax assessments from disputed audits, however this only becomes effective on
disputes over 2008 and future assessments, leaving those with current disputes under the old rule.

Bold progress on trade and customs reform has been made with the piloting of Indonesia’s
National Single Window (INSW) and paperless import clearance. The implementation of the
INSW represents one of the country’s most important trade facilitation initiatives. Under a single
window, exporters and importers will no longer be required to apply individually to multiple
agencies, potentially reducing the current 26 days (DB 2008) it takes to import to 15 days. A
pilot is underway in Jakarta’s main port and will be expanded to other ports in preparation for the
establishment of an ASEAN Single Window. Other trade reforms under the DPL sought to
improve the technical capacity of the tariff team in setting and evaluating tariff changes and non-
tariff barriers imposed by line ministries and others.

In strengthening the stability of the financial sector, the DPL supported the
implementation of a sounder financial safety net. At the start of the DPL series there was a
need to reduce the economic distortion and potential moral hazard caused by the existing blanket
guarantee, which had been introduced during the Asian crisis to stem bank runs. To this effect,
the DPL series supported a number of reforms including a deposit insurance scheme,
institutionalization of Bank Indonesia’s role as lender of last resort and establishment of
institutional processes and mechanisms for resolving troubled banks. By the end of DPL 4,
coverage on deposits was reduced from a blanket guarantee in 2003 to IDR 100 million (roughly
USD 10,000) by 2007. Indonesia is one of the few countries in the world that has removed its
blanket guarantee on schedule. In October 2008, in response to the global financial crisis,
Indonesia announced a number of confidence-building measures, including a twenty-fold
increase in the deposit guarantee to IDR 2 billion (about USD 200,000).
6
    The Doing Business indicator of time needed to set up a business was further improved to 60 days in 2009.

                                                                63
   II.     Results Achieved in the second DPL series (DPLs 5 to 6)

Overall results

The second DPL series was presented at a critical juncture for Indonesia, as it was facing
the ramifications and contagion effects of the global financial turmoil in late 2008.
However, Indonesia’s record of prudent fiscal management, previous macroeconomic
performance, and ongoing commitment to the longer term institutional reform agenda, provided
the requisite stability that warrant continued support for Indonesia’s structural and institutional
reform efforts through the second DPL series. Anchored to the FY09-12 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), the second DPL series was in substantive terms a continuation of the first DPL
series (DPLs 1-4), although focusing more on the medium-term institutional and policy reforms
in the three policy pillars: (i) investment climate; (ii) public finance management; and (iii)
poverty alleviation and service delivery. Altogether, 25 prior actions were supported under the
second DPL series under these three policy pillars.

Overall, the second DPL series significantly helped the Government in progressing towards
achieving its medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives. Despite the fact that the
series was terminated one year earlier, significant accomplishments were made in the three
policy pillars. In investment climate, the DPL helped reduce uncertainties for investors to invest
in Indonesia, by continuing to push for reforms through the revision of the investment negative
list, implementation of one-stop shops (PTSP) and rollout of the INSW. It also helped strengthen
the tax administration through key regulatory reforms aimed towards reducing compliance costs,
enhancing taxpayer services and improving the efficiency and equity of the tax administration. In
public finance management, the governance and transparency of public spending was
significantly improved, through various improvements to the budget formulation and execution
systems. In poverty alleviation and service delivery, the necessary groundwork for longer-term
reforms has been laid by institutionalizing a Government system for program evaluation within
Bappenas and initiating the process of establishing a uniform database that will be used by
various implementing agencies to develop poverty program beneficiaries list.

Investment Climate

By mid-2010, investment flows into Indonesia were already on their path to recovery after
the severe slump in 2009. FDI inflows totaled USD 9.3 billion in 2008 according to Bank
Indonesia statistics, but halved in 2009 as the global financial crisis and economic downturn
limited investment flows globally. However, in 2010, FDI inflows increased substantially to over
USD 13 billion, indicating their path to recovery. Evidently, firms were scaling up investments
with the global economic recovery and improved long-term financing conditions. This, together
with the Government’s renewed focus on improving the investment climates in general, helped
boost investment flows to Indonesia.

The Doing Business Survey 2010 indicated an improvement in Indonesia’s overall
investment climate. As of 2009, Indonesia ranked 122 out of 183 countries, up from 129 out of




                                                64
181 countries in 2008. 7 In particular, double-digit jumps were made in the categories of: (i)
registering property, wherein the time to register property was slashed from 39 to 22 days,
thanks to the time limits introduced for standard procedures at the land registry; (ii) protecting
investors, with the strength of investor protection index improved from 5.7 to 6, as disclosure
requirements for related-party transactions were expanded; and (iii) starting a business, wherein
Indonesia’s ranking improved from 171 (near the bottom ranking globally) to 161, with the
number of procedures, time and cost of starting a new business significantly reduced. 8

Various regulatory reforms were introduced to strengthen the tax administration following
the passage of the Tax Administration Law in 2007. Implementing regulations were issued by
the Directorate General of Taxes to support the Tax Administration Law’s effort of striking a
better balance between the rights and obligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials.
These new regulations clarified and provided certainty in the administrative procedures for the
taxpayers to comply with the law, as well as for the tax officials to provide services to the
taxpayers. The DG Taxes has also required the tax offices to report on a quarterly basis the
average time to process taxpayer registration, VAT refunds, tax objections, exemption of
withholding tax on imports, and property tax reliefs. Furthermore, DG Tax decrees were issued
to allow for the roll-out of e-registration and e-filing for taxpayers: (i) allow recognition of
digital signatures for individual taxpayer registration and for filing personal income tax returns;
and (ii) implement new, simplified standard format for financial information.

The DPL program also helped reduce the vulnerabilities of the financial system.
Establishment of the Financial System Stability Forum (FSSF) formed the basis for the financial
sector safety net, which called for an integrated system to supervise the financial sector and a
framework for closely monitoring financial sector stability. Through a joint decree between the
MOF, Bank Indonesia and LPS (the deposit insurance agency), the FSSF was established in June
2007 to serve as a venue for coordination, cooperation and information exchange among the
authorities responsible for safeguarding financial system stability in Indonesia. Teams were also
established under the FSSF to develop a financial system crisis management protocol, scenarios
for crisis simulation exercises and early warning indicators for various sub-sectors. Indeed, the
FSSF played a crucial role during the financial system turmoil, particularly in addressing
systemic risks and taking swift actions towards resolving insolvent banks through joint policies
and decisions. At the end of the DPL series, the financial sector was in good health overall, with
non-performing loans falling from 3.2 percent in 2008 to 3 percent in mid-2010 and capital
adequacy ratio increasing from 16.76 percent to 18.06 percent during the same period.

The DPL contributed to improved MSMEs access to finance. With support from the DPL, the
Government rationalized MSME financing schemes across line ministries and state-owned
enterprises. Regulatory reforms were also introduced, which allow for the legal establishment of
national and provincial credit guarantee and re-guarantee institutions, and clarify the legal status
of these institutions, their ownership structure, reporting mechanisms and investment options.
These positive developments contributed to the growth in proportion of MSME loans to banking
sector loans, from 50.4 percent in mid-2008 to 52.7 percent in mid 2010.

  Doing Business 2010 is based on data collected in 2009.
8
  During 2008 to 2009, for starting a business, the number of procedures was reduced from 11 to 9, the number of days reduced
from 76 to 60, and the cost reduced from 77.9 percent to 59.7 percent GNI per capita.

                                                              65
   III.    Results Achieved in the third DPL series (DPL-7)

DPL-7 was originally envisaged to be part of the second DPL series consisting of three annual
single tranche loans (DPLs 5-7). However, with a newly elected Government in place, it was
realized that there was a renewed opportunity to better realign the DPL program with the new
Government’s strategies and priorities (as outlined in the 100-day action plan, the Inpres
No.1/2010 Inpres No. 3/2010 and the RPJMN 2010-14). Hence, following agreement with the
Government, DPL-7 was then represented as the beginning of a new, third DPL series (DPLs 7
to 9), thereby ending the second DPL series one year earlier than envisaged. Although there was
significant continuity between the previous administration and the current one (and therefore the
reforms being supported by the DPL series), new priorities emerged, such as improving logistics
and connectivity to enhance competitiveness and efforts to address fragmentation and
inefficiency in the implementation of poverty alleviation Government programs. These reforms
were deemed to be better supported through a new series with a 3-year time horizon that
provides the necessary framework for a continued policy dialogue, technical support and
attention to ensure the necessary steps are taken for successful implementation of reforms. The
following describes some of the initial results of the DPL-7.

Pillar 1: Investment Climate

The Government improved the legal clarity for investments and opened up some sectors to
foreign investment, through its issuance of the Presidential Regulation (Perpres No.
36/2010) on the Investment Negative List. This new regulation updates restrictions on
investment, including preferential treatment for ASEAN investors, and clarifies the grandfather
clause, the treatment of publicly listed companies, and mergers and acquisitions. Although
changes in foreign equity limits are relatively minor, as a single document containing all
restrictions on investment, the new regulation helps substantially in serving as a simple checklist
easily understood by investors, thereby enhancing transparency and removing official discretion.
The regulation also benefitted from a series of discussions with stakeholders, including the
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) and international business chambers.

A more effective, efficient and integrated national logistics system is being developed, to
improve the country’s business competitiveness and ensure the even distribution of
strategic commodities and people’s basic needs at affordable prices. This is done through the
preparation of a National Logistics (Sislognas) Development Blueprint and Action Plan that have
been included in the RPJMN 2010-14, and their submission to the President as a draft
Presidential Regulation. Implementation of the blueprint presents a detailed program for the
period 2010-2014 and its implementation will require broad participation and coordination
among a large number of Government departments and agencies. Hence the finalization of the
blueprint and its submission to the President represents important policy reforms and the
building of consensus among multiple GOI stakeholders towards improving the national
logistics.

The tax administration continued to undergo reforms to reduce tax gaps and introduce
new systems and procedures that facilitate a taxpayer-centered approach to improve
voluntary compliance. Taxpayer compliance costs are expected to be lowered with more

                                                66
efficient and effective tax administration organization and business processes, which are being
pursued through the core tax systems development component of the PINTAR loan that is
supported by the World Bank. To that end, the MoF DG Treasury has issued the advertisement
(invitations for bids) for PINTAR procurement as an initial step in the development of business
process improvements and a new integrated information system.

   IV.      Results Achieved in the Development Policy Loan with Deferred Drawdown
            Option (DPL-DDO)
To alleviate financing constraints in the event that global liquidity conditions do not ease, the
Government requested in early 2009 the DPL-DDO as budgetary support that would have been
exercised only when certain conditions were met. The Government believed that the
announcement of such support package, backed up by a program of confidence-boosting policy
measures, would send a strong positive signal to the markets, making it more likely that
Indonesia would meet its financing needs for CY2009 from market sources. While the regular
DPL series aims to advance Indonesia's longer-term institutional reform agenda and focuses on
the many important but often incremental steps that need to be taken to realize this agenda, the
DPL-DDO supported critical stroke-of-the-pen measures implemented to deal with the crisis
situation, which helped accelerate and intensify the process that was already being supported by
the regular DPL series. The DPL-DDO supported 11 policy actions under three broad areas: (i)
reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial system stability; (ii) sustaining critical
public expenditures while maintaining budget discipline; and (iii) facilitating private investment
and supporting exports. The following are the key results.

Pillar 1: Financial Markets and Financial System Stability

The DPL-DDO helped put in place a stronger legal framework for a Financial System
Safety Net in Indonesia, which helped stabilize the banking system during the time of crisis.
A new financial safety net Government regulation was issued to clearly establish the roles,
responsibilities and procedures that govern the actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, the
Minister of Finance, and the Deposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a
financial institution. As a result, despite the financial crisis, the financial sector remained in good
health overall, with non-performing loans falling from 3.2 percent in end 2008 to 3 percent in
mid-2010 and capital adequacy ratio increasing from 16.8 percent to 18.1 percent during the
same period.

Public confidence in the banking sector was maintained with the introduction of regulatory
reforms targeted to address bank liquidity crises. The Government issued a regulation
increasing ceiling on deposit insurance from IDR 100 million to IDR 2 billion. The regulation
also allows the Deposit Insurance Corporation to change the amount of insured deposits in the
event that there is a risk that could reduce public confidence and endanger financial system
stability.

Pillar 2: Public Expenditures

A national poverty monitoring and response system was put in place to help monitor the
effects of the crisis, providing information to policy-makers on impacts of the crisis. The
system focused on collecting real-time data on employment, basic commodities, farmers’

                                                  67
livelihoods, health, education and social welfare. This information was fed to decision-makers at
the national and local levels to craft policy and programmatic responses.

Specific regulatory reforms and socialization efforts were implemented, which helped
expedite budget disbursement and enhance the Government’s ability to rapidly direct
public expenditures to mitigate growth slowdown. Through the DPL-DDO, the Government
undertook the following actions to speed up spending in 2009: (i) Implementation of a
socialization campaign to promote advanced procurement processing, to appoint multi-year
treasury officers, and to speed up disbursements through DG Treasury; (ii) Establishment of a
“DIPA 2009 Monitoring” committee comprised of DG Treasury (Chair), DG Budget, Head FPO,
and Bappenas, which aims to improve budget disbursements; (iii) Issuance of a MoF regulation
with a simplified mechanism and process for carry-over of unspent 2008 budget for PNPM
(national poverty program); and (iv) Issuance of a MoF regulation outlining procedures for
simplified amending of 2009 DIPA documents and carry-over of unspent 2008 budget for
infrastructure permitting line ministries to reallocate across sub-activities under a simpler budget
(DIPA) revision mechanism without prior amendment of the budget allotment.

Pillar 3: Private Investment and Exports

The DPL-DDO helped promote transparency in the extractive industries’ revenues. The
Government confirmed its intention to implement the Extractive Industries Revenue
Initiative (EITI), thereby providing a clear signal to the international investment
community that it is serious about oil, gas and minerals revenue transparency. The EITI is
recognized as the international standard of oil, gas and minerals transparency. It entails oil, gas
and mining firms (including state-owned) to disclose payments conveyed to the Government
related to various revenue and production streams. Each Government agency is also expected to
disclose how much revenue it collected from each oil, gas or mining firm. These two revenue
streams are reviewed by a multi-stakeholder Steering Group, with the specialized support from
an independent reconciler to cross-check the two figures, the results of which are then published
on an annual basis. Ultimately, implementation of the EITI should promote greater clarity in
regulations and rules, which would lower costs and lead to increased investment.

Trade financing were eased through the opening of a re-discount window for trade finance
and creation of an Export Financing Agency, which helped undermine the slowdown in
export growth at a time of a slowing down economy. Bank Indonesia introduced a special
discount window for trade finance as an emergency response measure to assist in providing
liquidity for trade financing, thereby sending a strong signal to the market of the Government’s
political determination towards supporting the nation’s export-related economic activities. In
addition, Parliament passed a law establishing the Export Financing Agency to further assist in
the process of easing the provision of trade credit.

                             Annex 4. Debt Sustainability Analysis

Indonesia’s Government debt as a share of GDP has fallen steadily over the past decade,
including through the recent global financial crisis. Indeed, Indonesia was the only G20
economy to record a falling debt to GDP ratio between 2008 and the end of 2009, due to its
modest deficits (with an expansion of the deficit to only 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009) and
ongoing growth (especially in nominal terms). This represents a continuation of the trends of the
past decade during which the combination of fiscal conservatism and GDP growth well above,
often negative, ex post real interest rates has contributed to a decline in public debt from around
90 percent in 2000 to almost 25 percent. These trends are expected to continue over the medium-
term. In 2011, even with the projected expansion of the deficit, mainly due to higher fiscal
spending on fuel subsidies, the debt to GDP is projected to continue to fall given nominal growth
projections and the stability of the rupiah.

Baseline projections suggest Indonesia’s debt to GDP ratios should continue falling over
the coming half-decade. The projected fall in the debt to GDP ratio can vary with those
projected by other multilateral agencies, depending in particular on the projected growth in
Indonesia’s GDP deflator which is used. The baseline projection in Table 6 below is based on the
assumption that the GDP deflator will continue to grow faster than CPI inflation, although the
difference between the two growth rates will converge gradually. The assumed continued
stability of the nominal rupiah/USD exchange rate over the medium-term is also supportive of
debt dynamics going forward. The budget deficit is assumed to widen in 2011 to around 1.6
percent of GDP before declining, in line with the near-term projections set out in the
Government’s 2012 proposed Budget. It is then assumed that the primary deficit widens towards
2016 as the Government embarks on greater infrastructure and social investment in line with its
medium-term development plans.

Indonesia’s downward debt dynamics appear to be robust to a plausible range of
macroeconomic shocks. In shocks to underlying assumptions based on recent trends, past
shocks and past volatility, the debt projections remain on a downward path. The historical period
used to calculate these shocks includes the last ten years of data, during which there have been a
number of adverse shocks to Indonesia’s exchange rate, for example during the recent global
crisis, although growth has been positive with relatively little variation. Even with a shock of a
10 percent of GDP increases in debt liabilities in 2012, the debt ratio comes back down to its
2011 value by 2016. However, when considering these results, it is worth noting that this debt
sustainability analysis focuses on solvency issues rather than liquidity and roll-over risks, which
may occur even if solvency is solid. As mentioned in the macro round-up while Indonesia’s near-
term financing position is supported by cash reserves from previous over-financing and the still
conservative fiscal deficits it remains sensitive to shifts in international financing conditions.

A.      Overview of Environmental Issues in Indonesia9

In 2009, the World Bank published a Country Environmental Analysis for Indonesia. The document
provides an overview understanding of environmental issues, with an emphasis on climate change as a
key cross cutting issue. The report also discusses costs of environmental degradation, governance and
constituency building as key challenges.

Overview. Environmental management remains a challenge for Indonesia. Over the past decade, many
aspects of environmental management and natural resource management have been decentralized to the
local level. Natural resource management and environmental quality are now more dependent on local
leadership, institutional capacity and willingness to conform to national standards and regulations. The
current picture across Indonesia is mixed, with some regions demonstrating commitment to sustainability,
while others are opting for exploitation with short-term gains. Greater local control has had positive
aspects through reputational programs, greater political will, interagency collaboration, community
empowerment, and integration of environment in spatial planning. At the same time, decentralization has
revealed obstacles to good environmental management, including: inadequate standards and enforcement;
distorted incentives; lack of community empowerment; and insufficient local government implementation
and enforcement capacity. Also, awareness about the expected negative environmental impacts of
unmanaged and exploitative development and the mechanisms for stakeholders to hold government
agencies accountable for their performance are weak. Environmental considerations have only been
integrated weakly into planning and programming processes, especially in the area of public investment
and in regional plans for land and resource use.

Environmental Damage Costs. Inadequate environmental management and growth without attention to
environmental outcomes and costs poses a challenge for Indonesia that hurts the poor and the economy.
Significant economic losses are also caused by other types of environmental degradation, especially
deforestation, soil depletion, and coastal/marine degradation. Inadequate water and sanitation constitute
the largest short-term cost to the Indonesian economy, estimated at more than USD 6 billion in 2005 or
more than 2 percent of GDP. The health impacts of outdoor and indoor air pollution have been estimated
at USD 4.6 billion per year or about 1.6 percent of GNI. In total, environmental degradation costs are
likely to grow in the future and are currently on par with the average annual growth rate. These costs are
disproportionately borne by the poor who are more vulnerable, more exposed and less able to cope with
the impacts of pollution and resource degradation. Climate change has the potential to exacerbate these
impacts and costs. The economic consequences of climate change represent the highest potential cost to
Indonesia’s economy in the long term, amounting to annual losses of between 2.5 and 7.0 percent of GDP
by the end of the century.

Environmental Spending. Indonesia’s spending for environmental purposes was low for the decade prior
to 2006, but has begun to increase substantially in recent years. Environmental revenue collection has

been low and natural resources have been under-valued. Fuel and electricity subsidies enhance over-
consumption, burden the budget and benefit higher income groups, while making it difficult for renewable
energy sources to compete. Legal and financial incentive structures have not been very effective in
curbing illegal logging, but recent changes in the deforestation rate show some progress and the GOI is
taking steps toward a REDD+ initiative. Policy distortions in fishing and mining have contributed to
unsustainable harvesting patterns and illegal mining activities. Conflicting sector-based regulations and
national laws, including those involving decentralization, contribute to the weak implementation. Ministry
of Environment and Ministry of Finance are now developing the capacity and tools for wider application
of environmental fiscal reform to address these distortions through the use of taxation and pricing
instruments to raise revenues, but also to provide incentives for more sustainable behavior.

Environmental Constituency. In terms of public awareness and constituencies for improvement,
environmental issues are on the radar of the Indonesian population, especially issues concerning water
(pollution, floods, and droughts), urban issues (cleanliness, solid waste, and air quality) and forests
(degradation, illegal logging, and fires). The GOI has policies, investments and programs for these public
priorities, but their persistence as public concerns is one indicator that they have not been adequately
addressed. In addition, the GOI is pursuing actions in areas (e.g., climate change, coastal and marine
resources, biodiversity, clean energy, and hazardous wastes), that are not yet fully understood or
appreciated by the general public, indicating a low level of public awareness. The large differences on the
level and quality of public participation and environmental awareness can be attributed to institutional and
policy constraints, the need for a more responsive bureaucracy that is willing to engage in a constructive
dialogue with civil society on policy and development initiatives, and ability to access funding and
information. Promoting public participation and increasing awareness, especially among mass media, civil
society organizations, the legislature, and religious organizations, are essential for any partnership that
seeks to build effective demand for environmental sustainability.

Environmental Laws and Sectoral Issues

There is an impressive set of laws, policies, programs, and national as well as local institutions that are
responsible for environmental and natural resource management. In recent years, the GOI has upgraded
the legal framework for environmental management and has made improvements in regulations, capacity,
and assessments. The GOI also has important initiatives to restrain utilities’ pollution, reduce smoke and
haze from forest and land fires, rehabilitate forests and degraded lands, improve environmental
management through the spatial planning process, and develop environmental data and information.

Environmental Management Law. In 2009, the GOI passed Law No. 32/2009 on Environmental
Protection and Management. Under this law, the AMDAL (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan)
process—the assessment of proposed activities with significant anticipated impact on the environment—
has become a recognized instrument to measure environmental pollution and degradation. Under the
Environment Law, both AMDALs and management and monitoring plans are required for the awarding
of the environmental permits—now as prerequisites for development activity permits (e.g., mining,
building, and industrial permits). The law placed AMDAL in a stronger position as one of the instruments
for minimizing pollution and environmental degradation. The law requires completion of the impact
assessment and preparation of an environmental management and monitoring plan as part of the business
licensing and environmental permit process. In addition, the law also includes provisions for licensing of
AMDAL commissions, certification requirements for compilers and sanctions for non-compliance with
the process. Indonesia has decentralized responsibility for environmental impact assessment. All 33
Provincial Governments and 55 percent of kabupaten/kota Governments have AMDAL commissions.

                                                    72
Solid Waste Management Law. In 2008, the GOI passed Law No. 18 2008 on Municipal Solid Waste
Management to heighten attention on this issue and to improve the requirements and incentives for local
governments to improve performance. Only half of Indonesia’s solid waste is actually collected, up to a
fifth properly disposed, and less than two percent is treated (recycled or composted). With
decentralization, local governments have acquired more responsibility in planning and implementing solid
waste management programs. About 85 percent of small cities and more than 50 percent of medium cities
dispose of their waste in open dumps. The 2008 law aims to reduce the generation of solid waste by
encouraging communities to “reduce, reuse, recycle,” and to improve the handling of solid waste through
improved separation of types of waste and processing prior to final treatment. The law also requires
municipalities to upgrade solid waste handling facilities, including landfills. The Ministry of Public
Works also plays a role in improving solid waste management and has issued the Strategic Plan for
development of solid waste management (road map for waste sector) to support Sub-national
Governments to improve the infrastructure facilities to manage municipal solid waste.

Air Pollution. As noted, air quality contributes to environmental costs through health losses. Air
pollution control has not received attention and funding at the level warranted by the very large and well-
documented health consequences. The GOI has banned leaded fuel and announced some steps toward
reducing petroleum fuel subsidies, which will help to improve air quality. However, efforts to manage air
quality are hampered by weak enforcement capacity, the rapid growth in vehicle use and ownership, and a
lack of mass transportation options, as well as cross jurisdictional coordination among institutions at local
level. A national air quality strategy was developed with ADB in 2006. Emissions regulations are
unevenly enforced. Capacity for long-term maintenance and calibration of air quality equipment is a
major limitation of the existing monitoring system.

Water Pollution. Poor performance of local water utilities (PDAMs) has contributed to excessive
reliance on private wells, and excessive groundwater extraction and subsidence in parts of Indonesia. Low
rates of sewerage and sanitation coverage cause widespread contamination of surface and groundwater.
As a result, Indonesia has experienced repeated local epidemics of gastrointestinal infections and has the
highest incidence of typhoid in Asia. Economic losses attributable to poor sanitation are conservatively
estimated at 2 percent of GDP. To improve firms' compliance with environmental standards, the GOI has
been trying to complement command-and-control regulations with public disclosure tools, e.g. PROPER,
which has had significant success in the firms where it has been applied. Water quality in many rivers is
not regularly monitored. In addition, where water quality is monitored and sites are monitored weekly and
daily, results are only reported monthly and/or yearly. There is no mechanism to incorporate monitored
data in a timely manner, into rehabilitation schemes.

Fisheries. The GOI passed a Fisheries Law in 2007. The President launched a 6 country Coral Triangle
Initiative (CTI) in 2008. The World Oceans Conference in Manado in 2009 focused attention on marine
and coastal issues. The GOI is implementing the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program
phase II (COREMAP II), which can be one of the key programs under CTI. The program has the
objective to help establish viable reef management systems involving coastal communities to sustainably
co-manage the use of coral reefs and associated ecosystem resources. It is generally recognized that
Indonesia's coastal and marine fishery resources are over harvested and threatened. This can be attributed
to excess fishing, due to inadequate zoning, licensing, weak regulations and enforcement, and low
awareness. Illegal fishing practices, such as trawling, are still widely practiced.

Biodiversity and Protected Areas. Although Indonesia has a well-designed and biogeographically
representative protected area system, there are gaps, especially with coastal and freshwater ecosystems.
Some large areas of marine national parks have been gazetted or proposed in recent years and the GOI
                                                   73
launched the CTI. Improvements have occurred allowing for the appointment of senior managers to head
the largest national parks. New protected areas have been established but some are still in a proposed
and/or declared status due to the long process of demarcating forest boundaries; and there are still
unresolved overlapping and conflicting claims to lands within protected areas. The Heart of Borneo,
REDD+ and HCVF initiatives have gathered significant support for increasing sustainable land use
management and ecosystems protection. The recent regulation from the Ministry of Forestry on
ecosystem restoration concessions allowing restoration of expired forestry concessions for development
of ecosystem services holds promise and is being pursued by several developers. The GOI participated in
meetings, workshops and summits related to tiger conservation in 2010, and has developed a National
Tiger Recovery Program as a part of a global effort with other Tiger Range States. There is some tension
between local governments and conservation goals under the decentralization system, as national parks do
not contribute to land taxes or local revenues. Ecotourism and payments for environmental services do not
generate sufficient revenues to offset losses in tax revenue from resource exploitation. Park entry fees are
officially set at a uniform national level and below the price of a bottle of water. A review suggests that
integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) in parks and buffer zones have provided very
limited development opportunities to local communities.

Extractive Industries Transparency. In May 2010, the President signed a regulation establishing
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Indonesia (Presidential Regulation 26/2010 on
Transparency of National and Local Extractive Industry Revenues). Key features include multi-level
governance and oversight to provide high-level accountability; an Implementing Team with public and
private representatives to make operational decisions; and industry and civil society representation. The
regulation requires the central government to specify how much oil, gas, mineral and coal revenue it has
conveyed to each local government, while each local government must specify how much it has received.
The regulation requires oil, gas and mining companies to report the amount of revenues they have
conveyed to the central government, the central government to report how much revenue it has received
from the companies, and also requires the central government to specify how much revenue originating
from oil, gas, mineral and coal companies has been subsequently transferred to each local government.

B.       Overview of poverty and social issues in Indonesia 10

This section reviews the current snapshot and trends of poverty and general welfare situation in Indonesia
over the past five to ten years period. It presents some changes in the poverty indicators, major aspects of
social development, and employment. It is conceivable that climate change may have a negative impact
on poverty and social development.

Poverty Reduction

Higher levels of economic growth have not translated, to the extent hoped for, into greater poverty
reduction. Much of the population remains in poverty or vulnerable to it. Until recently, high rates of
economic growth have been slow to be reflected in poverty reduction. Though poverty rates fell quickly
from 1997-98 crisis levels, progress until recently has been slow and higher rates of growth had not

translated to faster poverty reduction. With the exception of 2006, when the poverty rate jumped sharply
in response to the increase in fuel prices, poverty gradually declined in Indonesia after the crisis until
2007, when it had fallen below pre-crisis levels. The rate of decline had been disappointing in the context
of stronger growth. GDP growth averaged 7 percent annually between 1990 and 1996, with a four
percentage point reduction in poverty. By contrast, between 2003 and 2007, poverty had fallen by only
one percentage point with growth averaging over 5 percent per year. However, poverty has since fallen by
over two percentage points in the last two years, to 14.2 percent by early 2009. It remains to be seen what
effect the 2008-09 global economic crisis has had.

In addition, much of the population remains vulnerable to poverty. Nearly half of Indonesia’s
population in 2007 could reasonably be considered “near poor” or poor, with per-capita consumption
levels less than a third above the national poverty line. These households are vulnerable to myriad
aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks such as food price increases or employment and health shocks that can
drive them into poverty. Although 41 percent of the poor households escaped poverty between 2003 and
2004, over one-third of non-poor households fell into poverty, highlighting the fluid nature of poverty and
the depth of household vulnerability in Indonesia.

Human Development Outcomes

Human development outcomes continue to be uneven despite significant increases in public
expenditures. Indonesia’s human development outcomes are uneven and lag others in the region.
Because of geographic and income-related disparities and differences in the quality of health, water and
sanitation and education service delivery at the local level, Indonesia’s performance in terms of human
development outcomes has been quite uneven over the last decade. Over that period, there has been little
improvement in some indicators and, in the case of a few indicators, there has even been some regression.
As a result Indonesia lags behind its neighbors in a number of areas and is unlikely to achieve several of
its health-related MDGs. In particular, the country has made very little headway in reducing maternal
mortality (420 per 100,000 births is high given Indonesia’s income level), reducing child malnutrition
(which has remained at around 25 percent in the last few years), and in addressing geographic and
income-related health disparities.

National averages for health indicators mask significant geographic and income-related inequalities
within the country. In poorer provinces, such as Gorontalo and West Nusa Tenggara, the infant and child
mortality rates are four to five times higher than those in richer provinces such as Bali and Yogyakarta.
Health indicators for the poor are also far worse than those for the rich: child mortality rates among the
poorest quintile in 2003 were 3.5 times the rate among the richest quintiles (World Bank, 2008a).

Behind the impressive increase in enrollment rates at the national level, wide regional and systemic
differences remain. Indonesia tends to lag behind other lower middle income countries in early
childhood education and higher education, with gross enrollment rates of 21 percent and 17 percent
respectively. In addition, while the enrollment gap between males and females and across income groups
has been reduced, especially at the primary education level, striking inequalities remain across income
groups at the pre-school, junior secondary and senior secondary levels. Indonesia also scores poorly and
lags behind in student learning in international assessments, indicating that the quality of education
remains a concern.

Access to water supply services in Indonesia is among the lowest in the region. Provision of piped
water services is inadequate. The percentage of the urban population served by piped water had reached
40 percent by 1997 but declined to 31 percent in 2005; the national average is only 17 percent. Access to
                                                   75
improved water has declined from 90 percent in 1995 to 87 percent. The environmental consequences of
access through large-scale use of private unregulated wells are high. Land subsidence, higher costs of
reaching drinkable well water and proximity to septic tanks pose high environmental and health risks. The
high incidence of water-borne diseases disproportionately affects the poor. Climate change is predicted to
lead to some water shortage in some areas and thus exacerbate the difficulty in clean water provision to
the community.

Sanitation coverage in Indonesia is well below the average for South-East Asian countries, being 55
percent compared to 67 percent in 2006. Network sewerage coverage, estimated at 1.3 percent, is one of
the lowest in Asia. Sanitation coverage has increased nationwide by 9 percentage points since 1990 but,
on current trends, Indonesia will fall short of the MDG sanitation target of 73 percent by 10 percentage
points, or about 25 million people. Over 96 percent of human waste is not treated prior to disposal while
the manner in which private sanitation systems (including septic tanks) are managed and operated
frequently risks contamination of ground and surface water.

Environmental degradation contributes to high economic and social costs. High deforestation rates
contribute to decreasing water quality, soil fertility and land productivity as well as increasing water
shortages, fires and haze, health impacts, downstream siltation and flooding. Moreover, because a fifth of
Indonesians live in government-administered “forest zones” (which may lack trees), they are vulnerable to
shifts in policies and land use claims, which can result in conflicts and increasing pressure on state assets
and budgets. Fisheries resources that provide the main source of livelihood for fishing communities are
also declining throughout the country; fishing communities have nearly twice the poverty rate as the
national average and are vulnerable to loss of fisheries habitat, climate change and rising fuel prices.
Indonesia’s environmental conditions impose significant economic costs (Bappenas, 2007). The health
and other economic costs attributable to water pollution and limited access to safe water and sanitation are
estimated to have been USD 6.3 billion in 2006 (2 percent of GDP). The annual costs of air pollution to
the Indonesian economy have been calculated at around USD 400 million per year. These costs are
disproportionately borne by the poor because they are more likely to be exposed to pollution and less
likely to be able to afford mitigation measures. As climate change—without proper adaptation—will
likely intensify environmental degradation in both terrestrial and marine biomes, it will also increase the
threat to food security and of vector-borne diseases.

Employment

Despite recent signs of progress, Indonesia lags behind its more prosperous neighbors in producing
higher value-added non-agricultural jobs. Employment growth has failed to match population growth
since the crisis and job creation in the formal sector has been especially sluggish. Between 1999 and
2003, the percentage of the Indonesian workforce employed in the formal sector fell from 43 percent to 35
percent. There are signs of a recovery since then but the employment rate in the formal sector is still
below what it was prior to the crisis. The open unemployment rate, which was 8.1 percent in 2001, rose
further to 11.2 percent in 2005 before falling to 9.1 percent in 2007. This trend is mostly driven by youth
aged 15 to 24, who have consistently made up over half of the unemployed and currently have an
unemployment rate of 25 percent. Unemployment is especially high—roughly 33 percent—among young
people under the age of 25 with high school and college degrees. In addition, real median wages, after
growing rapidly from 1999 to 2003, have since stagnated.

Increasing numbers of workers were pushed into agriculture after the crisis; in 2008, over 40
percent of Indonesia’s labor force still derives its livelihood from low-productivity activities in
agriculture and related areas. During the post-crisis recovery period, increasing numbers of workers were
                                                     76
pushed into agriculture and by 2003, agricultural employment had returned to 1991 levels. Most of the
increase in agricultural employment came at the expense of the service sector, a driver of pre-crisis
expansion. Non-agricultural employment resumed growing rapidly between 2003 and 2006 and
agricultural employment fell to its lowest level since 1997. Despite this growth, just 30 percent of the
labor force is employed in high-value added activities in manufacturing and services. Indonesia’s
agricultural productivity has been low with just half the average productivity of the services sector and
one-eighth of the productivity of industry. There have been no signs of productivity improvement despite
the recent falling share of the labor force engaged in agricultural employment. In 2008, over 40 percent of
Indonesia’s labor force still derives its livelihood from low-productivity activities in agriculture and
related areas. Indonesia is not keeping up with its neighbors in moving workers out of agriculture and
progress has stagnated. Vietnam has a high share of agricultural employment but it is falling quickly as
the country’s share of industrial employment is increasing and will soon surpass Indonesia. Thailand has
already surpassed Indonesia and workers are continuing to move off the farm while Malaysia’s share of
agriculture workers remains stable and very low.

In the future, the labor absorbing capacity of the agricultural sector, including fishery, is predicted
to be lower due to decreases in productivity of the biomes induced by the climate change. Shrinking
agricultural lands and degradation of coral reef system due to temperature rise will lead to declining
productivity, hence employment opportunities in these sectors. Women and female-headed households are
a higher share of Indonesia’s poor and are more susceptible to negative shocks from natural disasters,
economic downturns, or climate induced impacts.

C.       Summary of Environmental, Social and Poverty Review of Operation

Environmental aspects

The environmental review for the FIRM DPL is discussed briefly here. Because the operation is focused
on financial sector and investment climate, the environmental review indicates few areas where
environmental issues may arise, and several general improvements in transparency and regulatory
consistency could lead to positive environmental or social effects in the longer term. The main areas of
reform supported under the loan will be:

     •   Pillar 1: Financial sector strengthening of regulation and supervision. Prior actions in this area
         focus on strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector, supporting the
         smooth establishment of the new Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK), and enhancing the
         Government’s financial crisis preparedness capacity. These actions are not likely to have any
         significant environmental effects.

     •   Pillar 2: Financial sector diversification through development of non-bank financial
         institutions. Prior actions in this area will support capital market development through improved
         corporate governance and insurance sector development through improved measurement of equity.
         These actions are not likely to have any significant environmental effects.

     •   Pillar 3: Financial inclusion for underserved groups and the poor. Prior actions in this area aim
         to expand the range of financial services available for the poor primarily through piloting and
         expanding reach of new financial products and launching of a National Strategy for Financial
         Inclusion. These actions are not likely to have any significant environmental effects.

   •   Pillar 4: Investment climate regulatory reform. Prior actions in this area support improving
       policy coordination across GOI ministries and support strategic planning and prioritization of
       regulatory reforms that will improve the business environment for investment and improving the
       contract enforcement process. The DPL supports the GOI to review and develop an action plan for
       priority regulatory reforms envisioned under MP3EI and also to improve business licensing and
       investment regulations. It should be noted that this component supports policy coordination and
       action plans for key economic and financial reforms that benefit the business and investment
       climate generally, not specific features of the long term economic Masterplan. The policy reforms
       supported under this operation are not anticipated to have potential for significant environmental
       effects. The actual implementation of priority reform actions or investments in specific locations,
       such as special economic zones, would need to be reviewed in more detail at a later date to
       ascertain their socioeconomic and environmental effects.

Poverty and social aspects

The proposed policy actions under this operation are expected to have significant positive social
effects, especially on poverty by helping to create an overall favorable economic environment for
growth and poverty reduction and by supporting specific measures targeted toward the poor and
vulnerable groups. Prior actions to improve financial sector stability, diversification and the investment
climate are part of a broader GOI effort to create a stable economic environment. In doing so, it will
reduce the level of risk of job loss faced by poor and vulnerable households during times of crisis. In the
past, poor and vulnerable households were hurt by the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-1998; formal sector
employment rates fell steeply as many households fell into poverty, so that 23 percent of Indonesia’s
population was below the poverty line by 1999 (Box 4). The GOI has made important strides since that
time in establishing economic stability, and the FIRM DPL aims to further bolster these efforts. Several
prior actions are also expected to have positive poverty and social effects.

   •   Pillar 1: Financial sector strengthening of regulation and supervision. The prior actions to
       promote financial system stability are expected to support the creation of a robust and stable
       financial system—a prerequisite for economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.
       Actions focus on enhancing crisis preparedness, supporting quality supervision, and promoting a
       more effective deposit insurance scheme.

   •   Pillar 2: Financial sector diversification through development of non-bank financial
       institutions. The prior actions to support financial sector diversification are expected to achieve
       indirect effects on poverty. The efforts to deepen the capital markets and insurance sectors
       supported are anticipated to help improve corporate governance in the financial sector, leading to
       greater stability, growth and the availability of a wider set of financial products for all including
       the poor.

   •   Pillar 3: Financial inclusion for underserved groups and the poor. The financial inclusion
       reforms are expected to expand the access to a full range of financial services for the poor,
       vulnerable groups and particularly women. This will be achieved through the implementation of
       the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion. Without access to such services, including both
       credit, savings and insurance products, poor individuals and small enterprises need to rely on their
       personal wealth or internal resources to invest in their education, become entrepreneurs or take
       advantage of promising growing opportunities. The importance of access to financial services to
       the poor is clearly reflected in the Government’s national poverty reduction strategy, which
                                                    78
    includes a cluster of programs that aim to stimulate job opportunities for poor and vulnerable
    households by encouraging small and micro-entrepreneurs. The largest of these programs is the
    KUR program, which is specifically supported by Pillar 3. KUR provides small credits to
    microenterprises. For most of these households and enterprises, the increase of income from
    additional working capital financed by KUR had made them less prone to economic shocks, and
    thus more resilient to falling into poverty.

•   Pillar 4: Investment climate regulatory reform. The investment climate reforms are expected to
    help create equal opportunities for businesses and improve the overall ease of doing business,
    thereby promoting job creation and inclusive growth. The benefits of the specific actions relating
    to enhancing policy coordination under MP3EI and supporting the development of a more
    effective contract enforcement system are expected to be realized in the medium-term.
