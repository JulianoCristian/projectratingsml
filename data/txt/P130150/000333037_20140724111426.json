{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Financial Sector and\n            Investment Climate Reform and Modernization Development\n            Policy Loan Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the evolution of the core Development\n            Policy Loan or DPL program into three sectoral operations\n            resulted in increased government ownership, a deeper Bank\n            engagement on key topics, and an improved focus on the\n            Government's most current priorities. The extensive\n            financial sector analytical work that was completed prior to\n            the DPL was a critical element in identifying the reform\n            program. In particular, the Indonesia FSAP (2010) and the\n            Indonesia Access to Finance Report (2009) provided strong\n            analytical underpinnings for the DPL and also helped to\n            build consensus among technocrats and policymakers on\n            specific reform measures well in advance of the DPL. To a\n            large extent, it was this advanced dialogue that allowed the\n            DPL to be prepared in a relatively short amount of time.\n            While the FIRM DPL included a well-structured results\n            framework, a clearer justification of the selection of\n            outcome indicators and greater government participation\n            could have improved the impact assessment. While adequate\n            overall, the monitoring system could have discussed the\n            nature and justification of the chosen outcome indicators\n            more thoroughly and also included sources of information to\n            be used for evaluation."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
