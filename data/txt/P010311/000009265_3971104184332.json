of the National Oilseed\n            Development Project for Pakistan was satisfactory. The\n            project achieved its main objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is uncertain at this time, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, the\n            project was too complex in design. In hindsight, encouraging\n            farmers to form \"producers organizations\" for\n            addressing their crop disposal issues and to foster better\n            linkages with extension agents for production technology\n            uptake could have assisted in better performance. Second,\n            monopolistic tendencies of the GCP as well as price control\n            regimes of the Government hampered the development of\n            efficient marketing channels. Third, credit did not work as\n            an incentive for the promotion of oilseed crops as\n            envisioned in the project. Fourth, the Bank's\n            supervision missions should have been more frequent for such\n            a complex project to succeed. Finally, aggressive awareness\n            initiatives should have been built into the project."}, "docdt": "1997-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
