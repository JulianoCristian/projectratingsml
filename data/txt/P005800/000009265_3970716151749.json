Technical Assistance Project,\n            complementing proposed but separate assistance from the\n            Kuwait Fund, would strengthen the capabilities of the\n            Central Planning Organization. It would achieve this by\n            national economic planning and public investment\n            programming, project evaluation and monitoring as well as\n            developing and maintaining a national data bank. More\n            specifically, it would: (a) provide on-the-job and overseas\n            training for selected staff in key General Departments of\n            CPO; (b) ensure greater coordination and complementarity\n            between the General Departments, and between the CPO and\n            other ministries/agencies. It would; (c) introduce improved\n            procedures in economic planning and investment programming,\n            project processing and cost control, and in reviewing\n            contract documentation, management of technical assistance\n            as well as improved procurement practices. Finally, the\n            project would; (d) ensure a well-managed and organized\n            central data processing capability in YAR. The project would\n            finance about 13 staff-years of specialists' services\n            and about 27 staff-years of overseas fellowship training;\n            English language training, mainly in-country, for about 16\n            CPO staff; and office and data processing equipment."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
