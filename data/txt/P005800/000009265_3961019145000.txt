IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1556 YAR)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Technical Assistance
Project in the Republic of Yemen, for which Credit 1556 YAR in the amount of US$4.7
mnillion was approved on March 7, 1985 and made effective on March 4, 1986.
The Credit closed on September 30, 1993, compared with the original closing date of
December 31, 1989. Forty-six percent of the Credit was disbursed and the balance of
US$2,865,873 was cancelled.
The ICR was prepared by Kanok Pranich (consultant) under the supervision of Anders
Bjorgung (Task Manager) and with additional input by Isik Erim (consultant), Country
Operations Division, Middle East Department, Middle East and North Africa Region, and
reviewed by Gianni Brizzi (Project Advisor). The beneficiary and implementing agency, the
Ministry of Planning and Development, was consulted during report preparation, but did not
provide any written comments.
The ICR is based on the project file and interviews with key Government and Bank
staff.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (CREDIT 1556 YAR)
Evaluation Summary
A.    Introduction
1.    The Technical Assistance (TA) Project was the first stand-alone TA operation in
Yemen. TA services, including training, were previously provided in the context of
investment projects. At the Central Planning Organization (CPO), the need had been
expressed for TA to complement the on-going assistance of other donors, to strengthen CPO's
key departments and data management capability. The unification of the Yemen Arab
Republic (YAR) with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) on May 22, 1990,
resulted in the merger of the respective planning agencies to form the Ministry of Planning
and Development (MPD). The project was implemented by CPO in the beginning and by
MPD in the later years.
B.    Project Objectives
2.    The project, supported by IDA Credit 1556-YAR, aimed to improve staff capability in
key departments of the Central Planning Organization (CPO) and to establish procedures that
would strengthen CPO's operations and its working relationship with other ministries and
agencies.
C.    Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The achievements of the project were mixed. On the positive side, the project did
improve the capability of CPO staff. The target of delivering 324 person-months of training
was exceeded by over 40 percent (of which 264 person-months were overseas), and at only
half the expenditure allocated for this purpose. The procurement of computer equipment was
also successfully completed before the original Credit closing date and at only half of the
expected cost. Expert services (156 person-months) contributed to strengthening of CPO
departments. In particular two computer specialists trained about 40 staff members for five
years in computer data bank technology in the CPO, the Central Statistical Office (CSO), and
the Prime Minister's Office. Another seventy staff members were trained overseas in
economic planning, investment programming, project evaluation, TA administration,
procurement and contract administration, and middle management. Computer systems were
procured, installed, and are currently in use.
4.    However, the project was not able to establish procedures to strengthen CPO's overall
operation and working relationship with other ministries and agencies. This is partly due to
the fact that the study of CPO organization and methods, which was to serve as the basis for
its reform, was not undertaken. Moreover, the Government was not prepared to give CPO an
unequivocal role in project selection and portfolio monitoring. In addition, the project



iii
experienced delays comparable to the other projects in the Yemen portfolio. The Credit took
almost ten months to become effective, rather than the four originally estimated. Further
delays occurred in the appointment of several staff, procurement activities, and Credit
disbursement. The project had no separate implementation unit and depended on CPO's own
staff to carry out its day-to-day operations. This situation and CPO's delay in making
decisions persisted through to the Credit closing date.
5.    With the unification in 1990 the project entered a new phase. After the Gulf war later
that year, the Kuwait Fund ceased its operation in the Republic of Yemen, thereby
discontinuing the TA it provided to CPO/MPD since its establishment. Meanwhile, with the
impact of the Gulf crisis Yemen's economy started facing major difficulties and the economic
dialogue with the donors took the forefront. In order to fill the TA gap and further strengthen
MPD's economic departments, IDA agreed to provide financing for macroeconomists and
planners, as well as a statistical analyst, and a national accounts advisor. The Credit closing
date was extended six months (to June 30, 1990), and then again for another year (to June 30,
1991) so that a TA action plan including the hiring of such specialists could be prepared and
implemented.
6.    In line with a two-year action plan agreed with IDA in 1991, MPD signed a contract
with AMIDEAST to manage training of ninety staff in various countries; another contract was
signed with the UNDP's Office for Project Services (OPS) to recruit and manage the services
of needed specialists (para. 5 above); and contracts for the purchase of additional computer
systems and office equipment were approved for award by the High Tender Board. A final
two-year extension was then granted to cover the action plan. However, none of these
contracts had been implemented by the final Credit closing date of September 30, 1993.
MPD cancelled the contract with AMIDEAST; did not make effective that with OPS; and did
not award the contracts for computer and office equipment. In the end, about SDR 2.52
million, or 53.6 percent of the Credit, had to be cancelled. This substantial credit
cancellation is the result of the combined effects of: (i) the non implementation of the above
mentioned components and activities; (ii) the rise in value of the SDR during the life of the
project; (iii) savings derived from the lower than expected costs of procuring equipment (fall
of computer costs) and carrying out training (use of regional rather than international experts);
and (iv) donor financing of the experts required to carry out some TA activities;
D.    Main Conclusions and Lessons Learned
7.    By substantially strengthening CPO's data management department, the project was
successful in laying the foundation of what became the Central Statistical Office which has
now adequate data management capabilities for national accounts and for surveys such as the
national household survey. The MPD departments responsible for project planning, financing
and monitoring are capable of carrying out these functions without external assistance and the
project has contributed to this through training programs and expert support. A management
information system for portfolio implementation was installed but is not operational pending
Government action to ensure that the project implementing agencies provide data inputs. As
regards the economic departments, MPD wish to secure further assistance for them in its
future TA programs.

8.     Installing computers, training staff in their use, and establishing a data bank in the
Prime Minister's Office were added to the original scope of the project. In this regard, the
project set a good example and similar projects are underway in other ministries. The lasting
effect of all components, on the other hand, depends on the ability of the Ministry of Planning
and Development to substantially retain the staff trained under the project.
9.    As for the lessons learned from the project, it should be mentioned that:
-     During project implementation, grants could become available and displace IDA
resource earmarked for specific project activities. To limit this occurrence, project
financing plans should carefully assess the availability of alternative grant financing.
Moreover, credit agreements should provide for unilateral cancellation, at IDA's
discretion, of any credit funds displaced by grants not included in the financing plan.
-     Institutional development components of TA projects should be contingent upon
Government agreement on a detailed institutional plan for the ministry or agency
concerned. Absence of such an agreement should be considered as a red flag to
successful project implementation. Even with such a plan, TA for institutional
development will have limited impact if there is no Government commitment to a
broader administrative reform.
In view of rapidly changing conditions and generally slow implementation, TA
projects should be kept as small and focussed as possible to avoid long implementation
periods; alternatively, when institutional development/administrative reform plans are
available, a time-slice or credit line approach could be considered together with a
flexible design to tackle institutional needs over a longer time period and under
changing conditions.
Agreement should be reached with the Government that procurement and recruitment
steps should be completed during the 9-12 months while effectiveness is pending.
Normally, agencies do not act on procurement and recruitment until after credit
effectiveness.






REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (CREDIT 1556 YAR)
PART I. IDA PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Background
1.    During the late 1970s and early 1980s Yemen benefitted from increasing development
assistance provided by OECD countries, Arab/OPEC countries as well as the Socialist block.
Availability of resources well exceeded the administration's ability to prepare and implement projects.
Many of the ministries/agencies were in the early stages of developing such capabilities and facing an
overall shortage of technical and foreign language skills. In 1983, the Government agency
responsible for preparing development plans, and promoting and administering external funding for
them (the Central Planning Organization-CPO), requested assistance from IDA for an institutional
development program that would strengthen its main departments.
B.    Project Objectives and Implementation
2.    In response to these needs, IDA prepared and financed a technical assistance project
(prepared through 1994 and approved on March 7, 1985) aimed at addressing the Government's main
objectives, namely to improve economic analysis/planning as well as project programming, financing
and monitoring. The project focussed on the following. First, in order to achieve better economic
analysis and development planning: (i) CPO's planning and research staff would receive external
training, (ii) staff responsible for the data bank would receive external and internal training as well as
assistance to prepare and implement an action plan, and (iii) the data bank would be equipped with
modern data processing equipment. These activities would be coordinated with those of the Kuwait
Fund which provided a senior economist as advisor to the minister. Second, to support project
programming, financing and monitoring CPO's General Department of Projects and Loans (GDPL) as
well as its Legal Department would receive expert support and overseas training. Areas of emphasis
being project costing, cost control, procurement, and contracting. These areas of emphasis were
selected not only to meet the needs of the CPO in handling externally financed projects but also to
enable CPO assistance to those of the technical ministries/agencies that did not have adequate
resources. Other components involved strengthening of the General Department of Technical
Assistance and Conferences as well as setting up a methods and organization unit.
3.    With respect to the data bank, the implementation proceeded quite well. The project laid
down a strong foundation for the present day Central Statistical Office which more than fulfills the
institutional objective of the project concerning data management. However, other activities related to
planning did not proceed as well, mainly because the economic environment was deteriorating, and,
in the face of declining resource availability, the need for structural adjustment was overtaking the
need for long term development planning. The project, thanks to its flexible design, could have
assisted the Government in gearing for structural adjustment work. However, the Government was
not prepared to undertake major economic reforms at the time.
4.    As regards CPO's general project preparation and supervision capabilities, the first two years
of implementation went well; training programs and expert recruitment took place more or less as
planned. Thereafter, the Government began shifting the main responsibility in some of the areas



covered by the project, such as project preparation, procurement and contracting, to technical
ministries and a central tender board which began receiving assistance from IDA and other donors for
institutional development. As a consequence, project objectives involving GDPS were reevaluated,
and their focus was changed to upstream work with donors and monitoring of the development
portfolio. By this time, CPO was offered expert support and training programs under bilateral
grants. Some of the training recommended under the project was thus financed by grants instead. As
a result of both developments, commitment of IDA funds slowed down.
5.     By 1989, the original closing date of the project (December 1989) was in sight, with
little progress over the preceding year. The completed project activities had cost substantially less
than estimates and a large unutilized balance remained. In that same year, the work on unification
between former North and South Yemen had taken a serious turn. Since unification implied the
amalgamation of the two administrations, most institutional development activities as well as plan
preparation had to be deferred. Government wished to maintain the project in order to support
institutional needs arising from the merger. IDA agreed with this request based on the following
considerations: First, the fundamental objective of the project, strengthening the central development
agency, was as valid as ever and strategy reviews in the Bank repeatedly identified institutional
reforms (in fact a broader administrative reform) as a very desirable objective for IDA operations.
Second, the flexible design of the project would lend itself (without formal restructuring) to further
institutional reform. Third, a single extension of about two years and a firm action plan would meet
the objective without extending the project's life beyond the average life of projects in Yemen at that
time (i.e. seven years).
6.     During 1990, the administration was overwhelmed with the logistics of a complicated
merger. The additional time provided in 1991, allowed a preliminary institutional survey of the
Ministry (by UNDP experts who prepared terms of reference for a study), and the completion of the
Action Plan. As a condition for a final two-year extension to implement this Plan, IDA required that
the equipment bids be evaluated and approved by all concerned; a training contract be approved with
an NGO that handled previous programs successfully; and experts be selected by UNDP to provide
support to the economic departments. These prerequisites were met and IDA granted a final two-year
extension. After the extension, none of the contracts were implemented and the project had virtually
no activity until its closing in 1993. It seems that a divergence of views occurred within the Ministry
on all aspects of the action plan and the relevant TA contracts. No further institutional action could
be contemplated because of the political difficulties encountered by the public administration, although
the Ministry was among the least afflicted. No budget or investment program could be approved on
time. Despite further requests for extension, the credit was closed in 1993.
7.     The credit amount was SDR 4.7 million, of which SDR 2.18 million was disbursed and the
balance was cancelled. Project costs for equipment and training were much lower than the estimates
because equipment costs fell dramatically throughout the computer industry, and training-performed
in the region-cost far less than had been assumed. Moreover, after the second year of
implementation, bilateral donors began offering grants for the kind of training and experts included in
the project. The Government preferred grant financing. The rise in value of the SDR also
contributed to reduce the financing needs. Closing date extensions were granted four times: for six
months (December 31, 1989 to June 30, 1990); for one year (until June 30, 1991); for three months
(until September 30, 1991); and for two years (until September 30, 1993). A total of 100 staff weeks
were used for project preparation, supervision, and preparation of the Implementation Completion



Report. Overseas training and expert services deployed under the project were 264 and 156 person-
months respectively. Total training amounted to about 450 person-months.
C.    Impact and Sustainability
8.     Support for data management provided results that exceeded the expectations of the original
design. The Data Bank evolved into the Central Statistical Office and prepared the first set of
national accounts for the unified country; more recently, it conducted major surveys such as the
household survey, a useful input for a future poverty assesstnent. This component had a positive
demonstration effect; other branches of the Government, notahly the Prime Minister's office, sought
to install data management systems of the same kind.
9.     The benefits of the training programs and expert services in the domain of project planning,
preparation, financing and monitoring remains with the Ministry which no longer needs external
assistance to fulfill these functions. Although its role has changed over time, the Department
responsible for project related activities is fully capable of fulfilling its functions. Indeed, its
technical staff have been quite accurate in identifying projects that would run into implementation
problems. Its operational data management needs are being addressed by bilateral assistance.
Responsibility for procurement and contracting has been shifted to the technical ministries and the
Tender Board. Nevertheless, the Ministry participates in these functions. While there is room for
improvement in Government's portfolio implementation, this is more an inter-ministerial issue than
one pertaining to the Ministry of Planning alone. For example, a management information system
developed under the project for monitoring portfolio implementation remains unutilized because the
Government does not require the project implementing ministries/agencies to input data. Hence a
global and up to date view of the portfolio(s) cannot be generated internally. Neither can any
Government agency supervise the entire portfolio in the absence of implementation data. IDA tries to
fill the information void by sharing data through the CPPR reviews, and through its Resident
Representative.
10.    Method and organization components were not implemented well. However, even if they had
been implemented as planned, the merger of the two agencies of planning in 1990 would have
changed much of the organizational structure. The merger made available a wider skill pool, but
because of the need to accommodate all civil servants and distribute positions evenly between the
North and the South, it created a heavy structure. This was anticipated and the project was
positioned, through extensions and the preparation of an institutional action plan, to address
institutional efficiency; an issue that still prevails. Unfortunately, the action plan was not
implemented while administrative reform and institutional development issues remained high in the
country's agenda.
11.   Key economic decisions are made by the High Economic Council (consisting of the ministers
with economic portfolios and the Central Bank Governor) which does not have a permanent
secretariat to carry out research and analysis. This task is shared by the Ministry of Planning, The
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. The project did not achieve noticeable results in building
up economic analysis capacity in the Ministry of Planning. Conversely, the Ministry has acquired the
capability to prepare public investment programs. Also it has a limited number of staff trained to
carry out the basic economic analysis that underpin economic adjustment programs. However, the
latter capability is not attributable to the project and it is not sufficiently institutionalized.

D.    Bank's and Borrower's Performance
12.   To take full advantage of external assistance, Yemen needs to be in a position to prepare and
implement development projects and programs. CPO, the government agency that had the statutory
mandate to plan investments and to interface with external donors, had a pivotal role in this area as
has the MPD today. In 1983-84, CPO and IDA identified the need to strengthen CPO, and together
designed a suitable project to that end. The project objectives remained valid throughout
implementation and continue to be so. The design was flexible and allowed adjustment under
changing circumstances. Had the second project implementation phase (the institutional action plan)
taken place, this feature would have born high rewards. Hence, the performance in project design
was good.
13.   Implementation up to the unification was in line with other projects in the IDA portfolio and
shared the same difficulties which are still present today. Beyond unification, the only achievement
has been the preparation of the institutional action plan which remains valid in the absence of a
broader administrative reform. IDA carried out fourteen supervision missions for a total of about 60
staff weeks monitoring and adjusting the project, designing the institutional review of the Ministry
and helping with the action plan. Project problems were discussed at every country implementation
review. The results from this effort were not entirely satisfactory but comparable to those from
several other projects in the portfolio. IDA staff appear to have underestimated the
political/administrative gridlock that followed the unification as did other donors. With hindsight, the
project/credit should have been closed when the first extension did not produce an institutional action
plan for the Ministry. More specifically, IDA should have set dates for contracts emanating from the
action plan to become effective with the added condition that-should these dates not be met-the
Credit would be closed.
E.    Lessons Learned
14.   The lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
-      During project implementation, grants could become available and displace IDA resources
earmarked for specific project activities. To limit this occurrence, project financing plans
should carefully assess the availability of alternative grant financing. Moreover, credit
agreements should provide for unilateral cancellation, at IDA's discretion, of any credit funds
displaced by grants not included in the financing plan.
Institutional development components of TA projects should be contingent upon Government
agreement on a detailed institutional plan for the ministry or agency concerned. Absence of
such an agreement should be considered as a red flag to successful project implementation.
Even with such a plan, TA for institutional development will have limited impact if there is
no Government commitment to a broader administrative reform.
In view of rapidly changing conditions and generally slow implementation, TA projects should
be kept as small and focussed as possible to avoid long implementation periods; alternatively,
when institutional development/administrative reform plans are available, a time-slice or credit
line approach could be considered together with a flexible design to tackle institutional needs
over a longer time period and under changing conditions.

Agreement should be reached with the Government that procurement and recruitment steps
should be completed during the 9-12 months while effectiveness is pending. Normally,
agencies do not act on procurement and recruitment until after credit effectiveness.
