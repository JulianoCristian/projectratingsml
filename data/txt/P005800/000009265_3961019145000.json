Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) during project\n            implementation, grants could become available and displace\n            International Development Association (IDA) resource\n            earmarked for specific project activities; (ii)\n            institutional development components of Technical Assistance\n            (TA) projects should be contingent upon government agreement\n            on a detailed institutional plan for the ministry or agency\n            concerned; (iii) in view of rapidly changing conditions and\n            generally slow implementation, TA projects should be kept as\n            small and focussed as possible to avoid long implementation\n            periods; and (iv) agreement should be reached with the\n            government that procurement and recruitment steps should be\n            completed during the 9-12 months while effectiveness is pending."}, "docdt": "1995-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
