Pernambuco Rural\n            Development Project are to increase production and\n            productivity of 15,540 small farms and 2,700 small non-farm\n            enterprises, to increase rural employment opportunities, and\n            to improve social and physical infrastructure in the Agreste\n            Setentrional Region of Pernambuco State. A related objective\n            is to improve the statewide effectiveness of institutions\n            participating in the project. The project provides for the\n            strengthening of agricultural and support services and\n            infrastructure, rural credit, technical assistance for small\n            non-farm industries, and institutional development of the\n            local executing agencies. Land tenure studies will be\n            carried out under the project to lay the basis for a new\n            land tenure policy in the Region. The main risk faced by the\n            project is that of not achieving active participation by,\n            and adequate coordination among, the various participating\n            agencies. To minimize this risk the State Government has\n            established an inter-agency Management Council and a Project\n            management Unit to coordinate and monitor project\n            implementation. Each executing agency will designate one\n            person as full time liaison with the Project Management\n            Unit. In addition the project provides for a detailed annual\n            work plan for each agency, consultant services, and contin"}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
