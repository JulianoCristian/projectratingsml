outcome is rated as satisfactory,\n            institutional development impact as modest, sustainability\n            as likely, borrower performance as satisfactory, and Bank\n            performance as satisfactory. OED assessment focused\n            particularly on one sub-component, the Integrated Pest\n            Management sub-component. It is the first time that OED has\n            looked at impact from this new and expanding area of Bank\n            rural lending. Efficiency and fiscal sustainability are\n            questionable in this component. The project offers five main\n            lessons: 1) Developing a poverty-related logical framework\n            helps to clarify the poverty rationale. 2) Mechanisms to\n            ensure sustainability become more a function of reforms that\n            deliver self-sustaining institutions and cost recovery at\n            the local level than public expenditure commitment from the\n            center. 3) This project raises efficiency and sustainability\n            questions about the use of separate PCUs. 4) Key elements in\n            scaling up extension include maximizing farmer-to-farmer\n            diffusion, enhancing the capacity of farmers to develop\n            their own solutions, cost recovery or privatization,\n            minimizing the cost of trainers through the use of\n            farmer-trainers, and low-cost mass media approach. 5)\n            Projects complex design could benefit from the Computer\n            Project Management systems to track and manage expenditure."}, "docdt": "2002-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
