satisfactory, with a likely sustainability, the\n            institutional development impact fell short of expectations,\n            partly due to the postponement of the study for\n            restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural\n            Development (MARD), where strengthening its policy planning\n            capacity should have been considered a matter of urgency.\n            Key lessons reinforce the notion that sound sector planning\n            should precede rural development projects, particularly in\n            transition countries, to achieve the expected agricultural\n            management results. Furthermore, provision should be made to\n            ensure continuity of supportive services following project\n            completion, for a potential replication to non-project\n            areas. Small-holder credit operations require independent,\n            and viable financial institutions, with qualified\n            experienced staff, and management to supervise, focusing on\n            timely repayments. Regarding administrative aspects, where\n            diverse project activities exist, it is worth considering\n            separate project coordination units for each component, in\n            addition to Bank staff continuity, to ensure close, and\n            flexible supervision for successful implementation. Finally,\n            government ownership is paramount in providing counterpart\n            funds for the sustenance of project activities, in a timely fashion."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
