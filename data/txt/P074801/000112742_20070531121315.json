The DSC series has complemented a parallel SDR 347\n            million Poverty Reduction Grant Facility (PRGF) program of\n            the IMF, due to be completed in June 2007. The Fourth\n            Development Support Credit Project operation, just like the\n            previous DSCs, supports implementation of the\n            Government's development strategy as laid out in its\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). In particular,\n            DSC-supported reforms have sought to (a) strengthen core\n            governance functions, with emphasis on reforms in public\n            procurement, budget formulation and budget execution, and\n            tax administration; and (b) improve the investment climate,\n            by maintaining macroeconomic stability, deepening domestic\n            deregulation and trade liberalization, and strengthening\n            performances of banking and energy sectors and state-owned enterprises"}, "docdt": "2007-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
