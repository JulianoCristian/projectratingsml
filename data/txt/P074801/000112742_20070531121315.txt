1.      Macroeconomic performance has been broadly in line with the objectives of the
PRGF-supported program. Over the last several years, economic activity has remained
strong and macroeconomic stability sustained, while poverty has been significantly reduced.
The external sector has been particularlyrobust with strong growth inexports and
remittances allowing for a considerable increase in international reserves. Recently, inflation
has increased and will likely require policy adjustments. With respect to fiscal policy, while
overall discipline has been maintained, revenue collectionhas consistently fallen short o f
targets under the PRGF-supported program. This, together with under-execution o f
development spending, continues to hamper the implementation o f the budget. Structural
reforms have progressed in several key areas, albeit often with significant delays.

Recent Economic Developments

2.      Growth remains strong spurred by export demand and rising private domestic
investment, but inflation has recently increased. GDP growth i s expected to continue at
around 6.7 percent inFY07, despite some supply-related disruptions, with lower agricultural
growth more than offset by strong manufacturing and service activities. Average inflation
picked up to 6.9 percent inMarchreflecting increases inboth food and nonfood prices.
Following fuel price hikes, average inflationi s projected to reach 7.2 percent inFY07 before
moderating duringthe course o f FY08.

3.      The exchange rate has been relatively stable and internationalreserves have
increased throughout the period of politicalupheaval. Reserves have reached beyond
$4 billion (approaching three months o f imports) on the back o f continued strong remittances
and exports, which are growing at 25 and 21percent, respectively. As credit to government
soared inthe first half o f the fiscal year, broadmoney growth reached a recordhigho f
22 percent inDecember and several end-December performance criteria were missed. While
BangladeshBank (BB) has moved to bring its net domestic assets inline with the PRGF-
supported program, broad money and private credit are still growing at 20 and 17 percent,
respectively.

4.      The execution of the FY07budget has been problematic. Spending accelerated
early inthe fiscal year sending domestic financing off track. Revenue shortfalls and delays in
external disbursements further aggravated the situation requiringexpenditure cuts later inthe
year to bringthe overall deficit back in line with the budget framework. Revenue, as a
percent o f GDP, i s expected to decline by 0.2 percentage points inFY07, rather than improve
by 0.4 percentage points as targeted under the PRGF-supportedprogram.

Outlook and Risks

5.       Growthis expected to remainaround6%-7 percentover the mediumterm.
Buoyant garment exports and remittance flows, as well as the possibility o fhigher aid and
private flows, should help sustain investment. Inflation could be contained at around
6% percent inFY08 with some adjustment inpolicies and aided by an expected leveling o f f
of international food and commodity prices. This scenario, however, depends crucially on the
government's ability to improve governance-especially       inthe power sector, makeprogress
on substantial infrastructure deficiencies inthe ports and transportation system, improve
labor skills, and address other constraints faced by investors. The current account may slip
into deficit ifinvestment and import growth strengthen, but international reserves would
increase with higher aid flows and foreign investment. To meet the large social and
infrastructure spending needs, revenue performance will needto be substantially improved.
Political stability, including progress toward credible elections with continued broad support
for the transitional government, will be an important factor insustaining investor and donor
confidence.

Macroeconomic Policies

6.       Addressing the perennialrevenue challenge in a sustainableway will likely
requirean overhaulof existing legislationto simplifythe system andbroadenthe tax
base.Numerous amendmentsto legislation over the years have createdtax lawsthat are
complicated and hardto administer. Systemic reform i s necessary to achieve the full benefits
o f ongoing tax administration reforms and to support further trade liberalization.

7.       The FY08budget aims at realistic revenueand spendingtargets.The authorities
are planning for an increase inrevenue to 10.6 percent o f GDP based on specific measures
and better governance, while expenditure priorities will focus on higher social safety net
spending and a more realistic 0.6 percent o f GDP increase inthe annual development
program. The overall budget deficit i s targeted to increase to 5.2 percent o f GDP once the
government assumes the stock o f nonperformingloans o f the state-owned petroleum
company (BPC) with domestic banks accumulated over several years amounting to
1.6 percent o f GDP. The underlyingdeficit (Le., the overall deficit excluding the impact o f
assuming SOE debt) would remain around 3% percent o f GDP. Price increases for fuel,
electricity, and fertilizer already implemented have substantially reduced SOE losses, but
hrther adjustments will be needed (see 710).

8.      A further tighteningof monetarypolicyis likely to be neededinthe face of
strong foreigninflowsand risinginflation.Inrecent months, ample liquidity(arising from
strong exports and remittances) has emerged as the main challenge for monetary policy.
Although monetary and credit aggregates have retreated from their peaks inDecember, they
are still growing well above the authorities' targets. The recentjump ininflation, coupled

                                                3


with the April hike infuel prices, reinforces the need for some monetary tightening,
including to firmly anchor inflationary expectations.

9.      T o support the objectives of monetarypolicy,there i s scopeto moderatethe pace
of reserve accumulation.A modest real appreciation o fthe exchange rate i s currentlytaking
place through higher inflation. Given the continued strong export performance and growth in
remittances, BB i s close to reaching a comfortable reserve position and could moderate its
reserve accumulation to allow for more movement inthe nominal exchange rate.

StructuralReforms

10.     Petroleumpricingpolicy has contributedto largequasi-fiscallosses ofthe state-
owned enterprises, particularlyinthe petroleum,power, and fertilizer companies. The
petroleum price adjustments o f April 2 (16-2 1percent) have brought retail prices closer to
full cost-recovery levels (about 88 percent), but inthe absence o f further price adjustment
(and at current international prices) losses would continue at about ?4percent of GDP
annually. To avoid the re-accumulation o f losses inBPC, it i s imperative to introduce an
automatic mechanism o f price adjustment and improve operational efficiency. Further
adjustments inelectricity tariffs and fertilizer prices, and financial restructuring o f the state-
owned electricity companies, will be needed. Adjustment o f natural gas prices, which is also
overdue, would reduce distortions and contribute to government revenue.

11.     BangladeshBankhas advancedreformsaimedat deepening financialmarkets,
butfurther efforts are neededto preservebanksoundness and enhance financial
intermediation.The regulatory framework has been strengthened, off-site and on-site
supervision has been enhanced, and steps are being taken to restructure, corporatize, and
privatize the large NCBs. However, the observed improvements inpublished aggregate
indicators o f bank soundness conceal wide divergences inindividual banks' performance and
mask the underlying weaknesses inthe banking system because o f underestimation o f the
capital shortfall and loan classification rules that are less stringentthan international
standards. Accordingly, the proposed amendment to the Banking Companies Act i s a
welcome step to further strengthen loan classification guidelines and gradually raise banks'
minimumcapitalrequirements. Corporatization ofthe NCBs will needto be accompanied by
appointment o f qualified directors that can guide and implement restructuring programs at
these banks.

Status of IMFRelations

12.    Bangladesh's three-year PRGF arrangementwas approvedinJune 2003, with
an initialcommitment of SDR 347 million(65 percentof quota). This was later
augmented by SDR 53 million (10 percent o f quota) inaccordance with the IMF's Trade
IntegrationMechanism(TIM). A total o f SDR 317 million has been drawn as o f
March 31,2007. Several performance criteria were missed for the final review on account o f

                                               4


accelerated spendingby the outgoing government and weak revenue collection and revenue
administration reform efforts. Notwithstandingsome recent improvements that are moving
things inthe right direction, not all programtargets have beenbrought back inline as of end-
March 2007, which will likelypreclude completion o fthe review. The PRGF arrangement
will expire onJune 19,2007.

13.     The most recentArticle IV consultationwas discussedby the ExecutiveBoardof
the IMFinJune 2005. The next Article IV consultation is scheduled to be discussedby the
BoardinJune 2007. The transitional government has emphasized its commitment to advance
reforms during its tenure and i s keen for early negotiation o f a follow-on PRGF. Staffwill
decide on next steps after taking into account the views expressedat the IMFBoard
discussion.
