operations, known as Development Support\n            Credits (DSCs). As part o f this series, four credits have\n            been provided to Bangladesh since 2003; the last credit, the\n            Fourth Development Support Credit (DSC IV), was approved by\n            the Board in May 2007. These credits have supported\n            Bangladesh's reform efforts to (a) strengthen core\n            governance functions with emphasis on reforms in public\n            procurement, budget formulation and execution, tax\n            administration, and public administration; and (b) improve\n            the investment climate by maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability, deepening domestic deregulation and trade\n            liberalization, and strengthening performance of the banking\n            and energy sectors and of state-owned enterprises. The\n            proposed Supplemental Financing envisages reducing the\n            pressure on the government's FYO8 budget arising from\n            the unforeseen flood related spending, which in turn will\n            allow it to continue moving forward on the policy and\n            institutional reform agenda supported by DSCs."}, "docdt": "2007-09-12T00:00:00Z"}
