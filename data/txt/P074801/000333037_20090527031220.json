Third\n            Development Support Credit (DSC) Project for Bangladesh were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Second Development Support\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Fourth Development Support Credit Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank must\n            maintain a close dialogue with political parties out of\n            power and with other key opinion makers to have a better\n            assessment of the support for reforms. This approach is\n            strategic and must be done even while working closely with\n            and supporting like minded governments. Such an approach\n            helps to mitigate risks of possible reversals if and when\n            the ruling parties change, and to avoid the appearance of\n            playing favorites. The Bank needs to do much more targeted\n            and tailored engagement and communication with stakeholders,\n            quite apart from the Government. This is needed for\n            deepening ownership and support for reforms under\n            programmatic loans, such as the DSC. Such an approach\n            becomes all the more critical during the tenure of an\n            elected government which tends to be disproportionately\n            sensitive to public opinion and is, oftentimes, reluctant to\n            make unpopular policy choices."}, "docdt": "2009-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
