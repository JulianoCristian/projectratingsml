Key lessons learned include: 1)\n            It is possible for even a very complex multi-State project\n            to be successful with full ownership and commitment of the\n            States. 2) Effective coordination and periodic joint reviews\n            can lead to cooperation, knowledge sharing and healthy\n            competition between project entities. 3) With the current\n            emphasis on decentralization, more Bank attention should be\n            given to local implementers. 4) In a complex multi-State\n            project covering a large number of wide-spread project\n            locations, decentralized procurement would be more\n            efficient. 5) Timely creation and filling of key staff\n            positions with qualified and trained staff is most critical\n            for success of an education project to ensure quality. 6)\n            The project could have reached a higher degree of success\n            with greater institutional autonomy of polytechnics and\n            decentralization. 7) The very significant increase in women\n            enrollment in polytechnics indicated their keen desire to\n            enter new areas like electronics, computers, etc., if proper\n            atmosphere and opportunities are created and supported by\n            visible policy measures like reservation in employment. 8)\n            Technical training of the handicapped needs special efforts,\n            tools, and teaching skills."}, "docdt": "1999-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
