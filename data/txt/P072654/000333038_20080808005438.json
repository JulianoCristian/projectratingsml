       Project for East Timor were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            flexible design (or a process approach) mandates especially\n            a carefully designed and effective monitor and evolution\n            (M&E) system to provide constant and early feedback\n            towards identifying needed implementation adjustments. Where\n            institutional development includes the need for new\n            legislation and regulations, arrangements must be in place\n            to provide for independent qualified reviews of proposals\n            coming out of public-private dialogue, and of draft\n            legislation. In-country Bank staff assigned to an operation\n            should be standard practice when there are significant local\n            capacity constraints.
