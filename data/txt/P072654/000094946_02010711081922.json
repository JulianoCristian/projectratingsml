There are four project\n            components. The first extends a further line of credit to be\n            offered on commerical terms. The SEP II line of credit will\n            draw extensively upon lessons learned during SEP I (See\n            report no. 20206). Accordingly, the line of credit will be\n            similar in style and function to that in SEP I but will\n            incorporate adjustments to the delivery method, targeting,\n            interest rate, and management processes. In addition to the\n            agri-business sector, viable loan applications from other\n            productive industries such as small-scale carpentry shops,\n            mechanical centers or manufacturing facilities will also be\n            supported. The second component finances business\n            development services, civil service training, and the\n            development of the business enabling environment. The third\n            component funds sub-grants to 13 districts for market\n            rehabilitation, specifically produce and goods market\n            facilities. The fourth component finances consultant\n            services, incremental operating costs, and project\n            implementation unit (PIU) training, as well as other\n            miscellaneous items for the PIU office."}, "docdt": "2001-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
