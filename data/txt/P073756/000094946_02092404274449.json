      financial institutions; phase-out of the crisis management\n            agency Financial Sector Adjustment Company Limited (FINSAC);\n            restructuring, and management of the public debt arising\n            from the resolution of the financial crisis; regulatory, and\n            supervisory reforms in the financial sector; and, improving\n            the financial infrastructure for renewed bank lending. The\n            project will contribute to moving the resolution of the\n            financial crisis toward completion, by supporting the\n            disposal of majority equity stakes in the last two\n            remaining, major government financial institutions to\n            foreign investors; and, will enable the Government to\n            continue its efforts at servicing the liabilities generated\n            during the crisis in cash. Moreover, it will support the\n            strengthening of regulatory, and supervisory framework for\n            the financial sector in the country, including support the\n            debt management program by lengthening the maturities of the\n            pubic debt, and replacement of stock, of relatively\n            expensive, shorter-term, domestic debt with relatively\n            cheaper international debt (assuming only modest\n            depreciation of the Jamaican currency). While risks exist,\n            i.e., exogenous economic shocks, actions taken by the\n            Government have changed the nature of risks, and contributed\n            to increase confidence in risk management."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
