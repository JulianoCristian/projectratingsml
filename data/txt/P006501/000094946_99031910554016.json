It also assesses direct impacts on the\n            beneficiaries as anticipated by the projects, and indirect\n            side-effects on the development of local economies focusing\n            on employment and income generation. The study evaluates the\n            impacts of two successful MDPs, in the Philippines and in\n            Brazil. They provide a rich base for the study to extract\n            lessons for ongoing and future projects. Three sets of data\n            were collected and analyzed: municipal finance data of local\n            governments, a sample survey of mayors on capacity building,\n            and a survey of stall-holders in public markets. At both the\n            municipal and the beneficiary levels, the study compared\n            impacts on the participating municipalities with conditions\n            of the non-participating municipalities, and the initial\n            conditions with the impacts after the project implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
