Bank has made available a\n            substantial amount of resources for Cameroon's economic\n            and social development and has helped shape economic and\n            social policy in the country. In spite of the difficult\n            political context, the Government has taken courageous\n            measures as part of its economic reform program. Although\n            these efforts merit support, government's demonstrated\n            willingness to pursue reforms, in spite of political\n            problems, is essential to continued the International\n            Development Association's (IDA) support. As proposed in\n            the strategy, IDA will continue to support a coherent set of\n            reforms and will play the catalytic role of mobilizing other\n            donors' support to fill the gap left by IDA. Under the\n            assumption that implementation of the reform program will\n            stay on track and that Cameroon will live up to its\n            commitments under the Economic Recovery Credit Project and\n            its economic reform program, IDA will pursue the\n            implementation of reforms in macroeconomic management,\n            including public procurement reform in collaboration with\n            Cameroon's other partners. The IDA lending program will\n            support Cameroon's efforts to attain these goals."}, "docdt": "1994-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
