Project for Poland were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance during implementation was also satisfactory, and\n            the recipient's performance was more satisfactory\n            during appraisal and implementation than during\n            identification and preparation. Some lessons learned\n            included: the project was intended to test a balance of\n            in-situ and ex-situ conservation, depending upon the\n            imminence of the threat on the environment. To date, it has\n            demonstrated that in-situ conservation is more\n            cost-effective than ex-situ conservation, and that the time\n            horizon of the threat and outside social and economic forces\n            are factors to consider when allocating scarce resources.\n            Furthermore, it teaches that without directly linking\n            in-situ restoration activities to ex-situ conservation, the\n            usefulness of the latter is jeopardized. The project\n            suffered from a lack of proactive, thoughtful\n            outreach/public relation activities at local as well as\n            national level. It must be recognized, however, that at the\n            local level, after a certain resistance was overcome, the\n            project was able to generate some important support for\n            Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF) through outreach activities\n            like man and the biosphere."}, "docdt": "1998-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
