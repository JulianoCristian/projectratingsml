Lessons cited included:\n            1) Financial Intermediation Operations are good vehicles to\n            help smaller banks engage in international finance. 2) A\n            credit line operation dramatically improves understanding of\n            the prevailing conditions in the banking markets and of the\n            financial condition of major banking institutions. This\n            understanding can better focus the policy dialogue or\n            improve the design of adjustment operations.3) The\n            Bank's ability to assist with the critical elements of\n            the macroeconomic framework and reforms programs, and get\n            directly involved with individual banks and their clients\n            seemed to be an important factor in the Project's\n            success. 4) Project design should be simple and make\n            accessing funds easier. 5) Benefits to banks in\n            participating in a Bank credit line operation extend beyond\n            access to Bank funding. 6) Demonstration and spill-over\n            effects can be as important in developing the local economy.\n            7) The objectives, expectations, and performance indicators\n            of technical assistance in a credit line operation should be\n            realistic.8)  Building technical and managerial capacity in\n            the project implementation unit is critical. 9) Staffing\n            continuity facilitates project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
