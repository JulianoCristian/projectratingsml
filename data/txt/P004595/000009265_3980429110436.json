This\n            project consists of four components.  First, subloans for\n            local government units (LGUs) subprojects will support\n            investments in upland agriculture, community forestry,\n            coastal resources and nearshore fisheries, and small scale\n            rural infrastructure.  Second, Municipal Development Fund\n            (MDF) rural window initiative and project management will\n            support the overall project management and the appraisal of\n            subprojects.  Third, planning and implementation support for\n            LGUs will provide training in preparing development plans,\n            and will manage procurement and financial matters.  Fourth,\n            environmental technology transfer and policy management will\n            a) support DENR (Department of Environment and Natural\n            Resources) in site verification, training, and conducting\n            studies on tenurial instruments; b) will support the\n            production and packaging of technology, verification of\n            technology, and preparation of environment reports; and c)\n            will finance the technical services for coastal and aquatic resources."}, "docdt": "1998-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
