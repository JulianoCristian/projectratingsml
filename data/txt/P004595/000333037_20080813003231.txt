F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective

The main project development objective (PDO) was to reduce rural poverty and environmental
degradation through support for locally generated and implemented natural resource management
sub-projects. The project aimed at: (a) enhancing the capacity of low-income rural local
government units (LGUs) and communities to plan, implement and sustain priority natural
resource management projects; (b) strengthening central government systems to transfer finance
(as financial intermediaries) and environmental technology, and improve the implementation of
environmental policies; and (c) providing resources to local government units to finance natural
resource management projects.

Revised Project Development Objective

The PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the project.

                          (from approval         (from approval          Target         at Completion or
                            documents)             documents)            Values           Target Years
 PDO Indicator 1        Household incomes are increased.

                                           increased.
 Date achieved                  -                       -                    -            December 2006
 Comments               The project exceeded the PDO target. A higher proportion of households were able
                        to achieve an increase in income as a result of the active participation of People's
                        Organizations (POs) through a community-driven development (CDD) process.
                        The extent to which incomes were increased varied widely across the households
                        from short-term labor opportunities to sustained and substantial income increases.
 PDO Indicator 2        Management of natural resources is improved.
 Value                  None stated        To be measured in                 -        All Key Indicators were
                                           terms of the outcome                       achieved.
                                           indicators (below).
 Date achieved                  -                       -                    -            December 2006
 Comments               The management of natural resources was improved in 100 percent of the sites,
                        apart from the 30 sites that were dropped during the initial restructuring where
                        implementation had not commenced. An additional 18 sites were included later in
                        the project and reached comparable levels of performance. Varying degrees of
                        improvement were seen depending on the nature of the local resources, the capacity
                        of the LGU and the community, and the level of support available through the
                        partner agencies.

 Comments       Targets for upland and forestry practices were established at the operational level, based
                on site plans per municipality. Overall interventions for natural resource management
                upland and forestry activities are assessed at 96 percent achievement of the 2003 interim
                targets. Achievements were close to targets because works were contracted to
                community members and the final payment was not approved until all the agreed works
                were completed.

 Comments       The achievements for rural infrastructure were generated through a community-driven
                development (CDD) approach that was "demand-driven". An operational policy was
                approved in 2000 which removed new roads and irrigation from the sub-project menu
                due to potential for negative environmental impact.

Comments       The improvement of LGU capacity was close to or exceeded the interim targets except
               for financial management which, despite significant improvements in some LGUs, still
               remained weaker than targeted. This was partly because of the limited availability of
                staff with detailed knowledge of the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO)
                financial processes.

               training sessions and also technical support from the project, LGU and partner agency
               staff. The proportion of loans repaid on time is below the target partly as a result of the
               late commencement of income-generating activities and also LGUs amending payment
               schedules in collaboration with the groups (which was not recorded in the project data-

Comments          Loans made to LGUs were issued through the newly-created "rural window" that was a
                  key achievement of the project. The establishment of the loan approval process required
                  streamlining, but once approval processes were simplified the rate of loans increased.
                  Repayments are collected by capture of government revenue funds for the respective
                  LGU prior to their disbursement. The five percent "delinquency rate" was mainly the
                  result of LGUs that requested and were granted a deferral of loan repayment deduction
                  because of difficulties experienced with typhoons or similar calamities.

growth had declined from 5.8 percent per annum in 1970-1979 to 2.1 percent per annum in 1980-
1989 and had risen slightly to 2.2 percent per annum in the period prior to project design (1990-
1994). The incidence of poverty in the Philippines at the time of appraisal was 50 percent in rural
areas and 34 percent for the country as a whole1.

1.1.2   The highest poverty incidence was identified in areas of degraded natural resources,
particularly upland and coastal areas. Fishermen and forestry workers were amongst the poorest
                                                                                    2

in the country. Logging activities and destructive land-use practices had reduced the original 17
                                                                                  3

million ha of forest cover in the country to 5.5 million ha. Steadily growing population pressures,
displacement of marginal and indigenous peoples with traditional stewardship patterns in
resource management, and the lack of legal and practical mechanisms for resource protection
were all leading to the conversion of forest land into marginal upland farming. Over-fishing; soil,
coastal and reef erosion; pollution; destruction of mangrove forest; and unsustainable fishing
practices had led to a steadily-reduced fish catch and increasing subsistence farming in fragile
coastal zones.

1.1.3   At the same time, the Bank and the government were supporting decentralization and
improved local governance in poverty reduction and sustainable development activities. Two key
challenges were identified in the decentralization processes and the resultant greater
responsibility of LGUs in improved environmental management. These were: (a) the difficulty in
channeling funds from the national government to LGUs for investment programs; and (b) the
low involvement of LGUs in long-term natural resource improvement programs aimed at
sustainable economic growth.

1.1.4   The rationale for Bank assistance was three-fold: (a) its experience in investment in the
rural sector to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty; (b) its commitment to support the
government in improved environmental management measures; and (c) its interest and experience
in providing assistance to the government and participating LGUs in improved decentralization
financing mechanisms.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

1.2.1   The main objective of the project was to reduce rural poverty and environmental
degradation through support for locally generated and implemented natural resource management
(NRM) sub-projects. This was to be achieved through: (a) enhancing the capacity of low-income
LGUs and communities to plan, implement and sustain priority NRM projects; (b) strengthening
central government systems to transfer finance (as financial intermediaries) and environmental


1 The PAD referred to 1994 poverty data. The population at that time was estimated at 67.5 million.
2 Fishermen and forest workers accounted for 76.7 percent and 82.6 percent, respectively, of the rural population.
3 There were almost 800 legal and illegal Timber License Agreements during its peak in the 1960s and 1970s.

technology, and improve the implementation of environmental policies; and (c) providing
resources to LGUs to finance NRM sub-projects. The main indicator of reduced rural poverty
was defined as an increase in the incomes of 25 percent of beneficiary households.

1.2.2     The main indicators of reduced environmental degradation were more complex, and were
defined in terms of the project outcomes (described somewhat confusingly as "specific
development objectives" in the PAD text and as "project outputs" in the PAD Project Design
Summary). These were expected to be:

(a) the improved management of upland and forestry resources, the indicators for which
would be: (i) a reduction in deforestation; (ii) an increase in vegetation cover; (iii) a reduction in
soil erosion; and (iv) an increase in the area of perennial crops.

(b) an improvement in coastal and near-shore fisheries resources, the indicators for which
would be: (i) an expansion in the area under mangrove forest; (ii) a reversal in the decline of fish
catches; and (iii) an increase in the area of artificial reefs and fish sanctuaries.

(c) an improvement in infrastructure in support of the management of upland, coastal and near-
shore natural resources, the indicators for which would be improvements in rural roads (through
new construction and rehabilitation of existing roads), water supply, sanitation facilities,
irrigation systems and other small-scale infrastructure.

(d) an improvement in the capacity of LGUs to improve livelihoods and manage natural
resources, the indicators for which would be: (i) the number of LGUs requesting eligible sub-
projects; (ii) the proportion of sub-project proposals approved (which would reach 75 percent);
(iii) the number of LGUs receiving training; and (iv) the proportion of loans repaid on time
(which would reach 90 percent).

(e) a strengthened capacity of barangays (villages) to implement improved livelihood and NRM
practices, the indicators for which would be: (i) the number of barangays requesting sub-projects;
(ii) the proportion of approved sub-projects being implemented (which would reach 75 percent);
(iii) the number of barangays receiving training; and (iv) the proportion of loans being repaid on
time (which would reach 90 percent).

(f) the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) rural window would be shown to be viable, the
indicators for which would be: (i) the number of loans made; and (ii) the achievement of an
improved repayment rate (of  90 percent) and an improved delinquency rate (of  10 percent).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Performance Indicators

1.3.1     There was no revision of the PDO during project implementation. The project was first
restructured during the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in 2000; the changes made were related mainly
to corrective measures in implementation processes and capacity development needs within the
implementing agency. The second restructuring, in June 2002, was largely focused on adapting
the project design to a more decentralized approach and introducing the CDD procurement
mechanisms. Both restructurings included the generation of specific targets in relation to the
intermediate outcome indicators and in response to the specific planning occurring through the
community-led planning processes. However, no formally recorded change in Intermediate
Outcome Indicators or targets was registered in the Bank's system. One operational amendment
to the original indicators occurred as the result of an internal project policy decision not to
approve sub-project proposals for new road construction or irrigation because of the potential


                                                    2

negative environmental impacts. As a result, these were not retained as key indicators during
implementation.

1.3.2    Overall, the Key Performance Indicators were biased downwards being "output"
indicators. Outcome indicators where included were difficult to assess in the absence of the
necessary base-line. It is important to emphasize that the project was among the first in the
Bank's portfolio at a time that it was beginning a substantive engagement in supporting different
aspects of decentralization and the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1992, and in that respect
was breaking new ground.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1    The main beneficiaries were those LGUs with a high proportion of small farmers,
fishermen and people generating income from forest products. Fishermen and forestry workers
were identified at appraisal to be amongst the poorest in rural Philippines, with a poverty
incidence of 76.7 percent and 82.6 percent, respectively, of the rural poor. Likewise, poverty
incidence in the uplands was recorded at 61 percent at the time of project design, which was
considerably higher than the rural average of 54 percent4. The beneficiaries relied heavily on
natural resources for their livelihood. Project sites were approved on the basis of two broad
criteria: (a) the identification of four focus regions with a high proportion of environmental
concerns and high poverty incidence; and (b) a demand-driven approach where LGUs expressed
interest in participating in the project and had sufficient commitment to provide the necessary
counterpart funds. The four selected regions (Regions 5, 7, 8 and 13) include provinces such as
Masbate that were, and still are, amongst the poorest in the country.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1    The project had four components. The costs estimated at appraisal included price but not
physical contingency provisions.

Component 1: Sub-projects in Natural Resource Management (appraisal cost US$46.9
million, 69.5 percent of total project cost). This component was designed to finance investments
in NRM via grants and loans to LGUs made through a new rural window of the MDF.
Investment sub-projects were grouped into three categories: (a) upland agriculture and forestry;
(b) coastal resource and near-shore fisheries; and (c) small rural infrastructure and livelihood
activities related to NRM.

Component 2: Planning and Implementation Support to LGUs (appraisal cost US$6.7
million, 9.9 percent of total project cost). This component was designed to support LGUs and
their barangays, through training and equipment supply, in the planning and implementation of
sub-projects.

Component 3: Initiating a Municipal Development Fund Rural Window and Project
Management (appraisal cost US$7.4 million, 11.0 percent of total project cost). This component
was designed to support a project management office that would be incorporated into the
structure of the MDF after a period of three years.

Component 4: Environmental Technology Transfer and Policy Implementation (appraisal
cost US$6.5 million, 9.6 percent of the total project cost). The Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Agriculture (DA) were to be supported to
transfer natural resource management technology to the LGUs and to improve the management of
environmental policies.

1.5.2    Component One directly contributed to the Intermediate Outcome Indicators 1, 2 & 3
related to both NRM and income generation. Components Two, Three and Four had an
institutional development focus at national, regional, provincial and local levels. Component
Two, although designed to result in the sub-projects supported in Component One, sought to
improve the capacity of the LGUs to access and manage financing for natural resource
management sub-projects provided through Component Three. Component Three was the crux
of the project ­ the establishment of a Rural Window for LGUs that would be sustained beyond
the project period. Component Four was an institutional support component to create a more
enabling environment for both the MDFO financing window and for the LGUs to implement sub-
projects, and repay the loan amortization. The four components combined to develop a viable
financing mechanism for natural resource management initiatives that would reduce both rural
poverty and environmental degradation.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1    The components were not revised during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1.   Design. Project corrective restructuring occurred after the MTR when the project was
rated as "unsatisfactory" in terms of progress towards achievement of the development objective.
Key criticisms were raised in the MTR regarding the design, particularly that some features were
unrealistic and that the procedures in the LGU financing window were cumbersome. Although
the overall design remained the same as at appraisal, the changes to the design included a
simplified and more flexible process for the LGU financing window. This was also a period
when the MDF was undergoing institutional change, driven by discussions in government on the
parameters that should be guiding the additional transfer of funds to LGUs through the MDF and
on the transformation of the MDF into the MDFO. In 2002, an adaptation of project procedures
was carried out to include a CDD approach in planning, procurement and implementation.

1.7.2    Implementation arrangements. In line with the design changes, decision-making was
devolved to regional levels; processes and review procedures were simplified; an expanded menu
for infrastructure sub-projects provided greater flexibility in implementation and multi-agency
efforts were enhanced. A specific focus was placed on the formation and strengthening of POs as
a key implementation modality. These changes were approved through formal supervision
missions, and with reference to specific thematic technical missions fielded by the Bank to assist
in the restructure.

1.7.3 Implementation schedule. There were two extensions to the project time-frame. The
first extension of the Loan Closing Date of two years was made largely to overcome early delays
in implementation. A further one-year extension of the Closing Date was approved because
implementation momentum had been achieved and additional funds (the result of exchange rate
shifts) were available to allow completion of works in progress.




                                                  4

1.7.4    Scope and Scale. The scope of the project was reduced from 120 LGUs to 90 LGUs
during the MTR. A further eight LGUs were removed because of non-compliance in
performance in 2002. New LGUs were allowed to enter the project at that time, leading to a final
coverage of 102 LGUs (85 percent of projected scope). The change in scope resulted in a
reduction in the target number of families benefiting, from 27,300 households and 300,000
indirect beneficiaries (including non-participating household members and indirect beneficiaries
of infrastructure sub-projects) to 23,205 households and 255,000 indirect beneficiaries5.

1.7.5    Project Financing. The Philippine Peso (PhP) was devalued substantially during the
project period in relation to the US$, from US$1 = PhP34.05 in 1997 to US$1 = PhP51.00 in
2001. Consequently, a partial loan cancellation of US$10 million was made in July 2001. A
further cancellation of US$2 million was made during September 2002, mainly as a result of
savings through further exchange rate shifts (US$1 = PhP51.60 in 2002). Figure 1 shows how, by
project closing, the actual disbursement exceeded the original projected loan amount in PhP terms
even with the two partial Loan cancellations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1    Soundness of Background Analysis. The project's core design was sound and based on
adequately reasoned analysis. The main premise of the project was institutional development to
provide a mechanism for financing to LGUs for natural resource management subprojects.
Targeting mechanisms were appropriate to the identified beneficiaries. In terms of technical
implementation, the project may have been better placed within DENR; however, given the focus
on institutional development, the mechanisms proposed were realistic. The analysis identified that
MDFO was a relatively new institution with limited capacity, and proposed capacity building
support. Similarly, the lack of experience of the LGUs was identified and addressed in the
analysis. Linking natural resource management initiatives and income generation was an




5There had been a rough revised target of 20,000 households generated during the restructuring, but this was further
refined during more detailed technical assistance on M&E following the restructuring.

innovation that had been trialed in the previous SECAL6 project. The project design
acknowledged the lessons learned and integrated learning in the project design.

2.1.2    Key factors and issues on the Quality at Entry: The key factor affecting quality at
entry was the limited capability and experience of MDFO to establish the necessary
implementation processes. A lack of project management experience, delays in recruiting and
hiring staff, the high turn-over of key staff and overly bureaucratic procedures were barriers to
smooth project establishment and early implementation (see also Section 5.1 (a)). The absence of
base-line data was also a serious impediment to the establishment of project monitoring.

2.1.3    Assessment of project design: The significant income and environmental impact of the
project has borne out the basic appropriateness of the planned interventions (see the PDO
Indicators in the Data Sheet). The components were relevant to the needs of the project partners.
Issues arose in execution of the design during the early stages. The issues were not due to design
gaps or technical difficulties, rather due to the capability of the implementers to move the design
from concept to operations (see also paragraph 3.1.2).

2.1.4    Government commitment: The government was committed to the project from
commencement and remained committed throughout the project period, demonstrating substantial
efforts to address the project requirements. The project design did recommend a focus on the
institutional development of the MDFO but there was insufficient preparation on the part of the
MDFO to fulfill the required role in the early stages of the project. The lack of implementation
experience of the Department of Finance (DoF) MDFO contributed to a slow project start-up and
initial implementation bottlenecks. The intensified focus by the Bank and implementing partners
on institutional arrangements and project management after the MTR redressed the capacity gaps
as shown by the improved performance later in the project.

2.1.5    Risks: The PAD identified five modest risks to project performance. These were: (a) the
potential for adverse weather conditions; (b) a potential lack of commitment to operation and
maintenance; (c) a low level of demand from LGUs for investment in non-revenue-raising sub-
projects; (d) possible inadequate or untimely provision of counterpart funds; and (e) possible
changes in LGU leadership reducing the commitment and/or implementation capacity. Risks (a)
and (e) both materialized and had an impact on the project, particularly in relation to the
infrastructure sub-projects, but risks (b), (c) and (d) did not occur. The ICR mission found that
the quality of infrastructure construction and maintenance was moderately good.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1    Major Factors Affecting Implementation: Project implementation was slow in the
early stages. Initial establishment was delayed by four months because of the change in national
administration after the November 1998 national elections. Undue complexities in the proposed
project policies and procedures further delayed implementation processes. These included over-
centralized clearance processes, fund flow problems and cumbersome procurement procedures
that created delays in operation and disbursements. The centralization of project processes
partially arose from the unfamiliarity of partners with the design, to which was added the lack of
experience of MDFO as an implementing agency and in technical aspects of NRM. As a result,
by 2001 a gap had emerged between targeted and actual performance (see Figure 2).

2.2.2     After the project was restructured, the gap narrowed and, by project completion,
          implementation performance had recovered. The decentralization of project processes in
          2002 was a major step in accelerating implementation. Engaging the regional and local
          offices of the implementing partners increased commitment to project outcomes and
          allowed more autonomy in decision-making. With the added step of incorporating CDD
          processes into the project, implementation accelerated rapidly.

2.2.3     Quality of Supervision: Supervision missions were conducted regularly and with an
appropriate mix of technical expertise. Additional technical supervision missions were conducted
during the restructuring process to assist with correcting initial procedural barriers and to install
adapted procedures following CDD principles. (See also 5.1.3 (b))

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1     Design of M&E: At the design stage, the monitoring of the project was to be carried out
by the Community Based Resource Management Office (CBRMO) and by the MDFO after three
years. This process was designed to provide the Bank with semi-annual progress reports and to
contribute to an integrated M&E system within the MDFO for continuing LGU financing. In the
initial stages of the project, there was no baseline study conducted to provide a basis for
performance measurement of intermediate outcome indicators. The second restructuring led to a
clearer focus on the demand-driven nature of the project. Operational targets were established,
based on the community planning processes, and provided a basis for measuring the
implementation performance of the project towards the expected intermediate outcomes8.

2.3.2     Implementation of M&E: The M&E system installed was operational in terms of
measuring inputs and outputs, but had weak linkages to the Intermediate Outcome and

7The weighted target is generated internally by the project as a progressive interim target. Measurement of progress in
relation to the targets did have some data gaps and errors but the overall trends are consistent across all project areas.
8However, these targets were never formally recorded as a design/target change.



                                                            7

Development Objective Indicators. During the restructurings, additional M&E technical
assistance was provided by the Bank. This led to the formulation of a retrospective base-line in
an endeavor to gain a more accurate assessment of progress. However, assistance provided did
not translate into a comprehensive, operational M&E system and the focus on input-output
monitoring continued. Despite twelve Management Information Training sessions, some data
and cross verification gaps remain: for example, there is insufficient data on infrastructure
operation to assess its usage, survival rates of rehabilitation planting are not sufficiently verified,
and the reported changes in fish catches are based mainly on anecdotal evidence.

2.3.3    Utilization of M&E: The lack of measurable indicators in the project development
framework and the limited base-line data collection was a barrier to assessing the project's
performance. Systematic data collection and management analysis was weak and only occurred
in the later years of the project when there was increasing emphasis on the importance of M&E.
There has recently been a major initiative by the MDFO to draw the lessons learned from the
project about M&E into improved, standardized operational procedures for the MDFO.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1    The project consistently complied with safeguard requirements. Sub-projects were small
in size and did not trigger any requirement for resettlement procedures or major environmental
assessment. All road sub-projects were for rehabilitation, as a result of which right-of-way and
land ownership issues were not applicable or applied only to marginal road widening. The CDD
process supported social development activities and the project assisted marginalized
communities to gain greater asset security. The government complied with counterpart funding
requirements throughout the project. Fiduciary concerns were raised at times. These were related
to the rapid turn-over and insufficient numberof financial management staff; incomplete and late
documentation submissions from LGUs that resulted from unfamiliarity with requirements; and
un-reconciled amounts between the Bank and the MDFO. The MDFO has been cooperative in
addressing all concerns raised, although the time taken for resolution has not always been within
the agreed time-frame.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1    There are no specific plans for a follow-on project as most of the project's processes have
been absorbed into the partner agencies or the LGUs. In many respects, the project represented a
transition arrangement to help both the national government and LGUs to adapt to the new
framework necessary to support decentralization as enacted under the LGC of 1992. In this
regard, the project has been successful. Sustainability plans were generated by each LGU
detailing specific actions such as the retention of field staff recruited for the project; the
establishment of a Municipal Environment and Resources Office (MENRO); the expansion of the
Municipal Agriculture Office (MAO) into the Municipal Agriculture, Environment and Natural
Resources Office (MAENRO); additional investment in the sites; the continued repayment of
sub-loans to allow for future reflow financing; and continuous liaison between community
groups, LGUs and partner agencies. In this way, the project's initiatives have a high degree of
follow-up. The MDFO is continuing to lend to LGUs for NRM activities from project reflows.
However, at present, there is no mechanism for replicating the "grant-loan-counterpart" mix of
the project. The level of demand by LGUs for reflows on 100 percent loan terms remains to be
seen. Several applications have already been received, but it is not clear if this will be a
consistent trend.

2.5.2    New MDFO projects are incorporating the project's processes and lessons learned. The
MDFO is also currently developing an operational manual for lending to LGUs and for MDFO
project management. The experiences of the project, along with other Bank-financed projects,
have provided major input to the process. The DENR is involving LGUs more strongly in local
NRM initiatives as a result of the project. The DENR has confirmed that incomplete processes
for land certification will be supported by DENR field staff in collaboration with the communities
and the LGUs. As with the MDFO, subsequent DENR projects are replicating the project's
processes (e.g., the Global Environment Fund component of the current Environment and Natural
Resource Management Project).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

3.1.1    Relevance of Objectives. The dual objectives of rural poverty and environmental
degradation reduction have been, and continue to be, priority development concerns of the
government as reflected in the development planning, programming and budgeting documents
(e.g., the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan and the Medium-Term Philippine
Investment Program). At the local level, their relevance can be seen in the high level of demand
by the target LGUs and communities for the services and interventions provided by the project:
the interest of 68 percent of the LGUs in continuing with the project prevailed despite the
substantial initial delays. The additional level of counterpart funding provided by the
communities, LGUs and partner agencies, beyond the required contribution (including investment
of personal funds and time in rehabilitation works, assignment of contracted staff to assist in
implementation, and allocation of regular budget to continue sub-projects) also reinforces the
relevance of the objectives to the target group. Furthermore, expressions of interest to participate
in the project were received from additional LGUs (around 30) were received after project
commencement but the demand could not all be accommodated.

3.1.2    Relevance of Design. The project's design placed LGUs and communities in control of
site-specific initiatives, with technical and financial backing from government agencies. This
approach is consistent with the country's sustainable development and decentralization and
devolution processes and the Bank's Strategic Directions. The design clearly responded to
lessons learned in the preceding project. The targeting of lower-income LGUs was generally
deemed proper; however, because of the demand-driven approach, sites tended to be fragmented
rather than forming the basis for strategic action in most environmentally-degraded areas.
Specific site selection was occasionally subject to political influence9. The development of links
between investment in NRM and income generation were valid. The components reflected the
specific objectives and, in the main, provided a suitable framework for operations. The choice of
the MDFO as the implementing agency may be perceived as being sub-optimal because of: (a) its
role and capacity as a financing institution rather than as an implementing agency; (b) the need to
draw many of the staff from outside the implementing agency (mainly DENR); and (c) the slow
initial rate of implementation. Nevertheless, the design recognized that much of the project focus
would be on developing institutional linkages. The institutional gains of the MDFO, the
implementing partners and the LGUs would have been unlikely to occur without the MDFO's
direct involvement in implementation. Moreover, the investment in the opening of the LGU

                                                   9

Financing Window, the absorption of some key project staff into the MDFO, and the improved
MDFO processes are an investment in future financing of poverty reduction and NRM initiatives.

3.1.3     Relevance of Implementation. The project ultimately achieved effective
implementation through a complex combination of interventions, but effectiveness evolved and
emerged towards the middle of the initial project period. The project's life was extended by three
years because implementation was not fully effective in the first years of operation. Regional and
local offices of implementing partners and the respective communities were not initially involved
in local planning; and national-level decision-making was neither appropriate nor effective. For
instance, after the adoption of the CDD approach the "ownership" of the LGUs and communities
in the potential outcomes of the project increased and resulted in more appropriate site selection10.
There were delays in tackling critical implementation issues, such as the process for the issuance
of tenure instruments for project areas and the strengthening of market assessments before the
commencement of income-generating activities. These did not receive sufficient project
implementation focus until after 2002. In due course, implementation issues were effectively
redressed so that, by the time of project completion, satisfactory ratings for each component had
been achieved and nearly all targets for key performance indicators had been attained.

3.1.7     Program Performance. The PAD did not make specific targets, only aiming for an
increase in relation to specified indicators because a major goal of the project was institution-
building rather than extensive physical accomplishment and because of the demand-driven
approach. Intermediate targets were devised after the MTR, although they were not formally
registered in the Bank's system as revised targets. Based on those informal targets, an overall
physical accomplishment of 96 percent overall for the project has been achieved. Details of
performance are provided in Annex 2. In summary, the results are:

Component 1: Sub-projects in Natural Resource Management (47 percent of project cost
compared to 69.5 percent at appraisal). Investment in sub-projects resulted in 16,967 ha of land
with improved NRM protection, 16,013 ha of agro-forestry and 11,585 ha of fish sanctuaries.
Some 590 barangays have commenced or expanded 51 types of income-generating activities.
The overall physical performance is assessed as 96 percent. The allocation differential relates to
the funds for forestry which were channeled through the DENR under Component 4 rather than
through the LGU sub-project mechanism.

Component 2: Planning and Implementation Support to LGUs (1 percent of project cost
compared to 9.9 percent at appraisal). This component achieved 95 percent physical
accomplishment in the provision of training and equipment supply to LGUs and their barangays.
Costs were lower than projected because of the decentralized planning and implementation
support that was covered through Components 3 and 4.

Component 3: Initiating an MDF Rural Window and Project Management (11 percent of
project cost compared to 11 percent at appraisal). The project management office was
operational not only for the original project period but also for an additional three years and yet
kept costs within the originally-proposed allocation. The Rural Financing Window was
established and is operational. The overall physical accomplishment is assessed as 98 percent.


10San Remigio LGU experienced issues concerning the boundary of forest lands in the area. The LGU financed a
survey and discovered that the land re-forested was actually classified as farm land and could not be classified as
protected forest. The already planted area was classified as agro-forestry and an alternative sites was found for
reforestation. The LGU actually achieved more planting than had originally been planned and local documentation has
improved.



                                                           10

Component 4: Environmental Technology Transfer and Policy Implementation (41 per cent
of project cost compared to 9.6 percent at appraisal). The DENR and the DA were supported to
transfer NRM technology to the LGUs and improve the management of environmental policies.
Overall, accomplishment for the component reached 100 percent.


3.2 Achievement of the Project Development Objective

3.2.1   The project clearly demonstrated an increase of capacity in low-income rural LGUs and
communities to plan, implement and sustain priority NRM initiatives. The original design
framework and indicators were weak in terms of quantifying the level of expected achievement,
merely specifying an increase in performance of LGUs without any base-line measures. The low
level of capacity of LGUs at the commencement of the project can be inferred by the initial
challenges in implementation. Positive improvement in LGU performance was progressively
documented and capacity-building initiatives led to accelerated and successful project
implementation. Tangible outputs have been achieved by LGUs and communities that
demonstrate a level of capacity for planning and implementation. It is noteworthy that three
LGUs have been recipients of national/international environmental awards for work carried out
with the support of the project.

3.2.2   The capacity of central government systems to transfer finance (as financial
intermediaries) to LGUs has improved. Procedures have been stream-lined, and policies and
procedures within the MDFO have been amended in line with the lessons learned from the
project. The DoF reports that the policies and procedures developed in the project are now being
replicated in other development projects. For instance, CDD procurement methods and age-
analysis of LGU liquidations are already being used in other projects.

3.2.3   The project contributed to the discussion of environmental policies, particularly in
relation to community-based NRM and tenure instruments. There have been few identified
improvements in environmental technology through the project. The process has involved more
transfer of existing technologies to LGUs and communities. At the national level, there has been
progress in policy in improving processes for land tenure security related to community-based
NRM and also support for LGUs in environmental conservation activities. At the local level,
there are numerous examples of improved local policies, ordinances and practices in
environmental protection and management.

3.2.4   The provision of resources to LGUs to finance NRM sub-projects has been largely
achieved, despite initial and continuing challenges with the financing mechanisms. Current loan
repayment rates from LGUs to the MDFO (at the time of project closure) are 99 percent, mainly
because of the mechanism within MDFO of capturing loan repayments directly from the LGU
Government Internal Revenue Allotment which is channeled through MDFO. There are
opportunities to continue financing through project reflows; however, discussions regarding the
potential for allocating further government resources to replicate the loan-equity-grant mix of the
project are still continuing within the government.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1   The cancellation of US$12 million, the 74 percent disbursement of the original Loan
amount, and the two Loan Closing Date extensions suggest that the project was less efficient than



                                                11

expected. Nevertheless, by project completion, the overall performance attained 96 percent and
the economic returns outweighed the project costs with an overall Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) of 27 percent. The Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated as PhP 2 billion, based
on recomputed appraisal estimates11. Based on up-dated projections of benefit flows, agro-
forestry and social forestry will generate an EIRR of 24 percent; however, these benefits have not
yet matured. Coastal fisheries indicate a 44 percent rate of return based on actual estimates of
incremental fish catches12 . For rural roads and water supply, rates of return were not re-
                                 13

computed because of the lack of usage data. However, the rural infrastructure activities were
judged as efficient in relation to investment cost, level of maintenance and reported use by target
communities.

3.3.2     The project's ICR Study of 2007 confirmed the appraisal estimates that investing in local
enterprises would generate sustainable sources of income and wider economic benefits. Re-
calculated financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) of vegetable modules range from 194 percent
in a two-crop module to 285 percent in a three-crop module, considerably higher than the
appraisal estimates. Bamboo-based river-bank stabilization has a 17 percent rate of return and
sale of propagules from mangrove plantations will generate an FIRR of 23 percent. The long-
term environmental benefits accruing to the targeted communities through improved soils,
reduced soil erosion, stabilized aquatic breeding grounds, etc., have not been valued in dollar
terms but were consistently confirmed by respondents during the ICR Study. Other non-
quantified benefits include the increased efficiency in institutional operations. Evidence from the
ICR Income Study shows that community organizations have been established that are generating
income, savings and re-investment in the local economy.

3.3.3     The incorporation of the financial rates of return on sampled diverse enterprises and
economic returns from NRM and institutional development activities into the overall project
EIRR would result in a higher rate of return than estimated at appraisal. Hence, the estimated
economic return is at least consistent with, and is likely to exceed, appraisal estimates, albeit over
a longer-than-anticipated project period. The EIRR compares favorably with other rural
development projects supported by the Bank. Detailed sensitivity analysis of project EIRR was
not performed, as the estimates of project benefits are considered to be conservative.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1     The importance of the project's achievements and the eventual attainment of all key aims,
albeit delayed by three years, outweigh the early unsatisfactory ratings for the project. Even
though the impact assessment of the project has been weakened somewhat by the absence of
base-line data, positive economic benefits from the combined investment in resource
conservation, enhancement, income-generating activities and improved governance have been
demonstrated and are highly relevant to sustainable development in the Philippines. The


11The re-computation considered all component costs, including project management, training costs, overhead costs
and the cost of the LGU equity in the sub-loans.
12Anecdotal community information and assessment by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.
13For example: Siganid (a fish delicacy) is caught in the wild. Demand is high but there were concerns that wild stocks
could be depleted by over-fishing. With assistance from the project, the local PO built a fish pen and started to breed
Siganid. The culture has been successful. Harvesting is done every two days, providing a regular income stream, and
sales are brisk. In 2006, each involved member of the organization earned a real net income of PhP32,644 (almost
doubling household incomes).

extensive physical accomplishments are positive outcomes, but of greater importance are the
long-term outcomes, such as improved land tenure status in environmentally-sensitive areas,
improved knowledge and practices in NRM, and improved local ordinances for protection of
critical resources.

3.4.2    It is, however, acknowledged that the early short-comings in project implementation
created delays in execution; US$12 million of the original loan funds were cancelled; and there
are moderate risks to sustainability and replicability. Whilst the project has established a loan
window for LGU sub-projects, the government has not committed further funds to expand and
further develop the potential of linked environmental and economic development initiatives. In
this respect, the satisfactory impact of the project has been limited to participating LGUs, with
little scope for replication in other LGUs. Considering both positive and negative factors, an
overall rating of "moderately satisfactory" for the project is deemed to be warranted.

3.5 Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1    The physical accomplishment for NRM activities demonstrates the impact for
environmental protection. The poverty reduction impact was more difficult to assess. The PAD
target was that at least 25 percent of households should have an increase in income. The
intermediate outcome targets developed during the MTR were more specific, aiming for a ten
percent increase in household incomes for at least thirty percent of households from the 2000
level. Those targets, although not officially recorded in the Bank system, became the operational
targets for implementation.

3.5.2    By the time the Impact Evaluation (IE) was conducted in 2005, insufficient progress had
been made adequately to confirm the poverty reduction impact. At that time, 81 percent of
project participants reported an estimated income increase of 10 percent from the 2000 income
level. However, most income generated was attributed to the payment of labor contracts to
communities engaged in community-based rehabilitation and construction works, resulting in a
cumulative real income per household of PhP 7,398 for male household members and PhP 1,955
for female household members14. This was income generated only during the project period and
it was not sustained after planting had ceased.

3.5.3    The supplementary work carried out for the Borrower's Report and the ICR focused on
the income-generating activities supported by the project. The study assessed 13 types of
enterprises that had at least three years of operation, plus several more recent enterprises that had
demonstrated innovation. The study clearly demonstrates that the average income of project
participants has already risen by PhP2,853 per annum15 in real terms and that there are signs of
rising income levels as the enterprises mature. In particular, a more substantial increase in
income is expected when harvesting begins on agro-forestry sites. Even at the current level of
operation there was a real increase of 7 percent from the base average income for all project sites
of PhP38,885 . (NB The incomes generated range from PhP203 for a communal egg-
                16

production enterprise to PhP30,401 for a women's weaving cooperative and PhP24,664 for
individual vegetable production enterprises.)

3.5.4     The study found that 65 percent of PO members benefited from involvement in income-
generation activities, substantially above the 25 percent targeted at appraisal. Of those activities,
individual activities generated a higher net income per household but group enterprises benefited
a greater number of participants. The final estimate for directly benefiting households was based
on the PO membership of 23,992 members. The impact assessment, project internal assessment
and the ICR Income Study all confirmed that PO membership was active and could be used to
establish the number of households directly benefiting from the project.

3.5.5     Gender Aspects. Some 528 out of 741 POs (71 percent) are recorded as participating in
training sessions on gender sensitivity. The impact assessment noted that female respondents'
adoption rate of social and institutional development and upland resources management
knowledge is higher than male respondents. The reverse was found in coastal resource
management, but no explanation of the results was suggested. A Review of Gender and
Development (GAD) in the Philippines, 2006 included a review of the project. The report
applauded the project for including GAD aspects in planning but concluded that the lack of
monitoring of GAD aspects was a weakness in the project. The Income Study found that both
men and women were involved in income-generating activities: women were more engaged in
livestock and craft activities, while men were more involved in marine activities, processing and
marketing. Planting activities were shared between men and women, but with men working in
the more isolated locations.

3.5.6     Social Development. Social development aspects such as PO membership, an increase
in savings, and greater involvement of community members in activities were more pronounced
after the MTR as the increased focus on PO strengthening led to substantial community
empowerment in terms of working towards self-generated economic development and
environmental conservation and protection goals17. The CDD processes as implemented after the
MTR greatly increased the opportunities for community members in the 741 POs to participate in
planning, implementation and operation of their own activities. Implementation strengthened the
links between the communities and the LGUs. Project-led and demand-driven training and skills
development contributed to an increased capability of LGUs and POs concerning sub-project
implementation and knowledge that will be used in continuing operations.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.7     The project contributed to improved working relationships between government agencies
with different mandates. The MDFO acted as a lead agency in drawing together technical
agencies such as the DENR and the DA in relation to project implementation, particularly on
resource management and tenure policy issues. The MDFO exhibited substantial internal
changes during the years of project implementation (see section 3.2). These were not all directly
attributable to the project as the MDFO is now also implementing other projects. However, the
lessons learned through the project greatly contributed to institutional learning and capacity.

3.5.8     Another major institutional change was seen at the LGU and provincial/regional levels.
All LGUs whose staffs were interviewed during the IA and ICR processes were able to articulate
aspects of improved governance in relation to NRM, stronger relationships with implementing


17The ICR Mission visited St Josefa where the LGU officials and community members affirmed that it was only during
the project that they first sat together to discuss environmental and development issues. The relationship strengthened
during the project to the extent that the PO Chairman is now a LGU Counselor. The LGU and the community are now
actively working together on a range of projects.




                                                            14

partners and positive economic outcomes. The planning processes in project barangays were
being replicated by the LGUs across the whole municipality. For the implementing partners,
there was a stronger realization of the potential for involving LGUs more in NRM and poverty-
reduction initiatives. LGUs were independently reviewing policies and processes related to
resource protection that will have a long-term benefit not only in the targeted sites but across
other key sites in the municipality. Similarly, lessons learned by the regional offices of
participating agencies (such as processes to expedite community-based forestry and the
establishment of sanctuaries) have been replicated across other municipalities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.9    The intended outcomes for the project were broad, and most impact can be accounted for
under the headings of the Development Framework. However, there was considerable evolution
of processes over time that led to local initiatives that were highly relevant18. For instance, the
definition of small-scale infrastructure was expanded in line with local demand. This resulted in
the construction of around 50 facilities that were classified as social infrastructure but which in
practice were in support of identified income-generating activities (such as ice factories and meat-
processing centers). LGUs report broader economic gains from such activities (such as an
increase in traders visiting the area and improved tax collection).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1    The IA results show that 86 percent of the LGUs covered by the study provided sufficient
support to sub-projects and acted in a participatory manner. Some 79 percent of respondents felt
that the LGU administrative and political leaders participated in and supported various sub-
projects, but only 69 percent of the LGUs were considered to have competent implementation
committees. Law enforcement teams were created by participating LGUs to implement
municipal ordinances related to environmental protection.

3.6.2    Although the M&E system does not capture the repayment rate from POs to LGUs, the
ICR preparation led to indicative information in this regard. Some LGUs consider the entire
amount borrowed by the PO as a loan which has to be repaid by the PO in full. Some LGUs
proportionally classify such funds to loan, grant and equity in the same way that project funds are
classified and expect the POs to repay only an amount equivalent to the loan portion. Loan
repayments to date have been made by 60 percent of POs. However, the total amount repaid to
date has reached only 33 percent of targeted installments because: (a) some activities have not yet
reached maturity; and (b) some LGUs are not being rigorous in asking for repayment as they see
the benefits to the communities of not doing so.

3.6.3    IA results recorded that village respondents were very positive regarding the impact of
the project. Access to a development fund for local priority sub-projects was welcomed,
particularly by the low-income municipalities. Respondents reported that the project opened up
new resource-generation opportunities and improved skills in project management, financial
management and inter-agency collaboration that can be used in future to attract private investors
and non-governmental organization/government support.

3.6.4    Specific impacts recorded by respondents were: (a) more than 40 percent of the
respondents in Regions 5, 7 and 8, and 77 percent in Region 13, perceived that the number of
visitors to their eco-tourism projects has increased; and (b) about 56 percent of the 28 project-
funded access infrastructure facilities were assessed as having had a satisfactory impact and 40
percent were assessed as very satisfactory; only 4 percent were rated as having had a poor impact
on the community.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1.1    The Risk to Development Outcome is considered to be "moderate". Operation and
Maintenance agreements for infrastructure have been developed and are being implemented.
Policies and procedures for the operation of protected areas are in force and are backed by local
legislation in most cases. Nevertheless, there are two significant risks to the gains achieved.

4.1.2    First, of the originally-targeted 406 land tenure instruments issued only 262 (65 percent)
have been completed; the remainder are still in various stages of processing. The issuance of a
tenure instrument to POs formalizes authority over the development, protection and management
of land and forest resources by the POs and provides rights over the use of land and plantations as
long as these are consistent with environmental protection and natural resources conservation
principles. Tenure instruments are the key in the sustainability of the NRM interventions, but
project experience shows that complicating policies, such as the "Free and Prior Informed
Consent" process required by the Indigenous Peoples Republic Act and changes in leadership and
policy directives in the DENR, make the approval processes for tenure instruments beyond the
capability and resources of most POs and further technical assistance in required. Thus, the
issuance of tenure instruments (such as the Community-Based Forest Management Agreement -
CBFMA) still requires DENR support to streamline and accelerate the process and to ensure
security for the protected areas and the processes.

4.1.3    Second, according to the last supervision mission, as of September 2006 only about 60
percent of the respondent LGUs said that sub-project sustainability mechanisms have been
institutionalized and incorporated in the Annual Investment Programs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1    The lending preparation process underwent thorough concept development, incorporating
agreed key issues within the project design. The relevance of the project design is substantiated
by the context at the time and the continuing relevance of design. Mission members were of
appropriate disciplines. The Task Manager at that time and some team members had been
involved in an earlier Bank-supported project (Loan 3607-PH) of a similar nature, thus providing
valuable inputs, project lessons and experience that helped address sector issues. Yet there were
substantial issues with the implementation modalities in the design that contributed to a lack of



                                                  16

effectiveness and efficiency in the early stages of the project. The agreement for the DoF to be
the implementing agency had disadvantages, given its lack of a project implementation mandate
and capacity. However, gains have been achieved in the internal lessons learned by DoF in the
requirements for a successful LGU financing window.

5.1.2.  No review by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) of the project's "Quality at Entry"
was carried out, but a QAG Review was held in 2006. A Quality at Entry assessment might have
identified the issues with implementation capacity gaps within the MDFO and might have led to a
more pro-active approach to addressing the early implementation bottlenecks. Earlier and more
comprehensive assistance with M&E would have addressed one of the weakest aspects of project
management. It is notable that a key recommendation from the SECAL project ICR was that
"Substantial delays in project start-up and implementation can be avoided if institutional
capabilities are thoroughly assessed as early as project preparation stage and a corresponding
agreed action plan formulated with involved institutions for focused capacity.". The Bank's
performance could have been improved if this recommendation had been applied.

5.1.3   The slow performance in the early stages of the project, the result of working with an
implementing agency with little implementation experience, the complexity of establishing a
working relationship between the multiple stakeholders and the over-centralized processes marred
an overall satisfactory performance by the Bank. Nevertheless, strong cooperation between the
Bank and the implementing agency during and after the restructurings overcame the initial
unsatisfactory performance.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.4   The Bank carried out 15 supervision missions at six-month intervals. The early missions
highlighted the problems experienced by the MDFO but initially over-estimated its capacity to
respond to the agreed actions. During the major project restructuring, interim thematic missions
were conducted to address specific project weaknesses. Each mission usually comprised
members of appropriate disciplines. "Key findings" and "agreed next steps" were promptly
provided to the Borrower for follow-up action. As a result of the progressive depreciation of the
domestic currency against the US$ after the South-East Asian financial crisis, the Bank urged the
Borrower promptly to cancel the excess loan amount to avoid commitment charges. Bank
supervision missions also carried out reviews on safeguards compliance. There was continuity of
task managers and some team members during supervision from the MTR onwards. This has
proved to be valuable to the implementing agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.5   The Bank responded promptly to the Borrower's request to help prepare the project, and
provided key technical inputs and guidance into the project concept and design based on
experience from other Bank-supported NRM projects. It provided effective supervision and
maintained close interaction and a collaborative relationship with all the implementing agencies.
The initial two-year extension of the Loan Closing Date was allowed in order to overcome early
delays in implementation that might have been prevented by a stronger "quality at entry" focus by
the Bank. The further one-year extension of the Closing Date was approved: (a) in recognition of



                                                 17

the implementation momentum achieved and the availability of additional funds resulting from
exchange rate shifts; and (b) to allow completion of the remaining activities, and does not reflect
any performance gaps by the Bank.

5.2 Borrower Performance

5.2.1   The initial supervision missions (between December 1998 and April 2001) recorded
"unsatisfactory" performance. However, once the project was restructured there was a
consistently satisfactory performance. The ex post Procurement Review in 2006 indicated
"unsatisfactory" performance in procurement based on 2005 procurement processes. However,
these issues were largely matters of incomplete compliance/procedural errors in eight percent of
sub-projects reviewed rather than a systemic issue in transparency or accountability. The issues
raised were satisfactorily addressed. Latterly, there have also been some delays in the submission
of financial requirements, such as audit reports, as a result of organizational restructurings and
other internal issues.

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2   The initial issues were related largely to the lack of implementation experience of the
implementing agency. The government made the necessary counterpart funds available and
actively supported the project restructurings. The government remained committed to the
Development Framework and in supporting sustainability of project investments.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3   The performance of individual entities is summarized as follows:

                               Implementing Agency                                  Performance
  MDFO, the main implementing agency, initially struggled to establish effective     Satisfactory
  procedures but invested heavily in building internal capacity and responding to
  the recommendations of supervision processes. The exponential and sustained
  increase in performance after the restructuring demonstrates a good institutional
  response to the needs of the project and subsequent satisfactory physical
  performance.
                              Implementing Partners
  DENR played a major role in supporting NRM rehabilitation, reforestation and       Satisfactory
  in tenure security.
  The Department of Interior and Local Government played only a minor role            Marginally
  in supporting LGUs and in supervising accountability processes. Moreover, the      Satisfactory
  DOF revised the provision of financial support to DILG/LGA downwards,
  mainly because of the low LGU demand for their services.
  DA had a limited role in supporting agriculture-based enterprise activities. The   Satisfactory
  strongest link in the project was through the local Municipal Agriculture Officer
  who is funded and managed by the LGU but supported by the DA.
  The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) had an active role in         Satisfactory
  coastal NRM. It assisted in establishing marine sanctuaries and provided
  technical advice to POs.



                                                      18

  The Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) had a major role in                 Satisfactory
  training for LGUs. Initially the feed-back on training was that it was too
  theoretical. Adjustments were made during restructuring and the revised training
  programs were well received.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.4    The project implementation experienced major challenges in the initial stages. It was a
complex project established with an inexperienced implementing agency, yet the difficulties were
overcome, government institutional capacity has been substantially strengthened and there are
signs that implementation processes are being effectively main-streamed within government at
national, regional and local levels. The final achievement of almost all Key Performance
Indicators demonstrates a satisfactory performance on the part of the Borrower.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1    The main lesson learned from the project was that an appropriate package of support for
NRM, enterprise development and infrastructure sub-projects can stimulate latent interest and
related investment in viable resource management, conservation and economic initiatives that
lead to poverty reduction. Specific lessons learned include:

6.1.2    Increasing the capacity of LGUs and communities in NRM initiatives:

(a)      Communities are well aware of environmental concerns and are willing to invest time in
environmental activities if it is viable for them to do so without jeopardizing their daily livelihood
and if seed/working capital is available.

(b)      Projects relying on communities for implementation must, during preparation: (i) prepare
good targeting mechanisms; (ii) build consensus, understanding and ownership with the
communities; and (iii) generate support for the project and communities to turn ideas into action.

(c)      Sub-projects that undergo on-site characterization survey, mapping, planning and actual
field-based appraisal have the least problems in identifying the best areas suited for the species, in
meeting establishment targets and in generating sustainable results.

(d)      LGUs and communities that have experienced economic loss caused by environmental
issues (e.g., illegal logging, fishing, land-slides) were most pro-active in implementation because
they were more aware of the direct link between the environment and the local economy.

(e)      The assessment of market potential and the development of marketing strategies is
required at an early stage of the project for all NRM/income-generating activities. Agriculture-
related business and marketing support increases the success of income-generating activities.

(f)      Security of land tenure is important to ensure ownership and sustainability. The process
for issuance of CBFMA and PACBRMA is too slow and needs to be further stream-lined.
Project sites with incomplete tenure processes still require support to complete the process.
DENR has committed to facilitating the process.




                                                     19

(f)      A blend between demand-driven and interventionist approaches is most appropriate to
allow community self-management and a demand-driven approach but also to provide effective
technical and strategic guidance.

6.1.3    Improved capacity of central government systems to transfer finance to LGUs:

(a)      A loan-equity-grant package, appropriate to the economic and social conditions of the
municipalities, is an effective way to attract institutional investment in NRM.

(b)      Development of a physical mechanism for the transfer of finances to LGUs is insufficient
to achieve the development objectives. A stronger link between financing mechanisms and the
practical requirements for implementation must be established for successful investment of the
finances transferred.

(c)      In a complex project, with multiple implementing partners, a common understanding of
the project concepts and processes needs to be achieved early in the project. Good coordination
processes must be embedded in the normal processes of partner agencies at municipal, provincial
and regional levels.

6.1.4    Provision of resources to LGUs to finance natural resource management projects:

(a)      The focusing on a dual strategy of LGU and PO strengthening was a turning point in
accelerating project implementation. Well-organized, technically-empowered LGUs and POs
with financing for their priority activities independently drove implementation activities so that
the project was facilitating locally-generated and sustainable initiatives and not introducing
externally-set initiatives.

(b)      LGUs' capability to implement NRM projects can be fostered in a way that rises above
political interest. The development of Municipal Ordinances to support specific NRM priorities
is an effective mechanism to develop local ownership and sustain the protection of resources.

(c)      A CDD approach to community-based projects is important to build local ownership and
contribute to ensuring sustainability, commitment and long-term capacity building, but requires
several years to introduce effectively.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies:

7.1.1    The implementing partners struggled with the centralized procedures of the project.
These issues were addressed in the restructurings. Thereafter, no major issues were identified
other than the limited budget to be able effectively to address all identified needs.

(b) Co-financiers:

7.1.2    There were no co-financiers of the project.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders:

7.1.3    The increased participation by POs after the restructuring was a turning point in the
achievements of the project. The ICR mission found that the POs were highly appreciative of the


                                                  20

opportunity provided by the project and, in particular, the flexibility to respond to local needs.
The increased link between POs, LGUs and other implementing partners was particularly
appreciated by the POs. Similarly with the implementing agencies, the main concern was the
limited resources within the project to address all identified priorities.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost - Benefit Analysis

3.1      This section presents an ex post analysis of the economic viability of the project using
actual costs, benefits and physical accomplishments obtained from the project's M&E database,
the draft PCR, the Impact Assessment Study of August 2006, data from the supplemental survey
requested by the ICR team in August 2007, and information gathered from project staff and
authorities and from key informants in the field. The analysis followed the assessment
methodologies used at appraisal. Assumptions in the projected units costs and benefits at
appraisal were adjusted using actual data. The latest project performance reports submitted to the
Bank were used as the basis of estimates in the absence of actual data. These were verified
during the ICR team's site validation visits. Incremental cost-benefit analysis comparing the
"without-project" and the "with-project" scenarios was performed for the project as a whole and
separately for the upland and coastal resources management sub-projects that were the main
sources of directly-measurable economic benefits. Prices are in constant 2005 terms, consistent
with the period in which the impact study was conducted and where most of the project
accomplishment data were obtained.

Project Costs

3.2      The appraisal estimate of project cost was revised in 2001 with the cancellation of US$10
million in loan proceeds and in 2002 with a further US$2 million loan cancellation. The appraisal
estimate of loan proceeds was US$50 million while the revised loan amount was US$38 million.
The structure of the project's actual costs is generally consistent with appraisal estimates where
Sub-Loans for LGU Sub-Projects made up the bulk (75 percent) of the financing. In terms of the
volume of financing, however, the allocation for the MDF Rural Window was increased from 11
percent at appraisal to 20 percent in the revised cost. The components on Environmental
Technology Transfer and Planning and Implementation Support, meanwhile, were both cut by
about 50 percent of their appraisal levels. The budget revision was a remedial measure which the
Bank and the Borrower undertook to address the substantial delays in project implementation and
fund disbursement. At the Mid-Term Review of the project in 2002, the time elapsed in project
implementation was 70 percent while the loan disbursement rate was only 20 percent.

3.3      Notwithstanding the cuts, the project has 17 percent remaining unutilized budget based
on revised cost. The overall utilization rate is 83 percent of the revised estimates. In terms of
financing sources, utilization rates are 89 percent from loan proceeds, 30 percent from GOP
counterpart and 101 percent from LGU equity. LGU equity in the sub-loans formed part of the
investment costs in the sub-projects and was included in the economic analysis.

3.4      In relation to component activities, the project was efficient in meeting its physical
targets in the Sub-Loans to LGU Sub-Projects (87 percent of all financing sources; 93 percent of
loan proceeds). It was less efficient in the institutional building components (69 percent cf. 78
percent of all financing sources; 77 percent cf. 80 percent of loan proceeds).

Project Benefits

3.5      Economic benefits were derived from the investments funded under the sub-loans for
LGU sub-projects. As determined at appraisal, the LGU sub-projects were made up of
investments in NRM, small-scale infrastructure support and livelihood enterprises.




                                                   27

3.6     Upland Resources Management. The analysis combined the benefits derived from
agro-forestry and from community forestry (as was done at appraisal). A total of 28,000 ha was
developed as agro-forestry and community forestry areas. The areas were planted to perennial
crops with a medium- to long-term gestation period. Timber species used in the tree plantations
comprised 80 percent fast-growing species that can be harvested in as early as ten years from
planting. The other 20 percent consist of hardwood species that are expected to become
harvestable in 20 to 30 years from the date of establishment. The re-assessed benefits considered
mainly the projected harvest of timber from the fast-growing species consisting of falcata,
gmelina, eucalyptus and mangium. Full maturity of these trees for timber production will be
realized in the fifteenth year from planting date but, based on field interviews, farmers plan to
harvest starting in the tenth year as part of the routine thinning of the plantations. Plantation
establishment and reforestation commenced in 2001. The first timber harvest is expected in 2010.
The re-calculation of benefits estimated that twenty percent of the tree plantations will be
harvested in the tenth year and the remaining eighty percent will be harvested in the fifteenth
year. Estimates of stumpage volume were based on reported estimates in the Impact Study that
calculated an average output of 40 m³ per ha. Market value is estimated at PhP3,800/m³ at 2005
price levels.

3.7     In addition to timber products, the other major economic benefit considered in the
analysis is the value of output from the fruit-bearing trees inter-cropped with timber species.
Among twenty-four reported fruit tree species used by the project, the major contributors to value
of output are mango, cacao, mangosteen, durian, lanzones, rambutan and calamansi. Based on
verified survey reports, the project established around 12,000 ha of fruit trees that will produce
marketable output in the sixth year after establishment. Fruiting started in 2006 in 10 percent of
the agro-forestry areas. Succeeding cropping potential is projected at 60 percent in the seventh
year. Full productivity of the fruit trees will be realized in the eighth year.

3.8     Non-quantified products from the agro-forestry and plantation areas include abaca, rattan,
salago, root crops and other fruit-bearing trees. These are, however, grown on a limited area and
are deemed to make a minor contribution to the project's economic output.

3.9     Coastal Resources Management. Project accomplishments in coastal resources
management included the establishment of artificial reefs, the rehabilitation of fish sanctuaries
and mangroves, and the stabilization of river banks. Based on the impact study and as verified
during the ICR supplemental survey, the improvements in coastal and marine resources
management resulted in an increase in fish catch of an average of 4.5 kg per hour. The analysis
considered 354 coastal barangays covered by the project. Each barangay consists of about 50
households, 60 percent of which are engaged in fishing as a primary means of livelihood. The
estimates of total incremental fish catch further assumed five hours per day and three days per
week of fishing effort by each household.

3.10    Non-quantified incremental outputs from the project include the catch from fish traps and
fish cages, miracle holes, and various other methods such as lift nets, gill nets and ring nets.
These are considered minor sources of project benefits and have not been included in the analysis.


3.11    Non-quantified benefits of NRM. Other economically important benefits of the project
noted in the PAD are the environmental improvements that are expected to be realized over the
long term. These include an increase in bio-diversity, an increase in carbon sequestration, a
reduction in topsoil loss as a result of erosion control measures, and other intangible
enhancements in environmental quality. The increase in bio-diversity has been documented by



                                                   28

the project in areas where forest cover had been significantly improved, thereby restoring the
habitat of forest plants and animals with significant value in the human food chain. Carbon
sequestration was estimated in the Impact Study at a volume of 68 tons per ha of forest. Current
estimates of sequestration costs are in the range of US$100 ­ 300 per ton of carbon emissions
avoided19. The erosion control measures and the increase in vegetation cover were, likewise,
estimated to result in the avoidance of soil fertility loss. Generally, the avoidance cost of
environmental/natural resources rehabilitation will constitute significant savings in economic
cost. No direct quantification of these economically-important environmental benefits is
attempted in this analysis. The PAD does not contain ex ante quantification of such benefits to
enable comparison.

3.12     Small-Scale Infrastructure constituted 22 percent (PhP 251 million) of the project's
sub-loans to the LGUs, net of LGU equity. Utilization was 50 percent for access infrastructure,
25 percent for potable water supply and 25 percent for other social infrastructure (such as street
lighting and sheds/marine watch-out towers). Access infrastructure consisted of 143 kms of
farm-to-market roads, 29.67 kms of foot trails and 148 linear meters of foot bridges/minor river
crossings. The standard estimates of benefits from the development of roads, such as vehicle
operating cost savings and time savings, do not yield a significant outcome in the ex post
economic analysis of the project's roads because of the very limited number of road users and
vehicles. As noted at appraisal, the access infrastructure facilities were primarily meant as
support to NRM activities, to facilitate entry to the forest plantation areas. These are not regular
traffic routes or agricultural production areas as in the case of the Agrarian Reform Communities
Development Project and the Mindanao Rural Development Project. The projected growth in
traffic in the project NRM areas is not known as no assessment processes were established.

3.13     Potable water supply facilities have improved sanitation, as reported by project
beneficiaries in perception surveys during the Impact Study and verified during field validation
visits. Quantified data on time savings and water revenues (user fees) obtained during the ICR
supplemental survey did not generate significant results in the calculation of economic internal
rate of return for potable water supply facilities. Economic benefit indicators have not been
monitored in the project's M&E data-base.

3.14     Livelihood Enterprises. There were about 64 types of land- and marine-based income-
generating projects undertaken by PO beneficiaries of the project involving a range of production,
processing, marketing and other value-adding activities. Overall, the activities provided positive
net income to the Pos and PO members, ranging from PhP 3,500 to PhP 11,700 per year. Based
on the supplemental survey conducted by the ICR team, 95 percent of the respondent IGP
participants have, to date, sustained their livelihood enterprises as a source of income.

Economic and Financial Rates of Return

3.15     Re-computed economic data show that the project's benefits generally outweigh the costs
as indicated by an overall EIRR of 27 percent and a NPV of PhP 2 billion. This is consistent with
the appraisal estimate, indicating that the project is generally viable as originally assessed. The
overall analysis considered the cost of all components of the project, including project
management, training, overhead costs and the cost of the LGU equity in the sub-loans. By
component activities, agro-forestry and social forestry will generate a 24 percent EIRR based on
up-dated projections of benefit flows. Coastal fisheries indicate a 44 percent rate of return based
on actual estimates of incremental fish catch. For rural roads and water supply, rates of return

were not re-computed because of insufficient data. The valuation of the non-quantified benefits,
including the economic output of livelihood enterprises and the economic value of the
environmental improvements, would result in much higher rates of return. A re-calculation of the
financial rates of return on selected IGP modules confirmed the appraisal estimates of the high
viability of these livelihood enterprises as sustainable sources of income. Re-calculated FIRRs of
vegetable modules range from 194 percent in a two-crop module to 285 percent in a three-crop
module. Bamboo-based river bank stabilization has a 17 percent rate of return, while the sale of
propagules from mangrove plantations will generate a 23 percent FIRR.

Annex 4. Beneficiary Survey Results

4.1      An Impact Evaluation (IE) was conducted in 2005 that involved field work in 16 sample
LGUs. The sample sites were selected based on areas with a large area of resource rehabilitation.
Although many results were still in the formative stage, the IE was able to draw out responses
from a total of 1,700 informants, including PO members.

4.2      In 2007, a further study was conducted jointly by the ICR team and the project office.
This focused specifically on addressing the gap in data regarding income generation as a result of
project activities. This study also covered 16 LGUs (different from the IE), and 37 POs with a
membership of 2,273 which had been in the project for at least three years, and in-depth
interviews with over 200 respondents. The results of both studies have elicited a positive
response from respondents in terms of their perceptions of the benefits that have arisen from the
project. The Income Study provided a greater degree of quantified assessment of financial
benefits from the project.

4.3      The IE results recorded that barangay respondents were very positive regarding the
impact of the project. Access to a development fund for local priority sub-projects was
welcomed, particularly by the low-income municipalities. Respondents reported that the project
opened up new resource generation opportunities and improved skills in project management,
financial management and inter-agency collaboration that can be used in future to attract private
investors and non-governmental organization support. Conversely, respondents expressed that
the time period for the project (three years) was too short to build local capacity and to plan,
establish and operate sub-projects.

4.4      Other feedback from the IE includes that 86 percent of the LGUs covered by the study
provided sufficient support to sub-projects and acted in a participatory manner. Some 79 percent
of respondents felt that the LGU administrative and political leaders participated in and supported
various sub-projects, but only 69 percent of the LGUs were considered to have competent
implementation committees. Law enforcement teams were created by participating LGUs to
implement municipal ordinances related to environmental protection.

4.5      Specific impacts recorded by respondents were: (a) more than 40 percent of the
respondents in Regions 5, 7 and 8 and 77 percent in Region 13 perceived that the number of
visitors to their eco-tourism projects had increased; and (b) about 56 percent of the 28 project-
funded access infrastructure facilities were assessed to have satisfactory impact (and 40 percent
were very satisfactory). Only 4 percent were rated to have had a poor impact on the community.
As a result of the construction/rehabilitation of the project-funded water supply systems, the
respondents reported satisfaction in the constant and adequate potable water supply.

4.6      The ICR Income Study confirmed the interest that the project beneficiaries have in the
integrated components of the project. There was strong support for the NRM focus of the project,
but more willingness and opportunity to engage in NRM activities if they are linked directly to
improving income generation. Time investment in activities was a prime consideration. Limited
volunteer time is available for rehabilitation work; however, when a direct economic benefit was
perceived from the environmental works, there was a stronger response and commitment from the
communities. POs also confirmed the delays and difficulties with the project in the early stages
and would have preferred a stronger focus on income-generating activities, with marketing
support, earlier in the project.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A multi-agency Sustainability Meeting with the project's government partners was held on June
15, 2007. Prior to the workshop, a range of individual interviews was conducted with key
stakeholders at national, regional and local community level, including DENR, DA and DILG, as
well as regional, provincial, municipal and barangay officials. Participants at the workshop
included representatives from DoF, MDFO, National Economic and Development Authority and
DENR as well as project staff. The workshop included a presentation on the performance of the
project and identified several key issues for discussion at both the operational and policy levels.
The overall feedback from government stakeholders in the participating partners was that the
project has largely been effective. There were substantial difficulties experienced in the early
stages in the project as a result of an overly-centralized management structure but the results are
considered to be impressive. Lessons learned are being incorporated into other programs and
activities of partner organizations.

A summary of responses is shown below:

     design appropriate?                        realized that there was a need to develop a more
                                                sustainable financing mechanism for NRM. The project
                                                design was the result.
     2. Were the coordination                   Coordination should have been more intensive in the
     mechanisms effective?                      early stages of the project. It was difficult for partners
                                                to meet, but there should have been more effort to do so.
     3. Did the financial resources go to       Resources were tight for all activities. Improved
     the right activities in the right mix?     planning at an earlier stage might have resulted in
                                                different deployment of resources, particularly for
                                                training and support to income generating activities.
     4. Were the results attained               There were no targets for the project as it was demand-
     sufficient?                                driven so performance was difficult to benchmark.
                                                Better M&E processes would have helped to gauge the
                                                progress better.
     5. Can the gains be sustained?             Yes. Most of the activities are continuing at the LGU
                                                level. Partner agencies are still in place and have some
                                                resources to continue support to the project sites.

Annex 7. Summary of the Borrower's Project Completion Report (PCR) and Comments on
Draft ICR

The Borrower's PCR is a fair reflection of the project performance. It is also an expression of the
enthusiasm that the Borrower has for the project. The level of ownership of the project has been
very high despite the challenges in implementation.

The PCR explicitly lists a number of the challenges and weaknesses of project implementation,
recognizing that the introduction of an operational project into a financial agency was not an easy
matter. The PCR highlights difficulties with coordination between partners.

The PCR is large, covering two volumes. The report contains both performance data and
anecdotal information regarding success factors and key challenges. The PCR identified six main
factors affecting implementation:

    · Weak NRM Policy Framework
    · Weak Operationalization of the LGU Financing Framework
    · Weak Institutional Framework
    · Weak project management controls over monitoring variables
    · Absence of well-tested operational mechanisms at project start-up
    · Weak readiness of implementing partners

The PCR also highlights facilitating factors:

    · Good project management structure and process after restructuring (FM and CDD-
        based procurement)
    · Improved policy framework as a result of coordinated discussions on issues related to
        land tenure and decentralization.
    · Signing of Memorandums of Agreements with the communities (POs) assisted in
        defining roles and responsibilities and improved coordination.
    · The presence of the BLGF Offices at the regional levels facilitated fund releases.
    · The provision of project funds to partner agencies facilitated achievement of project
        targets, such as the issuance of land tenure instruments which were funded based on the
        target set.

Key Challenges have been identified and recommendations made for addressing those challenges.

The Borrower had no major objections with the findings and recommendations of the ICR.
Nevertheless, it forwarded the following comments and recommendations for the Bank's
consideration:

1. On page iv, comment # 1 line 5, to change the expression "full payment" to "final payment"

2. On page v. comment 1, we strongly disagree that financial management remained a weak
aspect. It should be noted that (a) a major contribution of the project is the strengthening of
financial capability not only at the LGU level but also at the PO level which is very significant
in the implementation of the project; and (b) one strength of the MDFO is on the financial
management of foreign-assisted projects which is its distinct responsibility under DOF.
