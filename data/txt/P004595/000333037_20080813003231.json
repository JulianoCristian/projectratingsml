Some\n            lessons learned included: Development of a physical\n            mechanism for the transfer of finances to Local Government\n            Unit (LGU) is insufficient to achieve the development\n            objectives. A stronger link between financing mechanisms and\n            the practical requirements for implementation must be\n            established for successful investment of the finances\n            transferred. In a complex project, with multiple\n            implementing partners, a common understanding of the project\n            concepts and processes needs to be achieved early in the\n            project. Good coordination processes must be embedded in the\n            normal processes of partner agencies at municipal,\n            provincial and regional levels. Sub-projects that undergo\n            on-site characterization survey, mapping, planning and\n            actual field-based appraisal have the least problems in\n            identifying the best areas suited for the species, in\n            meeting establishment targets and in generating sustainable\n            results. A Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach to\n            community-based projects is important to build local\n            ownership and contribute to ensuring sustainability,\n            commitment and long-term capacity building, but requires\n            several years to introduce effectively."}, "docdt": "2008-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
