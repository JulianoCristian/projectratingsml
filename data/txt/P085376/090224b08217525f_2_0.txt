                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better employment opportunities that improve their incomes and
                         working conditions. This objective will be achieved by: (i) improving the access of rural workers to skills development opportunities, (ii) reducing the cost of their job
                         search through access to enhanced employment services, and (iii) removing the worst excesses of their transition through strengthened worker protections.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The project is designed to achieve its objective by focusing on: (a) skills enhancement of migrant workers. This is done through skills development by using the project procured
                         equipment; (b) quality improvement of the employment services. This is done through assessing training needs, developing training materials, capacity building and integration of

                         employers in the training; (c) worker protection. This is done through awareness enhancement of migrant workers regarding their rights and through legal assistance, as well as policy
                         development; and (d) policy analysis, and monitoring and evaluation. Policy and technical work have been undertaken to develop policy guidelines and management tools, as well as
                         project monitoring and evaluation at central and provincial levels.

                         2. The overall implementation has sped up since the last mission in January 2013. Procurement of IT equipment under ICB and disbursement of contracted loan were fully completed.
                         All the 19 packages for machinery equipment under ICB were contracted and 30% of the goods were delivered. The delivered goods have produced good results in capacity
                         strengthening of the project schools. NCB and shopping are progressing well and are expected to be fully completed by the end of February 2014. The soft activities (teachers
                         training, policy studies, curriculum development, and monitoring and evaluation) have received more attentions and more outputs are delivered. Teacher training activities were
                         organized at the central, provincial and school levels, and received positive feedback from school management and teachers. With regards to curriculum development, all contracts
                         have been signed. Among which, two are completed and others are progressing well. The two completed outputs will be piloted and tested in the selected project schools. For policy
                         studies, at the central level, all consulting services for policy studies have signed contracts and are progressing well and most of them can be completed before the current closing
                         date; at the provincial level, Anhui and Ningxia recently launched three policy studies related to training needs assessment, graduate tracer studies, and school-enterprise
                         partnership. The monitoring has continued and the evaluation work was initiated.

                         3. Compared with the last supervision mission, disbursement has made reasonable progress from 38.2% to 45.7% at the time of the mission, further to 54.0% in early October. In
                         spite of this, the overall disbursement remains slow largely due to slow delivery of machinery equipment under ICB, slow progress in policy studies in Anhui and Ningxia, and lack of
                         skills in FM and disbursement in some of the project entities. The implementing agencies at all levels have promised to further speed up disbursement through training.
