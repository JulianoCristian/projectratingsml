                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better employment opportunities that improve their incomes and
                         working conditions. This objective will be achieved by: (i) improving the access of rural workers to skills development opportunities, (ii) reducing the cost of their job
                         search through access to enhanced employment services, and (iii) removing the worst excesses of their transition through strengthened worker protections.

                         or complete. For the procurement and disbursement of machinery equipment under ICB, the delivery of procured goods increased from 30% in June 2013 to 85%, which are all
                         installed, checked and operational. For the major “soft activities”, about 80% of policy studies at the central and provincial levels are completed and some have informed policy
                         development; 6 out of 17 curriculum development packages are fully completed, 11 are completed by 50%; two packages completed earlier will be piloted and tested in the selected
                         project and non-project schools; overseas study tours were organized as scheduled for Shandong and Ningxia; and teachers’ trainings were held during summer time by the three
                         project provinces. Procurement and financial management are carried out in line with the Bank’s policies and guidelines.

                         Efforts have been made to accelerate the disbursement. The total disbursement rate rose from 46% in June 2013 to 57% in December 2013, and further went up to 70% by the end
                         of April 2014, catching up with the actual project progress to date.
