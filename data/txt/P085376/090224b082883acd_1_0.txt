                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better employment opportunities that improve their incomes and
                         working conditions. This objective will be achieved by: (i) improving the access of rural workers to skills development opportunities, (ii) reducing the cost of their job
                         search through access to enhanced employment services, and (iii) removing the worst excesses of their transition through strengthened worker protections.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is designed to achieve its objective by focusing on: (a) skills enhancement of migrant workers. This is done through skills development by using the project procured
                         equipment; (b) quality improvement of the employment services. This is done through assessing training needs, developing training materials, capacity building and integration of

                         The overall implementation of the project has kept its momentum since the last mission in January 2014. The procurement of goods and equipment is close to completion. The

                         procured equipment is well maintained and is playing a key role in strengthened teaching and training capacity of project schools, contributing to skills enhancement of their
                         graduates.

                         The “soft activities” (policy studies, curriculum development, teachers’ training, and monitoring and evaluation) have also made significant progress and contributed to policy
                         formulation. For policy studies, at the central level, of the total 33 policy studies, 24 of them have been completed, making policy recommendations and suggestions in 6 areas,
                         informed 4 types of policy and standard formulation, and developed 4 types of information platforms. The ongoing policy studies are approaching completion. At the provincial level,
                         both Ningxia and Anhui have conducted 3 policy studies and delivered draft reports, and have also kicked off the graduate tracer study, expected to be completed by the end of
                         December 2014. As for curriculum development, of the 19 contracts, 13 of them have been completed and delivered curriculum packages, 5 are 90% complete and the last one is
                         about 50% complete. The curriculum packages will be piloted during the period of September-November 2014 in six selected schools (3 project schools and 3 non project schools).
                         For teachers' training, most of the core teachers and principals in the project schools have participated in training activities financed either by the Bank loan or counterpart funds. No
                         further training activities will be carried out by the three project provinces. For monitoring and evaluation, the collection of monitoring data for 2012 and 2013 has been carried out
                         since July 2014 and the monitoring reports will be drafted after the completion of data collection; for evaluation, the Bank team suggested that the central PMO reconsider the
                         selection of consulting firm to conduct the evaluation work.

                         The dissemination of project outputs and outcomes has been carried out, in particular in Ningxia to broaden the impacts of the project. Ningxia has organized a series of activities to
                         disseminate the outputs and outcomes generated by the project intervention through local and national newspapers, magazines, TVs and other media. The other two provincial
                         PMOs and the central PMO are planning to organize similar dissemination activities.

                         Disbursement rose significantly from 56.8% in December 2013 to 74% by the end of June 2014, and went up further to 81% by the end of September 2014. The Implementation
                         Completion Report (ICR) preparation has been initiated. An ICR preparation team will be formed shortly at the central PMO and contact persons will be appointed by the three
                         project provinces to coordinate and cooperate with the central PMO on ICR preparation.
