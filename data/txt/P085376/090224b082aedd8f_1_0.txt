Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better employment opportunities that
 improve their incomes and working conditions. This objective will be achieved by: (i) improving the access of rural workers to skills development
 opportunities, (ii) reducing the cost of their job search through access to enhanced employment services, and (iii) removing the worst excesses of
 their transition through strengthened worker protections.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has achieved it Project Development Objective (PDO). The PDO is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access
 better employment opportunities that improve their income and working conditions. The Results Framework provided evidence to the achievement of
 the PDO. According to the results framework, the employment rate of graduates had increased significantly since the MTR in April 2011 and is higher
 than 90% in the three project provinces and close to full employment in Anhui and Ningxia by the end of 2014. 76-88% of graduates were employed in
 the occupational fields where they were trained, indicating that training is highly relevant. The initial wage of graduates was more than doubled in Anhui
 and Shandong and increased by nearly 40% in Ningxia between 2009 and 2014. More opportunities of short- and medium- term training have offered in
 Anhui and Ningxia, contributing to an expansion of rural migrants who received training, while Shandong sharply increased the opportunities of long
 term training that led to a slight decline of graduates in 2014. For most of the intermediate outcome indicators, their end values are on the right track
 compared with the expected end values in the three project provinces. At the national level, 9 policy studies were done with findings and
 recommendations that have informed policy reform and formulation of rights protection for rural migrant workers.

 The project design has innovative features. It is not only about skills training. The project combines skills training with employment services and
 rights protection to provide a comprehensive and seamless service to facilitate a smooth transition of migrant workers from rural to urban areas.
 Moreover, it also introduces different types of training such as short-term, medium-term and long-term ones to meet the needs of rural migrants and
 demand for skills, school enterprise partnership in running schools to enable teaching and training fully matching with the needs of the enterprises,
 mobile training vehicle to deliver in-door training services in the remote poor areas and for women in particular, entrepreneurships and business startup,
 and so on. These innovations, likewise, can be good examples and practices for provinces and schools beyond the project area to learn from through
 various types of dissemination and learning events.

 During the entire implementation cycle, the project intervention has strengthened training and employment service capacities, introduced
 new ideas, approaches and concepts in training and school management, and informed policy reform and formulation to create a friendly
 environment for rural migrant workers. All those efforts have not only improved the access of rural migrant workers to better employment
 opportunities in the three project provinces, but also produced spillover effects to the rest provinces of China, which contributes to increasing rural
 migrant workers’ income, enhancing their working conditions, and reducing rural poverty in a large scope. In this regard, the experience of this project
 provides scope for learning and experience that is relevant well beyond this project and project areas. All project activities will be completed by the
 closing date of February 28, 2015, including those activities under the four components: skills development, employment services, worker protection,
 and policy analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and project management.
