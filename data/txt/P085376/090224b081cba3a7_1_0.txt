                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better employment opportunities that improve their incomes and
                         working conditions. This objective will be achieved by: (i) improving the access of rural workers to skills development opportunities, (ii) reducing the cost of their job
                         search through access to enhanced employment services, and (iii) removing the worst excesses of their transition through strengthened worker protections.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.      The project is designed to achieve its objective by focusing on: (a) skills enhancement of migrant workers. This is done through skills development by using the project
                         procured equipment; (b) quality improvement of the employment services. This is done through assessing training needs, developing training materials, capacity building and

                         integration of employers in the training; (c) worker protection. This is done through awareness enhancement of migrant workers regarding their rights and through legal assistance, as
                         well as policy development; and (d) policy analysis, and monitoring and evaluation. Policy and technical work have been undertaken to develop policy guidelines and management
                         tools, as well as project monitoring and evaluation at central and provincial levels.

                         2. Remarkable progress has been made on major procurements. (1) ICB: The delivery of IT equipment is fully completed. For machinery ICB, 18 contracts were signed except drop
                         of one package, and 30% of machinery ICB goods are now delivered. (2) NCB and shopping: NCB is close to completion. Shopping is completed in all the three project provinces.
                         The delivered goods are fully operational and are playing important roles in training and skills enhancement of migrant workers. (3) Teachers training: This has been implemented at
                         all levels from the central, provincial down to the school levels, and has gained good results. (4) Curriculum development: 16 contracts have been signed. Among which, 2 are
                         completed, which starts to pilot in selected project schools and others are under implementation. (5) Policy studies: at the central level, more than one third of the total 25 policy
                         studies is completed; nearly one fourth of them are close to completion; and the remaining are under implementation. At the provincial level, Anhui launched policy studies on training
                         needs analysis, graduate tracer study and school-enterprise partnership. Ningxia sent TORs to the Bank team recently and will start these activities after they receive clearance.
                         Shandong has completed these activities. (6) Project management continues to be strengthened.

                         3.       Overall disbursement remains relatively low. The total disbursement is about 43% of the total loan in mid-June, 2013. The central PMO organized a meeting in April to
                         provide training on project management and disbursement. Efforts has been made to speed up disbursement, for which a disbursement schedule with target has been discussed and
                         agreed by PMOs at all levels.
