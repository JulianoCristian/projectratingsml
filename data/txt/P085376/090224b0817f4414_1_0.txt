                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better employment opportunities that improve their incomes and
                         working conditions. This objective will be achieved by: (i) improving the access of rural workers to skills development opportunities, (ii) reducing the cost of their job
                         search through access to enhanced employment services, and (iii) removing the worst excesses of their transition through strengthened worker protections.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.The project is designed to achieve its objective by focusing on: (a) skills enhancement of migrant workers. This is done through skills development by using the project procured
                         equipments; (b) quality improvement of the employment services. This is done through assessing training needs, developing training materials, capacity building and integration of

                         employers in the training; (c) worker protection. This is done through awareness enhancement of migrant workers regarding their rights and through legal assistance, as well as policy
                         development; and (d) policy analysis, and monitoring and evaluation. Policy and technical work have been undertaken to develop policy guidelines and management tools, as well as
                         project monitoring and evaluation at central and provincial levels.

                         2.This is the first ISR since the project extension was made on March 20, 2012. The closing date of the project was extended from the end of 2013 to February 28, 2014. The
                         disbursement Deadline Date will be four months after the Closing Date, which is June 30, 2014.

                         3.Steady progress has been made on major procurements. (1) IT and Machinery equipment ICB: the entire IT equipment ICB procurement is completed. Contracts of six packages
                         of all IT equipment were signed and goods were delivered to all the project schools. Disbursement of all IT equipment is expected to be completed before the year end. For
                         machinery equipment ICB, bid evaluation was conducted by the CPMO in June 2012. 17 out of total 19 packages have received the Bank’ s NOL and contracts are expected to be
                         signed shortly. The Bank is requesting additional information and clarifications for the remaining 2 packages and will try to complete the entire review soon. (2) NCB equipment
                         procurement: three project provinces continued to do NCB procurement during the first half of 2012. At present, NCB procurement in Shandong is fully completed and that of Anhui is
                         close to completion. Ningxia is making good progress. The majority of signed contracts has completed goods delivery. (3) Consulting services: the majority of consultancies at the
                         Ministerial level has made good progress and produced preliminary outputs, and some have final products. Curriculum development at the Ministerial level is ongoing. 12 out of total
                         16 packages have signed contracts. The Bank has issued NOL for three more packages. Policy studies at three provincial levels, including training needs analysis, graduate tracer
                         study and school-enterprise partnership, were launched during the first half of 2012 by Anhui and Shandong provinces, and Ningxia is expected to launch such activity shortly as well.

                         4.Overall disbursement remains slow. As of October 28, 2012, a total of US$ 14.67 million had been disbursed, representing only 29 percent of the total loan. This remains behind
                         the disbursement expectation discussed during the MTR, which took place on April 18-May 4, 2011. Several factors have caused the slow disbursement: (1) initial delays in
                         implementing project activities, though this has improved noticeably since the MTR; (2) slow ICB procurement and goods delivery under procurements managed by the CPMO, as
                         well as tardy acceptance of goods by received institutions; (3) inactive disbursement from DAs for incurred expenditures and Shandong in particular; and (4) lack of experienced staff
                         at the local levels has also contributed to inactive disbursement from DAs by PMOs for incurred expenditures, as well as delays in replenishment requests.
