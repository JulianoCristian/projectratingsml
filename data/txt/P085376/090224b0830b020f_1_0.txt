F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to support the transition of rural workers to urban
areas to access better employment opportunities that improve their incomes and working
conditions. This objective will be achieved by (a) improving the access of rural workers to
skills development opportunities, (b) reducing the cost of their job search through access

                                                 iv
to enhanced employment services, and (c) removing the worst excesses of their transition
through strengthened worker protections.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

A. Country and Sector Background

1.      Over the last three decades, internal labor migration in China has been occurring on
an unprecedented scale. According to the Rural Household Survey of the National Bureau of
Statistics, the total number of migrants in 2006 was over 130 million. An estimated one in five rural
workers was a migrant worker, and nearly one-half of the rural population lives in households with
one or more migrant workers. Migrant labor likely accounts for about one-third of total urban
employment.

2.     The massive migration flows reflect a combination of factors. One factor is the large
income differentials, with average urban incomes being over three times the rural average in 2005.
By migrating from rural to urban China, a typical household nearly doubled its per capita income.
Second, increases in agricultural productivity have created an extremely large pool of rural labor
surplus, with estimates ranging from 50 to 200 million. Third, the dynamic urban economy
generated great demands for labor, with the surplus rural workforce providing an obvious supply
of low-cost labor. Migration thus had become an important contributor to China’s economic growth
and a crucial element in sustaining China’s labor-based comparative advantage in global markets.

3.     The unprecedented scale and pace of rural-to-urban migration placed pressure on
social and economic institutions, hindering the rural migrants’ access to skills development
and better employment opportunities that would improve their income and working
conditions. With regard to working conditions, migrant workers filled the most menial and lowest-
paying jobs in urban labor markets, concentrated in occupations that exposed them to greater risk
of work-related injury and illness. Few migrants were covered by social insurance programs, so
any serious injury or illness imposed an immense burden on them and their families. Working
conditions were also a serious problem, with considerable evidence of basic employment rights
abuses and delayed or unpaid wages and limited avenues opened for protection. Migrant workers
experienced social discrimination. Information about job opportunities and living conditions in
destination cities remained largely informal. As for skills development, access to skills sought by
urban employers was limited in rural areas since competitive markets for training services were
slow to develop. In urban markets, the high turnover of migrants contributed to the reluctance of
employers to invest in their skills. Trade unions and other organizations were yet to develop the
capacity needed for protecting worker rights. Markets in China were thus struggling to cope with
the massive flows of rural-to-urban migration.

4.      Recognizing the critical nature of these issues, guidelines, policies, and pilot programs
were adopted at all levels of government to facilitate migration and ease the transition of rural
workers to urban centers. One set of reforms focused on relaxing the traditional legal and
institutional separation between the rural and urban realms, tying rights and responsibilities to
residency status. Some small cities and towns eliminated the distinction between urban and rural
hukou1 and allowed migrants to obtain hukou and/or access urban services, provided that they have

 The hukou is a population registration system that defines peoples’ residency status. It classifies the
population into rural (agricultural) and urban (non-agricultural) according to their place of birth and defines
peoples’ access to public services based on this classification. Apart from its basic registration function, it
provides the framework for managing population flows and defines entitlements for a range of social services,

                                                      1
stable incomes and legal housing. Other policies included legal measures to eliminate
discriminatory treatment of migrants in access to employment. To improve migrant workers’
employment opportunities, all levels of government implemented training programs and extended
public employment services. Private providers of these services were also emerging.

5.     The 2006 State Council Opinions on Rural Migrant Workers recognized the significant
contributions made by rural migrants to the country’s development and the importance of
safeguarding their rights. The Opinions mandated the establishment of a system to guarantee and
monitor salary payments and stipulated the principle of equal pay for equal work, staff leave,
holidays, and overtime pay according to law. The Opinions also called for improved access to
various benefits for migrant workers such as medical insurance and pension plans integrated with
insurance for urban employees and/or transferred between locations. Finally, the Opinions
mandated that migrant workers be represented in employees’ representatives conferences and
guaranteed their right to join trade unions according to law.

6.     However, much more remained to be done to facilitate labor mobility and help rural
migrants transition to urban labor markets. Although the government made considerable
progress in establishing migration-friendly policies, greater implementation efforts were needed
for the execution of the regulations to ensure better working conditions and protection at the local
level. Another key priority was to increase training and employment service investments.
Governments in both sending and receiving areas needed to develop capacity to meet the large
demand to extend those services to those in remote areas. Meanwhile, an enabling environment and
a regulatory framework were needed for more active private sector service delivery and for the
market to function efficiently. Addressing such issues and facilitating the movement of rural labor
were essential for China’s continued progress in poverty reduction, economic growth, and creation
of an equitable and harmonious society.

B. Rationale for Bank Assistance

7.     The World Bank brought significant expertise and experience to the multifaceted task
of facilitating the transfer of rural labor and developing China’s labor market. The Bank’s
comparative advantage included its extensive experience in the areas of skills development,
employment services, and worker protection. Knowledge and international experience enabled the
Bank to introduce international best practices and support an integrated approach for promoting the
employment of migrants. The Bank had also been actively engaged in migration issues in China
through policy dialogue and analytical work. The analytical programs on labor market development
and China’s rural-to-urban migration and social policies underpin the project design.2

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.     The PDO was to support the transition of rural workers to urban areas to access better
employment opportunities that improve their incomes and working conditions. This objective
was to be achieved by (a) improving the access of rural workers to skills development opportunities,
(b) reducing the cost of their job search through access to enhanced employment services, and (c)
removing the worst excesses of their transition through strengthened worker protections.



including employment, training, health, housing, and social protection program(The World Bank;
Development Research Center of the State Council, China, 2014).

Quality at Entry.

                                                     2
9.      The primary objective is therefore to support rural migrants through the process of
rural-to-urban migration in order for them to access better urban employment opportunities
that will improve incomes as well as their working conditions. Improved access to better
employment opportunities were expected to be achieved through increased access to better-quality
skills training opportunities and enhanced provision of employment services. To improve working
conditions, the project aimed to improve coverage and terms and conditions of labor contracts,
provide legal aid services to migrants, and develop implementation regulations for the labor
arbitration law, with particular focus on exploring an expedited arbitration process for migrant
workers. While not targeted at the poorest of the poor in rural areas, the project was expected to
have a positive impact on household poverty and rural development through migrant remittances,
enhanced agricultural productivity from more efficient land utilization, and the transfer of skills
and capital to rural areas with return migration.

10.       Key outcome indicators included:

          percentage of migrants trained in project training institutions who find employment
           within 6 months of training completion;
          percentage of migrants trained in project training institutions who find employment in the
           occupational field for which they are trained within 6 months of training completion; and
          wage level of migrant graduates of long-term training programs of the project-supported
           training institutions, by occupations.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/justification

11. Although the PDO was not revised, key indicators were modified at the time of the second
project restructuring to better align the indicators to the PDO and to refine the wording of the
indicators to more precisely define them (Table 1). One key indicator (the last one below) was
added and the wording of the original key indicators were redefined as:

          percentage of graduates of the project training institutions that find employment within 6
           months of training completion;
          percentage of graduates of the project training institutions who find employment within 6
           months in the occupational field for which they are trained;
          wage level of graduates of long-term training programs of the project-supported training
           institutions; and
          number of graduates receiving short-, medium-, and long-term training from the project
           training institutions.

12. The initial plan of a rigorous impact evaluation, also designed to provide data for the
results framework (RF), could not be effectively implemented and alternative arrangements
were agreed and implemented. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was designed as a three-
wave quasi-experimental impact evaluation covering Vocational and Technical Training Schools
and employment service centers supported by the project (treatment) and those that are not (control).
However, the baseline survey was never effectively carried out mainly due to the changes in the
Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security’s (MOHRSS) leadership at the start of the
project due to the government reorganization in 2009 and 2010. After several unsuccessful attempts
to monitor the project indicators by a local research institute, the Provincial Project Management
Offices (PPMOs) agreed to take charge of collecting data directly from project schools for the RF.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13. The main beneficiaries are the migrant workers from rural areas transitioning to
urban areas. The project’s direct investments covered 13 counties in 10 municipalities/prefectures
in the provinces of Anhui and Shandong and the Ningxia Autonomous Region. The project financed
the procurement of equipment and other investments in 23 Technical Vocational Education and
Training (TVET) Schools, technical colleges, and training centers (referred to as project schools in
this report). During the course of the project, 447,577 students graduated (among them 85.6 percent
were from rural areas) from project schools and public employment services served 4,206,642 job
seekers (70.7 percent were rural migrants) in the project provinces. Project investments also
reached well beyond the rural migrants in the three project provinces. These include the policy
studies influencing policies affecting all 260 million rural migrant workers and many hundred
million more migrant workers in the future as well as the digital curriculum designed under the
project, which is planned to be widely distributed online.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14. The project supported four main components at the national level by the Ministry of
Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) and in three provinces or autonomous
regions: Anhui, Ningxia, and Shandong. At the aggregate level, Anhui and Ningxia are primarily
senders of migrants to urban areas in other provinces, whereas Shandong is both a sender and a
receiver. The project localities were selected by the government to ensure that they demonstrate
the challenges faced by both migrant receiving and sending areas and represent issues faced by
different regions in China. As much of the migration is intraprovincial, especially to provincial
capital and large cities, interventions were implemented at the destination areas in all three project
provinces.

15. Component 1: Skills Development (US$72.84 million; o/w US$42.74 million IBRD
financing). This component included activities to (a) enhance capacity of the project
provinces to deliver training to potential migrants; (b) improve the quality, relevance, and
flexibility of the training offered, consistent with migrant and market needs in receiving
areas; and (c) improve functioning of the training market.

       Subcomponent 1.1: The training capacity subcomponent provided equipment for a
        number of training centers and schools in all three project provinces to deliver
        occupational skills that are in demand for migrants. In Shandong, public training
        platforms were equipped and tested as an instrument for expanding training by private
        providers and enterprises and as a way to encourage more competition and efficient use of
        public training resources. In Ningxia, seven mobile training bases were acquired to bring


                                                  5
        short-term, modular training programs to isolated communities in mountainous and remote
        areas.

       Subcomponent 1.2: The quality, relevance, and flexibility of training subcomponent
        supported activities that helped ensure effective use of the training capacity that was
        built. These activities included understanding the learning needs of migrant labor and
        engagement of industry in defining skill competencies, developing modular competency-
        based curricula, preparing related instructional materials, and training instructors and
        school managers. Guidelines for establishing and managing public training platforms and
        training managers for these platforms were developed. The subcomponent also supported
        industry linkages to bring industry into the development of the training program and guide
        training investments.

       Subcomponent 1.3: The training markets subcomponent addressed market failures
        and improved overall market efficiency. It supported the improvement of the
        accreditation standards for training institutions at the provincial level and strengthened
        policies concerning the use of public training subsidies for migrants. Government subsidies
        for migrant training were included as counterpart financing to test the effect of demand-
        side financing on outcomes for migrants. The subcomponent also supported the
        development of information packages for migrants on training opportunities.

16. Component 2: Employment Services (US$4.96 million; o/w US$3.24 million IBRD
financing). This component supported activities to (a) improve the provision of labor market
information and public employment services for rural migrants and (b) further develop policies and
institutions for employment services and support the development of the market for employment
service provision.

       Subcomponent 2.1: The labor market information and public employment services
        subcomponent supported the establishment of employment service institutions in
        rural areas and the extension of the labor market information system to county and
        township levels in selected project localities. It developed and implemented new
        employment services programs, tools, and delivery methods most suitable for current and
        potential migrants. The project trained employment service staff and management.

       Subcomponent 2.2: The policies and institutions for employment services
        subcomponent supported the development of regulations and standards concerning
        public employment services and the improvement of regulations on the licensing and
        accreditation of private employment service providers. A rating system for service
        providers was tested to provide more information to potential clients and to promote quality
        enhancement.

17. Component 3: Worker Protection (US$2.19 million; o/w US$0.88 million IBRD
financing and US$0.5 million grant from the government of Netherlands). This component
aimed to (a) improve the employment condition of migrant workers and (b) increase awareness of
worker rights and support legal services for migrants. In addition to the loan, grant, and counterpart
funding indicated above, an additional US$300,000 was provided by a parallel financed technical
assistance project.

       Subcomponent 3.1: The employment conditions subcomponent tested ways to
        improve employment conditions for migrant workers and to improve coverage and
        terms and conditions of labor contracts. The project supported the application of tools

                                                  6
           such as labor contract templates tailored to the needs of migrants. The project supported
           the national government to improve policies concerning the setting and adjustment of
           minimum wage and to assess experiences with measures such as wage funds. It explored
           ways to assist migrant workers and unions to strengthen collective bargaining. The project
           built government capacity to enforce policies concerning worker rights.

          Subcomponent 3.2: The legal services to migrant workers and awareness building of
           worker rights subcomponent supported pilot programs to provide legal aid services
           to migrants and developed implementation regulations for the labor arbitration law,
           with particular focus on exploring an expedited arbitration process for migrant
           workers. The project enhanced the awareness of migrant workers concerning their rights
           and responsibilities by developing various communication tools, providing training, and
           supporting education and public information campaigns.

18. Component 4: Policy Analysis, M&E, and Project Management (US$3.40 million; o/w
US$3.02 million IBRD financing). This component aimed to (a) support a policy-oriented
research program and the sharing of information and knowledge concerning rural-to-urban
migration; (b) help improve the monitoring of government programs in skills development,
employment services, and worker protection and conduct impact evaluations of selected policy
interventions; and (c) support project management and build capacity in general management and
planning.

          Subcomponent 4.1: The policy analysis and knowledge management subcomponent
           supported a policy-oriented research program to improve understanding of the
           trends of migration, challenges faced by migrants, and policy options. The
           subcomponent also supported knowledge-sharing activities by compiling, organizing, and
           maintaining an information and data warehouse that provides access to data, local policies,
           best practices, research findings, and other information concerning migration.

          Subcomponent 4.2: The monitoring and impact evaluation subcomponent helped
           develop a monitoring system for the government programs on migrant skills
           development, employment services, and worker protection. It supported the
           development of an indicator system and defined monitoring arrangement, data collection,
           production of periodic monitoring reports, and training for management and staff on
           program monitoring. The subcomponent also supported the design and implementation of
           the tracer studies.

          Subcomponent 4.3: The project management and capacity-building subcomponent
           supported the establishment and operation of Project Management Offices (PMOs)
           in the MOHRSS and in the project provinces and municipalities or counties. Capacity
           building focused on planning and management skills for policymakers and senior managers.

1.6 Revised Components

19.       No revisions were made to the components.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

20. Extensions of closing date. The project was restructured twice, extending the project
closing date for a total of 30 months, from the original project closing date of August 31, 2012,
to February 28, 2015. The first extension for 18 months was approved by the country director and

                                                   7
filed on March 20, 2012, while the second extension for 12 months was approved by the regional
vice president and filed on April 21, 2014.3

21. The extensions were necessary due to the initial delays in project implementation
caused by an unexpected reorganization of the project’s executing agency almost immediately
upon the approval of the project. The ministry and provincial agencies were subject to a major
reorganization which merged two ministries into the MOHRSS and entailed significant focus from
the ministry management and staff on internal organizational issues. The reorganization of the
ministry took around 12 months and somewhat longer in the provinces, resulting in significant
turnover of key Central Project Management Office (CPMO) and PPMO staff who had been
involved in the project preparation and in effect losing approximately two years of project
implementation period.

22. A total of US$2,481,861 was cancelled from the Bank loan. This includes the US$50,000
contract that was awarded to an entity without legal standing, and therefore determined as
misprocured4 the US$331,106 undisbursed by the CPMO, and the US$2,100,755 undisbursed by
the Shandong PMO by the project closing date.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

23. Project preparation. The ESW component of the comprehensive and collaborative
joint program, China Labor Market Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) Program,
provided the analytical underpinning of the project. The joint program comprised a
government-executed technical cooperation program and complementary analytical studies by the
Bank on labor market policies and institutions. The key recommendations of the report were for
the government to (a) strengthen worker voice; (b) strengthen social insurance systems; (c) foster
labor mobility and integrate migrant workers; and (d) facilitate reemployment and address skills
gaps. International experiences based on this analytical work suggest that an integrated package of
services covering skills training and employment services rather than training alone is more
effective. Also, based on the recommendations made by the AAA, Active Labor Market Programs
should respond to labor market demand and be linked to real workplaces. The project design draws
heavily from the main findings and policy recommendations that emerged from this collaboration.
The comprehensive nature of the analytical work allowed the project design to address a broad set
of issues faced by migrant workers by combining training with employment services, creating a
strong link between training design and provision with local industries, and establishing quality
assurance mechanisms combined with a worker rights component.

24. A knowledge-sharing workshop was also conducted as part of project preparation in
January 2007. The workshop was aimed at widening the perspective of the counterpart project
team by learning from international experiences. The workshop focused on skills development and
M&E, introducing main findings from impact evaluation of active labor market programs around

  The notice to the client regarding the amendment to the project agreement was sent by the acting country
director on February 13, 2014, but the restructuring was not filed until April 21, 2014, when the
confirmation from the client was received.

  This was identified by the Audit Report issued on June 30, 2012. See a more detailed description under
Procurement in section 2.4.

                                                     8
the world. This workshop helped bring the Bank and the counterpart teams’ expectations and ideas
together, paving the way for a more innovative project design.

25. Strategic approach and relevance were appropriate. The project design is fully
consistent with the Bank’s China Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006–2010 (dated May 23,
2006; Report Number 35435) and reflects the government’s priorities as laid out in the 11th Five
Year Plan for 2006–2010. The sharp increase in urban labor demand in the previous 15 years
brought about ‘the largest moving of people in history’. This unprecedented wave of migration
required the government to urgently face the challenge of integrating a large number of migrants
working in urban areas to provide them with better access to employment opportunities.

26. The project design appropriately reflected lessons learned and international
experiences, resulting in an innovative design providing comprehensive support to rural
migrants. This integrated approach allowed provinces or autonomous regions to identify activities
that would be beneficial to their localities that are at different stages of economic development,
further inducing commitments from the local government.

27. The relevance of the PDO was the key factor that sustained the commitment of the
government to the project despite staff turnover at the ministry and the PMOs as a result of
the reorganization. The reorganization of the executing agency was a large setback to the capacity-
building efforts during project preparation and the momentum built toward effectiveness. Although
the momentum was lost due to the reorganization and staff turnover, the government’s commitment
toward the project remained strong due to the relevance of the project objectives.

28. Risk assessment. At the time of project preparation, the weak implementation capacity
was appropriately considered substantial in achieving the PDO. Lack of leadership of the
CPMO and poor monitoring to support the M&E component of the project were indeed the two
weaknesses of the project, requiring the Bank’s intensive technical assistance.

2.2 Implementation

29.       The project faced a slow start losing the initial two years, with a turning point marked
at the midterm review (MTR) that led to an accelerated phase of implementation—the pace
of which was maintained until the closing of the project. The project was implemented for a
total of six years and four months, with the first two-and-a-half years facing a slow start caused by
the government reorganization. The reorganization led to significant changes and reductions in the
number of PMO staff at all levels and substantially weakened the CPMO. The global financial
crisis also had an effect on the project. PMO staff were diverted from their project tasks to work on
addressing the impacts of the crisis as the rural migrants were largely affected by the shutdown of
export-oriented manufacturing enterprises. For example, in Anhui Province, many rural migrants
returned to the province as a result of the crisis and the project staff were assigned to local response
initiatives such as daily monitoring of returned migrants, the establishment of the Business Startup
Park for migrant workers, distribution of subsidies to enterprises to stabilize employment, and
provision and subsidies for on-the-job training. By the MTR, two-and-a-half years into project
implementation (June 2011), the project had disbursed 7 percent, marking an 84 percent
disbursement lag.

30.     The MTR was the turning point, resulting in a set of agreements to accelerate the
implementation. Around the time of the MTR, procurement of IT equipment and machinery were
initiated and smaller procurement packages were at various stages of processing. Although the
procurement processes were starting to move, the ‘soft’ activities (that is, research, training, and

                                                   9
curriculum development) that consist of technical and capacity-building activities were still lagging.
The MTR concluded with the following agreements: (a) the PMOs to revise the implementation
and procurement plans; (b) the CPMO to organize project management training activities; and (c)
the government to ensure timely sharing of project outputs to allow the Bank to provide technical
inputs.

31.     The MTR created a new momentum, confirming a renewed commitment to the project
led by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to catch up with the delays in project implementation
and improve project performance. The MOF-MOHRSS-Bank tripartite meetings were held
regularly between October 2010 until the end of 2013 to discuss progress on project implementation,
including identifying priority issues, identifying fiduciary and project management training needs,
and providing support for the semiannual report writing. The tripartite meetings were initially held
every two weeks, later reduced to monthly meetings, and then bimonthly as project implementation
picked up pace. This focus on accelerating project implementation was met with significant
progress by the following supervision mission in January 2012. Large procurement packages had
been processed, bidding documents had been issued for larger machinery, and good progress was
made on national competitive bidding (NCB) packages at the local level. Implementation of ‘soft’
activities had also progressed, including policy studies at the central level, capacity building and
staff training, development of training curriculum, and protection of workers’ rights. By February
2012, the disbursement rate had doubled since the MTR to 14 percent.

32.     With the improving performance in project implementation, the first restructuring
was processed to extend the closing date by 18 months as it was clear that project activities
could not be completed by the original closing date of August 31, 2012. Although the
government had requested for a two-year extension of the project closing date, the Bank proposed
and the government agreed that an 18-month extension would better balance the desire for an
adequate period of extension with the need to sustain the implementation momentum achieved
since the MTR.

33.     By January 28, 2014, when the second restructuring was requested, the project had
disbursed 81 percent. The government continued to be fully committed to the project as
addressing training and employment services for migrant workers was one of the government’s top
policy priorities. With the one-year extension, the project was on track to complete all project
activities and was expected to achieve the PDO.

2.3 M&E Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34. In addition to the poor capacity of the project PMOs, the main issues related to the
project M&E were brought to the attention of the PMOs from the implementation of the
quasi-experimental impact evaluation when the project was experiencing a slow start. The
M&E design incorporated an innovative quasi-experimental impact evaluation, considered as best
practice. However, this impact evaluation did not take off due to changes in the ministry’s
leadership at the start of the project. Alternative arrangements made to collect data through a local
academic institute failed due to quality issues of data collected by the institute, which ultimately
led to dropping impact evaluation from the project. Strong technical assistance from the Bank
enabled project monitoring by the PPMOs.

35. Initial delays in implementing the impact evaluation were due to changes in the
government. By October 2010, two years after project effectiveness, the MOF called for a meeting
to discuss the continued relevance of the project and its potential in turning around the project
implementation delays. The meeting concluded that given the high relevance of the PDO, the

                                                 10
project should continue to be implemented but all efforts must be made to accelerate project
implementation. During this period, the government was reluctant to launch data collection for the
impact evaluation, considering it more important to prioritize their focus on catching up on other
implementation delays.

36. Further, data collected by the local academic institute as an alternative arrangement
was of poor quality, inconsistent, and unreliable. Data to monitor the indicators in the RF was
collected by a local academic institute for the MTR from April 18 to May 4, 2011, but there were
some inconsistencies in the data. Some key indicators were not supported by the team’s
observations in the field, with insufficient clarifications provided in the report. After one more
attempt by the institute to monitor the project indicators, the PPMOs agreed to take charge of
collecting data for the RF directly from project schools. Despite repeated efforts by the Bank to
collect information from non-project schools, the PPMOs were able to collect data only from
project schools. After the MTR, it became increasingly clear that the quasi-experimental impact
evaluation will not be implemented; however, there is no documentation of dropping the original
design and agreeing on an alternative method.

37. As a consequence, the end target values for the indicators in the RF were not set as
initially planned due to delays and eventual change in arrangements for data collection. The
targets were expected to be set based on the findings of the baseline survey for a quasi-experimental
impact evaluation. The impact evaluation was planned as a three-wave evaluation survey to identify
the effects of project investments by comparing the treatment and controls over time. This approach
was discussed and confirmed with the government at project negotiation. The end target values for
the indicators in the RF were established at the second project restructuring.

38. As stated above, the original set of indicators for the project were rephrased to better
define the indicators and supplemented by new indicators during the second restructuring.
This is mainly because the original intentions of the definitions of the indicators were lost at the
time of implementation and some of the indicators that were collected did not appropriately reflect
the wording of the original indicators. Therefore, definitions and measurement units were modified
for one PDO outcome indicator and six intermediate outcome indicators. The sharpened definitions
of the revised PDO outcome indicators were more focused and more appropriately measured the
achievement of the PDO. The intermediate indicators were also more closely aligned with the
investments made by the project.

39. Had the quasi-experimental impact evaluation taken off, it would have been the first
Bank-financed rigorous impact assessment of an investment project in China. Although
technically sound, this may have been ambitious considering the environment in China where such
rigorous evaluations are rarely conducted. Nevertheless, the fact that this impact evaluation did not
take place was a missed opportunity for the government to obtain evidence on project impacts and
insights on effective policy reforms. After the quasi-experimental evaluation design was dropped,
the Bank continued to discuss with the government to design and conduct an evaluation study. The
alternative evaluation design proposed was a tracer study, designed as a retroactive case-control
study, comparing the current status (outcome) of graduates from project schools (case) and non-
project schools (control). After many months of discussions, it was agreed that data collection
would be conducted in Anhui Province and Ningxia Autonomous Region.5


5
  The final report of the evaluation study was made available to the Bank during the final stages of ICR
writing. Although the government’s project completion report makes references to the evaluation study
findings, the Bank found some methodological issues in the analysis of the study and thus the findings are

                                                   11
40. M&E implementation and use was an area that required significant efforts from the
Bank team, primarily due to poor capacities of the project PMOs. The institute contracted for
data collection was not able to collect and report the data with adequate quality. The data collection
was therefore conducted by the PPMO staff by working directly with the various project schools
and employment service centers. There were data issues in the initial rounds of data collection that
were subsequently corrected, such as (a) indicators were incorrectly defined; (b) calculation errors
were made during compilation; and (c) unreasonable fluctuations that could not be explained were
observed. With tremendous efforts and strong collaboration between the PMOs and the Bank, the
capacity of the PMOs was strengthened and the data quality in the RF was reasonable and reliable
in assessing the progress of the project outcomes.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41. The project did not trigger OP 4.10. Although the Hui community in the Ningxia
Autonomous Region has a clear ethnic identification, their lifestyle, including language,
economic practices, and social behaviors, is quite similar to that of the broader Han Chinese
society. Therefore, the Hui are not particularly vulnerable to hardship or exclusion from the
development process and do not meet the definition of ‘indigenous people’ as provided in OP 4.10.

42. According to OP 4.01, the project is classified as Category C with regard to
environmental effects. The project had no adverse environmental effects. A certain amount of
civil works was financed by counterpart funds to build new or renovate existing classrooms, labs,
libraries, and dorms. These civil works followed Chinese regulations and requirements on
environmental protection and management. The civil works plan was reviewed by the Bank after
appraisal and it was confirmed that none of the activities would go beyond the concept defined by
OP 4.01 for Category C.

43. Financial management was rated in the Satisfactory range throughout project
implementation. The project had an adequate project financial management system and provided
reasonable assurance and accurate and timely information on project implementation progress, with
timely reporting of external audits of project funds. There were no major outstanding issues, and
minor deficiencies such as delays in project accounting and financial reporting by the PPMOs were
addressed or resolved in a timely manner.

44. Procurement rating ranged from Satisfactory to Unsatisfactory throughout project
implementation but was given a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the last Implementation
Status and Results Report (ISR). Procurement was unsatisfactory initially due to the delays in
international competitive bidding (ICB) procurement processes and procurement of consultants to
conduct ‘soft’ activities that included training, curriculum development, and policy studies. There
was also one case of misprocurement identified by the Audit Report for the year ended December
31, 2011, issued by the State Audit Bureau on June 30, 2012. The Audit Report disclosed that a
US$50,000 contract was awarded by the CPMO to an entity with no legal standing. The team
requested the government to suspend payments on this contract, recorded the issue in the aide
memoire (supervision mission July 22–26, 2012), and conducted a post review. The CPMO and


not referred to in this ICR. One of the main issues found was that although the outcomes such as wage levels
and employment rate vary to a large extent by the sector and the location the graduates are employed in (or
the vocational skills the graduates were trained in for those who are unemployed), these factors were not
controlled for in the regression analysis. This was despite the fact that there was a wide variation in the
distribution of sectors of employment among the graduates sampled for project schools and non-project
schools.

                                                    12
the MOF agreed to the findings of the Audit Report and the Bank’s post review. The CPMO
appropriately addressed the issue by halting all future payments on this contract and repaid the
Bank US$15,000 which had already been paid to the entity under this contract.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45. The government is keen to ensure the sustainability of the investments made by the
project, including maintenance of equipment and goods, and is making appropriate
arrangements at the provincial level. To ensure that the equipment and other goods procured by
the project are well-maintained and effectively used, the Department of Human Resource and
Social Security in Ningxia issued a notice dated March 20, 2015. The notice provides guidelines
for asset management of the equipment inventory registration, daily operational management,
maintenance, utilization and disposal, safety procedures, and the use of the seven mobile training
facilities. The order will warrant the ownership and the responsibilities to maintain equipment
procured under the project for the training facilities, vocational schools, and public employment
service centers, therefore ensuring sustainability. Anhui Province has an existing policy (issued in
2013) on asset management while Shandong is preparing to issue a similar notice. Furthermore, the
Ningxia Autonomous Region issued a policy to sustain the capacities built in project schools,
mobilize further resources to invest in rural migrant training, and strengthen dissemination of
achievements. The province is committed to maintaining the PMO to facilitate the
institutionalization of the positive impacts of the project.

46. Pilot initiatives related to worker protection have been mainstreamed into the worker
protection efforts for (non-migrant) general workers, with raised awareness and sensitivities
of migrant-specific issues among local officials. The activities under Component 3 on migrant
worker protection were funded by the Dutch Trust Fund (TF) (at the central level and in Shandong)
and Technical Cooperation Credit 5 (TCC5) (in Anhui and Ningxia). These activities closed earlier
than the project with the TCC5 in Anhui closing in 2010 and the Dutch TF and the TCC5 in Ningxia
closing in 2011. The activities funded under this component, including the pilot initiatives of legal
aid for migrant workers and provision of a template for worker contracts, have been integrated into
the general worker protection efforts of the provincial and regional governments.

47. Provinces have local initiatives that will sustain the investments made by the project.
In Shandong, the General Office of Shandong People’s Government issued Three-Year Action
Plans covering 2015 to 2017 for Rural Migrant Workers Skills Upgrade, for Rural Migrant Rights
Protection, and for Public Services, which mirrors the components of the project. The Three-Year
Action Plan for Rural Migrant Workers Skills Upgrade supports the provision of vocational training
and its range of skills training for migrant workers. The Three-Year Action Plan for Rural Migrant
Rights Protection will provide training workshops with the aim of increasing rural migrants with
contracts, strengthening collective bargaining and equal pay, improving coverage in social
insurance, and improving worker safety. The Three-Year Action Plan for Public Services is aimed
at improving social service provision to rural migrants, including employment services, health
services, education for children of rural migrants, and housing security. Anhui Province has issued
policies to provide free tuition and financial aid to students from poor households studying non-
agricultural programs (jointly financed through central and provincial funds). Anhui Province has
also increased financial subsidies for investments in qualified training institutes for training
equipment upgrades and for strengthening entrepreneurship training.

48. Furthermore, the National Policy Framework supporting rural-to-urban migration
has ensured increased government budget allocation at all levels, resulting in greater
investments in TVET schools and public employment service centers. Social policies presented

                                                 13
in the 12th Five Year Plan also envisage equalization of access to public services to all citizens
(including health care, education, employment, pension, social assistance, and housing). These
reforms will continue to build on the investments made by the program and transform the labor
market toward a fuller labor market integration and build stronger institutions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

49. The PDOs were highly relevant to the country’s priorities when the project was
developed and continue to be highly relevant at the time of the Implementation Completion
and Results Report (ICR). The objectives fit with the government’s priorities as laid out in the
11th Five Year Plan for 2006–2010 and the Bank’s China CPS 2006–2010. The objectives continue
to be highly relevant at the time of the ICR, reflecting the government’s 12th Five Year Plan for
2011–2015 and the Bank’s CPS for the period FY13–16. The 12th Five Year Plan, as part of its
urbanization strategy, supports the process of migration of rural farmers to urban towns by
“establishing basic training and allowance systems for migrant workers, pushing forward the
general coordination in provincial level regarding the capital management for the trainings of
migrant workers.” Similarly, the CPS for FY13–16 continues to support the government’s
commitment to promote more inclusive development by addressing inequities that have emerged
during the reform period, improving policies and delivery systems to promote rural-urban
integration, and strengthening skills development including for migrants.

50. The relevance of project design is substantial. The PDO was appropriately aligned with
the activities under each component, the outcome indicators, and the intermediate outcome
indicators. Although several of the indicators were reworded during the second restructuring, these
were to sharpen the meaning of the indicators and to define them as was interpreted by the project
team. The components were designed to address key issues and bottlenecks for migrant workers
identified by the China Labor Market Study component of the comprehensive China Labor Market
Development AAA Program. The high relevance of the project design allowed the project outputs,
in particular the policy studies, to contribute to higher-level national policy discussions.

51. The relevance of project implementation is substantial. The implementation of the
project activities was successful at the central level and in the three project provinces but most
notably highly successful in the Ningxia Autonomous Region and Anhui Province. Ningxia and
Anhui, although with weaker capacities at the PMOs initially, were able to complete relevant
activities in a timely manner and with good quality. All outputs delivered through the four
components produced concrete and tangible contributions toward the PDOs. Furthermore, the
project served as a platform for knowledge sharing by working directly with the subnational
governments, fostering interagency cooperation, and applying international best practices through
intensive technical assistance and the knowledge base founded by the preceding analytical work
underpinning the project design.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

52. The overall achievement of the PDOs is Satisfactory. This section evaluates the results
against the targets as well as the positive trends throughout the project period. The primary PDO
outcome is to support rural migrants through the process of rural-to-urban migration, in order for
them to access better urban employment opportunities that will improve incomes as well as their
working conditions. Improved access to better employment opportunities were expected to be
achieved through increased access to better-quality skills training opportunities and enhanced

                                                14
provision of employment services. To improve working conditions, the project aimed to increase
coverage and terms and conditions of labor contracts, to provide legal aid services to migrants, and
to develop implementation regulations for the labor arbitration law, with particular focus on
exploring an expedited arbitration process for migrant workers.

53. The project achieved the PDO to improve rural migrants’ access to skills development
opportunities. The total number of those trained in project schools, and particularly those who
originated from the rural areas, steadily increased in all three provinces. Targets in increasing the
number of graduates of short-, medium-, and long-term training from project training institutes
were met in Anhui and Ningxia, while in Shandong the December 2014 outcome reached only 85
percent of the target value.6 In Anhui and Ningxia, the increase in the numbers of those trained who
were from rural areas almost doubled between April 2009 and December 2014. A higher proportion
of the graduates received short-term training in December 2014 than in April 2009 in all provinces,
recognizing the constraints migrant workers face with regard to affordability of direct and indirect
costs of skills training. This is a result of the project’s investments in training equipment and
teaching facilities that led to an expanded training curriculum and improved quality of training. The
improvements in training quality and quantity have been widely publicized in local newspapers and
other media, resulting in heightened appreciation for the training in project schools and increasing
the number of applicants every year.

54. The targets for the PDO outcome of the percentage of graduates finding employment
within six months of training completion were met and positive trends were observed
throughout the project period for all provinces. The improvements in this indicator are
staggering with 47, 38, and 4 percentage point increases in the Anhui, Shandong Provinces and
Ningxia Autonomous Region, respectively, compared to the baseline. Targets for graduates finding
employment in the occupational field for which they were trained within six months were also met
or reached over 97 percent of the target in all three provinces. These achievements reflect the fact
that training courses became more sensitive to market needs with strong collaboration with
enterprises. According to the intermediate indicators, almost all of the graduates obtained a diploma
or certificates and the National Occupational Qualification Certification. About 85 percent, 89
percent, and 73 percent in Anhui, Ningxia, and Shandong, respectively, found jobs in firms that the
project schools had partnerships with, vastly decreasing the cost of searching for a job.

55. The project also helped reduce the cost of job search through access to enhanced
employment services. The use of local public employment services for counseling, job referral,
and guidance increased 20-fold in Anhui Province (from a baseline of 30,566 to 623,603 in
December 2014), by 40 percent in Ningxia Autonomous Region, and 50 percent in Shandong
Province between April 2009 and December 2014. All provinces met their targets for this
intermediate results indicator both for all job seekers and those originating from the rural areas.
Investments were made to improve the quality of services such as Shandong’s efforts in
establishing a local-level one-stop shop providing employment services and job counselling,
entrepreneurship training, provision of loans, social security, legal aid, and residential registration.
Similarly, Shandong issued a series of polices and measures to strengthen the service standards by
establishing (a) a rural and urban integrated employment plan; (b) provincial development plan for
human resources service industry; (c) service standards for public employment services; and (d)
performance evaluation measures for the employment funds. Shandong also established an urban-
rural integrated HR database, making it easier for job seekers to access information regarding jobs

6
  While the target value for the PDO indicator ‘# of graduates receiving short-, medium-, and long-term
training from project training institutions’ for Shandong was 32,190 graduates, the indicator only reached
27,403 in December 2014.

                                                    15
in urban areas through their local public employment service centers. All three provinces set
standards for trained public employment service officials, improving the quality of services
provided.

56. The project helped improve the incomes of rural migrant workers. The targets for the
PDO indicator on the level of wages of the students who graduated from long-term training in
project training institutions have been met or were close to being met, with improvements observed
throughout the project period.7 The wage levels in China in general had seen steady increases
during the project period. According to the National Bureau of Statistics’ China Rural Migrant
Workers Monitoring Reports (2011–2013), the wages almost doubled from 2008 to 2013 in
nominal terms (see annex 10).8 The trends in the nominal wage levels of the graduates of long-term
training in project schools followed similar increases. Considering the per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) by province, the three project provinces are considered to be lagging behind in their
respective regions. The average wages of project school graduates originating from rural areas
reaching the national average could be seen as evidence of the project’s good performance.

57. The project helped improve working conditions of rural migrant workers. There was
no PDO indicator to monitor the progress of the outcomes on worker protection. However, there
was an intermediate outcome indicator that monitored the number of rural migrants who received
legal assistance for addressing labor disputes, which has been met. In Shandong Province, the
number of rural migrants who received legal assistance provided increased 8-fold, and the same
doubled in Anhui Province. The number of rural migrants receiving legal assistance gradually
decreased in Ningxia Autonomous Region and the target for this intermediate indicator (5,000) was
set below the baseline in April 2009 (7,643) because the number of disputes requiring legal
assistance was expected to be reduced. The most common labor disputes faced by migrant workers
in Ningxia had been on wage payment. The timing of the project coincided with an increase in
labor disputes primarily involving migrant workers as a result of the passing of the 2008 Law on
Labor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration, which consisted of three labor laws on labor contract,
employment promotion, and labor mediation and arbitration (The World Bank; Development
Research Center of the State Council, China, 2014). Ningxia, however, was able to gradually reduce
the number of disputes, possibly due to the fact that Ningxia is a sender province of rural migrants.
The increase in disputes as a result of the law may not have been as pronounced. The reduction in
labor disputes in Ningxia was made possible by the strengthening of the education on rights
protection, raising awareness of migrant workers. This was done through the distribution of
educational materials at spring festivals when many migrants gathered. A popular educational
material was a set of playing cards with messages on laws, regulations, and services on worker
rights protection printed on each card. As a result, rural migrants became more consistent and
resolute in ensuring claims were heard by their employers. At the same time, the administrative
guidelines for supervision for labor protection now specify the issues that are reviewed,
significantly improving the enforcement of the regulations with, for example, more workers with
signed contracts and awareness on their access to social security. These improvements together
were expected to significantly reduce the number of migrant labor disputes, resulting in less need
for legal assistance.

58. Based on the above discussion and evidence, the overall achievement of the PDOs is
therefore rated as Satisfactory. It should be noted, though, that China also experienced
impressive economic growth during this period (between 2008 and 2014). As such, in the absence

7
  The targets were met in Shandong and Anhui Provinces, while in Ningxia Autonomous Region the
indicators for all students and rural students reached 93 percent of the target wages.
8
  From CNY 1,340 in 2008 to CNY 2,609 in 2013.

                                                 16
of the impact evaluation as originally designed, it is hard to disentangle the effects of the project
on certain outcome indicators from the national trend for these indicators. In general, non-project
provinces during this period also saw increased investments in technical and vocational education.
Had the impact evaluation been implemented, the assessment of the project’s contributions would
have been clearer. In the absence of such an impact evaluation, this ICR focusses on describing the
contributions the project made by weaving together the evidence provided by the project PMOs.

3.3 Efficiency

59. The project outcomes have significantly contributed to improving the cost-
effectiveness, efficiency, and relevancy of programs addressing rural migrants.9 The level of
efficiency of project implementation was rated as Modest. This is because the project experienced
significant delays in the initial years of the project, resulting in a project implementation period of
six years and four months while the project was designed for four years. Nonetheless, important
results of some project activities were achieved in an efficient way.

60. Central-level investments in developing digital training materials promises large
future gains in efficiency. Modular and competency-based training materials were developed for
skills training, including 23 digital material packages and 45 digital curriculum packages. The
quality of these training materials was assessed to be good and obtained positive feedback from
those who piloted the training materials. Development of digital training materials and curriculum
through the project promises a high efficiency gain in future skills development once the
dissemination strategy is identified and implemented as the digital materials are final and ready for
dissemination.

61. Investments in public employment services at the county and township levels improved
cost-effectiveness of employment services by improving quality and relevancy through a more
market-oriented and demand-driven approach. Public employment service officers are able to
better cater to the needs of job seekers, not only by providing information on job opportunities but
also by providing a more comprehensive set of services including information, advocacy,
introduction to occupations, training, contract signing, and registration of laborers and firms. These
one-stop shop services were provided at all local public employment service centers in Shandong.

62. As previously mentioned, the project implementation coincided with an explosion in
labor disputes as a result of the passing of the 2008 Law on Labor Dispute Mediation and
Arbitration. As very little had been done by the government in terms of efforts regarding
protection of migrant workers, all the activities that the project supported were highly relevant and
timely. Preventive measures including worker rights awareness raising, institutionalizing contract
signing, and collective bargaining have all contributed to protecting migrant workers.

63. Interventions such as policy studies that had national significance are highly efficient
given the number of people—some 260 million existing rural-to-urban migrants and many
more hundreds of millions of future migrants—who would benefit by the interventions.
Different departments of the MOHRSS carried out 28 studies in addition to 17 distinct deliverables
produced as part of curriculum development. These studies have provided direct contributions to

  The traditional net present value and economic rate of return were not calculated for this ICR since it is
difficult to obtain a quantitative estimate of the impact of project investments on employment outcomes.
The economic analysis in the project’s Project Appraisal Document (PAD) also focused on assessing the
project’s contributions with regard to improving cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and relevancy of programs
targeted at migrants.

four policy guidelines related to public employment service, migrant training, skills training, and
other services to migrants affecting the conditions of migrant workers nationwide. The studies also
led to the development of methodologies, tools and indicators, standards, certification processes,
and training reference materials in addition to the digital training materials developed under
curriculum development.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64. The overall outcome rating of the project is Moderately Satisfactory based on the
analysis above. The positive attributes of the project are (a) relevance of design and
implementation were substantial and (b) the PDO was achieved measured by the significant
improvements related to the PDO-level indicators and qualitative information collected on the
overall improvements in the skills training and the support system for migrant workers, including
employment services and rights protection. However, these positive attributes were
counterbalanced by the following shortcomings: (a) implementation efficiency was set back by the
initial delays in the start of the project which affected the implementation through to the end of the
project and (b) the impact evaluation was not conducted as originally designed.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

65. Although the project did not directly target the poorest of the poor in rural areas, the
project has had a positive impact on poverty and rural development. This was through migrant
remittances, enhanced agricultural productivity from more efficient land use, and the transfer of
skills and capital to rural areas with return migration.

66. The project did not place specific focus on the gender differences in the impacts of
project interventions or monitor the different impacts of project interventions by gender,
although findings of the tracer study may suggest the need for gender-sensitive interventions.
The project did not have a specific focus on gender as rural migrants are predominantly male, with
about a third estimated to be female by the National Bureau of Statistics. However, according to
the graduates tracer study conducted in Ningxia Autonomous Region that tracked graduates from
project schools in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to interview them, 44.5 percent of the 3,264 valid responses
from graduates of short-term training10 and 61 percent of the 880 valid responses from graduates
of long-term training11 were from females. According to a similar tracer study conducted in Anhui
Province, although the gender breakdown of the sample is unknown, a larger share of female
graduates currently hold general staff and team leader positions in their job while more male
graduates hold technician and managerial jobs. The average wages of the first job after graduation
for female graduates were about 5 percent lower (CNY 2,182 per month) than for male graduates
(CNY 2,291 per month). According to the same tracer study in Anhui, more female graduates than
their male counterparts considered that the training was not useful in their first job as well as in
their current jobs. These findings suggest that the project appears to have had some positive impacts
that were specific to female migrant workers, while the findings also suggest a need for further
analysis and gender-sensitive interventions.

     This is out of a total of 4,380 questionnaires sent out, yielding a response rate of 75 percent.

     This is out of a total of 2,020 questionnaires sent out, yielding a response rate of 43.5 percent.

                                                         18
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67. Project management capacities were strengthened at all levels. The CPMO and the
PPMOs struggled with the structured nature of the Bank’s fiduciary processes and the processes of
monitoring project implementation progress and at times complained that they were the source of
implementation delays. Nevertheless, the PMOs also appreciated the logical and rigorous processes
established for project management and attributed the successful implementation of the project in
part to the rigor of the Bank’s processes and its structures. They suggested that the government
adopt these processes in their own program operations. In particular, the PMOs found it useful to
establish objectives, outcome indicators, and intermediary outcome indicators to measure progress
and set up a system to monitor the progress through these indicators.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

68. Supporting urban-rural migration and reversing the rising inequality between the
rural and urban population is a priority for the Chinese government to sustain China’s
economic growth. The urbanization in China has been rapid, which facilitated the unprecedented
economic transformation and although gradual, the government is making important progress in
addressing mobility restrictions. The urbanization process remains incomplete with migrants still
lacking urban hukou that provides them access to urban public services and social security.
Although hukou reform was beyond the scope of this project, the issue has significant bearing on
the outcome of the migration. The Chinese government is making gradual but important progress
in hukou reforms at the local level since 2006. The State Council called for a gradual rollover of
the residence permit system in 2011.

69. To sustain the project’s development outcomes, considerable capacity has been built
at the local level, establishing a new norm in training facilities, vocational schools, and public
employment service centers toward market orientation and collaboration with enterprises.
The pedagogical approach transformed through the project’s investments in equipment, training of
staff, and exposure to international and domestic experiences were extremely positive, visible, and
appreciated. These changes at the local level are expected to have a long-lasting effect.

70. The favorable policy environment created through research and studies leading to
improvements in policies for migrant workers is expected to be sustained (that is, will not be
reversed). However, the level of future efforts to further improve the policy environment at the
central level may be slower than the pace in recent years during project implementation. These
factors together will sustain and further improve the development outcomes. The possibility of
reversal is expected to be low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71. The project design was based on comprehensive analytical work allowing the project
to address the key issues faced by rural migrant workers. This ensured that the project was
well-aligned with the government’s priorities and that there was a shared understanding between
the government and the Bank of the key issues and policy options to be addressed by the project.
The project design incorporated learnings from international experiences based on this analytical
work to provide an integrated package of services covering skills training and employment services
rather than a narrow set of interventions. The comprehensive package of services supported rural
migrants throughout the process of rural-to-urban migration, including investments in training
institutes to improve training capacity and quality, strengthened public employment services, and
supporting migrant worker conditions through worker rights protection. The Bank team included
appropriate technical specialists to develop the project. The team actively engaged the government
at the central and provincial levels in the preparation of the project to ensure that the project design
was relevant and appropriate.

72. An ambitious impact evaluation incorporated in the project design and the lack of
gender mainstreaming were two shortcomings in the project design. Although the
incorporation of impact evaluation as an integral component of the project’s monitoring design may
have been ambitious, the government was fully on board, which would have been a first Bank-
financed project in China with a rigorous impact evaluation. Given the relatively weak capacity in
project M&E identified at the appraisal stage, the evaluation design could have been made simpler
or the team could have identified an alternative design in case implementation did not go smoothly.
In addition, the M&E framework failed to document the plans for target-value setting of the key
indicators for the RF, contributing to the delays in target setting during the supervision phase.
Another shortcoming in the project design was the fact that the project did not have a gender-
sensitive design and did not monitor outcomes broken down by gender. This is despite the fact that
an initial social assessment report12 recommends that special focus is placed on gender. Although
only a third of the rural migrants have been women over the years as estimated by the National
Bureau of Statistics, female rural migrants face specific and different needs and constraints when
compared to men.

73. The Moderately Satisfactory rating of Bank performance at Quality at Entry weighs the
highly relevant project design incorporating best practices and the shortcomings of the complex
impact evaluation design and lack of gender sensitivity.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74. As the project experienced a slow start, the Bank team proactively engaged with the
PMOs to speed up implementation and start-up activities. After the project launch workshop in
November 2008, the first supervision mission was conducted between April 5 and 15, 2009,13

where the team emphasized the importance of staffing key functions of the CPMO. The second
supervision mission was conducted between December 11 and 18, 2009, where the team
highlighted the fact that no procurement had taken place at the provincial and local levels, resulting
in a low disbursement rate.14 The third supervision mission was conducted between June 17 and 24,
2010, where the team identified the lack of project management capacity at the provincial level and
slow progress in procurement.15 The team further conducted an interim implementation support
mission between September 12 and 16, 2010, where the findings included staffing issues in all three
PPMOs and the lack of progress in procurement.16 Since the project launch, on an average, the team
conducted implementation support missions every five-and-a-half months, indicating the Bank
team’s proactive efforts to identify bottlenecks and find ways to accelerate implementation with
the PMOs.

75. Gearing up toward the MTR in June 2011, the Bank team further increased the
intensity of its engagement. Once the ministry’s reorganization was about to be completed, the
Bank team worked closely with the MOF and the MOHRSS, meeting every two weeks to support
the PMOs in accelerating the procurement of goods and consultant services. These biweekly
meetings initiated by the MOF became the key platform to identify bottlenecks and agree on
solutions.17 The proactive engagement is evident from the two restructurings that were processed
in a timely manner to support the government’s performance in project implementation and the
steady and consistent disbursements from 7 percent at the time of the MTR to 95 percent at the
time of writing of this ICR.

76. The intensive technical assistance from the Bank team strengthened the capacity of the
PPMOs to manage project implementation and to submit progress reports in a timely manner.
The Bank team also provided intensive support on ensuring the quality of research studies,
particularly at the provincial level, as research capacity is weak at the province level. The country-
based team proved particularly crucial in resolving bottlenecks and accelerating implementation
during the project’s ‘acceleration phase’ after the project MTR.

77. The one shortcoming was the delay in revising the M&E framework when it became
evident that the original plan would no longer be implemented. This delay had two effects: (a)
the target values for the RF were set only at the time of the second restructuring, a year before the
project closing and (b) the alternative method for the impact evaluation was agreed with the PMOs
at the very last stages of project implementation. The initial delay was due to the focus of the
government and the Bank on rectifying the delays in procurement and disbursement. The Bank
team continued to pursue the original rigorous impact evaluation through the MTR but did not
adjust the M&E framework until the second restructuring. Although the RF did not collect
indicators broken down by gender, the findings from the provincial tracer studies suggested that
male and female migrant workers were benefiting differently from the project. No adjustments were
made to the project design.

78. The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This takes into account the
proactive role the Bank team played before the MTR and after in supporting the government’s
efforts in accelerating project implementation. The rating also takes into account the team’s delays

agreed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79. Based on the Bank’s Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This takes into account the Moderately
Satisfactory rating at entry considering the team’s effectiveness in preparing a project design that
was highly relevant to the issues rural migrants faced and ensuring capacity building and consensus
building throughout the design phase. However, the project design lacked a strategy for gender
mainstreaming and included an ambitious evaluation design. The Bank performance during the
supervision phase is also rated Moderately Satisfactory given the team’s demonstrated proactive
engagement. However, the team failed to set the target value earlier when it was evident that the
evaluation design will not be implemented as originally designed.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80. Although the reorganization of two ministries into the MOHRSS could not have been
foreseen, the ministry did not take action to reinforce the CPMO to take a stronger leadership
role even after the reorganization was completed. Participation of a senior MOHRSS official
was documented in one supervision mission in December 2009, where the deputy director general
chaired and facilitated an open discussion about the challenges that the project was facing at the
time.18 Nevertheless, despite numerous discussions with the MOHRSS on the need for the CPMO
to take a stronger leadership role, the CPMO remained weak and understaffed throughout project
implementation. Similarly, the MOHRSS did not focus on the slow progress in the implementation
of the M&E framework. The MOHRSS could have addressed the issue by providing additional
expertise and staff to the CPMO.

81. The MOF played an active role in ensuring that project implementation was
accelerated through the conduct of regular tripartite meetings. These meetings were held once
every two weeks starting September or October 2010 and were gradually reduced to once a month
and once every two months as the project implementation gained momentum. The last meeting was
held toward the end of 2013. Issues addressed through the tripartite meetings included:

          identified training needs at the provincial level on financial management, procurement,
           semiannual report writing, and project management;
          identified issues, causes of delays, and solutions; and
          agreements on priorities until the following meeting.

82. In addition, the MOF played an effective oversight role by making sure that the CPMO
provided management support to the PPMOs but also asked the Bank to work directly with
the PPMOs and not necessarily through the CPMO. Furthermore, counterpart funding was fully
provided at all levels, demonstrating the strong commitment to the project. Balancing the active
and effective role played by the MOF and the lack of action by the MOHRSS to strengthen the
CPMO’s leadership role, which contributed to the initial delays in project implementation and

failure to implement the evaluation as originally designed, the government rating is Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83. The CPMO and the three PPMOs were all actively engaged in project implementation
and supervision, with the Ningxia and Anhui PMOs performing particularly well. The impact
of the ministry’s reorganization was experienced at different degrees by the four PMOs. The CPMO
and the Shandong PMO experienced the largest turnover of key staff, while the staff of Ningxia
and Anhui PPMOs negotiated with their offices to minimize staff turnover. Although the Ningxia
Autonomous Region and Anhui Province were considered to have lower capacity relative to the
central and Shandong PMOs, the Ningxia Autonomous Region and Anhui Province’ proactivity in
addition to the close engagement of the two provinces’ high-level officials had significant positive
impacts on the implementation of the project in these provinces. PMO staff of both Ningxia
Autonomous Region and Anhui Province remained the same throughout project preparation and
implementation. This resulted in good understanding of the project as well as its project
management requirements. The capacities built were most prominent for these two PPMOs, with
timely submission of quality data for the semiannual reports.

84. The Shandong PMO had suffered from a constant lack of dedicated staff appointed for
project management. At most, the project PMO had one staff working part-time on the project.
This resulted in delays in procurement processes as well as follow-up on other implementation
details. There was little engagement in the project by the local government oversight agencies,
resulting in a lack of understanding of the needs of the project by the local government. These
limitations manifested most prominently in the delays in submissions of reports and data for the
RF and the US$2.101 million undisbursed funds from the province allocation at project closing due
to delays in procurement processing.

85. The CPMO also suffered from rapid staff turnover at the initial stages of project
implementation and faced chronic staff shortages with project management. Staff shortages
that resulted in tasks consistently falling on one or two junior staff aggravated the lack of leadership
of the CPMO to coordinate and supervise and lead the project implementation. Despite repeated
discussions at tripartite meetings, little improvements were seen during project implementation
until the last several months of the project with the change in leadership of the project management
team. Based on these varied levels of efforts and effectiveness of the PMOs, the implementing
agencies’ performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

86. Based on the implementation analysis above, the overall borrower performance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory. This rating weighs the strong performance of the MOF in
accelerating implementation while MOHRSS was unable to strengthen the CPMO. Performance of
the PMOs varied, with weak CPMO and Shandong PMO performances counterbalanced by strong
and effective performance of the PMOs in Anhui and Ningxia.

6. Lessons Learned

87. The project adopted an innovative design by forming a model of intervention in
addressing the needs faced by rural migrants at different stages of the rural-to-urban

                                                  23
migration in a comprehensive manner. The project design embraced the lessons learned from
international experience that it is more effective to support job seekers by providing both training
and employment services rather than training alone. The diverse and extensive nature of the
bottlenecks faced by rural migrants required a project design that not only strengthened access to
skills development opportunities but also access to employment opportunities through employment
services and interventions to strengthen worker rights protection. The project also contributed to
strengthening policy framework through the policy studies which were primarily conducted at the
national level. This integrated model of package of services was highly relevant in all three project
provinces with different profiles, suggesting that the model could be highly relevant in many other
settings. Although the specifics of bottlenecks and hurdles faced by migrants may be different in
every context, this model that allows to address a diverse set of issues spanning from skills
development, job search, improved access to social services, and worker rights protection could be
applied in countries facing massive flows of rural-to-urban migration and international migration.

88. The flexible implementation mechanism allows tailored solutions for the varying needs
of provinces, whether net sender province or net receiver province of rural migrants. This
breadth of issues covered by the project is an important distinction from traditional TVET projects,
allowing the project to support both sending and receiving areas of rural migrants. Although the
project was comprehensive in design, the investments were left flexible to address the specific
needs faced by provinces at different stages of economic development. In Anhui, a major
contribution made by the project was the improved partnerships with local enterprises and increased
entrepreneurship. In the Ningxia Autonomous Region, the focus was improving training of basic
skills and outreach of training activities through mobile training bases. In Shandong, the project
investments were made in improving training of advanced technical skills. Different needs in the
three provinces were effectively addressed through the project investments’ flexible nature of the
project design.

89. The project was carefully designed so that the public sector would not crowd out the
private sector service delivery. Strong partnerships were fostered between the public sector and
the private sector to improve service quality and efficiency delivered by both public and private
sectors. For example, in Anhui Province, schools developed enterprise-specific training courses by
institutionalizing school-local enterprise partnerships and establishing a committee that met
regularly, twice a year. The committee jointly developed school development plans, teaching
reform initiatives, curriculum reviews, internship programs, trainer exchange programs, and
enterprise-based training (using the facilities of the local enterprises). As a result of this partnership,
various types and contents of skills training were offered through long-term training and modular,
short-term training that perfectly met the skills gap faced by the enterprises. An explicit goal in
Anhui Province was for the project schools to produce graduates with the skills required to meet
the specific needs of local enterprises. In addition, project schools organized an annual workshop
inviting large and mid-sized enterprises to identify the demand for high-tech skills. This school-
enterprise partnership development was modeled after what they learned through the study tour to
Hong Kong SAR, China funded by the project. Other efforts to foster public-private partnerships
were through the training of rural information collectors and labor brokers and other intermediaries,
particularly on protecting the rights of rural migrants. This was the first time in Ningxia that the
local government approached informal labor brokers and intermediaries, opening doors for further
collaboration.

90. Various training modalities were developed by paying special attention to migrant
workers’ constraints. Rural migrants, the main target group for the project, often could not afford



                                                    24
the time or the cost of attending lengthy academic training.19 Therefore, curriculum development
emphasized short-term and medium-term training provided in a modular manner for migrants to
attend the training at their own pace. The developed modular, digital training material financed by
the project is expected to also benefit migrants who cannot afford to spend long periods in training.
The training trucks in Ningxia are tailored to provide short-term practical training (for example, in
cooking or sewing) for women living in mountainous areas who would otherwise not be able to
travel to towns to attend training. This attention to the specific needs of the target group of migrant
workers was key to improving access to skills development for rural migrants.

91. There is a need to incorporate gender mainstreaming into the intervention model by
understanding gender perspectives in access to information, skills development opportunities,
employment services, and the gender disparities in the jobs rural migrants aspire to obtain.
As identified by the tracer study in Anhui, more female graduates than their male counterparts
considered that the training was not useful in their first job as well as in their current jobs,
suggesting that the types of skills taught at project schools were not appropriate for the jobs the
female migrant workers obtained. The tracer study also found that women hold general staff and
team leader positions while more male graduates hold technician and managerial jobs. Systematic
incorporation of gender focus at key stages of project design and implementation at all levels are
required to ensure that the specific needs of female rural migrants will also be appropriately
addressed.

92. The M&E framework adopted by the project was innovative, adopting the best-
practice design requiring strong capacity, commitment, and resources at the central level.
The lack of capacity to implement the M&E framework was identified as a risk at the appraisal
stage, which suggested a need for a different institutional arrangement alleviating the CPMO from
the designing and procurement of the firm to conduct the evaluation. The evaluation could have
been assigned to a separate office or agency. Similarly, given the pre-identified capacity concerns,
embedding impact evaluation in regular monitoring carries risks, particularly in the context of
China, where the government is not used to conducting impact evaluations. As a result of the delays
at the start of the project which delayed the implementation of the baseline data collection, there
were delays in collection of regular monitoring data as well. Given that this would have been the
first Bank investment project in China with a rigorous impact evaluation, it may have been more
prudent to separate monitoring data collection and impact assessment to minimize the risk of delays
and/or to have a pre-identified plan B in case the original plans were not realized. Although at the
design stage the government understood the benefits of a rigorous evaluation and committed to
implement the agreed design, the US$190,000 budget allocated for a three-round survey covering
three provinces does not seem to substantiate the initial commitment. Implementing rigorous
impact evaluations requires considerable resources and dedicated staff ideally independent from
project management functions.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      This section describes the outputs of the four components. The assessment is based on aide
memoires, ISRs, two implementation support and ICR Missions, and reports and information
submitted by the four PMOs. During the ICR mission, discussions were held with the relevant
officials at the PMOs.

2.    Table 2.1 presents the expenditures at the time of appraisal and at the time of writing the
ICR. The expenditures can also be broken down by expenditure categories: US$37.72 million on
goods; US$4.76 million on consulting services; and US$4.8 million on training, conferences, and
seminars.

3.      Component 1: Skills Development (US$72.84 million; o/w US$42.74 million IBRD
financing). This component aimed to (a) enhance capacity of the project provinces to deliver
training to potential migrants; (b) improve the quality, relevance, and flexibility of the training
offered, consistent with migrant and market needs in receiving areas; and (c) improve functioning
of the training market.

4.    The total expenditure to date for Component 1 is US$42.92 million, 100 percent of the cost
estimated at appraisal.

5.       The following six indicators tracked the progress of this component:

         Percentage of graduates from the project training institutions by type of training (short,
          medium, and long term)
         Percentage of graduates from the project training institutions obtaining a diploma or
          certificate (total and among students originating from rural areas)
         Percentage of graduates from the project training institutions that obtained National
          Occupational Qualification Certification (total and among students originating from rural
          areas)
         Ratio of actual average weekly hours of lab use in project training platforms to designed
          capacity (use a common denominator for all training platforms) (Shandong only)
         Ratio of students taking ‘ordered training’ requested by enterprises to total students in the
          project training institutions (total and among students originating from rural areas)
         Percentage of graduates from the project training institutions that find jobs in firms with
          which the school has a partnership (total and among students originating from rural areas)

6.    Except one indicator in Shandong Province, all of these indicators were met (or
reached extremely close to the target value) in all the provinces. These indicators are designed
to measure the type of training provided by project schools that need to cater more toward what

                                                  28
migrant workers need (more short-term training than long-term training). The indicators also
measure quality of training by the percentage of graduates from project schools obtaining diplomas,
certificates, or National Occupational Qualification Certification. The indicators measuring ratio of
students taking ordered training (requested by local firms and enterprises) and percentage of
graduates finding jobs in firms that project schools have partnerships with, both measure the extent
of relevance of training and success of partnerships among the project schools and local firms and
enterprises. The one indicator that was not met was the percentage of midterm graduates from the
project training institutions in Shandong Province. The target was 54 percent but the final indicator
in December 2014 marked 27 percent. This was because the Shandong Province altered the earlier
trends and placed more emphasis on the provision of long-term training rather than medium-term
training, hence increasing the proportion of graduates in long-term training but reducing medium-
term training.

7.     Subcomponent 1.1: Training capacity. This subcomponent aimed to provide
equipment for a number of training centers and schools in all three project provinces to
deliver occupational skills that are in demand for migrants. Well over 80,000 pieces of
equipment were procured for the 23 schools and training centers in the 3 provinces. The equipment
ranged from large high-tech equipment such as the five color printing machine procured for
Shandong, digital CNC processing, five-axis processing equipment, and automobile repair
workshops to computers and multimedia equipment for use in the classroom. These pieces of
equipment have transformed the relevance of these schools for the local industries as well as for
students and prospective students. Local firms now request for interns during school holidays and
hire them when they graduate, knowing that the graduates will join the firm fully trained and ready
to work independently on the machines that the firms use. Automobile repair is one of the most
popular courses for the students as there is high demand for automobile mechanics given the
increased car ownership. For advanced machinery such as the five color printing machine and five-
axis processing equipment, the local industries request use of the equipment during off-school
hours, enhancing school-enterprise collaboration. This was made possible as local enterprises were
consulted before the procurement of the equipment.

8.     A unique initiative in the Ningxia Autonomous Region is the mobile training bases,
which are trucks that were refurbished into mobile training workshops. These trucks now
bring short-term, modular training programs to isolated communities in mountainous and remote
areas, allowing trainees to obtain skills for a considerably lower cost.20

9.    With these pieces of updated and upgraded equipment, the reputations of the schools
have considerably improved, as highlighted by Anhui’s Lu’An Senior Technical School. For
example, they were able to mobilize funding from local government sources. All the investments
have made technical vocational schools a more attractive schooling option for young secondary
school graduates from rural areas and their parents. The quality improvements in skills
development at these schools are evident by the number of national and provincial prizes and
awards won by students and instructors alike.21

migrants.
21
   For example, in Anhui Province, more than 32 students from project schools won the 3rd prize at the
provincial skills contest. In 2014, an instructor from Lu’An TVET School received a national award for his
contributions in training highly skilled workers.

                                                    29
10. Subcomponent 1.2: Quality, relevance, and flexibility of training. This subcomponent
transformed training by linking schools with the labor market and its demands, making the
contents of the training more practical, and using various pedagogical methods. The
procurement of computers and multimedia equipment, coupled with training of school instructors
and school managers, restored the quality of teaching in the project schools. Before the project,
instructors based their teaching on textbooks and training was held in classrooms. With the project’s
investments, teaching now takes place in laboratories where all the pieces of equipment are placed.
In-class teachings also take advantage of the multimedia equipment and computers and are more
dynamic and student-centered. During the school break in summer, instructors and school
management visited firms and large employers to learn the type of skills in demand. The instructors
also work during the off-school season to learn cutting-edge technology and skills applied by
employers of the graduates and future graduates of the schools.

11. School-enterprise collaboration was established with a total of 3,096 enterprises,
greatly improving the way schools design and provide training on relevant and practical skills.
Project provinces actively took initiatives to study how school-enterprise collaboration could be
improved. In Anhui, a survey was carried out to identify the issues and constraints schools as well
as enterprises face in allowing closer collaboration. In addition to the full consultation of training
program contents and on equipment to procure, project schools have also set up training centers
inside local enterprises to better meet the needs of the enterprises by effectively responding to
‘ordered training’ requested by the enterprise. These ordered trainings are targeted at the students
of the schools and employees of the enterprise. The quality of these ordered trainings has improved
in project schools, vastly improving the relevance of the schools and reflecting the effective use of
the investments made by the project. These school-enterprise collaborations have greatly facilitated
the graduates obtaining jobs where they can fully use their acquired vocational skills. A total of
308,697 graduates (among them 85.2 percent from rural areas) found jobs through the school-
enterprise collaboration between 2009 and 2013. Anecdotal evidence from Anhui Province shows
that encouraged by the skills obtained at the schools, over 300 graduates started their own
workshops, creating employment for some 2,100 workers.

12. Competency-based curricula and related instructional materials developed include 23
immediately deployable material packages and 45 curriculum packages. These resources were
developed for distance learning on three modules: (a) integrating into urban life - language (for
speakers of a dialect in Shandong); (b) on-the-job training for waiters; and (c) digital movie and
television shows. All modules were assessed to have high quality, with appropriate pedagogical
methods applied. A pilot of these modules provided good feedback from students and instructors
alike. The dissemination strategy is being designed to ensure that the modules are widely available
to the public.

13. Subcomponent 1.3: Training markets. This subcomponent addressed market failures
to improve overall training market efficiency by establishing accreditation standards and
assessing more effective communication channels. In Shandong, to standardize the quality of
training in the province, the provincial government developed training center accreditation
standards and assessment tools for public training platforms and training subsidies. In Anhui
Province, a study was conducted to identify the most effective information release channel on
migrant training and jobs to reach the target migrant population. The study was completed in 2014
and the study findings will be presented to schools and employment centers to improve the
effectiveness of their communication campaigns.

14. Component 2: Employment Services (US$4.96 million; o/w US$3.24 million IBRD
financing). This component aimed to (a) improve the provision of labor market information and

                                                 30
public employment services for rural migrants and (b) further develop policies and institutions for
employment services and support the development of the market for employment service provision.

15. The total expenditure to date for Component 2 is US$2.06 million, approximately 64 percent
of the cost estimated at appraisal.

16.       The following two indicators tracked the progress of this component:

          Frequency of workers using employment services (counseling, job referral, and guidance,
           etc) in project-invested localities annually (total and among users originating from rural
           areas)
          Frequency of workers using LM information system in project-invested localities monthly.

17. Both these indicators for all three provinces met their respective targets or were as
close as 97 percent of the target. In Anhui Province, the total number of workers using
employment services increased 20-fold between April 2009 and December 2014. In Ningxia, the
number increased by 40 percent and in Shandong by 52 percent during the same period. Similarly,
both in Anhui and Shandong, the number of workers using labor market information systems
increased by over 5-fold, while in Ningxia Autonomous Region the number stayed the same over
the years.22

18. Subcomponent 2.1: Public employment service centers have been set up and upgraded,
vastly increasing the number of job seekers served. During the course of the project, over 4.2
million job seekers were served at the public employment service centers, with 85.2 percent of
them being migrants. For example, in the province of Anhui, 520 sets of computers, facsimile
machines, and printers were procured for the public employment service centers. Training
curriculum was developed and training for public employment service center staff have also been
conducted, with 750 staff trained over four training courses. In Ningxia, such training was also
conducted on policies and its applications. The weaknesses of these employment service officers
were identified and discussed at the training, which included competition and market orientation
of job search and service orientation. Officers were trained to improve awareness of issues that
individuals and families without jobs face and the importance of their rights protection. In
Shandong Province, a management information system (MIS) was established containing job
search information on 33 million individuals, which is equivalent to 55 percent of the working age
population in the province. The MIS is accessible from the five-level public platform, which
established a one-stop shop at the local level throughout the province, providing employment
services, social security, legal aid, residential registration, and other public services. Also, in
Shandong, about 80 percent of the farmers claimed that they received information on public
employment service centers and the services they provide.

19. Subcomponent 2.2: Standards were established through improved policies and
institutions for employment services. In Shandong Province, service standards of employment
service centers were established based on a study and manuals for employment service officers
were developed and distributed. As a result of the investments made through studies and workshops,
Shandong’s 12th Five Year Plan promoted the strengthening of the employment service centers
and laid out plans for accreditation and certification of employment services. Anhui Province issued
the Standards for Anhui Provinces’ Public Employment Services that provides detailed provisions

  There is a typing error in the final ISR RF for this indicator. The ‘Total’ number for the indicator
‘Frequency of workers using employment services (counseling, job referral, and guidance) in project-
invested localities annually’ is correctly entered as 121,014 but the number for ‘Rural’ should be 106,130.

                                                     31
on service contents, process, and service satisfaction. The implementation of the Law on
Employment Promotion stipulated in 2010 will ensure that the provinces plan and execute
employment promotion in urban and rural areas in a standardized manner.

20. Component 3: Worker Protection (US$2.19 million; o/w US$0.88 million IBRD
financing, US$0.5 million grant from the government of Netherlands). This component aimed
to (a) improve the employment condition of migrant workers and (b) increase awareness of worker
rights and support legal services for migrants. In addition to the loan, grant, and counterpart funding
indicated above, an additional US$300,000 is provided by a parallel financed technical assistance
project.

21. The total expenditure to date for Component 3 is US$0.68 million, approximately 77 percent
of the cost estimated at appraisal.

22.        The following two indicators tracked the progress of this component:

           Number of rural migrant workers receiving legal assistance in project-invested localities
            annually
           Number of policy studies to inform policy reform and formulation of rights protection for
            rural migrant workers at the national level.

23. Targets for both the indicators mentioned above were met in all three provinces.
Shandong increased the number of legal assistance interventions by over 8-fold, while the number
for Anhui doubled between April 2009 and December 2014. Although the target was met in
Ningxia Autonomous Region for the same indicator, the target (5,000) was set below the baseline
in April 2009 (7,643) because the number of disputes requiring legal assistance was expected to
reduce. The most common labor disputes faced by migrant workers in Ningxia had been on wage
payment. Through the project, Ningxia strengthened education on rights protection, raising
awareness of migrant workers who became more consistent and firm in ensuring claims be heard
by their employers. At the same time, the administrative guidelines for supervision of labor
protection now specify the issues that are reviewed, significantly improving the enforcement of the
regulations. These improvements together were expected to significantly reduce the number of
migrant labor disputes, resulting in less need for legal assistance.

24. Subcomponent 3.1: Policies were established and implemented to improve employment
conditions. The Anhui Province and Ningxia Autonomous Region conducted studies to assess the
design of the migrant rights protection system. The studies found the need to enhance migrant
training and subsidies and employment promotion, ensure mechanisms to transfer and sustained
coverage of pensions and social security, and ensure that migrant children are entitled to education.
These findings were incorporated into the respective provincial government policies.

25. Under the guidance of the CPMO, the provinces developed and applied the contract
template, established and enforced minimum wage, and received guidance on salary setting.
Funded by the Dutch TF,23 the MOHRSS developed the Guidance Manual on collective bargaining,
model agreements for collective bargaining, and training materials. Pilots were conducted in eight
cities in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hubei Provinces. The officials from Shandong also used the Dutch
TF to visit Australia and New Zealand and were exposed to rights protection of farmers and studied
how to establish a wage guarantee fund and conduct collective bargaining on wage.

26. Awareness on migrant workers’ rights was raised through the production of a digital
film and publicity week (Shandong Province), playing cards, and leaflets (Anhui Province).
According to statistics, some 800,000 migrants viewed the film in the provinces of Jinan and
Shandong, and over 1.34 million migrant workers benefited from the publicity week around
China’s Spring Festival in 2011.

27. Subcomponent 3.2: Support to legal services to migrant workers were provided and
information materials were developed and distributed to increase awareness of worker rights.
Legal support was provided in eight cities in Shandong Province, financed by the Dutch TF. One
legal firm per city was selected to provide legal services for three to five days a week. The Dutch
TF ICR indicates that during the period of January to October 2011, the law firms handled 4,598
cases involving 5,440 individuals. Among these cases, 1,670 cases were related to wage arrears
involving 2,043 individuals, with a total arrear amount of CNY 5.7 million. Some 954 cases were
related to social insurance payments, with unpaid funds of CNY 3 million, and 638 cases related to
work injury, with a total arrear amount of over CNY 3 million. The remaining cases were related
to wage and contract conflicts. As a result of the legal services, legal labor relations were
established between the employees and the employers by signing a written contract, with many of
them reviewed by legal firms at the request of the migrant workers. Through legal support, about
1,000 migrant workers who originally sought lawsuits solved their disputes with the employers
through mediation or consultation.

28. Component 4: Policy Analysis, M&E, and Project Management (US$3.40 million; o/w
US$3.02 million IBRD financing). This component aimed to (a) support a policy-oriented
research program and the sharing of information and knowledge concerning rural-to-urban
migration; (b) help improve the monitoring of government programs in skills development,
employment services, and worker protection and conduct impact evaluations of selected policy
interventions; and (c) support project management and build capacity in general management and
planning.

29. The total expenditure to date for Component 4 was US$1.57 million, approximately 57
percent of the cost estimated at appraisal. The main savings were from Subcomponent 4.2 as
monitoring was conducted by project staff and an impact evaluation was not conducted.

30. Subcomponent 4.1: The policy analysis and knowledge management subcomponent
supported a policy-oriented research program to improve understanding of the trends of
migration, challenges faced by migrants, and policy options. The subcomponent also supported
knowledge-sharing activities by compiling, organizing, and maintaining an information and data
warehouse that will provide access to data, local policies, best practices, research findings, and
other information concerning migration. Table 2.2 provides the list of studies and assessments
conducted under this subcomponent. In addition to the 17 distinct deliverables produced as part of
curriculum development, 28 studies were conducted under this component, managed by different
departments of the MOHRSS in Beijing. These studies have directly contributed to four policy
guidelines related to public employment service, migrant training, skills training, and other services
to migrants, affecting the conditions of migrant workers nationwide. Similarly, in addition to the
digital training materials developed under curriculum development, the studies developed
methodologies, tools and indicators, standards, certification processes, and training reference
materials. All of these studies were relevant nationwide and not just for the project provinces.
Hence, although impossible to estimate the impact in concrete numbers, these studies guarantee a
large return for the project’s investments in this component.

32. Subcomponent 4.2: The monitoring and impact evaluation subcomponent helped
develop a monitoring system for the government programs on migrant skills development,
employment services, and worker protection. This subcomponent supported the regular data
collection to monitor the progress of project implementation for the RF. The Bank team had to
provide intensive technical assistance to ensure that the indicators were interpreted in a
standardized manner and calculated correctly. As a result of the technical assistance, the data
reported in the RF is of adequate quality to assess the level of success of project implementation.

33. Subcomponent 4.3: The project management and capacity-building subcomponent
supported the establishment and operation of the PMOs in the MOHRSS and in the project
provinces and municipalities and counties. With regard to the number of PMOs, 1 central office
in Beijing, 3 PPMOs, and 22 city or county offices were needed to be supported. Training and
capacity building extended to these offices include financial management, procurement,
documentation and filing, and communication and reporting. Strengthening the capacity of these
PMOs was essential in the efforts to accelerate project implementation and disbursement. Although
the CPMO and the PPMOs struggled with the structured nature of the Bank’s fiduciary processes
and the processes of monitoring project implementation progress, the PMOs also appreciated the
logical and rigorous processes. The PMOs attributed the successful implementation of the project
in part to the rigor of the Bank’s processes and its structures and suggested that the government
adopt these project management processes in their own program operations.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     The economic rationale of the project support to enhance migration flows is justified
as migration was widely acknowledged as an important engine for economic growth and
poverty reduction by narrowing the income gap between rural and urban areas in China.
Data for prefecture-level cities in 2010 demonstrated that differences between marginal
productivity and real wages persist and are greatest in midsize cities, suggesting less than optimal
labor mobility. Based on productivity differences between agriculture and urban occupations in
industry or services, studies have shown that every 1 percent more migration from rural to urban
areas would yield 1.2 percent more GDP.24

2.     This report does not attempt to estimate the net present value or the economic rate of
return. The project PAD also did not estimate the net present value or economic rate of return as
obtaining a quantitative estimate of the impact of project investments on employment outcomes is
difficult. This section therefore focuses on assessing the project’s contribution with regard to
improving cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance of programs targeted at rural migrants. The
contribution of the project was not only economic but technical oversight and capacity building
enhanced the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance of their programs.

3.      Cost-effectiveness. The project investments have increased the capacity of training
institutes to enroll more students and to train on a more diversified set of skills. Training
modules and curriculum are now being designed in close consultation with the enterprises. Owing
largely to the project investments, larger training institutes have been identified as the resource
training institutes at the national as well as provincial levels, providing training for instructors of
other training institutes. Therefore the impacts of the project investments are not only contained to
the graduates of these specific training institutes but also have positive spillovers on non-project
schools through training of instructors. The mobile training bases in Ningxia significantly improved
the outreach of skills training to residents in mountainous areas, with minimal cost to the training
participants as well as the training institute. Training participants in these remote mountainous areas
may have otherwise never participated in skills training that promise higher incomes. As a result
of this, more graduates are obtaining national vocational qualification certificates and finding jobs
before graduation through the school-enterprise collaboration.

4.      Public employment service officers are able to better cater to the needs of the job
seekers, not only by providing information on job opportunities but also by providing a more
comprehensive set of services, including information, advocacy, introduction to occupations,
training, contract signing, and registration of laborers and firms. In Shandong, service
standards of the employment services were established and officers were trained based on a manual
which was distributed to ensure the standard of services provided. One-stop shops were established
at the local level throughout Shandong Province, providing employment services, social security,
legal aid, residential registration, and other public services to local and migrant job seekers. Efforts
to strengthen information dissemination were also made, reaching approximately 80 percent of
farmers in the area. Farmers were trained on farming techniques and management of farm products
to nurture new generation of farmers and help them understand the responsibilities of jobs and
improve living standards.

5.    Supporting mitigating activities such as awareness raising of migrant workers,
applying contract templates, and promoting collective wage bargaining result in reduced

Development Research Center of the State Council, China, 2014).

                                                  36
number of labor disputes. Preventing labor disputes are obviously more cost-effective than
providing legal support to those facing labor disputes, although the latter is also highly relevant in
this context.

6.     Relevance. The project was highly relevant in the context of the largest number of
internal migrations in history. Between 2000 and 2012, rural workers working in urban areas
more than doubled from 79 million to 163 million. By 2013, 44 percent of the total urban
employment was held by rural migrants (The World Bank; Development Research Center of the
State Council. The People's Republic of China, 2014). The government places strong emphasis on
improving the services and the policy environment to better facilitate the transition process of the
rural migrants.

7.     The project interventions were timely as new labor laws were passed in 2008, including
the Labor Contract Law and the Labor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law. In particular,
the passing of the Labor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law was met with an explosion of
labor disputes. At completion of the implementation of grant-funded activities, mitigating activities
for rural migrants were integrated into the functions of employment services and addressed all
laborers, not only for migrants. As not many activities in migrant rights protection was conducted
before the project, all activities that the project’s component on migrant worker protection initiated
were highly relevant and timely.

8.      Efficiency. The various investments made by the project have increased the capacity
of the training institutes to increase the training courses and the number of students they can
enroll. Coupled with the increased relevance of the training content, there are many more
prospective students interested in being enrolled in the project schools. The increased training
institute and enterprise partnerships have increased ‘ordered training’ requested by enterprises.
Firms are requesting for students to work at the firm as interns and will hire them upon graduation.
This increases the likelihood of graduates finding a job locally, without having to migrate to a larger
town or city. Firms and enterprises also came to training institutes to rent the equipment procured
using project funds as training institutes now had more upgraded equipment, which allow schools
to contribute to the development of the local industry.

9.      Modular and competency-based training materials were developed for skills training,
including 23 digital material packages and 45 digital curriculum packages, which promises
further efficient delivery of high-quality, standardized training. The quality of these training
materials was assessed to be good and they obtained positive feedback from those who piloted the
training materials. Once the materials are made accessible through the Internet, the efficiency of
skills training will increase massively. The challenge for the government now is to identify the
most appropriate and effective dissemination strategy for such training materials.

10. Project investments in employment services also promise further efficient delivery of
service through standardized management and sharing of information with job seekers and
employers. In Shandong Province, the project invested in an information system to manage the
data on job seekers. The standardization and sharing of information through the MIS improves the
efficiency of job matching while ensuring quality of information sharing. In Anhui Province,
computers, printers, and facsimile machines were procured and the facilities of employment centers
were upgraded. With more public employment centers located in rural counties and townships,
local job seekers are better able to access the services. During the course of the project, the number
of job seekers using the employment services increased significantly (by 20-fold in Anhui and by
40 percent and 52 percent in Ningxia and Shandong, respectively), improving the efficient use of
the facilities and the infrastructure.

                                                  37
11. The policy environment was improved by conducting 28 studies on topics ranging from
employment promotion and vocational capacity building to labor relations and labor disputes.
These studies in general were of high quality and directly applicable as inputs for policy
identification or for policy consideration. Of the 28 studies, 11 studies were designed to evaluate
existing programs for rural migrants and to establish standards, guidelines, and evaluation methods.
The remaining 17 studies contributed to four policy guidelines related to public employment service,
migrant training, skills training, and other services to migrants, affecting the conditions of migrant
workers nationwide. Considering the sheer number of people affected by these policy guidelines
(260 million existing rural-to-urban migrants plus many hundreds of million more in the future),
the policy studies were an efficient contribution to the Chinese government’s efforts to improve the
conditions of rural migrant workers.

12. Financial analysis. The PAD estimates that the expected amount of recurrent
expenditures at the school level accounts for an average of less than 5 percent of the expected
revenues. Project schools saw large increases in the number of students they could take in through
improved training facilities and larger variety of courses offered. Schools are also doing more
‘business’ with local enterprises by renting more expensive (hence more costly to maintain)
equipment. The recurrent costs generated by the project are manageable. Some schools were able
to apply for additional government funds due to the improved quality and relevancy of the training
they provide owing to the investments made by the project.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.     The former Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the Bank agreed on strategic
cooperation through the Rural Migrant Skills Development and Employment Project (hereinafter
referred to as the project) to strengthen skills training, employment opportunities of migrant
workers, work environment, and the protection of the rights of migrant workers.

I. Project Overview

2.      The overall development objective is to support the transfer of migrant workers from the
countryside to the city for obtaining better employment opportunities, higher income, and better
working conditions by increasing the opportunities to acquire skills training, improving
employment services, and strengthening the protection of their rights and interests. With the support
of the Bank, the MOF, and the National Development and Reform Commission, various project
activities were satisfactorily accomplished, yielding abundant project results with expanding
influences.

3.      The project realized the expected objectives. The skills development component improved
the ability of Shandong Province, Anhui Province, and Ningxia Autonomous Region to provide
training for potential migrant workers. The component improved the quality, relevance, and
flexibility of rural migrant training. The employment services component improved the information
and employment services through policy development and provision of employment services. The
rights and interests protection component improved the employment conditions of migrant workers
and enhanced the awareness of migrant workers in rights protection and means of legal services.
The policy research, M&E, and project management component undertook policy research related
to migrant workers moving into the city; improved the monitoring of migrant workers’ skills
development, employment services, and rights protection activities; assessed the impact of policy
interventions; and significantly enhanced the capabilities in project management and planning.

II. Use of Project Funds

4.     According to the loan and grant agreements, the total project amount is US$50 million and
the grant amount is US$500,000. The project disbursed a total of US$47.29 million of the loan (96
percent): US$4.64 million of the loan amount was used by ministry-level departments, US$17.65
million by Shandong, US$15 million by Anhui, and US$10 million by Ningxia. The saving was

III. Project Plan and Completion Status

Ministry-level Departments
6.    Ministry-level departments guided the overall project implementation, established systems
and regulations for training and services, and directed the overall coordination and management.
These departments also undertook policy consulting services, training resource package
development, and training.

            The Professional Capacity Building Division conducted research and analysis on
             team leader job training, public training of migrant workers, training needs analysis,
             training and evaluation system, and training portals. These projects have been
             completed.
            The Labor Relations Division conducted research, analysis, and consultation on
             collective wage bargaining, employment filing system, minimum wage standards,
             and special labor relations. Except for ‘wage payment security research’, all projects
             have been completed.
            The Mediation and Arbitration Management Division studied the procedures for
             prevention of labor disputes and proposed and piloted the ‘wage consultation system’,
             which is expected to be scaled up. The project has been fully completed.
            The Employment Promotion Division conducted migrant-related studies on
             employment, business start-up, and subsidies for training and employment;
             developed public employment service officials’ training; established migrant workers
             research database; conducted international comparison of labor market policies
             during urbanization; developed the national employment monitoring and analysis
             tools; and conducted the professional intermediary service quality assessment. The
             following policies were formed based on the research: Notice of the MOHRSS and
             the MOF on Related Issues in Further Improving Public Employment Services
             System and Opinions of the State Council on Further Implementing Services for
             Migrant Workers (State Council Notice [2014] No. 40).
            The Financial Planning Division was responsible for the project M&E, tracking the
             implementation process, and evaluating project impacts. All studies have all been
             completed.
            The NDRC studied the issues related to rural migrant population, analyzed the
             current situation, developed development strategies, and guided the implementation
             of the project.
            The China Employment Training Technical Instruction Center developed
             training resource packages and formulated the online courses, evaluation question
             bank, and student and instructor manuals. The digital and public vocational training
             packages and the digital resources sharing and management platform will be widely
             used in future vocational education. Six schools piloted the digital resource packages
             and platform.

            planning.

V. Role and Effect of the Project

Direct Effect of the Project
             Expanded scale of training, with some 90 percent of trainees from rural areas.
              Training focused on rural trainees. Some 522,628 were trained (85.51 percent of them
              from rural areas). Among them, 447,577 graduated (85.56 percent of them from rural
              areas).
             Graduation certifications obtained by 419,898 from 2009 to 2013 (84.69 percent of
              them rural trainees).
             National vocational qualification certificates obtained by 365,348 (86.6 percent of
              them rural trainees).
             Full operation of project training platform in 2013.
             School-enterprise joint trainings were effective, with 3,096 school-enterprise
              cooperation were established and 308,697 (85.19 percent of them rural) found jobs
              through school-enterprise cooperation.
             Expanded employment services serving 4,206,642 persons (70.66 percent migrants).
             Increased signed labor contracts in Shandong with 30 percent in Linyi and 100
              percent in Lu’An.

Continuous Influences of the Project25
           Good employment prospects after training, with 376,568 trainees finding jobs
            within six months after taking part in training (85.86 percent of them were from rural
            areas).
           Well-targeted training, with over 80 percent finding jobs related to their majors
            within six months.
           Although there is still room for improvement, the wage level immediately after
            training improved. Monthly average wage of trainees (within six months of getting

25
  The data is based on findings from an evaluation study conducted by the central government comparing
graduates from project schools and non-project schools. The methodology used for this study was not
appropriate and therefore the findings of this study were not referenced in the ICR.

                                                  48
             the job) among those trained for one year who found jobs within six months in
             Weifang and Maanshan was the highest (CNY 3,000) and that in Binzhou was the
             lowest (CNY 2,300); the monthly average wage of rural laborers in Shou County was
             the highest (CNY 2,820) and that in Guyuan was the lowest (CNY 2,200).

8.     China Renmin University was contracted to evaluate the impact of the project and to collect
data of graduates of non-project schools concerning training and employment. The effect of the
project comparing graduates from project schools with those from non-protect schools is listed
below:

            Direct effect of training: 19.3 percent more graduates obtained vocational
             qualification certificates; more graduates were satisfied in terms of ‘professional
             curriculum design of training’ and ‘opportunity and content of field training’.
            Feedback on employment: 9 percent more graduates found a job matching their
             major for their initial employment and current employment; 7 percent and 9.2 percent
             more graduates considered training as either very useful or useful for their initial and
             current employment, respectively.
            Wage and hours: Project school graduates received hourly wages which were 23.5
             percent higher and worked 1.635 days more per month and 0.679 hours less per day
             on their initial job and on average worked 2.898 days more per month and 0.31 hours
             less per day in their current job.
            Rights protection: 24.9 percent more signed a labor contract for their initial
             employment and 14.9 percent more participated in all social insurance types in their
             initial jobs. More graduates from project schools also enjoy the benefits of social
             insurance in their current employment.

VI. Experience and Influences of the Project

9.     During project implementation, the following teams and committees played key roles in
ensuring effective implementation of the project: project guiding committee, project leading group,
external expert group, the project monitoring organization, and each of the leaders from the
Department of Planning and Finance World Bank Office.

Project Experience
           Project design and organization are key. The implementation was in accordance
            with the project task outline, guaranteeing the completion of project with agreed
            quality and quantity.
           Structured project supervision guaranteed project success. To standardize project
            operation, the CPMO issued multiple guidelines and established strict supervision,
            account rendering, withdrawal, and bid invitation processes and formed an
            unimpeded project management information network, laying a solid foundation for
            success.
           The Bank project management and operational guidelines are an important
            basis for success. A monitoring system was established at the beginning tracking
            progress in a timely manner. The project was executed in accordance with the planned
            task outline and the Bank Project Implementation Manual was followed earnestly.

Main Influences
10. The project had an impact on the project itself, China’s project management, and the Bank.


                                                49
11. The project had significant effects on China’s migrant worker management, training,
and skills development and on migrant worker protection.

12. The project significantly enhanced the hardware of project schools, including
infrastructure and labs and created conditions to strengthen trainees’ practical skills and school
curriculum.

13. Study tours helped improve management capacity of HR and Social Security
Departments, which are expected to remain for a long period.

14.    Research findings on public employment services promoted policy improvements:

            Notice of the MOHRSS and the MOF on Related Issues in Further Improving Public
             Employment Services System
            Opinions of the State Council on Further Implementing Services for Migrant Workers
             (State Council Notice [2014] No. 40)
            Notice of the MOF and the MOHRSS on Related Issues in Carrying out Employment
             Special Fund Performance Assessment Pilot (C.S. [2012] No. 17)
            Opinions of the State Council on Further Implementing Services for Migrant Workers
             (State Council Notice [2014] No. 40)

15. Development of curriculum and digital teaching materials resulted in 68 training
packages, with some of those piloted in three technical schools receiving positive feedback.

16. The project promoted effective management, standardized processes, and
strengthened assessments of HR and Social Security Departments at all levels. Despite some
conflicts encountered during the implementation concerning management concepts and operational
flow, complicated Bank procedures, objective setting, the project’s management, and effect
assessment were worth learning and referring to. The project strengthened management of each
department.

17. Improving the Bank’s project management. The Bank also made adjustments in
processes not suitable for China. It is fair to say that management ideas and methods of the Chinese
also have a profound influence on project management and operation of the Bank.

VII. Problems and Suggestions

Problems and Shortcomings
          Need more efficient project management. Implementation was delayed due to the
           government reorganization and to the complex Bank fiduciary processes.
           Government reorganization resulted in personnel changes at all levels. The turnover
           of staff working on procurement at the central and provincial levels caused delays
           and problems in quality.
          Project operation procedures must be optimized to accelerate project
           implementation. All project units considered the Bank’s review procedures logical,
           standardized, and rigorous. However, these procedures slowed down approvals,
           execution, and procurement. As a result, timelines were missed and the project could
           not achieve its maximum potential impact.
          Slow procurement processes. Delays caused IT device specifications to be out of
           date and rigid procurement rules resulted in some devices no longer meeting training


                                                50
             needs.
            Improvements required in coordination of project monitoring and labor market
             management. The project set high standards for monitoring of training and
             employment services. However, the statistical department failed to gather complete
             data. Impact evaluation could not be implemented due to delays in project
             implementation.
Relevant Suggestions
           Optimize Bank procedures by balancing control and efficiency. Bank procedures
            such as prior reviews were loaded with trivial details and were not appropriate for
            China. The Bank should revise the procedures to ensure strict financial management
            and efficiency for smooth implementation.
           Train staff to improve project management by hiring experts to address staff
            shortages, urging provinces to train staff on Bank project operations, standardizing
            processes, ensuring quality and efficiency, and training project managers on
            procurement and financial management.
           Fully utilize and sustain the training platform developed by the project. The
            platforms introduced or strengthened by the project that should be sustained include
            in-service training and collaboration with enterprises; government incentive
            mechanism; the government’s guiding role in migrant worker training; the migrant
            worker rights protection; and inclusion of rural migrants in the government’s
            vocational training financial subsidies.
           Strengthen migrant worker onboarding and enterprise development training by
            combining migrant worker skills training and business start-up. Move toward longer
            and higher technical skills training so that migrant workers can transform their
            employment.
           Strengthen employment services by strengthening the policy environment and
            employment services, promoting smooth labor mobility, and unifying labor markets
            for HR development, law enforcement, contract signing, and safeguarding migrant
            worker rights and interests.

VIII. Project Promotion and Application

18.   The following outputs must be further disseminated to sustain the project impacts:

            Continue research for policies development, sustaining initiatives such as the green
             channel system for priority handling of migrant worker labor disputes; scaling up the
             ‘labor wage negotiation system’ to prevent labor disputes; the adjustment of regional
             minimal wage standards; strengthening new-generation migrant workers’ vocational
             training; and strengthening the training functions of skills master studios.
            Promote training resource packages developed by the project which cultivated a
             combined online and field training. The training package should be applied
             nationwide, establish digital resource development sites, and provide resource
             sharing and allocation services for digital vocational training resources.
            Scale up Ningxia’s training vans in mountainous areas like Xinjiang, Tibet, and
             Guizhou.
            Adopt Anhui’s migrant worker skills training to support business start-up.
            Adopt project implementation, monitoring, and assessment of Bank projects.
             Each office should reinforce project demonstration, capital use, and process
             monitoring and impact evaluation to ensure objectives are met for government
             projects.

1.      The data provided in this annex is to give context to better appreciate the project outcome
and intermediate outcome indicators. Since the figures are obtained from national statistical
yearbooks, they are not directly comparable to the project indicators.

Economic Growth
2.      China experienced an impressive economic growth during the project period, and as can
be seen in the figure below, per capita gross regional product grew in every province during the
period. This growth was driven by market reform and urbanization (World Bank 2012).

Labor Supply and Migration
3.      A source of growth in China has been the expanding labor source owing to the demographic
dividend and rising from under 600 million of working age (15–64 years) in 1980 to around 990
million in 2012 (World Bank 2013) and the rural labor surplus. Although the rural surplus labor is
declining and is estimated to be depleted by 2030 (World Bank 2013), the number of rural migrants
rose throughout the project period. From 2008 to 2014, at the national level, the total number of
rural migrants increased by 22 percent. The proportion of women have been stable throughout the
period with about a third of the migrants being women.

Vocational and Technical Schools
4.      There are different types of schools managed by different agencies. The project schools are
among those categorized as skilled worker schools and are managed by the MOHRSS. These
schools are small in number compared to employment training centers or privately owned
vocational training agencies.

5.      Considering only the skilled worker schools, allocation of resources has increased
nationally as well as in the three project provinces over the years. The rate of increase in Shandong
and Ningxia was comparable to the national-level increase, while resource allocation grew faster
in Anhui Province.

Labor Demand
7.       With regard to labor demand measured by the total registered job vacancies, compared to
the 7.4 percent national average annual growth, Anhui grew faster at 11.9 percent, Shandong
slightly lower at 6.7 percent, while job vacancies decreased in Ningxia.

8.      It is important to note that the initial assessments indicate that there is considerable
difference with regard to the destinations of migrant workers from the three project provinces. The
vast majority of migrants from Shandong stay in Shandong, with only 22.6 percent who migrate
outside of Shandong. Their destinations include Jiangsu (4.1 percent), Beijing (3.6 percent), and
Guangdong (3.3 percent). Similarly, in Ningxia, the majority finds jobs inside Ningxia and only
30.4 percent migrate outside the province. Their destinations include Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang.
On the other hand, a vast majority of migrants (83.2 percent) from Anhui go outside the province,
Shanghai (19.6 percent), Jiangsu (22.9 percent), and Zhejiang (25.6 percent).

Wage Levels
9.       Although nominal wage levels are lower in the western and central regions compared to
the national level and the eastern region, the rate of increase over the years was higher in the central
and western regions than the eastern region and at the national level. These wage levels and the
increasing trend are comparable to those of the wages (and their trends) of graduates of long-term
training of project schools.

Labor Disputes
10.     Between 2008 and 2012, the number of labor disputes at the national level slightly
decreased while in all project provinces the numbers increased; there was a 14.2 percent and 15.5
percent increase in Anhui and Ningxia, respectively. The average annual change is not calculated
for Shandong as the 2011 figure seems too low, giving a large rate of increase on average over the
years.
