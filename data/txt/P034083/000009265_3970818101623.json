on a sustainable basis, the\n            efficiency and effectiveness of urban transport operations\n            in the municipalities of Ashghabat, Mary, and Chardjou.\n            Specifically, the investments will: (1) reform management of\n            the agencies in charge of urban transport operations in the\n            three participating cities; (2) establish a metropolitan\n            transport organization (APAPO) responsible for the overall\n            management of bus operations; (3) improve cost recovery of\n            the operating enterprises; (4) implement an Operations\n            Improvement Plan; (5) augment and preserve supply of bus\n            services; (6) enhance private sector participation in the\n            provision of urban transport services; and (7) establish a\n            continuing process of public consultation. The project\n            consists of the following components: (1) the purchase of\n            diesel buses, electric trolley buses, and a mobile charging\n            unit and equipment for diesel buses for the three cities\n            mentioned above; (2) rehabilitation of these vehicles to\n            include minibuses and spare parts replacement, workshop,\n            computers, and other tools and equipment for bus operating\n            companies, operating costs coverage, and establishment of\n            APAPO; and (3) technical assistance and training for APAPO,\n            municipal governments, and staff."}, "docdt": "1997-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
