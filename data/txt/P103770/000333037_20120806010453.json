satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: this DPL had a total of 44\n            indicators in its results indicator matrix. Furthermore,\n            several different indicators were used for key outcome\n            indicators in the loan and program summary table, inflating\n            the number of indicators to close to 50, which is not only\n            difficult to manage by the Bank, but especially by low\n            capacity clients. In the case of social security reforms,\n            the results matrix included indicators for revenues,\n            expenditures and deficit (both cash and actuarial). However,\n            the same reforms could be tracked with just one indicator.\n            The first component in the results indicator matrix had 16\n            indicators; however some of them were redundant like\n            measuring the primary balance according to LRF and Fiscal\n            Adjustment Program (PAF) methodology. Although, the numbers\n            differ from each other, they both respond to the same\n            policies and move in the same direction. The fact that one\n            target was achieved and the other was not just reflects\n            issues in the calibration of the target and not a failure of\n            the reform."}, "docdt": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
