                                 LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

Borrower            State of Alagoas, Brazil with the Guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil
Implementing        State Secretariat of Finance
Agency
Financing Data      IBRD Loan Amount: US$195.450 million
                    Terms: IBRD Flexible Loan with a Variable Spread
Operation Type      DPL Two-tranche operation. First tranche amounting toUS$120,000,125 to be disbursed
                    upon effectiveness and second tranche amounting to US$74.961,250 expected to be
                    disbursed in FY2010. Front-End Fee amounting to US$488,625 (capitalized and
                    included in the first tranche).
                    The proposed Loan will support reforms in key areas of public administration, namely:
Main Policy Areas
                       i.    Fiscal adjustment
                      ii.    Human resource management
                     iii.    Social security system for civil servants.
                      iv.    Public sector management
Key Outcome         The goal of the proposed operation is to support the efforts of the State of Alagoas
Indicators          (GoA) in implementing cross cutting reforms that will contribute to the State's broad
(by 2011)           objectives of reducing poverty and increasing growth to levels at least comparable to the
                    average of northeastern states in Brazil.
                    The proposed program aims at four specific objectives:
                       i.    Consolidating the State's fiscal adjustment and enlarging the fiscal space for
                             government investments.
                             Key Outcome Indicators: Net Consolidated Debt to Net Current Revenue Ratio
                             of 1.75 in 2010 (from 1.97 in 2008 and 2.20 in 2007), Primary Balance to net
                             Current Revenue Ratio of 0.15 in 2010 (from 0.13 in 2008 and 0.19 in 2007)
                             and Net Operating Balance to Net Current Revenue ratio of 0.24 in 2010 (from
                             0.21 in 2008 and 0.19 in 2007).
                      ii.    Enhancing the State's human resource management to rationalize personnel
                             expenses and improve service delivery.
                             Key Outcome Indicators: Personnel Expenditures to Net Current Revenue Ratio
                             of 0.56 in 2010 (from 0.56 in 2008 and 0.58 in 2007), completion of the payroll
                             audit in 2010 and adoption of corrective measures.
                     iii.    Reducing the deficits generated by the social security system for civil servants.
                             Key Outcome Indicators: Social Security Deficit of the state RPPS of R$500
                             million in 2010 (from R$468 million in 2008), Application of Constitutional
                             Amendment 41 parametric measures (from no application), net asset position of
                             Social Security Fund of R$ 120 million (from 0 in 2009).
                      iv.    Improving public sector management through better planning, budgeting, and
                             expenditure execution cycles.
                             Key Outcome Indicators (BFMA Scores): Aggregate expenditure out-turn
                             compared with original approved budget = A-B (from C in 2009), definition of
                             planning competencies between central and line secretariats = A-B (from D in
                             2009) and Guidelines for preparation of PPA, LDO and LOA = A-B from C in
                             2009 and Macro-Fiscal programming = B (from C in 2009).

                                                    vii
                    The proposed loan will support significant and sustainable reforms in key areas of public
Program             administration. These reforms would expand fiscal space for public investments. They
Development         will also allow the State to use more effectively its own resources and those transferred
Objectives and      by the Federal Government to undertake a program of targeted capital investments and
Contribution to     improve its management capability. Such improvements are a necessary condition for
CPS                 eventually meeting the high order objectives of reducing poverty levels and achieving
                    levels of economic growth comparable to those of other states in the region. In addition,
                    the proposed loan will help the State to comply with the Federal Fiscal Responsibility
                    Law (FRL), a purpose shared by Brazil's Federal Authorities. The proposed operation is
                    fully consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the Brazil Country
                    Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2008-2011. Sound macroeconomic management, fiscal
                    reform, efficient public sector management, and good governance are key pillars of the
                    CPS strategy for achieving inclusive economic growth in Brazil. The CPS also identifies
                    support for the states (under results-oriented public sector reforms) and improvement in
                    fiscal management as two of the most important areas of Bank engagement.
                    The risks associated with this operation are substantial and include:
Risks and Risk
Mitigation             i.    Political Economy. Some of the reforms supported by the DPL will be likely
                             opposed by entrenched interest groups. Public employee unions, in particular,
                             are powerful and have responded to previous efforts to reduce payroll costs
                             with extended strikes. Nonetheless, the political environment is currently more
                             propitious. The administration is strongly committed to reform as evidenced by
                             important policy actions undertaken during loan preparation. The operation is
                             also strongly supported by the Federal Government.
                      ii.    Timetable. The current Governor's term ends in December 2010. To succeed,
                             reforms should therefore be implemented rapidly. In fact, the most difficult
                             actions in each of these areas are currently being implemented and will be prior
                             actions for the first tranche. Second tranche actions will be follow up measures
                             that are expected to be in place during the current administration's mandate.
                     iii.    Technical and Implementation Capacity. Lack of a professional civil service
                             complicates the design and implementation of public policies. During project
                             preparation intense technical assistance was provided in critical areas such as
                             human resource management, social security and investment management.
                             Moreover some of the main reforms to be supported in the area of public sector
                             management comprise procedural and administrative improvements that will be
                             self-sustaining.
                     iv.     The Global Crisis. There is considerable risk that the fiscal repercussions of
                             the global economic crisis could partially offset the gains made in the last two
                             years. In 2009, revenues have fallen substantially, specially the transfers from
                             the Federal Government--the most important revenue source for the State.
                             Falling revenues, however, increase the importance of implementing further
                             reforms aimed at rationalizing Government's expenditures.
                    The risks associated with the program need to be weighed against the alternative of
                    continued inertia. Alagoas is one of the poorest states in Brazil. Failure to address the
                    state's problems may contribute to maintaining the conditions of poverty currently
                    suffered by half of its population--about 1.5 million people.

                         PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
    PROPOSED: ALAGOAS - FISCAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM DEVELOPMENT
                               POLICY LOAN
                    TO THE STATE OF ALAGOAS, BRAZIL



                                     I.   INTRODUCTION


1.     This program document presents a proposed two-tranche Development Policy Loan
(DPL) in the amount of US$ 195.450 million to the State of Alagoas, Brazil. The proposed
operation is designed to assist the Government of Alagoas (GoA) in the initial stages of
implementing a process of financial and management reform. The DPL will support significant
improvements in key areas of public administration. In this process, the DPL will assist in
providing the basis for long term fiscal sustainability and enhanced public service delivery--
important requisites for reducing poverty and increasing growth.
2.      Alagoas is one of the poorest states in Brazil. It has the highest poverty rate in the
country, with half the population living below the poverty line. It ranks second-lowest in the
Human Development Index (HDI). If it were a sovereign country Alagoas' HDI would rank
120th among the 185 countries members of the United Nations. In 2006, its per capita Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was US$ 2,200, the third lowest in the country, and only 40 percent of
the national average. While Brazil and the Northeast in particular have managed to seize new
economic opportunities in recent years, Alagoas has not. Its economic growth over the last
decade has lagged both the regional and national averages. Social and economic stagnation are
likely to persist unless major reforms are undertaken.
3.      The State government is a key factor in the state's social and economic development. It is
the principal provider of education, health, police, transport and basic infrastructure services.
Chronic fiscal crises, poor policy choices, and bureaucratic inefficiency have prevented the State
from performing these functions well. As a result of excessive borrowing in the past, the State is
highly indebted and must allocate a significant proportion of its revenues to servicing its debts.
Much of its remaining revenues are devoted to paying the wages of public employees who tend
to be inefficiently allocated among government responsibilities, under-motivated, and in some
cases, overpaid relative to public employees in other Brazilian states. Payments to retired state
employees are also a significant drain on resources, exacerbated by the State's failure to keep
accurate pension records or take advantage of recent national social security reform which
mandates the adoption of a set of measures to reduce pensions and improve the administration of
civil service social security systems to be applied by the federal, states and municipal
governments. The budget proposals of the State secretariats are only loosely related to the State
Government's priorities. Expenditure execution is slow and inefficient which is reflected in poor
quality of public goods and services.
4.      Relative to this poor state of affairs, the current administration has made significant
reform efforts, particularly in the fiscal area. On taking office in 2007, the administration
inherited i) a Net Consolidated Debt (NCD) equal to 2.22 times the State's Net Current Revenue
(RCL) and ii) substantial public wage increases granted by the previous administration at the end
of its term. The government immediately responded by stepping up enforcement on the
                                                1
collection of the State's Value Added Tax (VAT), the so called, Imposto sobre a Circulação de
Mercadorias e Servícios (ICMS), reducing discretionary operating costs by 20 percent,
negotiating a rollback in the wage increases granted by the previous government, and by making
sharp cuts in investment expenditures.
5.      As a result of these measures and growth acceleration in 2007 and 2008, the State's fiscal
performance improved considerably. The GoA increased its primary and gross operating
surpluses, obtained two consecutive positive overall balances (in 2007 and 2008) and reduced the
ratio of consolidated debt to net current revenue from 2.22 in January 2007 to 1.85 in August
2009. These measures also permitted increases in capital investments in 2008.
6.      These achievements, however, are now threatened by the global economic crisis, which is
reducing State revenues, mainly constitutional federal revenue-sharing transfers that are the most
important GoA's revenue source. Federal tax revenues have experienced a strong fall due to the
national economic slowdown and the adoption of countercyclical fiscal policies that temporarily
reduced rates on the taxes that are shared with sub-national governments. This has affected all
Brazilian states and municipalities, but especially those more dependent on federal transfers such
as the GoA. Facing a strong revenue fall, the State administration recognizes that further
adjustment measures will be required, especially with regard to the containment of current
expenditures.
7.      To preserve the fiscal adjustment initiated in 2007, the Government has adopted
additional decisive actions to reduce current expenses, in particular personnel expenditures, the
most important and persistent source of fiscal disequilibria. While federal legislation prohibits
the dismissal of civil servants, the State has now completed a census of personnel in order to
identify "ghost" workers and is performing an audit of the State payroll to identify irregularities
in the compensation of active employees, pensioners, and dependent survivors. The State has
also submitted to the State assembly a wide-ranging reform in the pension system for State
employees, incorporating administrative, parametric and structural changes to the system. To
reduce expenditures on government purchases of goods and services, the GoA has been
implementing reforms in its procurement system to generate additional savings.
8.      In this context, the GoA has sought Bank's assistance in fine tuning its own program of
fiscal and public management reforms. The proposed DPL envisions the consolidation of the
State's fiscal adjustment, the creation of additional fiscal space for public investment, and the
improvement of public sector efficiency. This program has been structured around the four
components of Alagoas's medium term strategy for the enhancement of its fiscal accounts and
the improvement of public sector management:
       ·       The fiscal adjustment component;
       ·       The human resource management component;
       ·       The social security component; and
       ·       The planning, budget and expenditure management component.
9.      The program is strongly supported by the Federal Government. The components of the
program have been defined in consultation with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN), which
is the State's principal creditor. STN is also responsible for managing a national program of state
fiscal adjustment, in which Alagoas participates. The proposed World Bank operation would
incorporate the PAF targets and would assist the GoA in achieving them.
                                                   2
10.      The proposed operation and associated Bank support meet the criteria for engagement
with sub-national governments agreed under the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008-
2011. As specified in the CPS, the level of Bank lending must be consistent with the credit
ceilings specified in each State's Program of Fiscal Adjustment (PAF) and must be approved by
the STN. The proposed operation has been developed on the basis of key principles of
engagement: i) a shared understanding of the fiscal and managerial challenges facing the State,
ii) State ownership of the program, with policy measures emerging from the authorities own
initiatives and designed in consultation with Bank staff; and iii) political commitment at the
highest levels.
11.     The risks associated with this operation are considerable. Reform will likely be opposed
by entrenched political interests. The technical capacity of the State bureaucracy is weak. The
window of opportunity for reform is short. These risks are mitigated, however, by at least three
factors. First, the hard budget constraint confronting the State provides an impetus for reform,
which helps offset internal opposition. Second, the specific Government actions that would be
supported under the proposed operation have been designed to be technically and politically
feasible within the available time frame. Third, as part of its reform program, the Government is
implementing two strategic programs aimed at building additional technical capacity and
strengthening the State's management systems in the critical areas of human resources,
procurement, and planning, budgeting and expenditure execution. These programs are part of the
GoA's portfolio of priority projects, which should help guarantee their sustained budgetary
funding.
12.     Finally, there is also a considerable risk that the fiscal repercussions of the global
economic crisis could partially offset the gains made through the fiscal reforms supported by the
proposed operation and thus call for further adjustment efforts. The fiscal performance of the
State will therefore be closely monitored throughout the disbursement period and the need for
further adjustments in order to meet the project's fiscal targets will be regularly discussed with
the Government.
13.     All of the risks associated with the project should, of course, be weighed against the
alternative of not supporting Alagoas. In this respect, if the GoA were to fail in its efforts to
address the state's fiscal problems the hopes of 1.5 million people--half the state's population--
to one day come out of poverty could have to be postponed once again.

                                           II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL UP TO THE OUTSET OF THE GLOBAL
CRISIS IN 2008

14.     Following the episodes of the Southeast Asian and Russian crises in the late 1990s and
which hit the Brazilian economy hard, the country economic policy efforts have focused on the
establishment of a consistent and credible macroeconomic framework. The combination of sound
macroeconomic management and the favorable external environment of the last decade, prior to
the on-going global crisis, allowed Brazil to maintain macroeconomic stability, increase growth,
reduce poverty and enhance its resilience to external shocks (see Table 1 below).
15.     This framework consisted in the adoption of a strong fiscal discipline, an inflation
targeting regime and a flexible exchange rate. On the fiscal side, the government pursued a
policy of primary fiscal-balance targets to reduce public debt. Primary balances of about 4
percent of GDP achieved annually since 1999 resulted in a declining public debt path and
contributed to continuous improvement in credit ratings and the achievement of investment grade
in 2008. In addition, through effective debt management, the Brazilian government also
improved the composition of public debt thereby lessening vulnerabilities associated with
exchange rate and interest rate shocks.
16.     Fiscal discipline was also pursued by sub-national governments. Until a decade ago, the
fiscal behavior and indebtedness of state and municipal governments were a major source of
macroeconomic instability. In 1997, the Federal Government assumed the debts of 25 of the 27
states that were unable to service their debt1. As part of the agreement, the Federal Government
negotiated structural adjustment programs with the states. The so called Programs of Fiscal
Adjustment (PAF) set annual targets over three year "rolling" periods on indebtedness, primary
balances, personnel spending, tax revenue and public investment2 aimed at guaranteeing a
gradual decline in their indebtedness3. In 2000, the controls on sub-national fiscal performance
were strengthened by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). The FRL explicitly prohibits debt
refinancing operations between different levels of government, which moderates the moral
hazard problem in intergovernmental fiscal relations derived from sequential bailouts by setting
limits on personnel costs, borrowing, and indebtedness.
17.     Results were immediate and impressive. Sub-national governments have accompanied
the adjustment efforts of the Federal Government and generated robust primary surpluses, which
have in turn contributed to the overall improvement in Brazil's fiscal accounts and lessened debt
sustainability-related uncertainty. Furthermore, the FRL may serve as a good model for other
federative countries contemplating imposing fiscal discipline at various levels of government.
18.    The inflation targeting regime has also been very successful in anchoring inflation
expectations. Operationally independent, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has been able to

control inflation and progressively reduce interest rates. Inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 2002
to 5.9 percent in 2008. Thanks in part to this regime the BCB reduced the headline interest rate
from a peak of 26.50 percent in 2003 to 13.75 percent at the end of 2008.
19.     Brazil's flexible exchange rate policy has also helped cushion external shocks while
supporting the country's strong external sector performance. Benefiting from high commodity
prices, exports grew from US$60 billion in 2002 to US$198 billion in 2008. The Brazilian trade
surplus grew from US$13 billion in 2002 to more than US$40 billion in 2005-07. The strong
trade surpluses resulted in a decisive improvement of the current account balance. After more
than a decade of deficits, Brazil obtained current account surpluses from 2003 to 20074.

  In 2008, strong economic activity and exchange rate appreciation led to 25 percent increase in imports which,
together with an increase of profit remittances led to a current account deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP.

20.     Such robust external performance led to strong accumulation of international reserves,
which grew to US$206 in December 2008 from US$37 billion in 2002. The growing strength of
Brazil's external position allowed the country to make an early repayment of its outstanding
obligations to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2005 and to the Paris Club in
2006, as well as the retirement of its Brady Bonds in 2006. As a result, Brazilian public sector
net external debt is now negative, and Brazil's external debt sustainability indicators have
improved noticeably. Strong exports reduced the interest payments-to-exports ratio from 24
percent in 2002 to 7.1 percent in 2008. Similarly, there was a significant decrease in the debt-to-
exports ratio from 350 percent in 2002 to 100 percent in 2008.
21.    GDP growth rates have also increased. Between 2004 and 2008 the economy grew on
average 4.7 percent, well above the average annual rate of just below 2.5 percent of the previous
two decades. The increase in growth was driven by domestic consumption and more recently by
the acceleration of capital formation, both fostered by vigorous credit expansion.
22.    Higher growth coupled to improvements in social policies resulted in pronounced poverty
and income inequality reductions. The poverty rate dropped to 21.6 percent in 2008 from 32.9
percent in 2002. The drop was due mainly to higher economic growth, real increase in the
minimum wage, well targeted conditional cash transfer programs (such as Bolsa Familia- PBF),
increases in labor income and a decline in unemployment from over 12 percent in 2003 to below
9 percent in 2008. The Gini index also fell to 0.55 in 2008 from 0.59 in 2002.
23.     Despite these remarkable improvements, the Brazilian economy still faces a number of
structural challenges. Capital formation is still low, inferior to 20 percent of GDP, and may be an
obstacle to more robust and sustained growth. In addition, high taxation and government
consumption limit Brazil's growth potential.


            Box 1. Brazilian Fiscal Federalism and the Control of Sub-National Fiscal Performance
The fiscal stance of Brazilian states has always been an important element in macroeconomic management in Brazil.
Until the late 1990s, the expansionary fiscal policies by the states and the lack of effective controls over their
indebtedness resulted in frequent sub-national debt crises. In three different occasions (1989, 1993 and 1997) the
Federal Government had to assume and reschedule the debts of the states. The largest operation occurred in 1997,
under Law 9496, when the Federal Government restructured R$ 200 billion (12 percent of national GDP) of the debts
owed by the states.
In the 1997 refinancing operation, the debts were refinanced for 30 years. This refinanced debt, so called intra-limite
debt, carries a real interest rate of 6 percent, with the nominal value of the debt rising by inflation. An interesting
feature of the agreement was the capping of the debt service at 13 percent of states' net current revenues. Any debt
service above the 13 percent cap is recapitalized and added to the intra-limite debt stock. At the end of the contracts
(in 2028), if there are residual debt balances, the state must pay off the remainder within 10 years
The 1997 bailout was conditioned upon the state's compliance with medium-term fiscal adjustment and structural
reform programs. In exchange for the rescue package, the debt renegotiation contracts mandate the implementation
of three-year rolling Programs of Fiscal Adjustment (PAFs) to be agreed upon by the National Treasury Secretariat
and the 25 states that had their debt rescued by the STN during the period of the contract. The PAFs set annual
targets on indebtedness, primary balances, personnel spending, tax revenue and public investment, in order to
guarantee a gradual decline in indebtedness. In addition, the PAFs include structural reforms such as privatization or
other public sector modernization initiatives.
The controls on sub-national fiscal performance were further strengthened by the approval of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal ­ LRF) in 2000. The LRF institutionalized fiscal discipline at all
levels of government, incorporating hard budget constraints into a single unifying framework. It explicitly prohibits

                                                          6
debt refinancing operations between different levels of government, thereby addressing the moral hazard problem in
intergovernmental fiscal relations caused by sequential bailouts. Complementary Senate resolutions also prohibit
borrowing if: (i) the net consolidated debt exceeds twice net current revenue (RLC ­ Receita Liquida Corrente); 5 (ii)
new credit operations exceed 16 percent of RLC, and (iii) debt service exceeds 11.5 percent of RLC. Borrowing is
also prohibited if it violates the debt reduction schedules set by the debt renegotiation contracts under the Law 9496.
Finally, emission of sub-national governments bonds is generally prohibited through 2016; however, states whose net
debt is less than net current revenue can issue bonds after 2011, although even here the Federal Government retains
to the option to review the decision to issue bonds.
This system of controls has resulted in a substantial macroeconomic adjustment as evidenced by repeated state and
municipal surpluses and control of sub-national indebtedness. In addition, this system has also favored the adoption
of appropriate expenditure programs by sub-national governments. Other FRL requirements improved transparency,
strengthening of budgetary practices and the application of the golden rule at the subnational level favoring the
improvement of public expenditure quality.
Transparency. Budget outturns and compliance with the LRF--including a statement of corrective measures if the
relevant provisions are breached--are reported on a regular basis. Municipalities and states are also required to report
the fiscal outturns of the previous year to the Ministry of Finance. The legislative branch of each level of
government, aided by their respective Court of Accounts, monitors observance with the fiscal targets and ceilings.
Reports on constitutional requirements for minimum expenditure levels in education and health are also published by
sub-nationals.
Budget Institutions. The FRL introduces more stringent requirements on fiscal targets in the preparation of the
Budget Guidelines Law (Lei de Diretrizes Orcamentárias ­ LDO), strengthening its role in budget preparation and
fiscal management in general. The LRF also calls for a detailed assessment of the government's contingent liabilities
and strengthens the link between the Annual Budget Law (Lei de Orçamento Anual ­ LOA) and the LDO. A
complementary Fiscal Crime Law is applied to all levels of the public administration, with the possibility of detention
for those public officials not complying with the FRL.
Golden rule. To prevent financing of current spending by borrowing, the amount of new loans contracted is limited to
the amount of the capital expense. In practice, it means that any loans contracted will only be destined to expenses
related to investments.
In summary, after ten years of consolidating macroeconomic credibility, the sub-national fiscal discipline framework
has generated the requirements and incentives for the adoption of adequate expenditure programs.



MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY6

24.     Despite its increased resilience, the global financial crisis has hit Brazil hard. The impacts
of the global downturn on the Brazilian economy can be divided into three categories according
to their timing and affected sectors. First round effects encompassed contagion in financial
markets, fall in commodity prices, exchange rate depreciation, external credit curtailment and a
liquidity squeeze for Brazilian firms. From September through December, 2008 the São Paulo
Stock Market Index (Ibovespa) fell 32 percent, sovereign spreads increased by 78 percent, the
main Brazilian commodity exports prices fell by more than 30 percent and the Brazilian Real
(BRL) depreciated by 35 percent (see Figure 1 below).

  The net real revenue (RLR) is defined as the total revenue less credit operations, asset sales, capital transfers,
transfers to municipalities, FUNDEF contributions, and the social security contributions of civil servants that opt out
of the state system. RLR is smaller than the RLC used in the PAF. Also, the debt contracts cover only the central
state governments while the LRF includes the consolidated state public sector. In the same vein, the debt
renegotiation contracts use gross debt for state indebtedness while the LRF uses the net consolidated debt.

25.     Access to external and domestic credit markets was strongly constrained, especially for
small financial institutions and medium and small firms. External credit for exporters and small
banks practically vanished. Domestically, the overall volume of credit to the private sector fell
sharply. The Government reacted promptly to alleviate the liquidity squeeze. The Central Bank
(BCB) adopted various measures to inject liquidity into domestic markets and provide foreign
exchange to Brazilian corporations facing obligations abroad. Reductions in reserve
requirements, liquidity provision support to small financial institutions in difficulties, incentives
to large financial institutions to buy smaller ones with liquidity problems, repo-credit line
auctions in dollars for exporters, sales of international reserves to irrigate the spot exchange rate
were all used to alleviate private sector difficulties in raising resources in domestic and foreign
markets and avoided deeper exchange rate depreciation. In addition, public banks increased
massively their lending to industry and agriculture to compensate for the fall in private credit
supply. The Government's quick reaction was successful in normalizing credit market conditions
in a short period of time. A year after the crisis both, domestic credit and access to foreign credit
have returned to their pre-crisis levels.

26.    Effects on the external sector were also sharp but, again, temporary. The fall in
commodity prices and the worldwide economic slowdown led to a decline in exports from a
monthly average of US$18 billion in Q3, 2008 to less than U$S10 billion in Q1, 2009. As a
consequence, for the first time in seven years, the trade balance was negative in January, 2009.
Nonetheless, the domestic economic deceleration reduced imports downward and the trade
balance returned to positive. The nominal and real exchange rates and terms of trade experienced
a temporary depreciation that was reverted with the increase in commodity prices and the
reduction of risk aversion in financial markets. The current account balance and foreign direct
investment also suffered the impact of the global crisis. However, the economic activity
contraction and the improvement in market sentiment have helped stabilize the current account
balance while Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to the country have resumed (see Figure 2
below).

27.    Second round effects were also quite strong and were felt immediately in the real
economy. The financial turmoil interrupted 21 consecutive quarters of GDP expansion (from Q2,
2003 to Q3, 2008). Indeed, Brazilian GDP contracted in Q4, 2008 by 3.6 percent (qoq) and in
Q1, 2009 by 0.9 (qoq), driven by a strong drop in investment. Consumption continued to grow
while the external sector had a neutral contribution to growth. Industrial production plummeted
(especially capital goods and car vehicle production), falling by 16 percent from September 2008
to March 2009. Industrial capacity utilization fell from 87 percent in September to 78 percent in
March 2009, while unemployment rose from 7.6 percent in September, 2008 to 9 percent in
March, 2009. Market GDP growth forecasts for 2009 were revised downward from a positive 2
percent in December-January to a negative 0.5 to 1.5 percent in May-June. (see Figure 3 below)
28.     On the positive side, the economic slowdown and the fall in commodity prices also
lessened pressures on inflation and opened space for monetary easing. Twelve month
accumulated inflation fell from 6.3 percent in September 2008 to 5.5 percent in March 2009 and
hit the center of the BCB target zone at 4.5 percent in July, 2009. Inflation expectations for 2009
fell from 5.5 percent in September 2008 to 4.5 percent in March and to 4.3 in July 2009.
Consistent with the inflation targeting regime, and drawing on the credibility earned in the last
decade, the BCB initiated a consistent interest rate reduction cycle from 13.75 percent in
December, 2008 to 11.25 percent in March, 2009 and to 8.75 percent in July, 2009 (its historical
lowest level).

29.     Third round effects are related to the accentuated deterioration of public finances and
government policy reaction. The sharp fall in revenues during the first semester of 2009 and the
aggressive expansion of government expenditures ­ mainly current expenses, especially social
security and public sector salaries - resulted in the reduction of the Consolidated Public Sector's
primary surplus, which decreased to 2.4 percent of GDP in January-June, 2009 from 5.9 percent
of GDP in the same period in 2008. Indeed, the total deficit increased to 3 percent of GDP in the
first semester of 2009 from 0.5 percent of GDP in the same period of 2008. As a result, net
public debt grew from 41 percent of GDP in June, 2008, to 43 percent in June, 2009.

30.    The fall in federal tax revenue resulting from the economic slowdown and from
temporary tax breaks adopted as part of the fiscal stimulus package has substantially impacted
sub-national governments through the reduction of federal revenue sharing transfers. This effect
has been particularly strong in the case of states and municipal governments that depend heavily
on federal transfers. Alagoas was one of the most affected states as federal transfers represent 60
percent of its revenues.
31.     Another important component of the government's expansionary policy was the
significant increase in credit supply from public financial institutions. It is estimated that the
quasi-fiscal stimulus associated with increased lending from public banks reached 3 percent of
GDP. In fact, credit by public banks grew 25 percent in the year since September 2008, while

                                                                                                                                                10
credit form private institutions grew only 3 percent. The expansion of finance from public banks
included credit to exporters, the agricultural sector, for housing and for durable goods
consumption. As a result, the share of public banks in total outstanding credit grew to 39 percent
in June 2009 from 34 percent in September 2008. In addition, the government has also
encouraged large private banks to increase lending and buy small banks that faced liquidity
problems.
32.     Strong monetary easing, expansionary fiscal policy, the expansion of credit supply from
public banks, and the recovery of commodity prices have allowed a quick and strong economic
activity recovery. Indeed, in Q2 2009 GDP growth achieved an impressive 1.9 percent (qoq).
Information on industrial production, job creation, unemployment in metropolitan areas and
labor income provides clear signals of an ongoing consolidation of GDP recovery in Q3 2009
indicating that GDP decline in 2009 will be less accentuated than expected and should be
followed by a strong acceleration in 2010.7
33.    Projections for the coming quarters indicate a strong GDP recovery that should vary
between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent8. Figure 3 shows that the initial recovery would be driven by
the increase in capacity utilization followed by the resumption of total factor productivity
growth. Increases in capital accumulation and employment are expected to accelerate in 2010.

7 Accordingly, market forecasts for growth in 2009 increased to 0 percent in September (from -1.5 percent in April).
For 2010 there was also an improvement in market projections that in September indicated a growth rate of 4.5
percent (from 3 percent in April).
8
  There is an statistical carry out effect on these numbers as Q4 2008 and Q1 and Q2 2009 levels are low, therefore
the comparison base will favor Q 4 2009 and 2010.

34.      Financial markets are also exhibiting a robust recovery. From March to September, the
Ibovespa stock market index grew 48 percent, sovereign spreads returned to their pre-global
crisis levels of about 250 basis points and the BRL appreciated by 23%, also returning to its pre-
global crisis level. Capital inflows resumed their pre-global crisis trend and the country
international reserves reached US225 billion in September, level well above the pre-global crisis
highest level of US$205 billion recorded in August 2008.
35.    In this context, two scenarios with growth rates of 0 percent (scenario A) and -1.5 percent
(scenario B) in 2009 are presented in Table 2 below. Growth assumptions for 2010 and 2011 are
the same and depict a gradual growth recovery to 3.5 percent in 2010 and 4 percent for 2011.

In summary, the country's macroeconomic framework is deemed appropriate for this proposed
DPL in that solid macroeconomic fundamentals built in the last decade have allowed Brazil to
smooth the effects of the financial turmoil with relative speed. The government has been using
its increased fiscal and external solvency and its enhanced credibility to adopt expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies.


ALAGOAS: ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT9

36.    Located in the Northeast region, the poorest in Brazil, Alagoas is a small state with 27.8
thousand km2 (0.3 percent of Brazil's territory), a population of 3 million inhabitants (1.5 percent
of Brazilian population) and a state GDP amounting to R$15.8 billion in 2006 (approximately
US$7 billion or 0.7 percent of Brazil's GDP). Public administration services and the sugarcane-
ethanol cluster (complexo sucroalcooleiro) are the most important state economic activities
being responsible for 25 percent and 15 percent of Alagoas's GDP, respectively. Public
administration, agriculture and services mainly provided by informal economic units in urban
areas and small household farms are the activities that absorb most of the active economic
population.

Recent Performance by Cícero Péricles Carvalho (Federal University of Alagoas ­ WB consultant)

37.    Alagoas is one of the least developed states in Brazil. In 2006, its per capita GDP
achieved R$5,200 (or US$2,200), the third lowest in the country10, only 40 percent of the
national average and 80 percent of the Northeast Region average. Income inequality is extremely
high with a Gini index of 0.59, one of the highest in the country (Gini for Brazil is 0.55). Low
income per capita and high income inequality result in the highest poverty rate in the country,
with 48 percent of the state population living below the poverty line (the national poverty rate is
22 percent) and 22 percent below the extreme poverty line (the national indigence rate is 7
percent).
38.    Medium term economic and social development trends have been poor. Alagoas's
economic growth rate over the past two decades has lagged behind both the regional and national
averages. From 1985 to 2006 (most updated information for sub-national GDP), economic
growth in both the Northeast region and for Brazil as a whole reached 2.6 percent. During the
same period, the annual growth rate of the Alagoas's economy was only 1.8 percent, the lowest
economic growth rate in the Northeast Region (see Table 3 below). As a result, between 1985
and 2006, the share of Alagoas in the regional and national GDPs fell from 6 percent to 4.5
percent and from 0.9 percent to 0.6 percent, respectively.

39.     The Alagoas economy still reflects the state's historical roots in sugarcane plantations
with high concentration in land ownership and agriculture output. According to Brazil's
agricultural census, large properties (more than 100 ha.) represent 5 percent of agricultural
properties but account for 62 percent of total agricultural land and are responsible for 76 percent
of the state's agricultural gross product (see Figure 6 below).

     Piauí and Maranhão are the other northeastern states with the lowest socio-economic indicators in the country.
                                                              14
40.     Sugarcane plantations are the dominant agricultural activity responsible for 65 percent of
the total cultivated area. As shown in Table 4, the sugarcane-ethanol cluster (complexo
sucroalcooleiro) is responsible for the generation of more than 15 percent of the state GDP.
After a long period of stagnation in the eighties and nineties the sugarcane-ethanol cluster has
experienced a rapid increase in productivity. Exports amount to more than US$800 million.
However, given that production is based on massive use of machinery, job generation capacity is
quite limited and the sector accounts for less than 3 percent of total employment in the state.

41.     Other agriculture activities developed on small farms cultivating traditional cultures such
as rice, beans, cotton and manioc generate less than 5 percent of state GDP and occupy only 15
percent of cultivated area. These non-sugar cane agricultural activities are the largest employer in
Alagoas with 45 percent of total employment. The rest of the agricultural sector comprises live-
stock activities that represent 2 percent of state GDP.

42.     The state' industrial sector is small and highly concentrated in sugarcane-ethanol
transformation. This accounts for 40 percent of industrial GDP. Public utilities (electricity,
telecommunications, water supply and sanitation) and civil construction generate 50 percent of
industrial GDP while mining and other extractive activities respond for the remaining 10 percent.
43.    Alagoas' economy is highly dependent on public sector activities11. The weight of the
public administration sector in the state economy (25 percent) is one of the highest among state

11
     Public administration in AL encompasses the activities of the state government and 101 local governments.
                                                             15
governments-- the national average is 15 percent. Public administration accounts for more than
18 percent of the state's formal employment and public employee salaries are significantly
higher than in the rest of the economy. Therefore, government activities have a strong
importance not only as the principal provider of economic infrastructure and social services but
also as the main income generation source in the state. Furthermore, Federal Government's
social security and social protection transfers are an important income source for a large part of
the Alagoas population. In fact, 355 thousand families in Alagoas -out of the 780 thousand in the
state are beneficiaries of the federal conditional cash transfer program (Bolsa Familia Program),
95 thousand individuals are beneficiaries of rural pensions and 68 thousand of other social
protection benefits.
44.     Other important services activities are commerce, maintenance and real estate. In recent
years, tourism has also experienced a rapid increase representing about 2 percent of the state
GDP. It is becoming an important source of employment generation in urban areas.
45.    Given the state's economic structure and lack of dynamism, the labor market has been
characterized by high unemployment and informality. From 1992 to 2007, average
unemployment in Alagoas was 9.2 percent, while the Northeast rate was 7.9 percent and Brazil
was 8.3 percent. The informal economy employs 66 percent of the state's active economic
population. Precarious employment conditions are reflected in low labor income. Half of the
active economic population (AEP) receives less than one minimum wage (about US$200 in
2007), 20 percent receive between one and two times the national minimum wage, 7 percent
receive between 2 and 5 times the national minimum wage and only 4 percent receive more than
5 times the national minimum wage. Some 22 percent do not receive any labor income.
46.    The active economic population's limited educational attainment is one of the reasons for
the low labor income. More than 25 percent of the active population has no education, 43 percent
has between 1 and 7 years, 25 percent has between 8 and 14 years and only 7 percent has more
than 14 years of education. Furthermore, the quality of education is very poor. Alagoas students
have consistently ranked last in national educational tests since 1998.
47.     The state's poor economic performance is also reflected in social development indicators.
Alagoas is the state with the highest poverty and inequality rates. In addition, education and
health indicators and the access of the population to basic services are also among the lowest in
the country. Literacy and enrollment rates and average years of schooling in Alagoas are among
the 3 lowest in the country. Infant mortality is the highest in Brazil and life expectancy is the
second lowest. As a result the Human Development Index in Alagoas is the second lowest
among Brazilian states - only Maranhão is lower. This is also reflected at the municipal level.
Figure 6 shows that 80 out of the 101 municipalities in the state fall in the lowest HDI quintile of
Brazilian municipalities.
48.     The comparative evolution of Alagoas's social indicators has also not been favorable (see
Figure 7). In 1980, Alagoas's Human Development Index (HDI) was the fourth lowest among
the 27 Brazilian states. By 2000, it had fallen to the second lowest. Particularly worrisome is the
comparison within the Northeast Region. At the beginning of the nineties, Alagoas enjoyed
better economic and social conditions than most of its peers in the region. Alagoas's per capita
GDP was the fourth highest in the region while poverty, education and health indicators ranked



                                                16
the three highest in the region. In 2006, the state per capita GDP ranked seventh and social
indicators place Alagoas among the three least developed states in the region.12

49.     Only in the last few years, due to the expansion of social policies by the Federal
Government and national economic growth acceleration, have the Alagoas economic and social
indicators improved. From 2004 to 2006 Alagoas annual economic growth rate of 4.1 has been
higher than the 3.6 percent national average but still lower than the Northeast Region's GDP
growth rate (4.4 percent). Increased intergovernmental transfers to state and local governments
and the increase of domestic consumption, especially low income groups, fostered by
redistributive policies promoted by the Federal Government, explain Alagoas's improved
performance over this period.
50.     Federal transfers to the State government and direct investments by the Federal
Government have contributed to the recent improvement of Alagoas' socioeconomic conditions.
Table 5 shows that intergovernmental transfers to the State government and municipalities
increased by 70 percent in the last four years reaching R$4.9 billion in 2008 (in 2006 they
represented 16 percent of Alagoas GDP). Apart from the constitutionally mandated revenue­
sharing which increased at the same rhythm as federal tax collection, the increase in voluntary
transfers to finance State investment projects and locally executed federal programs reflects
renewed federal administration interest in improving economic and social conditions in the
Northeast Region and especially in Alagoas. Nonetheless, difficult financial conditions and weak

     Non-official statistics indicate that Alagoas's HDI in 2006 was already the lowest in Brazil.

51.     Table 6 shows the strong and rapid expansion of federal transfers to people in terms of
beneficiaries and volume of transferred resources. Federal Government social protection covers
at least half of Alagoas households transferring about 10 percent of state GDP. Together with
improved credit access, Federal Government cash transfers have been promoting a large increase
in low income groups' consumption, which has been growing at 10 percent since 2005.

52.    Furthermore, the federal social protection programs have helped protect low income
groups from the effects of the global financial crisis. Moreover they have helped sustain the
consumption levels of a large part of Alagoas' population which has been relatively independent

   Federal Government has allocated more than R$1 billion to Alagoas within its ambitious investment plan the
Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). However PAC's execution rate in Alagoas has been the lowest among states.

   . Social security transfers are net of contributions raised in Alagoas. Rural pensions can be considered a social
protection transfer as retired in the rural sector did not contribute to the social security system.
                                                              18
of the economic cycle. Actually, Alagoas industrial activity and sales indicators have not
exhibited the strong fall observed in more developed regions.
53.     The recent fall in poverty indicators has also been partially driven by increases in federal
transfer programs as evidenced in Figure 8 below. The Bolsa Familia Program has reduced
extreme poverty by at least 3 percentage points (extreme poverty would be 25 percent without
the program instead of the observed 22 percent with the program), and poverty by 2 percentage
point (poverty would be 50 percent without the program instead of the observed 48 percent with
the program).
54.    While these increased resources would inevitably improve the Alagoas's economy and
population welfare and relative national rankings, its sustainability depends very much on the
State government's ability to take advantage of massive federal support. Continuation of its poor
performance could jeopardize Federal Government efforts to turn around the State's precarious
economic and social environment and to sustain recent improvements.

THE PERFOMANCE OF ALAGOAS STATE GOVERNMENT (GOA)

55.    The poor performance of the State public sector is a principal explanatory factor for
Alagoas's precarious economic and social conditions. Chronic fiscal disequilibria, poor policy
choices and managerial inefficiency are behind the inability of the Government of Alagoas
(GoA) to improve the state's economic and social situation.


Fiscal Disequilibrium
56.     For nearly two decades the State has experienced one of the most difficult fiscal
situations of any state in Brazil. Excessive personnel expenditures resulted in continuous fiscal
deficits and high indebtedness. This, in turn, has significantly hampered the GoA's ability to
invest and constrained the State's capacity to provide adequate economic infrastructure and
public service delivery required for economic growth and social welfare.
57.     Increasing mandatory expenses and sluggish revenues due to its small economic base
resulted in a persistent fiscal disequilibrium. On the expenditure side, the inability to contain
personnel expenses, the most important component of spending, has been the main reason for
chronic disequilibria. National constitutional regulations that guarantee job stability for public
servants and prohibit nominal salary reductions prevent downward adjustments of personnel
expenditures. In addition, inefficient human resources management, permanent salary increases
resulting from political pressures by strong State employees unions15 and serious irregularities in
the payroll system explain the high levels of personnel expenses Failure to constrain salaries of
the other government branches (judiciary, legislative and the public attorney's office) has put
additional pressure on GoA's finances.
58.     Payments to retired personnel are also a significant drain on GoA resources. The pension
system for GoA's public employees has been running large deficits that are covered by the State
treasury. The imbalance of Alagoas's civil service pension system is to a large extent the result
of generous benefit rules and eligibility criteria enshrined in the federal constitution, but in
Alagoas they are magnified by the State's failure to keep accurate pension records and to adopt
measures in line with federal regulations approved in 1998 and 2003 that could increase
contributions and reduce pensions benefits.
59.     In particular, the Constitutional Amendment No 41 (Emenda Constitucional No 41 ­EC
41) approved in 2003 opened space for the federal, states and local governments to reduce their
social security deficits though the adoption of administrative, parametric and structural reforms.
Given the nature of the reforms contained in the amendment No 41 to the Brazilian Constitution
of 1988, these reforms need to be mandatorily applied by all government entities. The failure in
the adoption of the reforms contained in the EC 41 prevents Alagoas to reduce its social security
imbalance.16
60.    As a result, Alagoas's personnel expenses (which include compensations to active
personnel and social security benefits to retired personnel) consume more than 65 percent of

15
   National comparisons of salaries for different categories of state governments' staff indicate that GoA public
employees' salaries are among the highest in the country.

System of Alagoas and Impact of Proposed Reforms by Marcelo Abi Ramia Caetano and Mario Rattes (WB

State net current revenues and it is one of the highest among Brazilian states. In addition, the
lack of adequate supplies, purchase and procurement systems results in high government
operating costs. Finally, constitutional earmarking of revenues has introduced additional
rigidities limiting expenditure reallocations and fiscal adjustment efforts.
61.    High levels of current expenses and lack of access to credit in the last decade have led to
a strong dependence on Federal Government capital transfers to finance investment spending.
Capital transfers are not mandatory hence tend to be very volatile resulting in GoA investments
also being volatile (see Figure 9). These fiscal constraints are leading to a downward spiral
whereby weak State capacity leads to a reduction in the quality of public services, lower
economic growth, which in turn leads to lower revenues and a more precarious fiscal equation.

62.     On the revenue side, low economic growth, a fragile economic base, informality, the
inefficient tax collection administration and the generous tax incentive system to attract
investments to the State (a pervasive practice engendered by the `fiscal war' among Brazilian
states) explain the low capacity to raise tax revenues17.

17
   In fact, the most important sectors--public administration and the activities related to the sugar-cane ethanol
cluster--are exempted and service sectors are predominantly driven by small firms and families. Hence, the tax
                                                                                       21
63.     Given the low tax collection capacity, GoA finances are highly dependent on federal
transfers. Indeed, transfers from the Federal Government are the most important GoA revenue
source representing about 60 percent of Alagoas current revenues. At the same time, the
importance of transfers vis a vis GoA own tax revenues discourages the State tax collection
effort and stimulates the use of tax incentives. In recent years, the dependence on federal
transfers has deepened as capital transfers from the Federal Government became the exclusive
financing source of GoA investment programs in a context of no access to credit and low
capacity to generate current savings.
64.    Permanent budget deficits resulted in high indebtedness. At present, with a debt
amounting to R$7 billion that represents 1.95 times the State's net current revenue, Alagoas and
Rio Grande do Sul (RGS) have been, until 2008, the two outliers whose debt indicators fail to
meet the (FRL) requirements since its enactment in 2000. Numerous conditions exacerbate
Alagoas debt dynamics including automatic capitalization of part of the deferred interest on debt
owed to the STN18, wholesale price shocks (debt stock is corrected by wholesale prices), the
higher interest rate paid to STN by Alagoas compared with other states19, modest revenue
performance (as debt service payments are linked to revenue) and contingent liabilities from the
operation of indirect administration entities.
65.     High indebtedness means high debt service. GoA allocates more than 13 percent of its net
current revenues to pay debt service obligations, a level above the FRL ceiling of 11.5 percent of
net current revenues20.


Poor Public Sector Performance
66.    The unsustainable fiscal position has been the clearest and the most worrisome sign of
GoA's institutional dysfunction. Inefficiencies in public expenditure management have not only
aggravated the impact of resource scarcity on the quality of public service delivery but also
worsened GoA's difficult fiscal condition.
67.    Notable inefficiencies in public sector management include: a weak planning, budgeting
and expenditure execution system; weak human resource management and government purchase
systems; and fragile institutional mechanisms for internal and external control that leave the
State administration vulnerable to corruption, rent seeking, state capture and corporative
pressures.
68.   Weaknesses in the planning, budgeting and implementation cycle exist within each phase
and moving from one to the other.21 Low technical and institutional capacities complicate the

base of the state VAT in Alagoas is concentrated in few sectors: energy, telecommunications, oil plus a few
industrial activities
18
   In the debt renegotiation agreement of 1997, the Federal Government agreed to cap debt service payments on the
restructured debt to 15 percent of state net real revenues (the rest of the states paid 13 percent of their revenues).
Unpaid interest has to be capitalized and moved to a "residual" account, which is to be paid off over ten years at the
end of the 30-year period.
19
   While STN charges 6 percent plus wholesale inflation for the debt refinanced to most other state governments,
Alagoas pays 7.5 percent plus wholesale inflation.
20
   Prior to 2009, non-compliance with the FRL requirement on debt service has prevented GoA to contract new
lending operations since 2000.
21
   For a more detailed description of planning-budgeting-expenditure execution problems see "Alagoas: Diagnosis
of Budgetary and Financial Management" by Luiz Carlos Nerosky (consultant) and "Strenghthening Public Sector

design, appraisal and evaluation of public programs and lead to the inefficient selection of
projects and corresponding wasteful use of Government resources. Last but not least, fiscal
difficulties have eroded the GoA's ability to plan and prioritize. Resource scarcity and fiscal
rigidities have resulted in budgetary unpredictability and expenditure cuts primarily in sectors
with weaker political resistance. Reductions have been mostly on programs that can be easily cut
and not necessarily on those that should be cut. Hence, government strategies and programs
defined in the planning phase usually are not carried out.
69.     In fact, government priorities and resource allocations defined in the planning phase
through the multi-year plans (PPAs) do not guide annual budget formulation. This is shown by
the inconsistency between the allocations to the programs included in the PPAs and those set in
the Government's annual budget proposals and the Annual Budget Laws (LOAs) approved by
the legislative branch. This inconsistency has several roots including: technical imperfections in
medium-term revenue forecasting and program costing, fragmented administrative structures that
favor the proliferation of sectoral programs that are not aligned to Government priorities, the
vulnerability of the capital budget to legislative amendments and the discretionary management
of expenditure execution by the Executive in a context of severe financial constraints.
70.     Deficiency in resource availability forecasts has been also present in the annual budget
process undermining the connection between the budgeting and implementation phases of the
budget. Frequently, the legislature approves an annual budget law that overestimates revenues. In
turn, the Executive issues decrees setting financial ceilings for the programs which generate
inconsistencies between budgeting and financial programming. Inconsistencies between budget
and financial programming result in delays in the physical execution of public works due to the
irregularity in resource flows.
71.     Uncertainty about resource availability, which usually generates indiscriminate budget
cuts, also undermines cooperation by line secretaries. Their focus has been to protect their
budgets; executing non-priority programs in the expectation that central secretaries (Finance and
Planning) will need to release resources for Government priority programs executed by the line
secretaries and for their basic operation and maintenance costs. As a result, a reversal of budget
priorities frequently occurs with cuts in investment programs and contingent liabilities generated
by expenditure commitments made by the line secretariats out of approved budgets.
72.     In this context of within-the-year budget cuts and arbitrary changes in financial ceilings,
the role of the legislature does not end at the budget preparation and approval stage but also
extends into the expenditure execution stage where intense political negotiations influence the
release of resources for the execution of specific programs. Finally, budget execution is also
affected by the inefficient government purchase system and the weak institutional capacity of
secretariats, especially with regard to budgeting and financial programming, purchasing goods
and services, and contract design and management.
73.     The GoA purchasing system is not well developed and has been imposing higher than
necessary government costs and contributing to the inefficient expenditure management system.
Most Government purchases are not competitively procured and are directly contracted by line
secretariats--only 27 percent of Government purchases are implemented by electronic reverse
auction or competitive selection processes performed by the Public Management Modernization

Management, Procurement and Investment Systems in GOA" by Juliana Wenceslau, Luciano Wuerzius and Tarsila
Velloso (World Bank).

Agency (AMGESP), responsible for government purchases. The institutional fragility of
AMGESP results in long periods of procurement processing exceeding than 250 days on
average--(see Figure 10). Given these delays, the executing entities continue to make their own
purchases, justifying this practice on grounds of `emergency' and using non-competitive
methods making more expensive government purchases.

74.     The weaknesses in the planning, budgeting and expenditure execution described above
result in poor policy choices marked by a lack of prioritization, low budget execution, inefficient
resource allocation and fiscal vulnerabilities related to the generation of contingent liabilities.
75.     The lack of effective human resource management is another factor explaining not only
excessive personnel expenditures but also the poor performance of public sector management22.
The inefficiencies in GoA's human resource policies include wasteful deployment of civil
servants, inadequate career structures, lack of work force planning, chaotic and non-transparent
compensation systems, absence of coherent compensation policies, unreliable HR information
systems, lack of government strategies to cope with demands for salary increases from public
staff unions, and lack of human resource qualification strategies.
76.     The GoA has about 47,000 active staff which consume around two thirds of State current
revenues23. National comparisons indicate that Alagoas has one of the highest staff-to-total-
population ratios among Brazilian states and the second highest personnel expenditures-to-net-
current-revenue ratio after RGS. In addition, despite the lack of a professionalized civil service,
salary levels seem to be higher than in other states and in the private sector. Table 7 compares
Alagoas with Sao Paulo, which, by virtue of the cost of living and competition, has some of
Brazil's highest paid civil servants.

22
  For a more detailed description of human resource management weaknesses see Civil Service in Alagoas: Poor
Performer and Costly by Evelyn Levy (World Bank).
23
     The state payroll bill includes 16 thousand inactive staff and 7 thousand survivors.


                                                            24
77.     The excessive staffing and generous compensation that result in high personnel expenses
are not matched by the quality and coverage of public services. The quality of GoA services such
as education, health and security are among the worst in the country which is reflected in the
poor performance on social and economic indicators. In fact, inflexible human resource
management derived from legal protection mechanisms that grant stability to public staff has
resulted in an inefficient deployment of public servants expressed in the excess of staff in some
sectors and shortages in others. Inflexibility is also generated by the rigid and very specific
career structure which severely limits the Government's ability to reallocate its human resources
according to changing needs and priorities. Finally, related to the inefficient distribution of staff,
the lack of work force planning is another cause that explains the mismatches between
Government strategies and priorities, service delivery and staffing.

78.    The existence of a myriad of contractual and compensation regimes, complex
compensation systems with different salary components (subsidies, bonuses, etc) and the lack of
consistent parameters, result in a chaotic, unreliable and nontransparent compensation system
where similar jobs and responsibilities are remunerated very differently. This compensation
system is also not related to performance and distorts career incentives.
79.     The multiplicity of compensation regimes is also related to the lack of an integrated
system for staff management. GoA has at least four human resource (HR) management systems
that are precarious and not interconnected.24 The unreliability of the HR information system not
only erodes the Government's ability to effectively manage its staff but also opens opportunities
for duplication, fraudulent compensation, irregularities, etc.
80.     GoA salary policies are highly influenced by the corporative pressures of staff unions.
Conflict governs labor relations between the State and public servants. In 2007-08, civil
servants' strikes for higher wages included: health sector workers (90 days), teachers (120 days),
police (60 days) and other indirect administration workers.

24
  The executive, legislative and judiciary branches have different HR management systems and indirect
administration entities have their own systems.
                                                    25
81.     To conclude, the fragility of the State's institutional systems described above and the
deficient oversight and control framework result in a weak accountability framework in the
government's core administrative functions. This situation results in poor policy decisions and
inefficiencies in the use of public resources, and it also makes public sector management and
government spending more prone to corrupt practices.


                         III.    THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM


82.     Governor Teotônio Vilella Filho, inaugurated in January 2007, undertook a diagnosis
upon assuming office that found a close link between the weakened functioning of the Alagoas
State public sector and poor economic and social performance. The Governor consequently set
an agenda prioritizing three reform pillars: the renewal of the public sector, recovery of State
public finances and reversal of the deteriorating trend of social and economic indicators. The
Governor aspired to leading a government "that established a responsible, efficient and ethical
administration, that promoted economic development with environmental sustainability and
interrupted the cycle of illiteracy and misery while improving the quality of life of the Alagoan
people and rescuing its self-esteem".
83.     In line with this view, the current administration defined the improvement of economic
development and social welfare as its medium term objective and framed its Multi-year Budget
Plan (PPA) for the period 2008-2011 accordingly. Figure 11 shows the government's strategy
built upon six interrelated areas or "axes": i) economic growth and diversification; ii) poverty
and inequality reduction; iii) human capital development; iv) integration between State and
population; v) improvement of the quality of life and; vi) modern institutions, fiscal adjustment
and public sector strengthening.
84.     The Economic Growth and Diversification Axis aims at turning the prevailing stagnant,
concentrated and exclusionary economic model into a more dynamic, diversified and inclusive
platform for economic growth. The main actions proposed under this umbrella will accelerate
state economic growth and spread it among economic activities, regions and the poor. These
will include improvement of public infrastructure in roads and irrigation, support to local
economic clusters expansion and consolidation of the tourism sector, increase of the value added
generated in the sugar cane-ethanol industry, support to small and family agriculture to enhance
its productivity and overall improvement in the state's investment climate.
85.     The Poverty Reduction Axis includes actions to reduce illiteracy and increase childhood
schooling, and increase the coverage and quality of health programs targeting especially reduced
infant and maternity mortality. The State will also undertake to mobilize federal transfers by
improving access of eligible populations to conditional cash transfer programs such as the Bolsa
Familia Program (PBF), the Rural Pension Program and the Beneficio de Prestação Continuada
(BPC) and other federal transfer programs.
86.    The Human Development Axis focuses on education. This axis comprises programs to
evaluate and improve the quality of State education services, support to municipalities -the most
important provider of basic education, guarantee access and continuation of children in school
and expand secondary and technical education.


                                               26
87.     The Integration between State and Population Axis comprises programs directed at
promoting a better integration between society and government and to improve the self esteem of
Alagoans. These programs include `moralization and transparency campaigns' to improve the
Alagoan populace's perception of the State public sector that has been damaged by recurrent
problems of corruption and mismanagement. In addition, the Valorization campaign
encompasses actions to promote Alagoas's rich cultural heritage and to reinvigorate its role in
the national scenario.
88.     The Quality of Life Axis encompasses programs to expand the provision of housing,
sanitation and water services for the population as well as programs to reduce crime and violence
in the state. The axis also comprises programs to rationalize and improve the efficiency of
public hospitals and clinics. In budgetary terms, this Axis is the most important responding for
more than 50 percent of government projected expenditures in the period 2008-11.

89.     The Fiscal Adjustment and Public Sector Renewal Axis includes the implementation of a
broad ranging administrative reform, recovery of public finances though consolidation of the
ongoing fiscal adjustment, strengthening of public management efficiency, and better use of
information technology tools in public sector activities. The Axis promotes enhancement of
internal controls and transparency through targeted reforms. And it provides support to
municipal governments that are responsible for essential social services delivery in the state.
90.     It is important to highlight the strong linkages between all six of the reform Axes
comprising the Government's strategy. However, the last above mentioned axis is perhaps the
most relevant for achieving the medium term development objectives of the proposed operation
and this axis focuses on improving GoA's ability to restore fiscal solvency while reforming the
inefficient and demoralized public sector apparatus. From its inauguration in 2007, the State
administration perceived that the corresponding challenges were among the greatest impediment
to turning around the state.
                                              27
91.      With this in mind, the GoA strategy in the first two years consisted primarily of setting
priorities for the Fiscal and Public Sector Renewal Axis. These reforms were seen as a necessary
condition for the successful implementation of the programs included in the other five axes. In
pursuing this course, the GoA is following a course of action similar to the one adopted
successfully in other Brazilian states over the last few years.25 Consequently, Alagoas is aiming
for drastic fiscal adjustments, administrative reforms, rationalization of government processes,
introduction of result-based management, prioritization of State programs and the enhancement
of human resource management.


FISCAL ADJUSTMENT

92.     Faced with extremely adverse fiscal conditions upon assuming office in 2007, the
government initiated an aggressive fiscal adjustment effort to reduce its indebtedness. The
adjustment measures encompassed initiatives focusing on both increasing State tax revenues and
restraining expenses. On the revenue side, government measures concentrated on the
enhancement of tax collection efficiency through the introduction of data base integration to
attack tax evasion on the State VAT, the so called ICMS. A `matrix managerial model' was
introduced based on the use of tax collection information from sectors and regions to detect
evasion. This effort was crowned by the signature of a `results based contract' with the Secretary
of Finance's State Revenue Department (Superintendência de Receita Estadual - SRE).
93.    On the expenditure side, the government adopted a set of emergency measures. First, an
administrative reform reduced significantly the number of State secretariats from 37 to 17 and
eliminated several indirect administration entities.26 Second, a budgetary and financial
management programming committee, called Comité de Programação Orçamentária e Financeira
(CPOF) was created to set budgetary ceilings for spending by State Secretariats to reduce the
number of expenditure commitments without resource availability and to assert strict cash
management controls. This Committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving all policy
decisions with fiscal implications. As a result, the government managed to reassert control over
spending. Third, a sharp reduction in operating costs of about 20 percent was achieved through
the imposition of controls on State entities' use of energy, telecom, water and other maintenance
supplies. Fourth, the government negotiated a rollback in the wage increases granted by the
previous government to the civil service. The hard salary adjustment negotiations and the
government's resistance to pressure from powerful civil servant unions resulted in a large
number of strikes affecting public service delivery in 2007. Agreements reached with the
unions defined a chronogram for salary adjustments covering the second half of 2007 through
2009. Fifth, given the expenditure rigidities the GoA was obliged to reduce by more than 25
percent its investment expenses compared to 2006.

   Of particular importance are the public sector reforms undertaken by the states of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande
do Sul.

94.     Favored by the good performance of State revenues in 2007-08 and the containment of
government expenses, GoA has obtained impressive improvements in fiscal balances and debt
reduction. Table 7 shows that from 2006 to 2008, State revenues grew by 20 percent. Fostered by
the acceleration of national economic activity the federal tax revenue sharing transfers to the
State increased by 21 percent in real terms. Better regional growth performance as well as the
stringent measures taken to improve taxpayers' compliance resulted in State tax collection
growth of 12 percent in the last two years.
                                              29
95.     As Table 7 shows, progress on the control of expenditures has been modest
notwithstanding the Government's efforts. GoA current expenses grew by 16 percent in 2006-08.
Despite the government's resistance to validate the salary adjustments granted by the previous
administration, the negotiated chronogram of salary adjustments over 2007 and 2008 resulted in
an accumulated increase in the State payroll of 22 percent in the last two years. These salary
increases are the most important driver of the increase in government expenses. Other expenses
that are not controlled by the State government such as revenue sharing transfers to
municipalities and pensions also exhibited strong increases. Where the GoA could assert control
it obtained good results. The strict control of operating expenses resulted in a reduction of 5
percent. Nevertheless, the adjustment resulted in an unavoidable sharp reduction in 2007
investment expenditures followed by a strong recovery as fiscal conditions improved in 2008.
96.     The impressive growth of revenues and the partial control of current expenditures
resulted in the complete accomplishment of the fiscal targets set at the PAF 2007-09 agreed with
the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) in 2007 and 2008. In addition, the generation of large
operating balances allowed the GoA to expand investments in 2008 while maintaining robust
primary balances and obtaining positive net lending/borrowing.

97.     Furthermore, for the first time since the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in
2000, Alagoas complied with the declining path of indebtedness required by this law. For the
ratio of NCD to NCR, the GoA has already reached the level of 2.0, seven years earlier than the
cut-off date of 2015 established by the FRL. As shown by Figure 12, strong revenue growth and
robust fiscal balances also resulted in the reduction of the Net Consolidated Debt (NCD) to Net
Current Revenue (NCR) ratio to 1.85 in August 2009 from 2.22 in December 2006. The
reduction in its indebtedness and its compliance with the FRL debt limit have led the STN to




                                                30
authorize Alagoas to contract the World Bank operation --its first credit operation in the current
decade.27
98.     These improvements are now threatened by the strong negative effects of the financial
crisis on GoA finances. While regional economic activity has not been too affected by the
worldwide economic slowdown, the transmission mechanism of the crisis to Alagoas is through
the decline of Federal Government transfers to the State. Federal revenues suffered a strong fall
that has been accentuated by its countercyclical policy of tax breaks. This has affected sub-
national governments that receive federal revenue-sharing transfers. Given the high dependence
of the GoA on federal transfers (about 60 percent of State revenues comes from federal
transfers), the fall in Federal Government tax revenue collection has been imposing expressive
falls in GoA revenues. In fact, Figure 13 shows the strong correlation between federal and
national industrial activity and between Federal Government and GoA revenues.

99.     The State administration is taking additional adjustment measures and accelerating the
pace of reforms directed at reducing the pressure of personnel expenditures on State finances28.
First, GoA established an additional cut of 15 percent on the operating budget of State
secretariats. Second, it is postponing planned investments in the state that will be resumed as
fiscal conditions allow. Third, it is initiating an audit of the State payroll that would bring
significant savings, implementing the revision of pensioners and survivors benefits and
accelerating social security reform. In addition, the government prepared a set of short run

27
   The Federal Senate Resolution 40/2001, complying with the Fiscal Responsibility Law, established a ceiling for
net consolidated debt to net current revenues of 2.0 for state governments. For states that were above this ceiling in
2000, the Resolution mandated an adjustment to the ceiling in fifteen years. In 2015 all states should have a net
consolidated debt to net current revenue ratio inferior to 2.0.

options to reduce personnel expenditures that would be used in case of revenue fall persistence.
Finally, the Federal Government is implementing a compensation support program to sub-
national governments that experienced intergovernmental transfers fall. Alagoas has been
included in this compensation package.


Procurement Reform
100. Given the potential short run gains from the introduction of electronic reverse auctions
(pregão eletrônico) and electronic price registration, the GoA is also expanding these
procurement methods for State purchases. In 2007 the GoA issued a Decree mandating the use of
reverse auctions, preferably in electronic form, for the procurement of goods and common
services. In 2008 the GoA purchased 635 items under the electronic price registration and
obtained savings equivalent to R$50 million or (28 percent of the estimated amount).
101. To further expand the use of electronic auctions, the GoA will need to reduce the long
processing times29. It is unreasonable to oblige government units to carry huge stocks or wait for
long periods to replenish stocks or to operate without essential materials. This is one reason the
government has frequently resorted to direct contracting justified on the basis of emergency
situation and/or small quantities. In 2008, 59.32 percent of the total amount contracted in
Alagoas was procured directly by government entities. To favor the use of electronic reverse
auctions, the government prepared a decree regulating procedures and establishing maximum
processing periods for public procurement steps to reduce processing times. With reduced
processing periods, the government envisages the expansion of electronic price registration in
government purchases which has demonstrated an even greater savings potential than the
electronic reverse auction.


HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

102. The effects of the international financial crisis on State public finances also reinforced the
need for fundamental reforms directed to containing current expenditures in response to declines
in revenues. Recognizing that personnel expenses are the driving factor contributing to fiscal
disequilibria, the government initiated essential human resource management initiatives. The
enhancement of human resource management under the government strategy entails two
sequential sets of actions. The first is the improvement of the existing unreliable information
systems regulating staffing, individual remuneration and overall payroll.
103. At the beginning of 2009, the government completed a census of civil servants (active,
pensioners and survivors). It is currently performing an audit of the payroll that will be followed
by the acquisition of a new human resource system that will consolidate the information
generated by the census and the audit and will allow better control of personnel expenses. The
expected benefits of the civil service census, the payroll audit and the new HR system are
substantial. The combined effect of the three actions would be a reduction of about 5 percent of
the GoA payroll. As the payroll covering active civil servants, pensioners and survivors amounts
29
  From July 2007 until December 2008, the state agency responsible for government purchases AMGESP received
230 purchase requests, but it processed and completed only 66. To complete these 66 processes, it took AMGESP an
average of 259 days. The data collected showed a much worse scenario for the remaining 164 processes: an average
of 379 days had already passed without AMGESP completing them.
                                                      32
to R$ 2.2 billion, the savings generated by the improvement of information systems would
amount to R$110 million.30
104. The second stage of the GoA's human resource management enhancement strategy is the
creation of institutional and technical capacity for the design and implementation of effective
Human Resources policies. With a more reliable information system, the GoA intends to
implement more complex reforms including HR planning, compensation policies, career
restructuring and introduction of performance evaluation. In order to design and implement HR
policies the government will create a Quality of HR Management Committee led by the
Secretariat of Public Management. Given the fiscal and budgetary dimensions of HR policies,
the secretariats of Finance and Planning will also be part of the Committee that will be
responsible for the control of personnel expenditures, and for appraising HR decisions such as
establishing new positions, creating new career paths, revising rules governing promotion, and
designing capacity building activities for civil service, among others.


SOCIAL SECURITY

105. To a great extent, the difficult financial situation of the civil service pension scheme in
Alagoas and other states is the result of generous benefit rules and eligibility criteria enshrined in
the Federal Brazilian Constitution and in other federal legislation. However, deep federal reform
is unlikely and a possible reduction in the imbalances of the GoA's Social Security System for
Public Employees (Regime Próprio da Previdência Social ­ RPPS) will depend on reforms
which can be implemented by the State within the existing federal legislation.
106. Recognizing the pervasive and debilitating short and long run impact of the growing
deficits of the GoA's RPPS, government efforts have been directed to the preparation of a bold
social security reform. This reform encompasses administrative, parametric and structural
reforms.
107. Among the first group, the most important is the creation of a single administrator of the
State pension system (Gestor Único da Previdência) to regulate the concession of benefits of all
government branches. With this reform, the Executive will for the first time exert control on the
benefits of the Legislative, Judiciary, State Accounting Court and General Attorney Office
branches which have so far resisted reforms and audits. In addition, the GoA expects to reap
significant administrative economies of scale from reducing replication of work across branches
and reducing irregular benefit payments.
108. The creation of the Single Administrator for managing pensions is a crucial action to
control the concession of benefits in all government branches. Currently in the State of Alagoas ­
and also in many others states and municipalities ­ pension administration is fragmented with
different entities handling different branches of government, and pensions are granted separately
by each branch and despite the need for uniform rules set by the Federal Government,
administrators are under no obligation to conform to State policies. The establishment of a single
entity for pension management is now permitted by law and encouraged by the Federal
Government. The result could be significant administrative economies of scale and synergies.
Furthermore, audits and other reforms could be carried out and policy targets could be imposed
30
   The census identified 450 ghosts among the civil service (0.8 percent of active employees, pensioners and
survivors). Similar auditing of payroll performed in other states generated savings that vary between 5 to 10 percent.
                                                         33
such as the establishment of a minimum performance rate for pension assets, maximum
deadlines for benefits' grants and revisions, and an independent governance body comprised of
fixed term members
109. In addition, GoA's administrative measures to reduce social security deficits include the
crosschecking of federal data bases for obits and beneficiaries of other national social security
systems (federal and sub-national ones) against Alagoas State's payroll. This would make it
possible to eliminate many cases of fraud such as the continuation of pension payments to
deceased persons or to employees said to be employed in the federal government, in different
states or in the private sector.
110. It is important to mention that the audit of the payroll in the HR component also includes
the payroll of pensioners and survivors. Rough estimates by the Secretary of Public Management
indicate that potential errors for pensioners and survivors are bigger than what can be found in
the payroll for active civil servants.
111. As for parametric reforms their scope at the sub-national level is limited since many rules
are established in the Brazilian Constitution and in federal laws. However, as the State of
Alagoas still needs to comply with a number of changes introduced by Constitutional
Amendment 41 of 2003 (see below), there is ample space for the adoption of parametric reforms
that could address the financial difficulties of the GoA's RPPS. The government is assessing the
adoption the following parametric measures to its RPPS. The first item is the adoption of
survivors benefit indexation according to price inflation, and not to wages of active employees as
it is applied now in Alagoas. Constitutional Amendment 41 stipulates that survivor benefits
awarded after 2003 should be indexed to inflation. However, the State continues to index all of
these benefits to wages of active personnel. The cost of this practice of wage indexation for
survivor pensions is high as wages increases in Alagoas tend to exceed inflation. The high cost
of wage indexation might even force the State to freeze wages in order to contain expenditures
with survivors' benefits.
112. The second parametric reform is the application of the correct replacement rate for
survivor benefits. Constitutional Amendment 41 also determines that a marginal replacement rate
of 70 percent above the General Regime of Social Security (Regime Geral da Previdência Social
­ RGPS) cap should be applied to survivor benefits granted from 2004 onwards. However, the
State still replaces 100 percent of the pension received by the deceased.
113. The third item is the adoption of benefit formulas for pensions based upon the average
work-life wage and not on the last wage. Constitutional Amendment 41 stipulates that the benefit
formula should be based upon average wages, not on the higher last wage. Alagoas does not
apply average wage pension formulas in calculating benefits which results in a far larger and
unnecessary cost to its pension system, especially considering that civil servants benefit from a
seniority increase in their wage calculation.
114. The fourth item is the adoption of a correct definition of special treatment for the purpose
of determining the contributions of retirees and survivors. These must still contribute to the
pension system. Special deductions apply for certain kinds of illnesses. However, definition of
the situations that give rise special treatment is in Alagoas the same that is applied for Federal
Income Tax (IR) purposes. As this definition is different and more generous than that applied for
pensions, the use of the social security legislation regarding exemptions for pensioners and
survivors contributions would bring additional revenues.
                                               34
115. Finally, the government will extinguish the application of the parity adjustments among
salaries of active employees and pensioners benefits. Current practice in Alagoas is to apply
parity to inactive employees for all readjustments of benefits conceded for active employees
regardless of the regulations. As allowed by federal legislation, the social security reform being
implemented by GoA will eliminate this parity.
116. Savings from the application of the above parametric measures are significant (see Figure
14 below). The annual net present value of these savings amount to R$42.5 million or 6 percent
of total social security payments. Given the accelerated deterioration of public finances in 2009,
the government will speed up the adoption of the above measures and it is expected that they will
be in place still in this years.

117. Finally, the State government also prepared a draft law proposal (already sent to the State
assembly) to restructure its social security system. This reform consists in the gradual
transformation of the current as pay as you go system (PAYG) into a fully funded system (FFS).
The biggest problem with this change is that it imposes huge transitional costs. The contributions
paid by younger civil servants would not be used to pay the benefits of current retirees and
survivors. Rather, their contributions would be converted into assets that in the future would be
used to pay their pensions. However, current pension outlays would remain the same since
current retirees have accumulated no assets and the value of their pensions is unchanged. For
this reason, there must be a managed transition from PAYG to a funded system in order to
mitigate transition costs. The transition alternative that this operation is supporting is the
segmentation of the RPPS participants and the temporary coexistence of PAYG and fully funded
systems31.



31
  Another option would be the creation of a complementary fund. The Bank team assessed feasibility of this option
and recommended the adoption of the segmentation alternative.
                                                            35
118. The government's gradualist strategy consists in the segmentation of civil servants into
two groups. The first group is composed of current retirees, survivors and older staff in active
service. These individuals would continue to be in a PAYG system funded by general
government revenues as they have not accumulated enough assets to finance their pensions. They
also have not enough time remaining in their active career to save for the financing of their
retirement. Within this group under the PAYG system, the government decided to separate the
military staff as they have particularities that call for a differentiated social security treatment.
The second group comprises younger, active workers. This group has enough time to save in
order to finance a fully funded system.
119. This strategy mitigates the transition cost problem since the contributions of older
generations will still be used to finance current retires. Because of the magnitude of the transition
costs and the difficult financial situation of the State, the government set 2007 as the cut-off date
for the participants' segmentation. While there will still be significant transition costs in the short
and medium term, this structural reform will ensure that pension costs will be independent of the
government budget in the long run32.


PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT

120. Public sector reforms have moved less rapidly. The Government had hoped to
aggressively implement ground-breaking reforms similar to those adopted by other high-
performing states (e.g Minas Gerais). After a more realistic assessment of the various obstacles
to the implementation of those reforms ­ e.g associated to the State's institutional framework,
technical and implementation capacity and political context - the focus of the public sector
management reform agenda has evolved to the gradual implementation of basic improvements in
planning, budgeting and financial execution. In addition, the GoA is also cautiously piloting
results based management tools in a sub-set of government priority programs with the aim of
replicating them gradually to other government programs.


     a) Planning, Budgeting and Budget Execution
121.     The government's priority reform agenda includes addressing of the weaknesses
identified in the planning, budgeting, expenditure execution cycles. Failures at all these levels
result in poor policy choices marked by inefficient resource allocation and lack of prioritization,
dispersion of government resources in a large number of programs, low budget and financial
execution of the great majority of programs and fiscal vulnerabilities related to the generation of
contingent liabilities as well as corruption, rent seeking and state capture.
122. The government has taken the first steps for improving the planning-budgeting-execution
cycles. In April 2009, the GoA signed a technical cooperation agreement with the federal
Ministry of Planning and Budgeting and Management (MPOG) for capacity building of State
agencies in planning, budgeting and financial management. In addition, per suggestion of the
Bank team, it included articles in the Budgetary Guidelines Law (LDO) for 2009-11 to simplify


32
  Earlier cut-off dates would impose higher short run costs. Nonetheless, this also means that State Treasury
contributions to the RPPS will end later.
                                                     36
budget classification, allow more flexibility for budget reallocation and set budget ceilings by
secretariats in Annual Budget Law (LOA) 2010.
123. In order to improve government resource allocation and expenditure execution, a joint
GoA and Bank diagnostic identified and measured the main performance indicators governing
planning, budgeting, expenditure execution and control. The purpose of this exercise was to
create a baseline, formulate an action plan for improvement and provide GoA with a roadmap for
implementation. The plan encompasses clearer definition of attributions and responsibilities for
central and line secretaries in the planning, budgeting and financial management areas, plus
capacity building activities for carrying out the budget cycle.
124. The action plan consists of a set of policy measures addressing the most urgent and
important limitations identified in the diagnostic work. The actions and areas were selected
according to their relevance, the getting of poor ratings in the diagnosis (areas that obtained
scores C and D) and implementation feasibility in the coming years. Using these criteria, the
activities that were included in the action plan are:
   ·   formal definitions of roles and responsibilities of central and line agencies in the
       planning, budgeting and financial management system;
   ·   definition of formal rules and chronograms for the preparation of budgetary pieces;
   ·   capacity building activities for planning staff in central and line agencies in macro fiscal
       programming, program formulation;
   ·   budget programming; and
   ·   strengthening the internal control agency (CGE).


   b) Prioritization and Introduction of Intensive Project Management tools
125. Finally, given resource scarcity, the GoA is taking steps to allocate resources to priority
undertakings and avoid fragmentation. Hence in 2009, a portfolio of priority projects has been
selected that will receive differentiated treatment during budget preparation and execution and be
intensively monitored to improve budget and project execution.
126. A unit inside the Planning Secretariat has taken on the responsibilities of a project
management office and innovative project management techniques are being used to administer
this strategic portfolio program. Each project is led by an assigned project manager who is being
trained in project management techniques and will be accountable for project performance. It is
expected that these measures will enhance budget predictability and facilitate faster corrective
measures to assure that projects are implemented and results are achieved. The introduction of
these managerial tools constitutes the GoA's first steps in delivering results in an efficient and
effective manner.

             IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


LINK TO CPS

127. The proposed operation is fully consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the
Brazil Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2008-2011. Sound macroeconomic management,
fiscal reform, efficient public sector management, and good governance are key pillars of the
CPS strategy for achieving inclusive economic growth in Brazil. The CPS also identifies support
for the states (under results-oriented public sector reforms) and improvement in fiscal
management as two of the most important areas of Bank engagement over the next four years.
Furthermore, the current partnership strategy was developed in close consultation with the
Federal authorities, who see Bank support to the states as central to their efforts to improve fiscal
management and the provision of public services.
128. The proposed loan meets all of the CPS criteria for a `priority operation'. It helps
reinforce fiscal discipline. It supports public sector management reforms and improved
governance. It helps strengthen federal-state relations. It responds in a flexible and timely
fashion both to the state needs and requests by the National Treasury.
129. The proposed operation also reinforces the FRL and fiscal discipline. Alagoas has not yet
been able to meet many FRL requirements. The State had been exceeding legal limits on debt,
debt service, and personnel expenditures. As a result of the strong fiscal adjustment and good
revenue performance, in 2008 Alagoas reached the FRL limit on indebtedness and met all of the
targets under the three-year rolling Fiscal Adjustment Programs (PAF) for the period 2007-2009.
The proposed operation became possible because good fiscal performance over the past two
years opened space for new borrowing. Moreover, the loan supports measures that will increase
the State's ability to satisfy FRL restrictions and the requirements of the debt renegotiation
contract signed with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN).
130. It is also noteworthy that by working with the State of Alagoas the Bank is assisting in
addressing poverty and management problems prevalent in numerous other poor Brazilian states.
These states have more in common with the Bank's poorer client countries than with Brazil, a
Middle Income Country (MIC). Brazil has attained MIC status by virtue of the dynamism of its
Southern states: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná and Santa
Catarina. Sao Paulo alone accounts for 34 percent of Brazil's GDP and if it were a sovereign
country would rank third in the LAC region with a GDP of US$550 billion (behind only Brazil
and Mexico) and a per capita GDP of US$9,000.
131. The Northeast, on the other hand, lags far behind in income and most other well-being
indicators and Alagoas is among the 2-3 poorest and worst scoring Brazilian states. In 2006 the
state's per capita income was US$ 2,200, only 40 percent of the Brazilian average, and the third
lowest in the country losing only to Piauí and Maranhão. In an international perspective Alagoas
ranks among the bottom group of middle income countries. Its HDI place Alagoas in the 120th
position among 185 countries (Brazil ranks 65th).
132. Consequently, this operation will be mobilizing good case loan design and experience to
address one of Brazil's and the world's poorer states --one that is less akin to a MIC than a much
poorer client country. Hence, this DPL is not only addressing some of the world's poorer

                                                 38
populations but it presents a prototype that might well serve as an example for subsequent
operations in the Northeast and elsewhere in the world.
133. By supporting one of the poorest sub-national governments in Brazil, the proposed
operation is also responding to a recent IEG study which assessed the Bank's engagement with
sub-national governments in large federal client countries. IEG recommended that the Bank
deepen its involvement in the lesser developed sub-nationals to enhance operations' poverty
impact, to provide the Bank with tested prototypes and to create desirable demonstration effects
for the broader community of lagging states. The Alagoas loan is addressing all three of IEG's
recommendations.
134. The operation will also draw upon successful good practice reform experiences in other
states which will bolster the reform program's credibility. Examples include the design and
implementation of human resource management reforms, improvements in State's procurement
system, reforms of civil service pension systems and successful experiences in reforming
planning, budgeting and financial management systems. The advice provided by Bank staff
during the preparation stage on the potential for adapting these experiences to Alagoas has
already delivered significant results. These have been reflected in the GoA's recent performance
and in the development of the government's reform program supported by this operation.


COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

135. Given its history of non-compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law and high
indebtedness, Alagoas has not been able to access credit since 2000. Currently Alagoas has an
external debt amounting to US$3 million with the Inter American Development Bank (IADB)
that corresponds to a loan for the promotion of the tourism sector (Programa de
Desenvolvimento do Turismo ­ PRODETUR) signed in 1998. In addition, Alagoas participates in
two national programs of technical assistance provided by the IADB with resources being
channeled through the Federal Government. The first is the National Program for the Support of
State Finance Secretariats (Programa Nacional de Apóio para a Administração Fiscal dos
Estados Brasileiros, PNAFE) and the second is the forthcoming National Program for Fiscal
Modernization (Programa Nacional de Modernização Fiscal - PROFISCO). The State has been
using the funds from the PNAFE program, available to all states, to promote improvements in
the State tax administration. In the same line, the PROFISCO program will finance technical
advisory services and IT systems to support the implementation of the Electronic Invoice (Nota
Fiscal Eletrônica) for the collection of the State VAT ­ ICMS and for general improvements in
the State's financial management systems. It is worth to mention that there is a strong
complementarity between the Bank's proposed DPL and the PROFISCO program financed by
IADB.
136. Even though the proposed loan is to a sub-national government rather than the Federal
Government, the team has maintained a regular policy dialogue with the IMF. This dialogue has
been focused has been maintained on fiscal issues and on the role played by the Bank's sub-
national lending program including the proposed operation in strengthening the institutional
framework for fiscal discipline at the sub-national level33.

33
  As discussed in the Staff report for the 2009 IMF Article IV Consultation, Brazil fiscal responsibility legislation,
together with its inflation targeting and flexible exchange rate regimes have built a strong macroeconomic
                                                         39
137. The preparation of the proposed operation also entailed strong collaboration with national
development partners. The most important has been the Federal Government of Brazil who
defined the improvement of Alagoas social and economic conditions as one of its priorities. In
the last four years Alagoas has received strong support from the Federal Government. The
support consists in sizeable capital transfers to the GoA, large federal investments in the state
under the Program of Growth Acceleration (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento ­ PAC)
and technical assistance support. The technical assistance activities provided by the Federal
Government are complementary to the reform program supported by the proposed operation. For
example, the Federal Government is supporting the State Secretary of Planning to improve
planning and budgeting systems. This is fully consistent with the main objective of the loan's
component on Strengthening Public Sector Management which is to improve the GoA's capacity
to manage budget resources and take full advantage of federal transfers to the capital budget.
Federal technical assistance activities also encompass support to the State Secretariat of
Education for the development of evaluation systems to improve the performance of Alagoas
public schools. Last but not the least, the federal social programs of direct cash transfers such as
Bolsa Familia, Beneficio de Prestação Continuada and the Rural Pension benefit a huge
proportion of the state population. They have been critical factors contributing to the recent
poverty reduction trend observed in the state (see chapters II and VI for more detailed reference).
138. The private sector has also assisted the government in the design and implementation of
the reform program supported by the proposed operation through the Brazil Competitive
Movement (Movimento Brasil Competitivo- MBC), a private sector organization dedicated to
reducing Brazil's tax burden by improving the efficiency in public spending. The MBC has
drawn on private-sector funding to hire the well recognized National Institute of Managerial
Development (Instituto Nacional de Desenvolvimento Gerencial-INDG)34 to advise the
government of Alagoas on cutting-edge techniques for data base integration targeting tax evasion
(matrix management of State tax revenue collection). During loan preparation, the INDG has
also been an important source of information for the Bank regarding the Government's progress
in improving institutional efficiency at the Secretariat of Finance and Planning. As part of loan
preparation the Bank organized a workshop on project management with INDG for the managers
of priority projects. MBC is expected to finance subsequent rounds of the workshop targeting a
broader audience of public servants from the Planning and line secretariats responsible for
carrying out other government projects.


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

139. The Bank's interaction with Alagoas has been limited over recent years owing to
Alagoas's borrowing constraints. The last direct investment lending operation with the State was
prepared in 1993 amounting to US$38 million. Alagoas fully repaid it in December 2008. This

framework. Thus Brazil is in a favorable position to weather the effects of the financial turmoil. This is illustrated by
the fact that after a sharp decline in activity in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the Brazilian
economy appears headed toward a gradual recovery
34
   Sponsored by the MBC, the INDG has been selling advisory services directed to improve the efficiency of
governmental processes to the states of Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and the municipality of Rio de Janeiro
among others. A recent Financial Times article (July 6, 2009) highlighted the successful experience of private sector
support for public sector reforms.

                                                          40
investment loan, "Brazil ­ State Highway Management (Loan No 3547-BR)," supported
highway maintenance and rehabilitation programs in several states. The objective of the project
was to reduce the deterioration of the states' road networks and to improve their condition.
Because of the substantial reduction in the scope of the rehabilitation component in Alagoas due
to scarce counterpart funds, the project was only able to prevent the road network from
deteriorating further. Improvements were marginal. While the overall rating of the project was
satisfactory, in the case of Alagoas its sustainability was questioned owing to limited technical
capacity and political interference in the decision making process.
140. In 2002, Alagoas non-compliance with the FRL caused the cancelation of a Rural Poverty
Reduction Project ­ Alagoas (P074803) loan. This project was part of a series of rural poverty
alleviation programs that benefited the northeastern states. Alagoas was the only State in the
region that did not receive such a loan.
141. While the Bank's engagement in Alagoas was limited, the proposed DPL has benefited
considerably from recent similar Bank operations with other state governments. In fact, the DPLs
to the states of Minas Gerais (Partnership for Development) in 2006 and Rio Grande do Sul
(Fiscal Sustainability for Growth) in 2008 provided strong foundations for this operation in two
ways. First, during the preparation and supervision of both operations the Bank acquired
substantial experience in sub-national fiscal and public sector management reforms that are
similar to those being implemented in Alagoas. Second, the success of both operations enhanced
the Bank's reputation and led the Federal Government and the State Government of Alagoas to
request a similar operation.
142. In addition, other Bank projects in the less developed states of the Northeast and North
regions provide valuable experience regarding the challenges associated with supporting
economic reforms in precarious institutional environments with severe technical and
implementation capacity constraints. At the same time, the Bank's successful interventions in
the Northeast, especially in Ceará, nourish the perception that a more efficient public sector is
both necessary and possible in less developed states and thus create a positive environment for
the implementation of the GoA's reform program.
143. Finally it is worth mentioning that several federal projects financed by the Bank have
directly impacted Alagoas. In the 1990s, the first phase of the Rural Poverty Reduction Projects
consisted in an umbrella loan to the Federal Government that benefited the nine northeastern
states. The second phase of this project consisted in direct loans to the northeastern states in
which Alagoas did not participate due to its difficult financial situation. Existing investment
lending operations approved since 2004 that have benefitted Alagoas include: Family Health,
Aids and STD Control, VIGISUS (health), Fundescola III (education), Bolsa Familia Program,
PARSEP (social security), and Proagua (water resource management). Undoubtedly, Bolsa
Familia Program is the most important of these, due to the very large number of beneficiaries
among Alagoas' population.


LESSONS LEARNED

144. The design of the proposed operation reflects several lessons from the recent experience
with state DPLs in Brazil. Most important is the need for client ownership of the reform
program. The State's commitment to reform was explored in the initial identification mission and

                                               41
has clearly been in evidence since. As soon as it took office, the Alagoas government authorities
prepared an emergency fiscal adjustment package to stop the growth in the State's deficits and
initiate a strong fiscal turnaround. As part of this package, the Government immediately stepped
up enforcement of the State's principal tax (a VAT), reduced discretionary operating costs, made
sharp cuts in investment expenditures and negotiated a rollback in the wage increases granted by
the previous government.
145. The project's time frame and disbursement mechanism have been designed to reduce the
risk of wavering political commitment in the future. The project would disburse entirely within
the term of the current administration. It focuses on procedural and administrative reforms that
will be self-sustaining. As elaborated in the section on risks, it would disburse in two tranches. A
tranched, rather than programmatic approach, was chosen in order to prompt the Bank and the
Government to agree on conditions for both tranche disbursements at the outset, rather than
leaving longer term reforms for a subsequent operation.
146. A second important lesson is the need for close dialogue with the State during the project
preparation. The team has been providing technical advice for the design and implementation of
reform measures. The fiscal targets for reform have been jointly developed by the State and
Federal administrations. The team provided technical support to the Secretary of Public
Management (SEGEP) on the preparation of the census of State personnel (which has now been
completed) and the follow-on audit of personnel (which is now ongoing and expected to be
completed in November). Bank dialogue has also helped the Government prepare a wide-ranging
reform in the pension system for State employees, to design an action plan for procurement
reform. During project preparation, the Bank also supported the State Secretariat of Planning
(SEPLAN) in the enhancement of planning, budgeting and expenditure execution cycles. To that
end, the Bank organized workshops on public investment systems, cost-benefit analysis and
project management for the staff of SEPLAN. In addition, the Bank team organized visits for the
staff of the Planning Secretariat to the states of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, so as to
learn their experiences in the reforms of investment management systems.
147. The third lesson is the need for realism in the definition of reform targets. The technical
capacity of the Alagoas government is particularly weak and the political constraints on reform,
particularly formidable. The targets for reform have been designed to take these constraints into
account. Efforts to reduce the wage bill, for example, focus on correcting errors in personnel
records, rather than wage reductions. By the same token, a variety of arrangements for technical
support would be incorporated in the project. These include technical assistance for budget
formulation to be provided by the Federal budget secretariat, site visits to the states of Minas
Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul (where similar reforms have been recently implemented) and
access to privately provided technical assistance.

                                Box 2. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1 - Reinforce Ownership: The program of reforms supported by the proposed DPL builds upon the
government program of the Governor Teotônio Villela and the State Multi-year plan (PPA) which explicitly
identifies GoA priorities for the period 2008-2011. To guarantee civil society support to the budgetary instruments,
the Brazilian legislation requires the realization of public consultations for the preparation of the PPA that should
antecede its approval by the State Legislative Assembly (Federal Constitution of 1988). In Alagoas, article 176 item
I of the State Constitution of 1989, set the rules for the preparation of the PPA. In addition, the Multi-Year Plan
(PPA), Budgetary Guidelines Law (LDO) and Annual Budget Law (LOA) are regularly and extensively discussed
by the State Assembly, which has the authority to revise and approve these government planning and budgetary
proposals. For the preparation of the PPA 2008-2011, the government organized an extensive program of public
consultation with civil society organizations, professionals, universities, specialists and regional leaders. The
government organized 17 sectoral workshops and 7 regional workshops to discuss the sectoral and regional
allocation of investment programs included in the PPA. The PPA is also the subject of biannual reviews by the State
Assembly, at which the government reports on the previous year's performance in meeting program objectives. This
year the GoA presented to the State Assembly the progress review of its PPA 2008-11 and discussed the inclusion
of the public sector reform agenda supported by this loan and the portfolio of priority projects that are part of the
public sector management component. Furthermore, a public consultation process is currently taking place at the
State Assembly for the approval of the social security reform package supported by this DPL. The State's
participatory/consultative mechanisms are also needed for the preparation and approval of credit operations.
Discussion of the proposed DPL operation has been extensive in other government branches, especially the
Judiciary and the Public Attorney's Office which were involved in the initial phases of preparation. The State
Assembly approved the draft law proposing the DPL loan in June 2009.
Principle 2 - Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework: The Bank's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix. The policy
matrix draws on government fiscal targets from the Fiscal Adjustment Program PAF agreed with the National
Treasury Secretariat (STN). In addition, a matrix of performance indicators for each component has been prepared
by the government and bank teams. These performance indicators will chart the progress of the different
components. The State Finance Secretariat (SEFAZ) will be the responsible for the tracking of loan progress against
indicators. In addition, the State Planning Secretariat (SEPLAN) and the State Secretariat of Management
(SEGESP) participated fully in the preparation of the performance indicators matrix since they are major
stakeholders and are responsible for implementing components 2, 3 and 4. Each government participant is clear on
its responsibilities and the consequences for failing to meet them.
Principle 3 - Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to address country
circumstances: Brazil's rigorous fiscal control regime has contributed much to sustenance of fiscal responsibility
since the late 1990s but also imposes relatively high transaction costs for processing sub-national loans. Given this
reality, the GoA has strongly preferred a two-tranche DPL for which a federal approval is needed only once. The
Bank concurred that under the present circumstances a two-tranche DPL was the most appropriate instrument.
Principle 4 - Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement: The Bank's
policy matrix uses a limited number of first and second tranche conditions (9 and 7, respectively). Government
commitments are also clearly stated in the Letter of Economic Policy. Conditionality is focused on critical activities
that will support Alagoas's reform including fiscal targets, adoption of laws and implementation of action plans.
These conditions link to the pillars of Alagoas's reform program and consequently constitute a formidable incentive
for moving forward.
Principle 5 - Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support: As agreed with the government, the two-tranche operation is timed to the State's financial and
reform needs and planning. The review of second-tranche conditions is expected to take place in mid 2010. This
process should allow for predictable second tranche disbursement in the second semester of 2010. The policy matrix
contains a limited number of outcome indicators, which will be monitored and evaluated during implementation.
These indicators link to essential policy and institutional reforms. Hence, project supervision will be continuous and
will focus on the critical reform path Alagoas has opted to follow.


                                                         43
148. Finally, the Bank's experience with state DPLs has demonstrated the importance of
coordination with the Federal Government. The Alagoas project was initiated with the
concurrence of the STN. The team regularly briefed STN during the course of project
preparation and would continue to do so during project supervision.


ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

149. The proposed operation builds on a number of reports produced by the Bank task team.
GoA authorities of the secretariats of Finance (SEFAZ), Planning (SEPLAN), Public
Management (SEGESP), Agency for Modernization of Process Management (AMGESP) and the
AL Social Security Entity (AL-Previdência) provided valuable information for the preparation of
this operation. The Bank team diagnostic studies include:
   1. The Economy of Alagoas: Historical Trends and Recent Performance (August, 2009)
   2. Alagoas: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis and Impacts of the World Bank Program (July, 2009)
   3. Civil Service in Alagoas: Poor Performer and Costly (June, 2009)
   4. Diagnosis of the Social Security System of Alagoas and Impact of Proposed Reforms (June, 2009)
   5. Adjustment of Personnel Expenditures in Alagoas: Options in the Short Run (June, 2009)
   6. Alagoas: Diagnosis of Budgetary and Financial Management (July, 2009)
   7. Strenghtening Public Sector Management, Procurement and Investment Systems in GoA (June,
      2009)
   8. Assessment of Debt Restructuring Options for Alagoas (November, 2008)
150. In addition to the pieces above, the Bank has produced recently a report entitled, "Topics
in Fiscal Federalism" (November, 2008) that describes the existing system of controls of sub-
national governments' and highlights its achievements and limitations. This study provided
background material for the assessment of the State debt profile and options for its restructuring.
151. Finally, the ESW report entitled "Brazil: Improving Fiscal Conditions for Growth" (April
2007) addresses important policy issues relating to budget rigidity and expenditure management
that contributed to the assessment of fiscal and public sector management challenges faced by
the GoA.


                             V.    THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

152. The proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) aims at supporting the government's
overall objective of economic development with social welfare. In particular, the operation is
supporting the fiscal adjustment and public management renewal axis as the Bank considers that
the consolidation of fiscal adjustment and the enhancement of public sector management are
necessary conditions to improve the difficult Alagoas's socioeconomic conditions. The operation
comprises four key components: fiscal adjustment, human resource management, social security
reform and public sector management reform. The selection of the four key DPL components
                                                44
responds to the government and Bank team's shared assessment on their relevance to the
government's development objectives, feasibility and the value added that the Bank can bring to
the GoA reform agenda.
153. The four DPL components are described in detail below and in Annex 3, which contains
the operation policy matrix. The components are:
       ·   Consolidating the Fiscal Adjustment and Creating Fiscal Space for Investment
       ·   Improving Human Resource Management
       ·   Reducing State Social Security Deficits
       ·   Strengthening Public Sector Management

                   Figure 15: AL: Fiscal and Public Sector Reforms ­ DPL Program




                                    Enhance the GOA's
                                        Capacity to
                                    Promote Economic
                                     Development and
                                      Social Welfare




154. These four components are intended to restore fiscal sustainability, improve the
management of State human resources, reduce social security deficits and improve public sector
efficiency. They are fully consistent with the CPS objectives of strengthening macroeconomic
fundamentals and public sector management. This operation is one of a number of sub-national
DPLs and SWAps designed to reinforce public sector management as an integral part of the


                                                45
Bank's public sector governance strategy in Brazil35.The proposed operation is a two-tranche
Development Policy Loan totaling US$195.450 million. The primary reason for choosing a
single Bank operation, instead of two or more programmatic loans, is the considerable
transaction costs and delays involved in processing sub national loans in Brazil. The complex
and strict system of fiscal control of sub-national governments' finances makes it very difficult
to process sequential operations. Each loan would have to go through a time consuming process
of multiple reviews and approvals by Federal Government agencies, a process that could take
months or even years.
                            Box 3. Alagoas: Fiscal and Public Sector Reforms DPL
                                 Prior Actions for First Tranche Disbursement
     Consolidating Fiscal Adjustment
     ·   Prior Action 1: Adoption of a system aimed at achieving GoA's revenue collection targets through the
         establishment of an integrated data base (Gestão Matricial da Receita - GMR) to facilitate the
         identification of tax evasion and the establishment of a remuneration schedule for the staff of the
         Secretariat of Finance (SEFAZ) linked to specific tax collection targets.
     ·   Prior Action 2: Introduction of a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the Borrower's public
         procurement system, including the implementation of an electronic price registration system for the
         purchasing of 635 items during 2008 and the establishment of time limits to complete each procedure
         under said system.
     Improving Human Resources Management
     ·   Prior Action 3: The completion of the Census of the civil service staff and the carrying out of remedial
         measures, including the elimination of about 450 staff from the registry of active public servants.
     ·   Prior Action 4: Launching the audit of the state payroll including compensation for active employees and
         pensioners and survivors benefits which includes the contract with the auditing firm, the approval of its
         working plan and first progress report confirming the conclusion of the Audit first phase.
     Reducing the State Social Security Deficits
     ·   Prior Action 5: Approval by the State Assembly of the Law 7114/2009 establishing the Single
         Administrator (Gestor Único) for the Government of Alagoas's (RPPS) pension system and the
         restructuring of the State Social Security System directed to a gradual transition to a fully funded system,
         through the segmentation of participants in said system into different beneficiary groups and the
         establishment of corresponding funding mechanisms, including : (i) a fully-funded system (Fundo
         Previdenciário) for the civil service staff contracted after December 31. 2006); (ii) a pay as you go
         funding mechanism (Fundo Financeiro) for the civil service staff contracted before December 31, 2006;
         and (iii) a pay as you go funding mechanism (Fundo dos Militares) for the military staff.
     Strengthening Public Sector Management
     ·   Prior Action 6: Approval of an action plan detailing the measures required for the improvement of the
         Borrower's capabilities for budget formulation and financial execution, including the establishment of a
         task force (Grupo Gestor) responsible for the implementation of the action plan.
     ·   Prior Action 7: Establishment and staffing of the Project Management Office at the Secretary of Planning
         (SEPLAN) responsible for the definition of rules governing the execution of the portfolio of priority
         projects and for their and their monitoring.
     ·   Prior Action 8: Approval by the State Assembly of an amendment to the Multi-Year Plan 2008-11,
         including the State priority programs "Strengthening of Public Management" and "Strengthening of
         Planning" with a budget allocation of R$7.8 million and R$7.2 million, respectively.

35
  Bank support for public sector management in Brazil's sub-national governments includes the states of Minas
Gerais (Partnership for Development I (DPL) and II (SWAp), Rio Grande do Sul (Fiscal Sustainability for Growth
(DPL) and Ceara (Multi-sector SWAps I and II).
                                                        46
155. A two-tranche DPL is also congruent with the State authorities' interest in drawing on the
Bank's advice in program implementation. Hence, the agreements made under the loan are
viewed as important signals of their commitment to carry out the proposed reforms. Finally, the
two-tranche design reinforces the continuity of the government reform efforts, something a
single tranche DPL may not be able to do as effectively. Indeed, the second tranche conditions
are follow-up actions of government prior actions to be completed by loan signature.
Accordingly, a two-tranche DPL provides superior incentives for completing, consolidating and
sustaining the reform agenda launched by the current administration.


                           Box 4. Alagoas: Fiscal and Public Sector Reform DPL
                                     Second Tranche-release Conditions
 The government has agreed on the following actions as conditions for releasing the second tranche:
     Consolidating Fiscal Adjustment
     ·   Condition 1: Maintenance of good fiscal status under the Brazil's Fiscal Responsibility Law.
     Improving Human Resources Management
     ·   Condition 2: Completion of the payroll audit and implementation of remedial legal, administrative
         and accounting measures.
     ·   Condition 3: Crosschecking of the information on the social security system with the National
         Registry of Obits (SISOBI) to identify deceased beneficiaries that are still receiving pensions and
         with National Registry of Social Security System Participants (SIPREV) and implementation of
         remedial legal, administrative and accounting measures.
     Reducing the State Social Security Deficits
     ·   Condition 4: Application of federal social security legislation including: (a) public sector entities
         should pay 100 percent of survivors benefits up to the RGPS ceiling plus 70 percent of the value that
         exceed this ceiling (Art. 40.7.1 of the Constitutional Amendment 41); (b) public entities should
         calculate pensions using the average of the 180 previous salaries before retirement and not anymore
         the exit salary (Art. 40.3 of the Constitutional Amendment 41); and (c) public entities need to use
         specific social security exemptions legislations to be applied to pensioners and survivors
         contributions in excess to the RGPS ceiling and not the legislation used by the income tax legislation
         (Art. 40.21 of the Constitutional Amendment 41).
     ·   Condition 5: Adoption of administrative, legal and regulatory instruments required to fully
         implement the provisions of the Social Security Law, including: (i) the issuance of the statutes of the
         Single Administrator, the staffing of the governing bodies and appointment of officials and key
         technical staff of the Single Administrator, the approval of its financing plan; (ii) the segregation of
         the three funding and the (iii) the capitalization of the funding of an amount of at least R$122.5
         million in 2010.
     ·   Prior Action 6: Completion of all legal, technical and administrative conditions required for the
         issuance of the CRP issued by the Social Security Secretariat at the Ministry of Social Security.
     Strengthening Public Sector Management
     ·   Condition 7: Satisfactory implementation of the Action Plan to improve planning, budgetary,
         financial management and internal control systems. The criteria for satisfactory implementation
         would be the implementation of at least 5 out of the 9 actions included in the Action Plan.
     ·   Condition 8: Satisfactory implementation of the State priority programs "Strengthening of Public
         Management" and "Strengthening Planning". The criteria for satisfactory implementation would be
         the government expenditure of at least R$5 million committed expenditures (or 30 percent of budget
         allocations) in these programs.

                                                        47
156. The first tranche (US$120,000,125 million)36 will be disbursed upon effectiveness of the
loan. The second tranche (US$74,961,250 million) will be disbursed when the Government
meets the conditions described in the loan agreement including 2nd tranche indicators that are
expected to be met by mid 2010. Disbursement of the first tranche would recognize the GoA's
important actions since Governor Villela assumed office in January, 2007. The World Bank and
the Government of Alagoas have consequently agreed upon the prior actions enumerated in Box
3 above as conditions for presenting the DPL to the Bank's Board for approval.
157. It is also noteworthy that the proposed DPL makes use of `intermediate results' or
`secondary indicators' to monitor the implementation of the reform agenda. Hence, the
government will monitor and report progress on the implementation of a results framework that
sets medium term outcomes for roughly 50 results indicators (see Table 9 below and Annex 3A).

158. In addition to its expected positive effects, the proposed operation would have impacts at
the state and national levels in other important ways. At the state level, the two tranches of the
operation would be relieving serious short-term liquidity constraints and supporting the reform
agenda.
159.    Also at the state level, knowledge transfer is another important benefit. Hence, during
project implementation the Bank will advise the government on technical aspects of policy
design such as social security, human resource management and improvements in the State
planning-budgeting-execution cycle drawing upon results-based management tools.
160. The proposed operation would also provide benefits at the national level. First, it will
reinforce the importance and feasibility of addressing sub-national fiscal discipline with an
appropriate institutional framework. The demonstration effect would be especially instructive in
Alagoas where public finances have been consistently precarious. Second, it will demonstrate
that a turnaround in fiscal, economic and social conditions is possible even in a previously poorly
performing and poorly managed State.


POLICY REFORM AREAS

161. The proposed operation would support essential policy reforms and institutional
strengthening actions in ten areas within four broad components of the government program:
fiscal adjustment, human resource management, social security and public sector modernization.
These policy reforms are described in detail below.

Component 1: Consolidating Fiscal Adjustment and Creating Fiscal Space for Investment

162.    This component comprises government actions directed at:
        ·       guaranteeing the financial sustainability of Alagoas;
        ·       reinforcing the decreasing path of State indebtedness;

                                                    49
        ·       complying with the federal fiscal discipline framework; and
        ·       expanding fiscal space for investments.
163. As mentioned in Section III, since 2007, the GoA has obtained robust fiscal balances and
reduced consistently its indebtedness. Furthermore, for the first time since the enactment of the
FRL in 2000, the State is in compliance with the indebtedness ceiling defined in the FRL. In
addition the GoA has managed to meet the targets for primary balances, debt, own tax revenue
collection and personnel expenses agreed in the PAF 2007-09 in 2007 and again in 2008.
164. The Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA) performed by the Bank team indicates the
need to deepen the strong fiscal discipline exhibited by the GoA since 2009. In addition, the use
of the Government Financial Statistics (GFS) framework suggests that the underlying adjustment
relied upon the reduction of investment expenditures which are also highly dependent on federal
capital transfers. Reducing investments will invariably slow growth and should not be relied
upon unless there is no other recourse available. Furthermore, Alagoas and other states are
confronting a reduction in federal transfers owing to the current economic recession. Therefore,
Alagoas will need to increase its net operating balances to finance with its own sources the
expansion of investments and reduce its dependence on federal capital transfers.
165. Consistent with this assessment, the proposed operation supports the increase of
government fiscal balances, the reduction of indebtedness, improvements in tax collection and
the control of current expenses. Therefore, the accomplishment of the targets for primary
balance, financial debt to net real revenue ratio, own revenue collection and personnel
expenditures to net current revenue ratio in 2007 and 2008 defined in the Program of Fiscal
Adjustment (PAF) agreed with the National Treasury Secretariat for the period 2007-09
represent the standard DPL requirement that consists in the maintenance of an appropriate
macroeconomic and expenditure program and fiscal arrangements with the Guarantor. In addition, second
tranche conditions reinforce macroeconomic and expenditure appropriateness by requiring
achieving the targets for the primary surplus, financial debt to net real revenue ratio, own
revenue collection and personnel expenditures to net current revenue ratio in 2009 defined in the
Program of Fiscal Adjustment (PAF) agreed with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) for the
period 2008-10.
166. Furthermore, the deepening of the fiscal adjustment and the recovery of State capacity to
finance investments with its own resources depends on the ability of the GoA to maintain a good
tax revenue performance through the strengthening of revenue collection efficiency and
tightening control of current expenditures. On the revenue side the program supports, in addition
to the achievement of the target for own revenue collection in 2007 and 2008 defined in the
Program of Fiscal Adjustment (PAF) agreed with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN) for the
period 2007-09, the introduction of an IT integrated data base system (Gerenciamento Matricial
de Receitas ­ GRM) to reduce tax evasion and the establishment of a remuneration schedule for
the staff of the Secretariat of Finance (SEFAZ) linked to specific tax collection targets37.
167. On the expenditure side, the program supports the control of personnel expenditures -the
single most important disequilibrium factor - and improvements in the State procurement system

37
   The GoA submitted to the Bank a communication (Ofício) GSEF No. 519/2009 dated on October 7th describing
the adoption of the GMR and the Laws No 6951 of July 2008 and No 7001 Of December 2008 establishing the
targets and parameters for the remuneration of SEFAZ staff.
                                                    50
directed at reducing irregularities and generating savings in the purchase of goods and services38.
Apart from the achievement of the target for personnel expenditures to net current revenue in
2007 and 2008 defined in the Program of Fiscal Adjustment (PAF), prior actions completed in
this area for the first tranche disbursement would consist in the introduction of a series of
reforms aimed at modernizing the Borrower's public procurement system, including the
implementation of an electronic price registration system for the purchasing of 635 items during
2008 and the establishment of time limits to complete each procedure under said system.

38
   It is worth mentioning that specific actions for the control of personnel expenditures are contained in Components
2 (Improving HR Management) and 3 (Reducing the State Social Security Deficits).

   Prior actions for first tranche disbursement and second tranche conditions are bolded.

168. The second tranche condition on the consolidation of fiscal adjustment component
consists in the maintenance of good fiscal status as evidenced by the accomplishment of the
Fiscal Responsibility Law.
169. The program also includes benchmarks to measure progress in the implementation of
government actions. In this regard, the marked increase in the net operating balance in 2007 and
2008 signals improvement in the quality of fiscal adjustment as it contributes to the expansion of
fiscal space for investments. In fact, another marker of fiscal adjustment progress has been the
increase of government investment expenditures in 2008. The continuous adoption of IT tools
and the introduction of results based management mechanisms are other benchmarks that will be
monitored. The continuous improvements in State procurement system would be also indicator
of progress in this area. The first component of the policy matrix is detailed in Table 10 below.


Component 2: Improving Human Resource Management


170.    This component comprises government actions directed at:
        ·    exerting effective control over the payroll;
        ·    developing efficient human resource policies; and
        ·    enhancing civil service performance.
171. The operation supports the enhancement of GoA's human resource management strategy
which consists in two sequential sets of actions. The first is the improvement of the currently
unreliable information systems regulating staffing, individual remuneration and overall payroll.
In 2009, the GoA has made significant advances that would be first tranche prior actions: the
completion of the Census of the civil service staff and the carrying out of remedial measures,
including the elimination of about 450 staff from the registry of active public servants and the
launching of an audit of the state payroll including compensation for active employees and
pensioners and survivors benefits which includes the contract with the auditing firm, the
approval of its working plan and first progress report confirming the completion of the first
phase of the Audit40.

40
  The GoA submitted to the Bank a communication (Ofício) No. 689/2009 dated on October 23th and issued by
SEGESP describing the results of the Census of the Civil Services staff and the Decree No 4102 announcing the
Census and stating the mandatory participation of the state's public servants. In addition, the GoA presented to the
                                                        52
172. In addition, an important benchmark in this area is the completion of the procurement
process for the purchase of the human resource management IT system that will provide payroll
processing security. Follow-up actions comprise second tranche disbursement conditions,
namely the completion of the payroll audit and implementation of remedial legal, administrative
and accounting measures.
173. A progress marker in this area would be a new fully operational HR management system

174. The Bank also supports a second set of actions to enhance GoA's capacity to design and
implement Human Resource Management policies. The creation of a Quality of HR Management
Committee led by the Secretariat of Public Management would be a benchmark indicator of
progress on this area. Given the fiscal and budgetary dimensions of HR policies, the secretariats
of Finance and Planning will also be part of the Committee which will be responsible for the
control of personnel expenditures, and for appraising important HR decisions. These would
include establishing new positions, creating new career paths, revising rules governing
promotion, and designing capacity building activities for the civil service, among others.
175. The corresponding indicative benchmark for the second tranche disbursement consists in
the development of the activities assigned to the Committee such as the preparation of workforce
planning, proposals for simplification of HR legislation, revision of career structures, review of
compensation policies and the development of training strategies.

Component 3: Reducing the State Social Security Deficits

176.    This component comprises government actions directed at:
        ·        improving the managerial control of the State social security system
        ·        reducing the cash and actuarial deficits of the State social security system; and
        ·        reducing the contribution of the State Treasury to the social security system
                 through the gradual transition from a PAYG system to a fully funded system.
177. As described above, the GoA social security system is one of the main sources of
disequilibrium of State public finances. In 2008, the deficit of the GoA's RPPS reached R$430
million or 15 percent of its net current revenues. Projections performed for the preparation of this
operation indicate that the RPPS's financial disequilibrium will be aggravated over time resulting
in a significant increase in the financial burden unless steps are taken. This is in large measure
due to an expected increase in pensioners and survivors relative to active public servants.
Therefore, social security reform comprises an essential pillar of the effort to reduce the State
fiscal disequilibrium.
178. The administrative and structural reforms to be supported by this proposed DPL (Table
12) which are prior actions for first tranche disbursement are the approval by the State Assembly
of the Law No 7114/2009 establishing the Single Administrator (Gestor Único) for the
Government of Alagoas's (RPPS) pension system and the restructuring of the State Social
Security System directed to a gradual transition to a fully funded system, through the
segmentation of participants in said system into different beneficiary groups and the
establishment of corresponding funding mechanisms, including: (i) a fully-funded system
(Fundo Previdênciário) for the civil service staff contracted after December 31. 2006; (ii) a pay
as you go funding mechanism (Fundo Financeiro) for the civil service staff contracted before
December 31, 2006; and (iii) a pay as you go funding mechanism (Fundo dos Militares) for the
military staff (see Table 12)41.

   The GoA presented to the Bank the draft Law proposal sent to the State Assembly on October 6, 2009 reforming
its social security system. The CRP will be obtained with the Federal Government as soon as the Social Security
Reform Law is enacted by the State Assembly.
                                                      54
179. The second tranche conditions on administrative reforms to the State social security
system are the crosschecking of the information on the social security system with the National
Registry of Obits (SISOBI) to identify deceased beneficiaries that are still receiving pensions and
with National Registry of Social Security System Participants (SIPREV) and implementation of
remedial legal, administrative and accounting measures.
180. In addition, the DPL supports the GoA's parametric reforms directed at reducing the
State social security deficit. In particular, the loan is supporting the application of federal social
security legislation including the payment of 100 percent of survivors benefits up to the RGPS
ceiling plus 70 percent of the value that exceed this ceiling, the calculation of pensions using the
average of the 180 previous salaries before retirement and the use specific social security
exemptions legislations to be applied to pensioners and survivors contributions in excess to the
RGPS ceiling. Potential savings from the adoption of the federal legislation are significant.
Figure 16 below shows the potential gains to be obtained in the next 50 years.
181. The second administrative action for the second tranche disbursement is the completion
of all legal, technical and administrative conditions required for the issuance of the CRP issued
by the Social Security Secretariat at the Ministry of Social Security. The Social Security
Ministry issues a pension certification to states and municipalities if they comply with certain
rules that reflect sound pension management including, inter alia, adequate legislative
frameworks, actuarial analysis and audits. Currently Alagoas does not hold the CRP due to its
non-compliance with a number of requirements. For example, even required basic reports are not
sent to the Social Security Ministry. Hence, obtaining pension certification by complying with
the Federal Government rules is an essential step in demonstrating commitment to pension
reform and professionalizing pension management.
182. It is important to mention that the audit of the payroll in the HR component also includes
the payroll of pensioners and survivors. Rough estimates by the Secretary of Public Management
indicate that potential errors for pensioners and survivors are bigger than what can be found in
the payroll for active civil servants. The government has also committed to adopt additional
administrative measures to correct data inconsistencies that were found by the Bank team. These
are related to irregularities affecting more than 700 old-age retirees and survivor family
relationships. These inconsistencies constitute a significant management challenge but the
correction of corresponding irregularities and frauds should generate significant savings.
183. The second tranche condition regarding the administrative and structural reform to the
State social security system is a follow up action to the approval of the State RRPS which
corresponds to adoption of administrative, legal and regulatory instruments required to fully
implement the provisions of the Social Security Law, including: (i) the issuance of the statutes of
the Single Administrator, the staffing of the governing bodies and appointment of officials and
key technical staff of the Single Administrator, the approval of its financing plan; (ii) the
segregation of the three funding and the (iii) the capitalization of the funding of an amount of at
least R$122.5 million in 2010.

Component 4: Strengthening Public Sector Management
184.   This component comprises government actions directed at:
       ·       providing planning, budgeting and management tools, methods and arrangements
       for better implementation of government programs; and
       ·     improving government service delivery through the gradual adoption of intensive
       management in a selected set of government priority programs.
185. The Bank is supporting the GoA's efforts to enhance its planning, budgeting and
financial management system reflected in the action plan that has been prepared by the
Government with technical support of the Bank team (see Table 13). Indeed, a prior action
completed for first tranche disbursement is the approval of an action plan detailing the measures
required for the improvement of the Borrower's capabilities for budget formulation and financial
execution, including the establishment of a task force (Grupo Gestor) responsible for the
implementation of the action plan42.
186. The second tranche condition related to the improvement of planning, budgeting and
expenditure execution systems is the satisfactory implementation of the Action Plan to improve
planning, budgetary, financial management and internal control systems. The criteria for
satisfactory implementation would be the implementation of at least 5 out of the 9 actions
included in the Action Plan.
187. The proposed DPL also supports government actions to prioritize resource allocation and
gradually introduce results based management techniques to improve the effectiveness of its
programs. Given the scarcity and fragmentation of its resources the government selected a
portfolio of priority projects that will receive special budgetary treatment and be intensively
managed.
188. For the intensive management of the portfolio of priority projects the government created
a unit that has taken on the responsibilities of a project management office. Indeed, the prior

  The GoA submitted to the Bank the Decree No 4197 of October 2009 approving the Action plan for the
improvement of its planning, budgeting, financial management and internal control systems.
                                                57
actions for the first tranche disbursement would be establishment and staffing of the Project
Management Office at the Secretary of Planning (SEPLAN) responsible for the definition of
rules governing the execution of the portfolio of priority projects and for their monitoring and the
approval by the State Assembly of an amendment to the Multi-Year Plan 2008-11, including the
State priority programs "Strengthening of Public Management" and "Strengthening of Planning"
with a budget allocation of R$7.8 million and R$7.2 million, respectively. The selection of the
portfolio can be considered as a benchmark action that indicates the willingness of the
government to focus its resources on a small set of high priority programs and deliver results
through their intensive management. If successful, this pilot experience could be replicated in
other government programs43.
189. Finally, to guarantee the implementation of the GoA's priority programs in the area of
institutional enhancement, the second tranche disbursement condition on this area would be the
satisfactory implementation of the State priority programs "Strengthening of Public
Management" and "Strengthening Planning". The criterion for satisfactory implementation is
defined as the government spending effectively at least R$5 million of committed expenditures
(or 30 percent of budget allocations) to these programs.
190. The Bank provided technical advice to the government on the analysis of policy
proposals in a number of reform areas such as social security, human resources and public sector
management. The Bank will continue to provide technical advice as the government implements
its reform program. The approval of the amendment to the State Budget including allocations for
the strengthening of public management and planning signals the GoA's commitment to
guarantee resources for capacity building activities in the policy areas supported by the DPL.
191. In addition, as mentioned in Section IV the GoA is currently receiving technical
assistance from the private sector, the IADB and the Federal Government. The private sector in
particular, is financing through the MBC, technical assistance activities in the areas of tax
administration and project management. These organizations are assisting with the
implementation of actions corresponding to components 1 and 4. For components 2 and 3, with
Bank support, the GoA has designed with a program on public sector modernization that has
been included in the portfolio of priority programs. This program includes the census of the civil
service, the audit of the payroll, the new HR IT system and the design of the social security
reform proposal. While the Bank will not finance this work, it can provide technical advice
during project supervision. Furthermore, a second tranche condition is the satisfactory
implementation of the "Strengthening Public of Management" and "Strengthening of Planning"
programs included in the portfolio of GoA´s priority programs.

   The GoA submitted to the Bank the Decree No. 4198 establishing the Project Management Office at SEPLAN
and the Law No. 7089 approving the budget allocations in the State Budget (for FY 2009 and FY 2010) to finance
the implementation of the strengthening of the public management system priority programs "Fortalecimento do
Sistema de Gestão Pública" and "Fortalecimento do Planejamento".

OVERALL IMPACT AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

192. The impact of the measures supported by the proposed Bank operation has been assessed
in a debt sustainability analysis presented in detail in Annex 4. Two scenarios were developed.
The first scenario was based upon the revenue and expenditure trends observed prior to the
measures taken by the government in 2007 and 2008. The second scenario took into account the
continuity and strengthening of the adjustment measures adopted in 2008-09 supported by the
operation. The study projects the evolution of the government balances, the civil service pension
deficit, and the key Fiscal Responsibility Law indicators of total debt, debt service, and
personnel expenditures.

                                                          60
193.   The assumptions under the two scenarios are as follows.
   a. Revenue collection efficiency measures such as the adoption of the system of data base
      integration to discover evasion, introduction of results-based management mechanisms at
      the Secretary of Finance (SEFAZ) matrix management model and the electronic invoice
      should lead to tax collection increases that would be 5 percent higher than projected in
      the baseline scenario where the growth rate of the ICMS is projected to follow GDP
      growth and inflation.
   b. Payroll census, audit and the new HR system will generate a once for all decrease of 3
      percent of the payroll registered in 2009 under the reform scenario. In addition, a new
      compensation rule would be established to limit the payrolls real increase to 85 percent of
      the GDP real growth. The baseline scenario implies that payroll will grow with GDP and
      inflation.
   c. Social security reforms consisting of audit of pensioners and survivors payroll and
      crosschecking with federal data base information and corrections will generate a one time
      decrease of 6 percent. Parametric measures will generate savings that amount to R$800
      million in 20 years. The baseline scenario implies that pensions grow with population,
      national GDP and inflation.
   d. Reforms in procurement with the introduction of electronic price registration and
      electronic reverse auction will generate savings of 10 percent in 2010 of government
      purchases of goods and services. Thereafter expenditures on goods and services will
      grow at the same rate as inflation and GDP in both scenarios.
   e. Improvements in public sector management and the strengthening of government
      strategic investments will result in an increase of 10 percent in the real GDP growth rate
      compared to the baseline scenario. In addition, the reform scenario assumes higher
      investment expenditures financed by increased net operating balances that will result
      from the reforms on current revenues and expenses, and
   f. World Bank loan of US$195.450 and would have the following financial conditions: 30
      years, 0-grace period, Libor + 11 b.p.
194. Figures 16 and 17 show the projected scenarios with and without reforms. The exercise
shows that revenue gains are limited and that the bulk of the adjustment relies on the expenditure
side, in particular on the reduction of personnel expenses and social security deficits. Both the
Census and the Audit economies will keep Alagoas below the Fiscal Responsibility Law ceiling
for personnel expenses (at 60 percent of Net Current Revenues). The application of the
compensation rule contains the payroll increase in the medium term. Together with the gains on
the purchase of goods and services, the reforms on the expenditure side enable the GoA to
expand the fiscal space for investment. Indeed investment expenditures to net current revenues
under the reform program are 2 percentage points higher than what is projected without reforms.

195. Higher investment expenditures do not reduce primary and overall balances. Only in the
first year are the projected primary and overall balances lower under the reform scenario because
the Bank loan is allocated to investments. From 2010 onwards, projected fiscal balances are
higher and thus the debt reduction path is accelerated. It is worth noting that the projection for
debt services (amortization plus interest payments) reflects the prepayment of a high cost debt.
Part of the DPL proceeds would be allocated to pay this debt that amounts R$106.8 million and
must be paid in 2012.

196. In summary, the reforms supported in this proposed DPL and agreed by the GoA will
have important impacts on guaranteeing a decreasing path for indebtedness and expanding fiscal
space for the increase of investment expenditures.
197. The World Bank team considers the policy reforms and institutional strengthening
activities supported by the DPL to be essential if Alagoas is to put aside its chronic financial
disequilibrium and strong dependence upon Federal transfers. Moreover, in light of the level of
fiscal disequilibria and administrative disarray that has characterized the State for years; the
Bank team considers the prior actions and second tranche conditions comprising the DPL to be
quite relevant.
                                              64
198. The strong effects of the global financial crisis on the GoA's public finances suggest the
need for a deeper analysis to assess the effect of some of the shocks in the most important
determinants of fiscal sustainability, namely economic growth at the state and especially at the
national level. On the revenue side, the most important risk is a sharp reduction in transfers from
the federal government, which represented 60 percent of total revenues in 2008. Transfers from
the federal government are associated to national tax collection which in turn depends on
national GDP growth. Own tax collection is the second most important source of revenue and
depends on the State GDP growth rate44.
199. Using the World Bank lending operation as the baseline, a sensitivity analysis exercise
was performed using a more pessimistic growth scenario than the used in the simulations above.
Table below shows the growth rate for the baseline and alternative scenarios.

                                        Table 15: Different Growth Scenarios
                                       2008         2009         2010        2011         2012         2013-2020
Baseline                                 0%       -0.50%           3%       3.50%           4%             4.50%
Lower GDP Growth rate                    0%       -1.50%           3%       3.50%           4%             4.50%


200. Results are exibited in Figure 18 below. Given the temporary nature of the negative
shock on the GDP growth rate, there is a temporary shift in the declining trend observed for the
net consolidated debt to net current revenue. Indeed, in 2009 and 2010 Alagoas's debt may
return to above the FRL ceiling of 200 percent. Personnel expenses to net current revenue should
be much higher than the FRL limit of 60 percent. Nonetheless, better growth prospects for 2010
onwards should help Alagoas to resume the improvement of its fiscal accounts.

201. The probabilistic approach indicates that the effect of the ensuing reforms supported by
the loan have a measurable impact towards improving debt sustainability and the probabilities of
compliance with the FRL.

202. Besides the sensitivity analysis for each variable, risk analyses were conducted to observe
simultaneous random shocks in a set of variables and their impact on the state's financial
situation. A random error was added to each of the following variables: tax revenues, federal
government transfers, state government transfers, personnel expenditures and pension fund
contributions, other current expenditures (including goods and services), and the exchange rate45.
Results from Monte-carlo simulations are depicted in Figures 19 and 20. Right hand panels
correspond to the scenario without reforms while left hand panels correspond to the reform
scenario.

  For each variable, a random error affected its growth of rate. Random errors were assumed to follow a zero-mean
normal distribution.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

203. The proposed operation is not expected to have a significant direct impact on Alagoas's
poverty and social conditions. However, the indirect poverty and social impact of the reforms
supported by the operation could be very positive. Indeed, the proposed DPL will complement
the robust social protection network built up by the Federal Government in the last years.
Improved public service delivery in education, health and access to basic infrastructure provided
by the State Government will, as a result of the improvement of public finances, reinforce the
gains derived from the federal conditional cash transfers programs.
204. Federal direct transfers to individuals benefit a large part of Alagoas's population.
Almost 350 thousand families or 47 percent of Alagoas families are beneficiaries of the Bolsa
Familia. Figure 19 shows the incidence of the program by municipality. More than 50 percent of
families in 80 municipalities (out of the 101 municipalities in the state) are Bolsa Familia
beneficiaries. The average benefit per month is about R$80 which represents a significant part of
the population's income, especially in poor municipalities.

205. Other Federal Government direct transfers to the population are even larger than Bolsa
Familia and target other vulnerable population segments. The Beneficio de Prestacao Continuada
(BPC) benefits poor elderly and handicapped people regardless of their contributions to the
social security system. The Rural Pension is another social security transfer for rural workers that
were not covered by the general social security system (RGPS).

206. As mentioned above, the expansion of these federal cash transfer programs has been
decisive for the poverty and income inequality reduction observed in the last years. Currently,
the social protection network has been effective in protecting the low income population from
the effects of the financial crisis. Furthermore, the State fiscal adjustment supported by this loan
will not affect negatively the poor as they are protected by the Federal Government's social
protection network.

207. The reforms supported by the loan will bring gains for low income groups. In fact, over
the last decade Brazil has experienced a significant increase in school enrollment, reduction of
illiteracy, improvement in health indicators and increased access to basic infrastructure by low
income groups. In order for this progress in reducing poverty and income inequality to be
sustained in the medium and long run, it is critical to increase the coverage and quality of
                                                                69
education and health services as well as the access of the poor to basic infrastructure services, all
of which are mainly provided through the State Government.
208. To the extent that the policy reforms supported by the proposed operation will increase
the GoA's fiscal space for increasing investments as well as enhance the efficiency of public
expenditures, it should have a positive indirect impact on the State's ability to increase access to
and the quality of social and infrastructure services.

209. Improvements in the coverage and quality of state-provided social services would benefit
disproportionately the poor. As noted in Figure 20, low income groups (to the left on the income
distribution axis) have lower education indicators and are the predominant users of public
education and health services. Less than 20 percent and 10 percent of the first three quintiles of
income distribution have completed primary and secondary education, respectively. Public
schools are attended by about 40 percent of the low income groups compared to about 10 percent
of high income groups which rely to a much larger extent on private schools. The same pattern is
observed for public and private health services, which are used predominantly respectively by
low and high income groups. Only high income groups have health plans provided by the private

                                                                     70
sector and public entities (e.g civil service employees have health plans financed by the public
sector entities in which they are employed).
210. To illustrate the potential pro-poor effects of improvements in both fiscal sustainability
and the quality of public services, Figure 21 shows the increase, by percentile of the income
distribution, in the outreach of public programs in the areas of water, sanitation, electricity and
garbage collection between 1992 and 2007. All income groups benefited from the expansion of
these public services. However, low income groups with a history of very low access to these
services experienced relatively larger gains. Despite these gains, inequality in the access to
public services remains significant. Higher income groups have high levels of access (e.g about
90 percent of the top quintile group has access to water and garbage collection) while low
income groups have reduced access (60 percent). Therefore, further expansion in public services
and improved coverage should mainly benefit the poorer groups with relatively low coverage
ratios. Again, improving public services and especially sanitation and water supply depend on
State Government investments. Hence, the creation of fiscal space for State investments -
supported by the loan - will likely have disproportionately indirect positive effects on the poor,
who have much lower access indicators.
211. Despite these indirect positive social effects, it is worth noting that the reforms supported
by the DPL could be viewed as hurting public employees and thus face some opposition from
civil service unions. On this regard, it is important to note that most of the reforms would affect
only newcomers and not current public servants. Moreover, state public servants are found
among the medium to high income groups. About 77 percent of civil service staff are among the
first two top quintiles of the income distribution while only 8 percent of them have a monthly
income below the poverty line of R$126. A similar situation is observed for pensioners and
survivors (see Table 16 below).

                 Table 17: Income Distribution of Households Head by Civil Service Staff, 2007

212. But even if the human resource management and social security reforms supported by the
DPL could reduce the rate of income growth of some of these public servants, they should not
cause them to experience nominal nor real reductions in income levels. More important, as
reforms are intended at guaranteeing the medium and long term solvency of the State, they
should increase its ability to meet future salary and social security pension obligations.
213. To further assess the social impact of the policies supported by the DPL, the Bank will
prepare in the context of its supervision activities a stakeholder assessment to understand the
view of the different actors involved in the reforms and assess their interests and potential
reactions to the reform agenda. It must be noted, however, that the definition of the GoA's
                                               71
development priorities, as embodied in the PPA, reflects not only rigorous technical analyses but
also a genuinely participatory process of decision making defined in the State's constitution. In
particular, the preparation of the State Multi-Year Plan (PPA), Budgetary Guidelines Law (LDO)
and Annual Budget Law (LOA) included the organization of public consultation sessions. As
described in Box 2, the preparation of the PPA 2008-2011 encompassed the organization of
seventeen workshops to discuss the sectoral and regional dimensions of the multi-year
investment program. The corresponding government initiatives are regularly and extensively
discussed by the State Assembly.46
214. The state's participatory/consultative mechanisms were also present in the program
design phases when the state government presented to the Bank a plan for public discussion of
the program to be supported by the proposed DPL.


IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

215. The Secretariat of Finance (SEFAZ) will be responsible for the overall implementation of
the proposed operation and for reporting progress and coordinating its actions with the
Secretariats of Planning and Budget (SEPLAN) and Public Management (SEGESP). There will
be two essential tasks: (i) providing evidence justifying the first and second disbursements, and
(ii) overseeing and reporting progress towards completion of the second disbursement conditions
including tracking individual conditions and facilitating the timely contracting and/or carrying
out of the studies and activities required for meeting these conditions.
216. The Bank will vet the prior conditions for the first disbursement. The timing of this
disbursement will depend upon the GoA's ability to provide the Bank with evidence satisfactory
to the Bank that the conditions have been met. While most of these conditions have been
addressed already during project preparation, it will still be the responsibility of SEFAZ to
present the information in a timely manner and format satisfactory to the Bank.
217. Similarly, SEFAZ will be responsible for marshalling the information necessary to
demonstrate that the GoA has met satisfactorily the second tranche conditions and covenants. In
the event that one or more conditions are not met or partially met SEFAZ will take the lead in
identifying and explaining causes and determining what, if anything can be done to mitigate the
corresponding risks.
218. A Project Implementation Committee comprising officials of the three State agencies
directly involved in the policy reform agenda supported by the DPL will be identified to monitor
project implementation including all technical assistance activities essential for its
implementation.


FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

219. In general, public financial management (PFM) systems in Brazil are adequate for DPL
lending.

Foreign Exchange Control Environment

220. The IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank of Brazil done in October 2002 and
updated in March 2004 concluded that the Central Bank (BCB) does not present widespread
vulnerabilities that could compromise the safeguarding of Fund resources. In particular, its audit
is conducted by an internationally recognized audit firm, while its internal audit function
contributes effectively to internal control systems.
221. As the IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank has not been updated in recent
years, the Bank reviewed the comparative Financial Statements of the Central Bank for the years
ended in December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, including the Explanatory Notes to the financial
statements and the independent auditors' report that included an unqualified (clean) opinion on
the financial statements for all years. The financial statements for all years were prepared in
accordance to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), three years before the transition deadline date established
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários ­ CVM)
Instruction 457 and the CB's Rule No. 14.259.
222. The Explanatory Notes, an integral part of the Financial Statements, provide an extensive
explanation of the Central Bank's risk management policies, including those related to financial
instruments held to manage the international reserves. In relation to operational risks, the Notes
state that the Central Bank "uses internal control systems, which are considered adequate for its
activities."
223. Based on the above, the control environment, procedures and regulations governing the
Central Bank's operations within which the foreign exchange from the operation would flow are
considered adequate.

Public Financial Management of Budget Resources

224. The Good Practices Note on Financial Management Issues in Developing Policy
Operations states that "No minimum standard of public financial management has been
established which may be used as a precondition for development policy lending. Development
policy operations could be provided in a country that has a weak public financial management
environment but has committed itself to an adequate program of public financial management
and there is reasonable evidence that improvements are occurring in a timely manner. Improved
PFM performance may indeed be an outcome, rather than a precondition, of development policy
lending."
225. The Bank carried out a Budgetary and Financial Management Systems Assessment,
review of external auditor opinions and other diagnostic review work of the State's PFM
(medium-term planning, budget, treasury, accounting, debt, funding agreements ­"convênios",
internal controls and internal audit) with the assistance of a consultant. This review revealed that
the State of Alagoas is emerging from weak public financial management inherited from
previous administrations. On average, the State was evaluated solidly in the middle of B and C
scores in PFM areas evaluated. Despite continuing weaknesses, the State has shown significant
commitment to an adequate program of public financial management evidenced by substantive

                                                73
improvements that result in acceptable risk levels and justify the operation. These improvements
include:
       ·   Maintenance of a core group of competent and committed financial managers;
       ·   Completion of an independent payroll audit and procurement of a new personnel and
           payroll management system;
       ·   An independent and active internal audit function whose work is supported and
           integrated with the Federal General Controller (Controladoria Geral da União-
           CGU);
       ·   Strengthening of internal controls over convenios (financing agreements) and;
       ·   Implementation of numerous accounting and revenue collection controls.
226. Desirable improvements are still needed but notable progress is being made. The Bank
identified and discussed with State Finance officials opportunities for PFM improvements during
preparation of the DPL operation and will support selected elements of the State's PFM reform
agenda through DPL disbursement conditions such as the satisfactory implementation of the
action plan for the strengthening of the planning, budgeting, financial execution and internal
control phases.


DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

227. Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that the loan is available for withdrawal,
the Borrower may submit a withdrawal application so that the proceeds of the loan would be
deposited by the Bank into a local currency (Brazilian Real) account of the State Treasury,
established at the Caixa Economica Federal - CEF, controlled by the federal government and one
of the largest national banks, for the Borrower's use. The exchange transaction is expected to be
done through the Central Bank of Brazil.
228. The Bank will disburse the two tranches of the loan proceeds into an account of the
Central Bank denominated in USD, which forms part of the country's official foreign exchange
reserves. The Central Bank will immediately credit the disbursed amounts to the State's Single
Treasury Account, thus becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures. The National
Treasury will then provide the Bank a written confirmation of the transaction. The same
disbursement procedure will be followed for both tranches.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

229. The specific actions supported under the proposed DPL are not likely to have significant
positive or negative effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources.
The loan comprises four components, all having to do with fiscal management and public sector
management reform. There are no conditions that may trigger environmental concerns or that
may affect environmental laws and regulations, their enforcement or associated organizational
framework in Alagoas.




                                               74
RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

230. The risks associated with this operation are considerable namely: i) government
ownership and political economy of reforms; ii) reform continuity; iii) low technical and
institutional capacity; and iv) fiscal deterioration due to the financial crisis.
231. Government ownership and political economy of reforms: reforms are likely to be
opposed by certain entrenched political interests. Public employee unions, in particular, are
powerful and have responded to previous efforts to reduce payroll costs with extended strikes.
Nonetheless, the current political environment is favorable. The current administration is
strongly committed to reform. This is evident in the Governor's response to the fiscal crisis he
inherited and by his active support for this project. The broader political environment also favors
reform. States to the south (e.g., Minas Gerais) and northeastern neighbors to Alagoas (e.g.,
Ceara, Sergipe, Pernambuco) have successfully undertaken major programs of state reform.
Their administrations have been rewarded by the voters. Popular opinion in Alagoas increasingly
expects better governance and can be expected to reward politicians who achieve it.
Furthermore, the operation is strongly supported by the Federal Government.
232. The timetable for reform is also short. The current term of the Governor ends in two
years. While the Governor can run for re-election, there is no guarantee that he will prevail.
Reforms must therefore be implemented quickly and must be difficult to reverse. The policy
measures supported by the project have been designed to lock in reforms while remaining
technically and politically feasible within the term of the present administration. Most of the
reforms are procedural and administrative and are likely to be self-sustaining. In addition, the
project is strategically tranched. Several of the most politically sensitive reforms are included
among the first tranche conditions, requiring them to be completed while the project has
maximum fiscal leverage; i.e., before any funds are released. While a second tranche is required
to permit more time-consuming conditions to be met, conditions for second tranche disbursement
will be clearly specified in the project matrix and are mostly follow up measures likely to be
implemented during the current administration term.
233. The technical capacity of the State bureaucracy is weak. Lack of a professionalized civil
service complicates the design and implementation of public policies. Nonetheless, during
project preparation intense technical assistance advice was provided by the Bank team.
Moreover, capacity building activities are being institutionalized in government programs whose
funding is a prior condition for this operation. Those capacity building activities cover critical
areas such as human resource management, social security and investment management.
234. Impact of the financial crisis on GoA's public finances. There is considerable risk that the
fiscal repercussions of the global economic crisis could offset the gains made in the last two
years. In 2009, revenues have experienced a strong fall, specially the transfers from the Federal
Government that are the most important revenue source. The State administration is trying to
attenuate the fall in transfers through a stronger own tax collection effort and the improvement in
the recovery of tax arrears. The Federal Government is also creating financing mechanisms to
compensate for the fall of its transfers to the states. Nonetheless, falling revenues may require
further adjustment on the expenditure side. The fiscal performance of the State will therefore be
closely monitored throughout the disbursement period and the need for further adjustments in
order to meet the project's fiscal targets will be regularly discussed with the Government. In


                                                75
timing the reforms to fall within the term of the present administration, the project design ensures
that reforms do not depend upon political continuity.
235. Finally, it is worth mentioning that fiscal risks are also limited by the strict the sub-
national fiscal discipline framework. The hard budget constraint imposed by the Federal
Government also provides an impetus for reform. The debt ceilings imposed by the Fiscal
Responsibility Law, STN's relentless enforcement of the PAFs, and the near-absence of
discretionary transfers in Brazil's system of intergovernmental fiscal relations limit the State's
ability to `borrow its way' out of future financial difficulties. This creates strong incentives for
maintaining the current government's commitment to the reforms supported by the proposed
operation.

ANNEX 1: MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK: THE GLOBAL CRISIS EFFECTS ON
THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY

 A1.1 Despite its increased resilience, the global financial crisis has hit Brazil hard. The impacts
of the global downturn in the Brazilian economy can be divided into three according to their
timing and sectors that affected. First round effects encompassed contagion in financial markets,
fall in commodity prices, exchange rate depreciation, external credit curtailment and a liquidity
squeeze for Brazilian firms. From September through December, 2008 the Sao Paulo Stock
Market Index (Ibovespa) stock market fell 32 percent, sovereign spreads increased by 78 percent,
the main Brazilian commodity exports prices fell by more than 30 percent and the BRL
depreciated by 35%. Such movements reflected increasing risk aversion that affected worldwide
markets, deep slowdown in economic activity of developed countries, relevance of commodity
stocks in Ibovespa, and the fact that the BRL is a commodity currency (correlated with global
economic activity). (see Figure A1.1 below)

A1.2 Access to external and domestic credit markets was strongly constrained, especially for
small financial institutions and medium and small firms. External credit for exporters and small
banks practically vanished. Domestically, the overall volume of credit to the private sector fell
sharply. The Government reacted promptly to alleviate the liquidity squeeze. The BCB adopted
different measures to inject liquidity into domestic markets and provide foreign exchange to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          77

liquidity provision support to small financial institutions in difficulties, incentives to large
financial institutions to buy smaller ones with liquidity problems, repo-credit line auctions in
dollars for exporters, sales of international reserves to irrigate the spot exchange rate were all
used to alleviate private sector difficulties in raising resources in domestic and foreign markets
and avoiding deeper exchange rate depreciation. In addition, public banks increased massively
their lending to industry and agriculture to compensate for the fall in private credit supply. The
Government's quick reaction has been successful in normalizing credit market conditions in a
short period of time. Domestic credit and access to foreign credit have returned to the pre-crisis
levels.
A1.3 Effects on the external sector were also sharp but again temporary. The fall in commodity
prices and the worldwide economic slowdown led to a decline in exports from a monthly average
of US$18 billion in Q3, 2008 to less than U$S10 billion in Q1, 2009. As a consequence, for the
first time in seven years, the trade balance was negative in January, 2009. Nonetheless, the
domestic economic deceleration reduced imports downward and the trade balance returned to
positive. The nominal and real exchange rates and terms of trade experienced a temporary
depreciation that was reverted with the increase in commodity prices and the reduction of risk
aversion in financial markets confirming the strong correlation between commodity prices and

A1.4 Second round effects were also quite strong and were felt immediately in the real
economy. The financial turmoil interrupted 21 consecutive quarters of GDP expansion (from Q2,
2003 to Q3, 2008). Indeed, Brazilian GDP contracted in Q4, 2008 by 3.7 percent (qoq) and in
Q1, 2009 by 0.8 (qoq). The strong drop in investment has been the main driver for the GDP
slowdown as consumption continued to grow having a positive contribution to GDP growth and
the external sector contribution to growth was neutral. Accordingly, industrial production
(especially capital goods and car vehicle production), plummeted by 16 percent from September
to March 2009. Industrial capacity utilization fell from 87 percent in September to 78 percent in
March 2009, while unemployment rose from 7.6 percent in September, 2008 to 9 percent in
March, 2009. Market GDP growth forecasts were revised downward from a positive 2 percent in
December-January to a negative 0.5 to 1.5 percent in May-June. (see Figure A1.3 below)
A1.5 The economic slowdown and the fall in commodity prices also lessened pressures on
inflation and opened space for monetary easing. Twelve month accumulated inflation fell from
6.3 in September 2008 to 5.5 in March 2009 and hit the center of the Central Bank target zone at
4.5 in July, 2009. Inflation expectations for 2009 fell from 5.5 percent in September 2008 to 4.5
percent in March and to 4.3 in July 2009. Consistent with the inflation targeting regime, and
drawing on the credibility earned in the last decade, the Central Bank initiated a consistent
interest rate reduction cycle from 13.75 percent in December, 2008 to 11.25 percent in March,
2009 and to 8.75 percent in July, 2009 (its historical lowest level).

A1.6 Third round effects are related to the accentuated deterioration of public finances and
government policy reactions. The sharp fall in revenues during the first semester of 2009 and the
aggressive expansionary impulse adopted by the government resulted in the reduction of the
primary surplus which decreased to 2.4 percent of GDP in January-June, 2009 from 5.9 percent
of GDP in the same period in 2008. In spite of the strong reduction of interest rates that reduced
interest payments on public debt that fell to 5.5 percent of GDP in January-June, 2009 from 6.4
percent of GDP in the same period of 2008, the total deficit increased to 3 percent of GDP in
January-June, 2009 from 0.5 percent of GDP in the same period in 2008. As a result, net public
debt grew from 41 percent in June, 2008 to 43 percent in June, 2009. (see Figure A1.4 below)

A1.7 The reduction of the government primary balance resulted from the strong fall in
government tax revenues, the functioning of automatic stabilizers (such as the unemployment
insurance and income tax) as well as government expenditures increase. Table A1.1 shows the
Federal Government's primary balance deterioration and its main drivers in the first semester of
2009. The primary balance fell to 1.3 percent in January-June, 2009 from 4.4 percent in the same
period in 2008, a drop of 71 percent. Federal Government revenues decline responded for 39
percent of the primary surplus fall while government expenditures growth responded for 61
percent of this fall. The contribution of recurrent expenses was 57 percent while the increase in
government investments was responsible for 4 percent of the primary balance reduction47.
A1.8 The contribution of reversible countercyclical fiscal stimulus has been limited. Adding
up, the income tax and the federal VAT on industrial products (whose rates have been reduced to
foster industrial activity), unemployment insurance and investment expenses, the countercyclical
stimulus amounted to 1.1 percent of GDP being responsible for only 33 percent of the primary
balance decline. The remaining 2 percent primary balance decline that respond for 67 percent of
this fall corresponded to increases in recurrent expenses (personnel expenditures and government
consumption) and to the fall in other indirect tax revenues (that can be attributed to the economic
activity slowdown).

A1.9 The main instrument of government expansionary stimulus has been increased credit
supply from public financial institutions. It is estimated that the quasi-fiscal stimulus through
increased lending from public banks reached 3 percent of GDP. In fact, credit by public banks
grew 25 percent since September, 2008 while credit form private institutions grew only 3
percent. The expansion of finance from public banks included credit to exporters, for working
capital, to the agricultural sector, for housing and for durable goods consumption. As a result, the
share of public banks in total outstanding credit grew to 39 percent in June, 2009 from 34 percent
in September, 2008. In addition to the expansion of public institutions' credit supply,
government has also stimulated large private banks to increase their participation in the market.
In the aftermath of the crisis, government induced large banks to acquire smaller institutions
facing liquidity problems. As a result, an increasing role of public banks and a strong
concentration in the financial sector have also resulted from the financial turmoil. While the
expansionary stimulus by public banks seems to be efficient in restoring credit supply, this
stimulus could have pervasive effects on the balance sheet of the public financial institutions and
that contingent liabilities may appear in the future.
A1.10 Strong monetary easing, expansion of credit supply from public banks, tax breaks for
durables consumption and recovery of commodity prices seem to have smoothed the economic
downturn. Furthermore, consistent recovery signals in Q2, 2009 in economic activity,
                                           82
unemployment and labor income indicate that GDP decline in 2009 will be less accentuated than
expected and should be followed by a strong acceleration in 2010. Market forecasts for growth in
2009 and 2010 are -0.4 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.
A1.11 Financial markets are also exhibiting a robust recovery. From January to July, 2009
sovereign spreads fell by 42 percent, Ibovespa stock market index grew by 45 percent recovering
its pre-crisis levels while the Brazilian Real appreciated 20 percent in 2009. The recovery of
commodity prices should be accompanied by exports growth and improvements in the trade
balance. Current account deficit in 2009, should be smaller than that observed in 2008 and, given
the strong expected GDP growth and the BRL appreciation should worsen in 2010. In 2009, FDI
flows have been higher than the current account deficit. The financing of higher current account
deficits in the medium term, to a great extent depends on how FDI performs. Nonetheless the
solid external position of Brazil and the flexible exchange rate should allow the Brazilian
economy to sustain a robust growth rate in the coming years.
A1.12 In this context, two scenarios with growth rates of 0 percent (scenario A) and -1.5 percent
(scenario B) in 2009 are presented in A1.2 below. Growth assumptions for 2010 and 2011 are the
same and depict a gradual growth recovery to 3.5 percent in 2010 and 4 percent for 2011.
A1.13 In summary, the solid macroeconomic fundamentals built in the last decade have allowed
the country to smooth the effects of the financial turmoil with relative speed. Government has
been using its enhanced fiscal and external solvency and its credibility to adopt expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies. As the more intense effects of the crisis lose force and normality
returns, Brazil still faces the same macroeconomic challenges of the pre-crisis period.
Furthermore, medium term effects of the crisis and of some policy reactions that have been
adopted to weather the effects of the crisis could prejudice country growth.
A1.14 The most important issue is the fiscal agenda. While the fall in the primary surplus should
not put at risk fiscal solvency, the irreversible nature of the fiscal stimulus will accentuate the
already high expenditure rigidity. With a higher level of recurrent mandatory expenses, fiscal
policy options to resume the declining path of indebtedness will be restricted to further increases
in taxation and lower levels of investments adversely effecting growth conditions. In addition,
the irreversible fiscal stimulus would prejudice long run interest rates and private investments.
A1.15 The resumption of key structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of the country is
another challenge that did not change with the crisis. This is the case of credit markets
deepening, labor market reform and increasing the openness of the country. In this regard, while
the strict regulation of financial markets, the low leverage of financial institutions and the large
participation of public banks attenuated the effects of the worldwide credit squeeze, the
development of capital markets would require liberalization of credit markets, reduction of
public banks' subsidized credit and increased private sector participation. Similar observations
can be applied to reforms in labor markets and openness. The stricter regulation of labor markets
could avoid a sharper increase in unemployment while the inherent dynamism and size of
domestic markets may have alleviated the economic slump provoked by the financial crisis.
Nonetheless, a more flexible labor market and an increased competitiveness in international trade

ANNEX 3: FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS AND DPL PROGRAM IMPACTS

1. INTRODUCTION

A3.1 The fiscal situation of Alagoas is widely recognized as among one of the most difficult in
Brazil. Up to December 2008, Alagoas was one of the two outliers whose debt indicators fail to
meet the conditions set forth in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidad Fiscal,
LRF) (Rio Grande do Sul has been the other). Alagoas had difficulty meeting its fixed spending
obligations, such as personnel expenditures, civil service social security benefits and debt
servicing. As in other states, high indebtedness led Alagoas to require three debt refinancing
operations from the federal government between 1989 and 1997.
A3.2 The 1997 debt refinancing operation has been accompanied by a three year rolling fiscal
adjustment program (PAF) with specific actions and targets focused on all major parameters of
fiscal performance. The State of Alagoas signed its initial restructuring agreement in 1998. After
the debt renegotiation contracts were signed with the National Treasury Secretariat in 1997 and
especially following the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2000, which created the
conditions for the presence of hard budget constraints, Alagoas was obligated to adopt a severe
fiscal adjustment.
A3.3 The adjustment has been due largely to the fact that GOA' access to borrowing sources
had by then been practically eliminated. Without any access to credit since 2000, GoA has
confronted a permanent impending fiscal crisis characterized by extreme difficulties to
accomplish the targets of the Fiscal Adjustment programs agreed with the National Treasury
Secretariat, very low investment spending, and increasing dependence on federal capital transfers
to finance some investments.
A3.4 High personnel expenditures, social security deficits and burdensome debt payments have
crippled the state's ability to invest in and support the growth of its economy, which in turn led
to lower revenues and a more adverse debt dynamics that jeopardized the fiscal adjustment
efforts. The hard fiscal constraints faced by GoA have choked off initiatives to promote
economic development and poverty reduction, leading to a downward spiral of weaker public
services and missed growth opportunities.
A3.5 The challenge to turn this situation around is at the core of the new government's
program for fiscal adjustment and reform. Indeed, during the first two years of the current
administration, the difficult fiscal situation was partially alleviated by the good revenue
performance, reduction of operating costs and further investment expense cuts. Nonetheless,
strong expenditure rigidities, have limited the scope of a more decisive fiscal adjustment.
A3.6 The program supported by the proposed DPL aims at weathering the structural forces
behind the chronic fiscal disequilibria. Along these lines, measures directed to increase the
efficiency of tax collection, to control personnel expenditures and to reduce social security
deficit would both guarantee the sustainability of the current fiscal adjustment effort and open
fiscal space for government investments.

2. ALAGOAS FISCAL SITUATION: 2003-2008


2.1 Evolution of Fiscal Balances, 2003-2008
A3.7 In the last years, Alagoas fiscal balances have experienced a strong improvement. Since
2003, gross operating and primary balances increased significantly and net lending has been
positive. This adjustment effort has been deepened since 2007 with increasing operating balances
(they grew from 14 percent of net current revenues in 2006 to 21 percent of net current revenues
in 2008). From 2006 to 2007, primary surplus jumped from R$361 million to R$675 million.
Even more important, the generation of large operating balances allowed the Government of
Alagoas (GOA) to expand investments in 2008 (they reached 10 percent of net current revenue)
while maintaining robust primary balances and maintaining positive net lending superior to 10
percent of net current revenues (See Table 3A.1)

A3.8 An impressive revenue growth performance has been the main responsible for the GoA's
fiscal balances improvement. Between 2006 and 2008, they presented an accumulated real

                                                      96
growth of 21 percent while expenditures grew by 16 percent during the same period. As a result,
GoA's gross operating balance which corresponds to the current account saving including the
capital revenue transfers, recorded an increase of 58 percent during 2006-08.

                  Figure 3A. 1: GoA Fiscal Balances, 2003-2008 (Millions of 2008 Reais)




A3.9 The increase in operating balance broadened the space for investments. After the strong
cut in 2007, GoA's investments more than doubled between 2007 and 2008, while primary
surplus has been maintained above 10 percent of net current revenues. As a result, primary
surplus and net lending declined slightly when compared with their 2007 levels but still
significantly higher than the levels observed in previous years.

2.2 Evolution of Fiscal Revenues, 2003-2008
A3.10 From 2003 to 2008, state revenues grew by 56 percent in real terms. In this period,
GoA's fiscal revenues trajectory can be divided into two periods. The first period would be from
2003 to 2006 and the other would be 2007 to 2008 when GoA's revenue growth accelerated.
From 2003 to 2006 GoA's revenues annual growth was 6 percent while in the last two years the
growth rate increased to 10 percent.
A3.11 Transfers from federal government have been the most important driver of this growth.
Fostered by the national economic activity acceleration in 2006-2008 the federal tax revenue
sharing transfers to the state increased by 11 percent per year. Better regional growth
performance as well as the stringent measures taken to improve taxpayers' compliance resulted
in state tax collection annual growth of 5.5 percent in the same period (See 34A.2).

A3.12 The better performance of federal transfers compared to the one observed for tax
revenues, accentuated the dependence of GoA's public finance on transfers. In average tax
revenue transfers represented about 50% of state revenues while GoA's own tax collection
accounted for 40%. In the last year the share of transfers increased to 54 percent while own tax
revenue represented 38 percent of total revenues. (See Figure 3A.3).

                                                      98
A3.13 In addition, in recent years, the dependence on federal transfers has been deepened as
capital transfers from the Federal Government became the most important financing source of
GoA investment programs in a context of reduced access to credit and low capacity to generate
current savings.

2.3 Evolution of Fiscal Expenditures, 2003-2008
A3.14 During the period 2003-2008, total expenses increased by 45% driven by the personnel
expenditures which grew by 53% while social security benefits grew by 60% in overall.
Expenses followed a similar pattern than the observed at the revenue side. From 2003 to 2006,
expenses grew at 6 percent per year, while between 2006 and 2008, expenditure growth
accelerated to 7.6 percent.
A3.15 This pattern was defined by the evolution of personnel expenses and social security
benefits, the most important expenditure categories. From 2003 to 2006, both categories annually
grew by about 6 percent while their annual growth increased to 11 percent in the last two years.
The reason for the personnel expenditures growth acceleration was the concession of large salary
increases by the previous administration that began to be applied in the term of the new
administration. Despite the government's resistance to validate the salary adjustments granted by
the previous administration, the negotiated chronogram of salary adjustments over 2007 and
2008 resulted in the acceleration of personnel expenses growth. As social security benefits are
indexed to salary adjustment for the active civil service, a similar increase has been observed for
pensions expenses (See Table 3A.3).
A3.16 In terms of their composition, GoA current expenditures represent in average 91% of
total expenses. Among the current expenses, the compensation of employees is the bigger

                                                  99
component accounting in average for 42 percent followed by both pensions and the use of goods
and services at 19 percent. (See Figure 3A.4).

A3.17 Other expenses that are not controlled by the state government such as revenue sharing
transfers to municipalities grew by 66% from 2003 to 2008. Interest payments and debt
amortization (transactions in financial assets in table 13) are also other obligations not controlled
by GoA and they represent about 14 percent of government expenses. Summing up personnel
expenses, pensions, transfers to municipalities and debt service, obligatory spending represents
in average more than 80 percent of total expenditures and about 75 percent of GoA's revenue.
A3.18 Where the GoA could assert control it obtained good results. For instance in 2006-2008,
the strict control of operating expenses resulted in a reduction of 5 percent. On the negative side,
GoA recent fiscal adjustment resulted in an unavoidable sharp reduction in 2007 investment
expenditures followed by a strong recovery as fiscal conditions improved in 2008. In fact,
investment expenses seem to be the adjustment variable at the expenditure side.

3. ­ EVOLUTION OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT: 2003-2008


A3.19 From 2003 to 2008 Alagoas consolidated debt increased by 20 percent in real terms in a
period where new borrowing has been practically eliminated. Most of the increase (78%) was
due to the evolution of the state debt with the National Treasury Secretariat, the so called
intralimite debt, which in average represented more than 90% of the consolidated debt stock.
A3.20 The origin of this debt was refinancing agreements between federal government and state
governments.49 The increase in the state indebtedness with the federal government has two main
causes. The first is the index used to correct the debt stock: the General Price Index (IGP). The
use of the General Price Index (IGP) to correct the debt balances has been the main factor for
debt accumulation. This index is much more influenced by exchange rate changes than consumer
price indexes. While the exchange rate appreciated by 35 percent from 2003 to 2008, the
General Price Index during this period increased by 56 percent and the consumer price index ­
IPCA ­ increased by 33 percent.
A3.21 The ceiling on debt service has been other factor behind debt accumulation. Debt service
from the refinancing agreement of 1997 should be below 15% of net real revenue (this is why



49
   Brazil's federal government set up three bailout operations in ten years, reflecting the weak fiscal discipline of
state governments. In 1989 the federal government assumed R$ 10.5 billion of state's external debt which
represented 1.4% of GDP. In 1993, the National Treasury assumed R$ 40 bi or 7.2% of GDP of state's debt with
federal financial institutions. Finally, in 1997, the federal government restructured state's bond debt by R$ 87 bi or
11.7% of GDP. (for more detailed information, see Bevilaqua, 1999)
                                                        101
this debt is called intralimite debt).50 Any intralimite debt service above this limit is
automatically incorporated into the debt stock. It is worth to mention that Alagoas pays an
interest rate of 7.5 percent (plus the IGP debt stock correction) while other states pay 6 percent
(plus the IGP debt stock correction), therefore, debt dynamics is more adverse for Alagoas. In
fact, given the high debt, high interest rates and debt correction above inflation, Alagoas has
been capitalizing interest payments as they were always superior to 15 percent of GoA net real
revenues. This explains why, even in the absence of large new credit operations, the debt stock
has grown.
A3.22 The other part of the GoA debt is the extralimite debt that encompasses small debts
including the external one. In the last years, the extralimite debt increased basically because the
debt with the federal social security system has strongly increased. This debt is being generated
by indirect administration entities that did not contribute to the general social security system and
that needed to be recognized by the state government. Debt with federal banks (BNDES and
Caixa Economica Federal) has been constant. External debt was eliminated as the state did not
have access to new borrowing operations.

   Net real revenue is sum of current and capital revenues excluded: FUNDEF transfers, credit operation revenues,
asset sales revenues, capital transfers, constitutional transfers to municipalities and the SUS revenues. The concept is
different than the net current revenue that it is used by the Fiscal responsibility law. The difference is the coverage.
Net real revenue refers to the revenues collected by state treasury account (direct administration), while the net
current revenue refers to the consolidated public sector.

         term obligations is negative


A3.23 At present, net consolidated debt amounts R$7 billion representing 1.97 times the state
net current revenue. Actually, Alagoas net consolidated debt to net current revenue fell from 277
percent in 2003 to 197 percent of net current revenues in 2008 and to 1.85 in August 2009. As a
consequence--and for the first time since the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2000,
Alagoas is in compliance with the declining path of indebtedness requirement. Furthermore, it
has already reached the level of 2.0, seven years earlier than the cut-off date of 2015 established
by the FRL. Up to 2008, Alagoas had been one the two outliers whose debt indicators fail to
meet the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) requirements since its enactment in 2000 (Rio Grande
do Sul is the other). The reduction in its indebtedness and its compliance with the FRL debt limit
have led the National Treasury Secretariat to authorize Alagoas to contract the World Bank
operation --its first credit operation in the current decade.51

4. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW

A3.24 GOA has met only partially with the Fiscal Responsibility Law key indicator
requirements since its enactment in 2000, mainly because of its high level of debt, debt service
payments and personnel expenses. The reduction of net consolidated debt to net current revenue
from 277 percent in 2003 to 197 percent in 2008, has allowed Alagoas to comply with the fiscal

51
  The Federal Senate Resolution 40/2001, complying with the Fiscal Responsibility Law, established a ceiling for
net consolidated debt to net current revenues of 2.0 for state governments. For states that were above this ceiling in
2000, the Resolution mandated an adjustment to the ceiling in fifteen years. In 2015 all states should have a net
consolidated debt to net current revenue ratio inferior to 2.0.

responsibility law. Nonetheless, the state is far from reaching the FRL target on debt service in
relation to net current revenues. Debt service payments to NCR has been varying between 13
and 14 percent between 2003 and 2008, above the target of 11.5 percent of NCR reflecting that
high indebtedness obligations continues to restrict new borrowing operations.
A3.25 According to its own estimates, the state has been mostly in compliance with the other
indicators of the FRL. The personnel expenditures to net current revenue ratio, which under the
Fiscal Responsibility Law should be inferior to 60 percent, declined from 66 percent in 2003 to
56 percent in 2008. It is important to note here that the figures compiled by the State may be
underestimated as personnel expenditures do not include, severance payments, payments derived
from judicial decisions, payments derived from past fiscal years, certain fringe benefits, among
others. Inaccuracy is also likely in the personnel expenses reported by the different branches. In
any case, the figures presented in the Table below show that Alagoas has serious difficulties in
maintain personnel expenses below the FRL ceilings.
A3.26 Given the lack of access to credit operations, new borrowing as a proportion of the net
current revenue has been almost 0, therefore, the FRL constraint in credit operations has not been
binding for Alagoas.

5. THE IMPACT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ON GoA's FISCAL SITUATION


A3.27 The financial crisis has been strongly impacted GoA's finances. While regional economic
activity has not been too affected by the worldwide economic slowdown, the transmission
mechanism of the crisis to Alagoas is through the decline of Federal Government transfers to the
State. Federal revenues suffered a strong fall that has been accentuated by its countercyclical
policy of tax breaks. This has affected sub-national governments that receive federal revenue-
sharing transfers. Given the high dependence of GoA on federal transfers (about 60 percent of
State revenues comes from federal transfers), the fall in Federal Government tax revenue
collection has been imposing expressive falls in GoA revenues. In fact, Figure below shows the
strong correlation between federal and national industrial activity and between Federal
Government and GoA revenues.
A3.28 In the first semester of 2009, as a result of national economic slowdown and the
countercyclical measures (tax breaks) adopted by the Federal Government, federal revenue
sharing transfers fell by 10 percent in real terms. The State VAT, the ICMS maintained a positive
growth rate of 5 percent.
A3.29 State administration is taking additional adjustment measures and accelerating the rhythm
of the reforms directed to reduce the pressure of personnel expenditures on State finances52.
First, GoA established an additional cut of 15 percent on the operating budget of State
secretariats. Second is postponing planned investments in the state that will be resumed as fiscal
conditions allow. Third, is initiating the audit of the State payroll that would bring significant
savings, initiating the revision of pensioners and survivors benefits and accelerating social
security reform. In addition, government and Bank teams prepared a set of short run options to
reduce personnel expenditures that would be used in case of revenue fall persistence. Finally, the
Federal Government is implementing a compensation support program to sub-national
governments that experienced intergovernmental transfers fall. Of course, Alagoas has been
included in this compensation package as its fiscal situation deteriorated substantially in the
previous months.
A3.30 This deterioration trend has been reflected in the assumptions for the projection exercises
performed by the Bank Team. As it is described in section VI, projections on transfers and own
revenue collection incorporate the recent fall as well as, personnel expenditures were projected
using available information on the salary adjustment already conceded and other automatic
adjustments that should be granted in 2009 and 2010.

6. PROJECTED FISCAL SITUATION: 2009-2020

A3.31 In this section, the fiscal situation of GoA will be projected in order to asses fiscal
sustainability of the state, the state's capacity to repay the Bank's loan, with and the fiscal impact
of the new policies. In addition, compliance with key indicators of the LRF will be evaluated
through time. For this, two scenarios will be depicted: first without the lending operation and
second with the World Bank lending operation.
A3.32 The first scenario was based upon the revenue and expenditure trends observed prior to
the measures taken by the government in 2007 and 2008 that are contemplated as prior actions in
the proposed lending operation. The second scenario took into account the measures adopted in
2008-09 and the actions proposed in the operation. The study projects the evolution of the
government balances, the civil service pension deficit, and the key Fiscal Responsibility Law
indicators of total debt, debt service, and personnel expenditures.
A3.33 The assumptions under the two scenarios are as follows.

A3.34 Figures 3A.8 and 3A.9 show the projected scenarios with and without reforms. The
exercise shows that revenue gains are limited and that the bulk of the adjustment relies on the
expenditure side, in particular on reduction of personnel expenses and social security deficits.
Both the Census and the Audit economies will keep Alagoas below the Fiscal Responsibility
Law ceiling for personnel expenses (at 60 percent of Net Current Revenues). The application of
the compensation rule contains the payroll increase in the medium term. Together with the gains
on the purchase of goods and services, the reforms on the expenditure side enable GoA to
expand the fiscal space for investment. Indeed investment expenditures to net current revenues
under the reform program are 2 percentage points higher than what is projected without reforms.

A3.35 Higher investment expenditures do not reduce primary and overall balances. Only in the
first year are the projected primary and overall balances lower under the reform scenario because
the Bank loan is allocated to investments. From 2010 onwards, projected fiscal balances are
higher and thus the debt reduction path is accelerated. It is worth noting that the projection for
debt services (amortization plus interest payments) reflects the prepayment of a high cost debt.
Part of the DPL proceeds will be allocated to pay this debt that amounts R$106 million and must
be paid in 2012.

A3.36 In summary, the reforms supported in this proposed DPL and agreed by the GoA will
have important impacts on guaranteeing a decreasing path for indebtedness and expanding fiscal
space for the increase of investment expenditures.

7. RISK ANALYSIS

A3.37 To take into account the uncertainty surrounding the projection of fundamental
bmacroeconomic variables such as the exchange rate, the GDP growth rate, the real interest rate
and the inflation rate a risk analysis was conducted. By doing a number of Monte-Carlo
simulations drawing shocks from specific probability distributions it was possible to simulate
simultaneous random shocks in a set of variables and their impacts on the state's financial
situation.
A3.38 The Normal distribution has been applied for simplicity, but one can easily change the
distribution choosing from a wide family of densities e.g. , Exponential, Gamma, Log-Normal,
etc--- or even boostrap the shocks from, e.g., WEO historical values. Thus, stochastic variables
are specified using the formulation:
                                     xt = x +  t ,  t ~ N (0,  2 )

A3.39 with x being the mean of the variable of interest--- e.g. , the inflation rate, the growth
rate, the real interest rate and the exchange rate. Note that  t          = 0.5 tdepreciation
                                                               inf lation
                                                                                              .
A3.40 Since these are expressed as percentages, attention must be paid to use appropriate units
in the shock specification--- e.g. , a normally-distributed shock with a standard deviation of one
percentage point will be specified as:
                                   t ~ N (0,  2 = 0.012 = 0.0001)

revenue ratio indicator.

A3.42 On a technical consideration, the probability bands display the 10, 25, 50, 75 and 90
percentiles computed from the N Monte-Carlo simulations. The interpretation of the probability
bands is as follows: in 75% of the cases, the projected value of the debt-to-NCR ratio lies below
the limit indicated by the 75% band on the vertical axes. Hence the area lying between two
bands, say the 25% and 75% probability bands, gives a range of values that can be taken by the
debt-to-NCR ratio for each year, with a given probability--in this case, with a probability of
50%, as 75% - 25% = 50%.
A3.43 Hence in our case, in 90% of the cases, the debt-to-NCR ratio projected for 2012 takes on
values lying between 165% and 185%.

8. GLOBAL CRISIS EFFECTS ON GoA FINANCES

Sensitivity Analysis (Baseline GDP growth Rate).

A3.44 The strong effects of the global crisis on GoA fiscal situation as described in section V
led to perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of different growth assumptions on GoA
fiscal sustainability. Table 3A.6 depictsdifferent growth rates that were used to simulate the
impacts o Alagoas's fiscal trends under the no-reform and reform scenario.

                                   Table 3A. 6: Growth Scenarios
                                2008       2009       2010          2011    2012       2013-2020
Baseline                          0%     -0.50%         3%         3.50%      4%           4.50%
Lower GDP Growth rate             0%     -1.50%         3%         3.50%      4%           4.50%


A3.45 Results are presented in Figures A3.11 to A3.13 below. Given the temporary nature of
the GDP growth rate shock, the trends for the main fiscal variables did not exibit significant
shifts. Of course, results show the deterioration of the scenarios withou and without reforms. The
analysis shows that from 2009 and 2011 Alagoas would return to the non-compliance of the FRL
indebtedness indicator. More important, results show that the adoption of the reforms would
guarantee a faster return to fiscal sustainability and to the compliance of the Fiscal Responsbility
Law.

Risk Analysis (Baseline GDP growth rate)

A3.46 Besides the sensitivity analysis for each variable, risk analyses were conducted to
observe simultaneous random shocks in a set of variables and their impacts on the state's
financial situation.
A3.47 A random error was added to each of the following variables: tax revenues, federal
government transfers, state government transfers, personnel expenditures and pension fund
contributions, other current expenditures (including goods and services), and the exchange
rate. For each variable, the random affects the simulations as depicted in Figures A3.14 to A3.1654.

9. FINAL REMARKS

A3.48 GOA's fiscal situation has substantially improved in the last years. The state
government presented better figures than usual for its primary, operating and overall
balances. Although fiscal adjustment has been impressive, it is worth to recognize that the
observed improvements resulted from a very good revenue performance. The recent financial
crisis has impacted negatively government revenues and GoA would need to adopt additional
measures or to accelerate the path of reforms it has been implementing to avoid a
deterioration of its public finances.
A3.49 Medium-term impacts of the reform actions already undertaken and the ones
supported by the DPL are expected to be quite positive and sustainable. Nonetheless this
annex shows that this predicted positive trend depends on continued improvements in tax
revenue collection and the reduction of personnel expenses.


METHODOLOGICAL NOTE


A3.50 The debt and fiscal sustainability analysis has been computed using Analytica
software. Using a minimal set of parameters and initial values, the model calculates useful
indicators to identify public-debt vulnerabilities and risks related to exchange-rate, inflation
and         revenue         growth        using         Monte          Carlo       simulations.
This section will first present the general framework for the fiscal and debt sustainability on
which the model is based before specifying the differents assumptions and sets of parameters
specific to the case of Alagoas.

VII.1 Fiscal and Debt Sustainability Analysis

A3.51 This part follows the exposition in E. Ley (2009) "Fiscal and External Sustainability"
(World Bank: unpublished), refer to that document for further details. Note that specificities
from the subnational case of Alagoas will be adequately highlighted throughout the section.
Time subscripts take the values t = 0,  , T . Values for the initial period, taken as given--i.e.,
not forecasted shall be denoted with a 0 subscript, e.g. , d 0 . In this note, series of values will
                                    {g }T             {g }
be denoted within brackets--- e.g. , t t =0 or simply t .


                                      Dt denote the stock of government debt let it be the
A3.52 Public Debt Dynamics ­ Let
(average) nominal interest rate and let Bt be the primary ( i.e. , non-interest) government
balance. The government budget constraint implies that the change in debt stock is driven by
                    OBt --- i.e. , the difference between total government revenues and
the overall balance
expenditures:

                                      Dt = Dt -1 - ( Bt-t
                                                    
                                                        i Dt -1 )                                      (1)
                                                      Overall balance

                                      Dt = -OBt = -( Bt - it Dt -1 )

with the overall balance being given by the primary balance net of interest payments.

A3.53 Equation (1) always holds ex-post and states that when the government is running a
surplus in the primary balance Bt > 0 , that surplus can be used to reduce the stock of existing
debt. In contrast when the primary balance is negative, Bt < 0 , new debt has to be issued to
finance the government's deficit. (For simplicity, seignorage is not explicitly addressed in
this framework.)



A3.54 Domestic debt composition ­ The stock of domestic debt Dt at time t is composed of
                      I                               E
the intra-limit debt D t and of the extra-limit debt D t
                                             Dt = D I t + D E t
                                                                           E
A3.55 Note that debt in foreign-currency are part of the extra-limit debt D t . Details on the
debt composition of Alagoas are exposed in Table 22.

A3.56 Cashflow Analysis ­ The size of gross debt issuance (or withdrawals) is determined
by the primary balance and the debt service. Debt service is defined as the sum of principal
repayments (amortization), At , and interest payments, it Dt -1 . Equivalently, gross debt
issuance is determined by the overall balance and amortizations. However, as equation (2)
shows, net change in debt, D , is determined solely by the overall balance.
A3.57 Rewriting equation (2), we obtain the debt-dynamics equation:

                               Dt = Dt -1 - OBt

                               = ( Dt1) + ( At+ t1 - )
                                  -  
                                                                                                  (2)

A3.58 The size of the gross debt issuance is important for assessing rollover risk---an
appropriate cashflow analysis can flag important vulnerabilities.
A3.59 Debt service ceiling ­ The PAF (Program of Fiscal Adjustment) sets a cap to the
intra-limit debt service of 15 percent of the State's net real revenues (NRR) debt service with
the exceeding interest being automatically capitalized and incoporated into the so-called
intra-limit residual.
                          At is then defined as a residual variable such as
A3.60 The amortization

                                  At = 0.15 * NRRt - iDtI-1                                       (3)


                                                  119
A3.61 Indexation of the debt ­ In the case of Brazil, subantional intra-limit debts are
indexed by inflation. By taking into account the amortization and the indexation of the debt
we have from Equation (3):
                                Dt = [1 +  ]( Dt -1 - At ) + ( At - OBt )                    (4)
                                      = Dt -1 +  t ( Dt -1 - At ) - OBt


A3.62 Where  t ( Dt -1 - At ) is the automatic indexation of the principal. Note that the
indexation has no effect on the gross debt issuance, but do affect the evolution in nominal
terms of the stock of debt.


A3.63 Ratios to Net Current Revenue (NCR) -- Normalizing equation (1) by NCR provides
the most important FRL indicator and by the same token gives a sense of the government's
ability to service its debt obligations. The law of motion of the government's debt-to-NCR
ratio is thus given by:

                               Dt / NCRt = (1 + it ) Dt -1 / NCRt - Bt / NCRTt
                                        (1 + it )       Dt -1     Bt
                               =                                -
                                   (1 + g t )(1 +  t )  NCRt -1  NCRt
                                                                

where gt is the growth rate of real GDP and  t is the inflation rate.


A3.64 Using lowercase symbols to denote ratios to NCR, the dynamics of the debt-to-NCR
ratio is:
                                     (1 + it )
                          dt =                      d t -1 - bt
                                (1 + g t )(1 +  t )
                                  1 + rt    
                                =1+ g       d t -1 - bt                                            (5)
                                        t   

where the real interest rate is given by r = (i -  ) ÷ (1 +  ) .

A3.65 The change in the debt-to-NCR ratio is therefore given by

                                          r - gt    
                                   d t =  t
                                          1+ g      d t -1 - bt                                    (6)
                                               t    

                                                                         d d = 0 ), the real
A3.66 From (5) it is apparent that to stabilize the debt-to-NCR ratio t ( t
interest-growth differential ( rt - g t ) must be balanced by the primary surplus/deficit. Thus,

                                                  120
when rt > g t , a primary surplus is required to achieve a non-explosive path for the debt-to-
NCR ratio.


A3.67 Debt in Foreign Currency-- When governments can borrow in foreign currency, then
                                                            h
government debt D has a domestic-denominated component D (home), and a foreign-
                         f
denominated component D :

                                     Dt = Dth + et Dt f                                           (7)


A3.68 with e being the exchange rate (price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of
domestic currency). Let us define the fraction of foreign-denominated debt as
 f = et -1 Dt f-1/Dt -1 , and, reciprocally, the fraction of domestic-denominated debt as
 h = 1 -  f . The dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio in an open economy is given by:

                                           1 + it +  t  f (1 + it f )
                                               ^
                                    dt =                              d t -1 - bt                 (8)
                                              (1 + g t )(1 +  t )


A3.69 with  t = et /et -1 being the rate of depreciation of the local currency -- i.e. ,  t > 0
means depreciation, it =  hith +  f it f being a weighted average of the domestic interest rate
                    ^
ith and the foreign interest rate it f . Particular attention must now be paid to exchange rate
movements since they may affect the debt burden, especially during sharp exchange-rate
adjustments.


VII.2 Model setting for the specific case of Alagoas

A3.70 In this section we will first expose the different policy reforms considered in our
scenarios, then we will specify the equations defining the debt sustainability analysis.

A3.71 Policy reforms ­ The policy reforms are those described in Section V and
summarized in Table 22.

A3.72 Debt dynamics ­ As mentioned above the stock of domestic debt Dt is composed of
the intra-limit debt D I t and of the extra-limit debt D E t
                                              Dt = D I t + D E t

A3.73 Note that the extra-limit debt is composed in turn by a foreign-denominated D f ,t part
                                                    E
and a domestic-denominated component Dh ,t :
                                         Dt = Dh ,t + D f ,t

A3.74 Intra-limite debt :
                                    DtI = (1 +  GPI ,t ) DtI-1 - (0.15 * NRRt - iDtI-1 )                                    (17)

A3.75 Where At = 0.15 * NRRt - iDt -1 is the amortization on the intra-limit debt. Hence if
                 I                      I


the interest payment is exceeding the threshold of 15% of NRR (i.e when
0.15 * NRRt - iDtI-1 < 0
                         ) the residual is capitalizing into the stock of intra-limit debt.

A3.76 Extra-limite debt, domestic-denominated part:

A3.77 Where OB t* is the modified overall balance defined as follow:
                                                   OBt* = OBt - 0.15 * NRRt + iDtI-1

A3.78 and AtE the principal repayment for the domestic-denominated extra-limit debt. Note
that according to our debt restructuring, the principal repayment is also including a part of
WB loan disbursement (i.e 15 %) for the Parana debt.

A3.79 Extra-limite debt, foreign-denominated part:

 Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote
 transparency of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and
 policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are
 issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
 countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-
 program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
 longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
 discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
 Board in a particular case.


A4.1         On July 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Brazil.1
Background
A4.2           Brazil has built a strong macroeconomic framework over the past decade,
which has served to increase its resilience to the global economic crisis. Sustained fiscal
discipline and implementation of the inflation targeting regime have reduced fiscal and
external vulnerabilities, and the flexible exchange rate regime has played a key role, allowing
the economy to adjust quickly to external shocks. Public debt has been lowered in relation to
GDP, and substantial international reserves have been accumulated. While the economy has
been sharply affected by the global crisis--GDP shrank by 4½ percent in the two quarters to
March 2009--the high credibility of the policy framework has allowed the authorities to
adopt countercyclical measures. There are signs that the economy began to improve in the
second quarter of this year, supported by private consumption and a healthy financial system.
A4.3            The global downturn affected Brazil through a sudden curtailment in external
credit, as well as a decline in commodity prices and export demand. The disruption in global
financial markets also led to a liquidity squeeze for Brazilian corporates and financial firms.
Access to credit became limited, especially for small- and medium-sized firms. The
weakening of external conditions also led to pressures on the currency, which depreciated by
about 23 percent against the U.S. dollar between mid-September and end-December 2008.
A4.4            The creation of lending facilities in foreign currencies and intervention in the
foreign exchange market through futures helped stabilize domestic financial conditions
relatively rapidly, while making parsimonious use of cash reserves. Exchange rate
depreciation and equity market price declines reduced the stock of nonresidents' claims on
the economy, without generating a large outflow of reserves. Since the beginning of this
year, the real has appreciated by 17 percent against the U.S. dollar, and the stock market has
been among the best performers globally.
A4.5            Brazilian financial institutions, which were not exposed to impaired assets
abroad, have built strong capital buffers in recent years, albeit at levels varying across
institutions. Bank liquidity ratios have recovered after some dipping in the fourth quarter of
                                              123
2008. Nonperforming loan ratios (NPLs) have risen with the weakening in economic activity.
In recent months, the extension of credit by private banks has slowed, reflecting greater
caution as economic activity weakens and NPLs rise, while the share of public banks in total
credit has risen. The external financing needs of the corporate sector appear manageable.
A4.6            Monetary policy has been eased substantially. With inflation trending
downward since July 2008, the policy rate has been cut by 450 basis points since January
2009, and the equivalent of 3½ percent of GDP in liquidity has been released through
reductions in reserve requirements. Inflationary expectations have remained well anchored,
despite the significant depreciation of the currency and the fact that inflation was still close to
the top of the target range in late 2008.
A4.7           Federal Government revenues declined by close to 7 percent in real terms
during January-May 2009 compared with the same period in 2008. The government has
announced some stimulative tax and spending initiatives. It is also providing additional
resources to the development bank BNDES (equivalent to 3½ percent of GDP over two
years). The primary surplus is targeted to decline by 1½ percent of GDP in 2009. The
adjustor for public investment, and resources from the sovereign wealth fund, provide
additional flexibility to maintain spending should staff's less optimistic revenue projections
materialize. While the net debt ratio is expected to increase this year and public financing
needs remain large, at approximately 19½ percent of GDP, long-term interest rates have
remained below the levels prevailing a year ago.
Executive Board Assessment
A4.8            After suffering a sharp contraction in the last quarter of 2008 and first quarter
of 2009, Directors welcomed signs that the Brazilian economy has began to improve and
considered Brazil to be in a favorable position to weather well the global crisis. They praised
the Brazilian authorities' robust policy framework and sound prudential supervision, which
has allowed an appropriate and timely countercyclical policy response. If the growth outlook
were to deteriorate significantly from the authorities' current projections, Directors saw room
for additional fiscal and monetary easing, subject to careful monitoring of market reaction.
A4.9           Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has served Brazil
well. They generally commended the authorities for accumulating a comfortable foreign
reserves cushion, which has helped limit the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil.
Directors agreed that intervention to address disorderly market conditions remains
appropriate. They noted that under the most recent and globally-consistent application of the
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) methodology, based on exchange rates
prevailing during the reference period February 25­March 25, Brazil's real exchange rate
was assessed to be broadly in equilibrium, but had appreciated slightly since the reference
period.
A4.10           Directors endorsed the authorities' planned fiscal stimulus and reduction in
the primary fiscal surplus target in 2009. If revenues are less buoyant than projected.
Directors saw scope for further flexibility in the fiscal target through the use of the adjustor
for public investment and resources from the sovereign wealth fund. They encouraged the
authorities to contain other current expenditure, including wages, which will be difficult to
reverse as the economy recovers.


                                               124
A4.11          Directors stressed the importance of keeping public debt on a declining path
over the medium term, and welcomed the authorities' plans to return to a higher primary
surplus in 2010 as the economy recovers. Directors underscored the importance of instituting
a sound medium-term fiscal framework and encouraged efforts to reinvigorate the reform
process, including with respect to tax and pension reform. A gradual reduction of revenue
earmarking and expenditure rigidities would also be desirable.
A4.12           Directors praised the authorities' adroit management of liquidity in domestic
and foreign exchange markets. Intervention in the foreign exchange market has allowed
participants to hedge exposures rapidly. Significant cuts in reserve requirements, expansion
in the range of collateral accepted in discount operations, liquidity provision to smaller banks
by the Deposit Insurance Fund, and the temporary extension of deposit guarantees have also
eased tensions in domestic money markets and helped redistribute liquidity to smaller banks.
Directors welcomed recent proposals to change the taxation of savings accounts, noting that
further changes may be needed to facilitate monetary easing. They also encouraged efforts to
lower the high interest rate spreads.
A4.13          Directors considered that the financial system has proven resilient during the
global crisis but that some risks may persist at the individual bank level. Therefore, they
encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the financial safety net and the assessment of
contagion risks across financial intermediaries. Directors emphasized the importance of
ensuring that banks, including public banks, do not take on excessive risk. They encouraged
reviewing the limits on financial funds' exposures to single counterparties and the regulations
on asset sales between banks and affiliated funds. Directors suggested clarifying the role of
the central bank and other institutions to ensure that adequate resources would be available in
the event of systemic crisis scenarios. Directors supported the authorities' efforts to ensure
greater availability of information on nonfinancial firms' foreign exchange exposures. Some
Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake a Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) update in the near future.
