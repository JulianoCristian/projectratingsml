Some lessons learned included: there should be\n            a champion capable of leading sector reform activities. The\n            Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MOWI) took leadership for\n            the sector reform and continuously followed up on the\n            implementation of this reform. It was also important that\n            Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) and Nairobi City Water and\n            Sewerage Company (NWSC) were championing and piloting the\n            day-to-day implementation of the sector reform, and that\n            both agencies were well suited to do so because of the\n            capacity they already had and which they were constantly\n            increasing throughout the project's implementation\n            period. The project focused its support on one water service\n            board and one water service provider only. By doing so the\n            project avoided overstretching financial resources as well\n            as implementation capacity on the Borrower's and the\n            Bank's side. With the selection of AWSB and NWSC as the\n            agencies for implementing the sector reform first, the\n            project focused on stakeholders which already had some\n            capacity which increased the likelihood of success."}, "docdt": "2008-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
