(NHB)\n            capacity to plan and manage highway maintenance and\n            operation and introduction of modern technical and financial\n            management practices.  It furthermore seeks (iii) to improve\n            traffic safety on National Highways; (iv) to develop the\n            capacity of Pakistani contractors to execute maintenance and\n            rehabilitation works; and (v) to ensure continued adequate\n            mobilization of revenues from road users.  To this end, the\n            project components entail (i) rehabilitation of about 650 km\n            of the N-5 Highway and associated bypasses and bridges; (ii)\n            improvements to the planning, management and execution of\n            maintenance and traffic engineering on National Highways;\n            (iii) improvement of road safety; (iv) technical assistance\n            and equipment; and (v) studies for preparation of future projects."}, "docdt": "1987-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
