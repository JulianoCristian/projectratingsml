Principal features of\n            the project would be drainage works; larger and more modern\n            agricultural machinery for full mechanization of farming\n            operations; construction equipment; and provision of roads,\n            housing and supporting infrastructure. Training in equipment\n            operation and maintenance and in construction techniques\n            would be provided together with technical assistance (78\n            man-months of consultant services) in the fields of\n            planning, training, and seed production. The project would\n            produce more than 440,000 tons of grain and soybean\n            annually, and thereby help reduce China's food grain\n            deficit. It would serve as a large-scale trial and\n            demonstration of techniques applicable to an additional\n            470,000 ha of uncultivated land and some 2 million ha now\n            cultivated by state farms in Heilongjiang."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
