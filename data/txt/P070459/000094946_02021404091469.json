The scope and criteria of this\n            environmental assessment covers both a social assessment,\n            and the ecological aspects potentially affected by the\n            project implementation. The following is a summary of the\n            environmental impacts, and mitigation measures. During\n            construction, trees in the right of way (ROW), and forestry\n            - particularly for soil conservation and protection of\n            irrigation systems - will be avoided as possible; spoil\n            sites with no impact on farmland, or natural vegetation will\n            be reduced, by lowering embankments, to be later\n            rehabilitated along with local agriculture development\n            activities; spraying of storage material, and asphalt mixing\n            sites should prevent air, and dust pollution; and,\n            wastewaters, and oil spills discharges will be prevented\n            from river flows, treated appropriately, aiming as well to\n            prevent soil erosion, and irrigation contamination. Drainage\n            ditches will be designed so as to prevent flooding, and\n            water losses, and contain soil erosion. Traffic safety\n            measures shall include adequate signs, and road\n            diversification as needed; while limited working days\n            activities should minimize noise disturbances."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
