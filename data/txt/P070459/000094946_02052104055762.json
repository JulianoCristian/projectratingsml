      at improving the efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness\n            of the transport infrastructure, to support the development\n            of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by improving\n            accessibility to its poorer areas, and reducing the\n            region's socioeconomic disparity. The main components\n            include: 1) construction of the Laoyemiao-Jining highway\n            (LJH) - a divided four-lane, access controlled toll highway\n            - which as part of the national highway network, and\n            critical within the east-west corridor in the region, will\n            connect the key industrial, administrative, and hub cities\n            of Baotou, Hohhot, and Jining. Supply of equipment,\n            electrical installation, lighting systems, and construction\n            supervision will be financed, based on environmental\n            criteria established prior to commencement of civil works;\n            2) a highway network improvement program for poverty areas,\n            establishing that sections to be constructed should link the\n            poor to the developed areas in the province, based on\n            established monitoring and performance indicators; 3)\n            highway safety program, as per detailed engineering designs,\n            that include installation of traffic safety facilities; and,\n            4) institutional strengthening, and training, enhanced\n            through technical assistance provision for project\n            preparation, road maintenance programs, and engineering research."}, "docdt": "2002-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
