satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: simplified internal clearance procedures\n            for variation orders. The approval of the different has led\n            to long delays in finalizing contracts. A simplified yet\n            efficient internal clearance procedure in Inner Mongolia is\n            needed to streamline the approvals process between multiple\n            agencies and to avoid long delays. Reduced use of\n            International supervision for shorter, more specific\n            technical tasks. Construction supervision under local\n            engineering firms was supported by an international\n            consultant firm and four consulting staff was relocated to\n            the construction site. It was found that the international\n            consultant provided good project management and quality\n            control support but lacked sufficient knowledge of Chinese\n            standards and technical challenges. As construction quality\n            in China is generally high and implementation periods\n            satisfactory, it is recommended to use international\n            consultants only for shorter, more specific technical tasks\n            and to make more use of local consultants that are familiar\n            of the Chinese standards and technical practices. In the\n            planning of transport investments it is important that there\n            is good coordination between various modal agencies. During\n            the preparation stage more emphasis could have been given to\n            the linkages between road and rail movements with the\n            objective of improving integration in planning and\n            operations and greater inter-modal efficiencies."}, "docdt": "2008-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
