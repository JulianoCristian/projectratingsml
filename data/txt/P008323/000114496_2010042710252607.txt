Amendment to Loan Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement for the above-referenced Project, dated December 
16,1996, between the Republic of Bulgaria (the Borrower) and the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Project Agreement of the same 
date between the Bank and the National Social Security Institute (NSSI). We also refer 
to your letter of May 27, 1999, requesting the Bank to amend the said Loan Agreement 
in order to fund additional investments  in the amount of US$4,000,000 equivalent that 
would facilitate the expansion of NSSI’s collection activities to include 
contributions in the social sector including Health Insurance contributions.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank has agreed to your request. 
Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is amended as set out in the Annex to this letter.
In addition, certain amendments would have to be introduced into the Schedule to 
the Project Agreement. These are set out in a separate letter to Mr. Nikolai Nikolov, 
Governor,  NSSI, dated October 27, 1999, copied to you.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by countersigning and dating 
the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us. This amendment will become 
effective on the date hereof upon receipt of your countersigned copy by the Bank.
Due to his interest in the Project, I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. 
Nikolai Nikolov, Governor of  NSSI.
Sincerely yours,
