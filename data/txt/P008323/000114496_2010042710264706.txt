Dear Mr. Nikolov:

for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Project Agreement of the same

to the letter of His Excellency, Muravei Radev of May 27, 1999, requesting the Bank to 
amend the said Loan Agreement in order to fund additional investments  in the amount 
of US$4,000,000 equivalent that would facilitate the expansion of NSSI’s collection 
activities to include Health Insurance contributions.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank has agreed to the said request. 
Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is being amended as set out in a letter dated October 
27, 1999 to His Excellency, Muravei Radev and the Schedule to the Project Agreement is
