Insurance Administration project and the sustainability were\n            both highly satisfactory, the institutional development\n            impact was high and, the Bank and the borrower performance\n            were both highly satisfactory. The lessons learned during\n            the project were that successful institutional capacity\n            building takes many years and requires a comprehensive array\n            of investments, including infrastructure , development of\n            management skills and team building, expert skills training,\n            basic skill training and, strategic and business planning.\n            Project design needs to be developed with the involvement\n            and commitment of client, country stakeholders, all donors\n            and, subject matter experts. New roles were assigned to the\n            National Social Security Institute. Investment in building\n            institutional capacity should be the first step when working\n            with a country to develop new policies so that the\n            institutions are prepared to help develop and then implement\n            new policies. Projects that build institutional capacity\n            need to be structured and financed to provide ongoing expert\n            advice. Projects require strong and active Bank\n            participation at supervision and support, along with strong\n            commitment by the client management. It is very important\n            that all officials responsible for project components, not\n            just the project coordination unit, acquire strategic and\n            project planning skills for successful project management\n            and capacity building."}, "docdt": "2002-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
