Project aims to support the government's current reform\n            program goals of eliminating the social insurance budgetary\n            subsidy through fiscal balance achievement and laying the\n            groundwork for future reforms aimed at a fundamental\n            restructuring of Bulgaria's system for guaranteeing\n            income security. Therefore, the project will: a) strengthen\n            efforts to increase the National Social Security\n            Insitute's (NSSI) overall operational efficiency in the\n            emerging market economy, focusing on reversing the reduced\n            tax compliance trend which is undermining the financial\n            stability of the public Pay-As-You-Go social insurance\n            program; and b) strengthening the NSSI to perform key policy\n            formulation and evaluation functions and better manage\n            available resources. The first component is increasing\n            compliance and operational efficiency. This will institute\n            effective operational procedures for inter alia: a) control\n            and monitoring of fund flow into and out of the social\n            insurance system; b) improved revenue/ expenditure\n            projection and benefit calculation on an actual contribution\n            basis; and c) improved services to clients, including\n            efficient payment of pensions and short term benefits. The\n            second major component is strengthening Institutional\n            capacity by: a) policy analysis; b) actuarial forecasting;\n            c) public information/ education concerning the social\n            insurance program and d) personnel management including\n            improvements in staff selection, incentives, training and\n            career development. The project will be implemented over a\n            period of four years."}, "docdt": "1996-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
