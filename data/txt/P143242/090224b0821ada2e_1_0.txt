                         government-development partner joint review mission found many areas of important progress across the reform program supported by the DPO, while highlighting the need to both
                         ensure reform efforts to date are fully implemented given significant capacity constraints and that the reform program shift its focus to actions to enable inclusive economic
                         development in Solomon Islands. The macroeconomic framework remains stable, and the 2014 budget takes steps to address some of the fiscal risks described in the program
                         document, especially around control of expenditure on tertiary scholarships and constituency funds.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank will continue to support the development of the 2014 Economic and Financial Reform Program, and the development of a longer-term program to refocus the EFRP on the
                         challenges of achieving sustained development for Solomon Islands. The Government, led by FEDU within MoFT, will present to Cabinet the 2014 EFRP early in the new year. The
                         2014 Joint Review Mission, scheduled for mid-2014, will collect indicators of the impact of the policy actions supported by the EFRP in general and specifically of the results
                         indicators of the DPO series.

                         Restructuring History
