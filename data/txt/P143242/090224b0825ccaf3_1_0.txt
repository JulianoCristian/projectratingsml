                         The DPO policy actions have been fully implemented without slippage, and associated follow-on actions are advancing through development and implementation. Capacity limits

                         2013 Joint Review Mission, Government is currently working with development partners to refocus the policy actions of the EFRP towards broader structural reforms for inclusive
                         growth. In the interim, a third DPO is being prepared linked to the 2014 EFRP, providing financing for recovery from recent floods. The macroeconomic framework remains stable,
                         and the 2014 budget takes steps to address some of the fiscal risks described in the program document, especially around control of expenditure on tertiary scholarships and
                         constituency funds.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank will continue to support the development of the Economic and Financial Reform Program, and the development of a longer-term program to refocus the EFRP on the
                         challenges of achieving sustained development for Solomon Islands. The Government, led by FEDU within MoFT, presented to Cabinet the 2014 EFRP early in the new year, with
                         several actions from the 2014 EFRP supported by the Recovery Financing DPO, currently being prepared. The 2014 Joint Review Mission, scheduled for August, 2014, will collect
                         indicators of the impact of the policy actions supported by the EFRP in general and specifically of the results indicators of the DPO series.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
