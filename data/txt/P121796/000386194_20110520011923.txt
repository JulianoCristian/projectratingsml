                                      Republic of Latvia—Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                                           May 11, 2011

                    1.      Latvia’s economic recovery is strengthening after the sharp contraction
                    in 2008-09. Real GDP started to increase in late 2009, and after a slightly negative outturn
                    in 2010 due to base effects, growth is forecast at 3.3 percent in 2011 and 4 percent in the
                    medium term. Net exports supported the initial recovery, but domestic demand is expected to
                    drive growth from 2011 onwards as improving confidence and investment outweigh
                    continued fiscal consolidation, the weak labor market, and contracting credit. However,
                    unemployment is 17 percent (Labour Force Survey) and could remain in double digits for
                    some time, including because of challenges in shifting those previously employed in
                    construction to other sectors.

                    2.      After a period of deflation (inflation averaged -1.2 percent in 2010), prices
                    started to rise in late 2010 due to world supply shocks. Like other Baltic countries (which
                    have high shares of food and energy in the CPI basket), headline inflation jumped to
                    4.1 percent in March, with food prices growing 9 percent, and energy prices by 15 percent.
                    VAT and excise tax increases, introduced at the beginning of 2011, have also raised prices.
                    However, core inflation has remained flat due to weak domestic demand and high
                    unemployment, and inflation is projected to fall in 2012. Wages have started to pick up, but
                    only moderately, and remain 9 percent below the pre-crisis peak.

                    3.      The current account remains in surplus, though much of the sharp improvement
                    in 2009 has proved transitory. The investment income account has worsened, but because
                    of the recovery in profits of foreign banks, which reflects the underlying recovery.1 The
                    current account slipped briefly into deficit at the end of 2010 for the first time since the crisis,
                    with imports and exports both rising rapidly.

                    4.      Financial indicators underscore growing confidence. The 5-year CDS for Latvia
                    has fallen to around 200 basis points, and in March Fitch raised Latvia’s credit rating to
                    investment grade status. T-bill rates remain close to historic lows, 10-year lats bonds were
                    issued in February, and bank deposits are above pre-crisis levels. Though repayment of
                    banks’ foreign liabilities has led to some decline in international reserves, they remain at
                    comfortable levels.

                    5.      With the economy recovering, policy efforts should focus on measures to help
                    Latvia move toward euro adoption, and long-delayed state bank reforms. Euro
                    adoption—which the authorities hope to achieve in 2014—would allow a credible exit from
                    the current exchange rate regime, thereby permanently eliminating a key source of risk, and

                    1
                    The balance in the income account in early 2009 was artificially high due to the treatment of bank losses. Debt
                    write-downs and other valuation effects were booked as a credit in the income account.

                                                                   2


                    would also lower borrowing costs. To qualify for the euro, Latvia needs to undertake further
                    fiscal adjustment, but also to be mindful of the price stability criterion. Additionally, some
                    adjustments in interest rates could be warranted in line with movements in ECB rates, and
                    Latvia will need to remain vigilant to safeguard competitiveness over the medium term.

                    6.     Strong spending discipline enabled Latvia to comfortably meet its 2010 fiscal
                    targets. The ESA deficit is estimated at 7.7 percent of GDP, well below the 8.5 percent
                    program target. Excluding bank restructuring costs (which have been largely front-loaded
                    and should be much smaller from now on), the deficit is considerably lower, only 5.5 percent
                    of GDP—within striking distance of the Maastricht 3 percent reference value.

                    7.      For 2011, the budget passed in December 2010 and the supplementary budget
                    passed in April 2011 should deliver a fiscal deficit well below the previously agreed
                    program target. Both budgets rely mainly on revenue increases, including greater emphasis
                    on fighting the gray economy (revenue gains in this area are difficult to quantify).
                    Expenditure measures are few and some may not be sustainable. The authorities believe their
                    measures will reduce the 2011 deficit to below 4.5 percent of GDP (ESA terms, excluding
                    bank restructuring costs). Given risks of higher spending, plus the uncertain yield of
                    measures to combat the gray economy, the outturn could be slightly higher (perhaps as high
                    as 4.9 percent of GDP), but even this would be considerably better than the initial program
                    path of 6 percent of GDP.

                    8.      For 2012, the authorities will aim for a 2.5 percent of GDP deficit, well below the
                    3 percent of GDP Maastricht criterion, to demonstrate their commitment to euro
                    adoption. Preliminary estimates suggest a 2012 adjustment need of L150 to 180 million
                    (1.1 to 1.3 percent of GDP), which is much lower than estimated previously. The authorities
                    are aware that next year’s fiscal consolidation will need to focus on expenditure cuts, rather
                    than tax increases (except in areas such as real estate taxes), so as to contain domestic
                    inflation and maximize the chances of meeting the Maastricht price stability criterion.

                    9.      Significant steps have been taken to stabilize the financial system and maximize
                    the recovery of state aid while reducing government involvement in the banking sector.
                    After long delays, Latvia submitted its restructuring plan for Mortgage and Land Bank to the
                    EC in April, which envisages the sale of most of its commercial assets and liabilities. The
                    development part of the bank would be merged with other development institutions. The
                    government is also implementing its plans for Citadele and Parex banks: selling Citadele as a
                    whole bank in a public auction later this year, and for Parex, combining quick sales with
                    gradual asset realization depending on expected future returns. In addition, the authorities
                    have strengthened financial sector supervision and improved procedures for private debt
                    restructuring.

                    10.   Adjustment of official interest rates may be needed to support the fixed
                    exchange rate, especially now that the ECB appears to be entering a tightening cycle.

                    Should international reserves continue to decline, there would be a case for raising interest
                    rates, particularly as interbank rates dropped below those in the euro area in April.

                    11.     Continued competitiveness improvements will be essential for the medium-term
                    success of Latvia’s euro adoption strategy. Internal devaluation and higher productivity
                    have produced significant competitiveness gains (relative to their peaks, the CPI-based real
                    effective exchange rate has depreciated by around 10 percent, the ULC-based measure by
                    15 percent), although improvements have leveled off recently. As discussed in the 2010
                    Article IV consultation, quantitative assessment of the real exchange rate is complicated by
                    the rapid pace of structural change but, most likely, a moderate competitiveness gap remains.
                    With its nominal exchange rate fixed to most of its main trading partners, Latvia needs to
                    control labor costs and implement productivity-enhancing structural reforms.

                    12.      The IMF’s Executive Board is expected to consider Latvia’s request for
                    completion of the Fourth Review under the Stand-By Arrangement on May 25, 2011.
                    Since July 2010 when the Board approved the Third Review (and concluded the 2010
                    Article IV Consultation), the authorities have met all September and December 2010
                    quantitative performance criteria and continued to perform well on macroeconomic
                    indicators in 2011. They met most structural benchmarks, although some with delay, and
                    intend to make progress on a fiscal responsibility law, a strategy for state-owned enterprises,
                    and the divestment of state-owned banks in 2011. The authorities have requested a waiver of
                    nonobservance of a continuous performance criterion due to their decision at end-2010 to
                    extend an exchange restriction related to Parex Bank. The earlier Board approval of that
                    restriction expired at end-2010, and the restriction was unapproved for a short period before
                    the Executive Board granted another temporary approval in April 2011.
