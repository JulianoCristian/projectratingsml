objectives of the Second Safety Net\n            and Social Reform Program for Latvia are (i) to protect\n            vulnerable groups with emergency safety net support during\n            the economic contraction; (ii) to mitigate the social costs\n            of fiscal consolidation; and (iii) to ensure that structural\n            reforms lay a foundation for sustainable improvements in the\n            social sectors. This operation is part of the special\n            lending support by the World Bank for the Republic of\n            Latvia. This is the second operation in a program of two\n            loans focused on safety net support and social sector\n            reform; the first Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL 1)\n            was fully disbursed on September 27, 2010. The second\n            Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL 2) supports actions\n            related to protecting the most vulnerable within a reform\n            program that underpins fiscal adjustment in the education\n            and health sector. The government has embarked on a\n            'funds follow the student' financing reform in the\n            education sector to increase efficiency and education\n            quality in light of the shrinking school-age population. The\n            government has made progress in implementing the SDPL\n            program. In substance, Latvia is on track to meet nine out\n            of the eleven triggers outlined in SDPL 1 for the second\n            operation. Two of the triggers have been merged, so the loan\n            now has eight prior actions. Support for the reform program\n            is not weakening despite the social costs it has entailed."}, "docdt": "2011-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
