Main Policy Areas        Emergency Social Safety Net, and Education, Health and Social Protection
                         Reforms
Key Outcome              1. The Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS) has adequate
Indicators                   budget financing in 2010 and 2011 (at 0.6% of GDP).
                         2. State co-financing of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI)
                             program introduced and maintained at 50% in 2010 and 2011.
                         3. Participants in the emergency public works program equaled on
                             average 19,000 (16% of the unemployed not receiving unemployment
                             benefits) and 16,500 (13% of the unemployed not receiving
                             unemployment benefits) in 2010 and 2011, respectively.
                         4. Regular monitoring reports on the ESSNS implementation published
                             by the government on the internet.
                         5. The independent Audit Report on ESSNS implementation is completed
                             and published on the internet in October 2010, and the action plan of
                             audit recommendations is put in place by October 2011.
                         6. The share of GPs with an extra public health nurse increased from 0%
                             in 2009 to about 21% of GPs in 2010, and reaches 36% in 2011.
                         7. Pre-school attendance rates have been maintained over the crisis and
                             equaled 94% of 5 year olds and 98% of 6 year olds at end-2010 and
                             end-2011.
                         8. Share of children from closed schools receiving assistance for school
                             transportation under the State-subsidized scheme reaches at least 77%
                             in 2011 (it increased from 0% prior to May 2009 to 88% in 2010).
Program Development      The objectives of the program are: (i) to protect vulnerable groups with
Objective(s) and         emergency safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii) to
Contribution to CAS      mitigate the social costs of fiscal consolidation; and (iii) to ensure that
                         structural reforms lay a foundation for sustainable improvements in the
                         social sectors. The first loan in the series focused mainly on the first and
                         second objectives given the need for an emergency response to the deep
                         downturn Latvia suffered in the wake of the global crisis. While


                                               v
                      concentrated on continuing support for the emergency social safety net
                      measures through to end-2011, the proposed second operation will expand
                      this focus to the third objective through support for the structural reform in
                      the social sectors. This support is made through the ESSNS and seeks to
                      protect the most vulnerable within an overall structural reform program
                      aimed at high quality fiscal adjustment in the education and health sector.

                      Latvia graduated from World Bank financing in 2007. The global financial
                      crisis led to an exceptional request by the government of Latvia for
                      renewed access to World Bank lending resources. The proposed operation
                      is the final operation under the SDPL support program and would complete
                      World Bank crisis lending activities in Latvia. There are two related World
                      Bank operations: the Financial Sector Development Policy Loan approved
                      on September 22, 2009 and First Safety Net and Social Sector Reform
                      Development Policy Loan (SDPL 1) approved on March 4, 2010. The
                      World Bank program is an integral part of the international rescue package
                      of the IMF, EC, EBRD, Nordic countries, and other lenders.

Risks and Risk        Risks. Risks to the proposed operation are moderate to high. The risks are
Mitigation            related to the economy, political and social support for the ongoing fiscal
                      adjustment program, and possible reversal of the social sector structural
                      reform program supported by the World Bank’s SDPL loan series.
                      Economic risks are moderate. Overall, the macroeconomic outlook has
                      notably improved since the previous World Bank loan (SDPL 1) was
                      approved and risks have diminished. Growth performed better than
                      expected in 2010, as did the fiscal outturn. Political risks remain moderate
                      to high, and relate to the challenge of maintaining the support of the
                      governing coalition and society at large for the ongoing fiscal stabilization
                      program. Despite the difficult economic conditions that the population has
                      faced, social stability has endured. The government has reiterated its
                      commitment to the structural reform program and implementation risks are
                      moderate in 2011.

                      Mitigation of Risks. The SDPL program will help to mitigate the
                      economic and social risks of the stabilization program. The proposed
                      SDPL 2 facilitates the fiscal reforms in the social sectors. The technical
                      assistance program that has accompanied the SDPL program has supported
                      the fiscal stabilization program. In supporting the implementation of the
                      ESSNS, the SDPL program lowers the social costs inflicted by the rapid
                      fiscal adjustment and sector structural reforms. In supporting the
                      monitoring and making public the results of the ESSNS—including the use
                      of country systems to audit, evaluate and feed into program re-design—the
                      SDPL supports greater governance and accountability.

Operation development objective
The objective of the proposed Second Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL) is to support
safety net and social sector reforms in Latvia. The proposed operation would be part of the

Special Development Policy lending support given by the World Bank to the Republic of Latvia
under the stabilization program of EUR7.5 billion agreed in December 2008 and provided by the
European Commission (EC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the World Bank, and bilaterally through support from
Nordic and Central European countries. The stabilization program is designed to address severe
macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances and financial vulnerabilities that grew worse in the wake
of the global economic and financial crisis.

The objectives of the program are: (i) to protect vulnerable groups with emergency safety net
support during the economic contraction; (ii) to mitigate the social costs of fiscal consolidation;
and (iii) to ensure structural reforms lay a foundation for medium-term improvements in the
social sectors. The first loan focused mainly on the first and second objectives given the need for
an emergency response to the deep downturn Latvia suffered in the wake of the global crisis.
While concentrated on continuing support for the emergency social safety net measures through
to end-2011, the proposed second operation will expand this focus to the third objective, seeking
to support the structural reform program that the Latvian Government has put in place for the
social sectors.

                                        TO SUPPORT A

              SAFETY NET AND SOCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM


                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This operation is part of the special lending support by the World Bank for the
Republic of Latvia. Under the stabilization program of EUR7.5 billion agreed in December
2008 and provided by the European Commission (EC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and bilaterally through support
from Nordic and Central European countries, the World Bank agreed to support Latvia’s
stabilization program with EUR 400 million in funding. The stabilization program is designed to
address severe macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances and financial vulnerabilities that worsened
in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis.

2.      This is the second operation in a program of two loans focused on Safety Net
Support and Social Sector Reform; the first Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL 1)
was fully disbursed on September 27, 2010. The objectives of the program are: (i) to protect
vulnerable groups with emergency safety net support during the economic contraction; (ii) to
mitigate the social costs of fiscal consolidation; and (iii) to ensure that structural reforms lay a
foundation for medium-term improvements in the social sectors. The first loan focused on the
first and second objectives given the need for an emergency response. While concentrated on
continuing support for the emergency social safety net measures through to end-2011, the
proposed operation expands the focus to the third objective.

3.      The SDPL 2 supports actions related to protecting the most vulnerable within a
reform program that underpins fiscal adjustment in the education and health sector. The
government has embarked on a “funds follow the student” financing reform in the education
sector to increase efficiency and education quality in light of the shrinking school-age
population. The switch to this form of financing creates incentives to increase the low teacher-
pupil ratio in Latvia and decrease school infrastructure. In the health sector, structural reforms
delivering fiscal adjustment aim to improve administrate capacity and transparency, and to
rationalize the provision of care. Primary health care services are being protected and reforms are
aimed at substituting expensive inpatient services to the extent possible through increased use of
outpatient surgery and alternatives to overnight hospital stays. The high inpatient costs are being
tackled by reducing the number of hospital beds and making more effective use of co-payments
to manage demand for services. The aim is not solely to increase efficiency, but to improve


                                               1
health outcomes through better primary care. With the 2010 Public Expenditure Review (PER),
the World Bank has also engaged with government on other important structural reforms,
including increasing the retirement age for pensions, the development of training-based labor
market programs and a move to a voucher scheme for training, and the formulation of a health
sector strategy.

4.      The government has made progress in implementing the SDPL program. In
substance, Latvia is on track to meet nine out of the eleven triggers outlined in SDPL 1 for the
second operation. Two of the triggers have been merged, so the loan now has eight prior actions.
The explanation for the removal of one of the triggers on a social assistance evaluation report
and another on health are given in Section 5.2, which describes the policy areas supported by the
operation. Annex 2 gives a description of the status of each trigger for SDPL 2, compares them
to the proposed prior actions and given a summary of progress under the proposed prior action.

5.      Support for the reform program is not weakening despite the social costs it has
entailed. The parliamentary election on October 2, 2010 indicated support for the government’s
policy record, with the two-bloc coalition led by Prime Minister Dombrovskis maintaining
power. Prime Minister Dombrovskis campaigned on the need for additional fiscal cuts for Latvia
to meet the conditions of the stabilization program and achieve the Maastricht criteria by 2012 to
join the Eurozone by 2014. The coalition Dombrovskis now heads won 58.6 percent of the vote.
With technical input and financial support from the World Bank, the government put in place an
Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS) to finance essential services and benefits
delivered by national agencies and municipal governments on October 1, 2009, which extends to
December 31, 2011. Certainly the safety net helped to offset the impact of the crisis on the most
vulnerable households and contributed to reduced social pressures. While unemployment
increased by more than ten percentage points, poverty only rose by a little more than two
percentage points. The proposed SDPL 2 will contribute to further mitigating these social
consequences.

                                        II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

2.1. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN LATVIA

6.      After the EU accession in 2004, the Latvian economy experienced rapid economic
growth, helped by expansionary macroeconomic policies. Growth averaged 10.4 percent over
2004-2007. A domestic demand boom was facilitated by large real wage increases, pro-cyclical
fiscal policy, capital inflows and rapid credit expansion. Labor shortages and out-migration to
EU151 countries resulted in rapid nominal wage growth (about 80 percent on average from 2004
to 2007), which outstripped productivity growth.

7.      The overheating pressures translated into large macroeconomic imbalances. The
cyclically-adjusted deficit deteriorated from to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to 6.2 percent in
20082, with public expenditures growing by 4 percent of GDP, or by more than 90 percent in real

Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the U.K..
2
  The cyclically-adjusted deficit reported here is based on the methodology outlined in the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA-95).


                                                       2
terms between 2003 and 2008. Consumer price inflation rose, increasing from 6 percent year-on-
year in May 2004 to 18 percent in the first half of 2008, undermining the purchasing power of
households. Competiveness deteriorated, with the unit labor cost-based real effective exchange
rate (ULC-REER) appreciating by more than 50 percent between 2004 and the end of 2008.
Driven by vibrant domestic demand, the external current account deficit widened from 9 percent
in mid-2004 to almost 25 percent of GDP in mid-2007. Moreover, the external deficit was
increasingly financed by institutional foreign borrowing, mainly parent bank funding, which
drove external debt to 128 percent of GDP at the end of 2007. Latvia’s non-financial private
sector debt rose rapidly and was a key source of vulnerability. Substantial inflows from Nordic
parent banks fuelled rapid credit expansion, while investment contributed to a real estate bubble.

8.       The combination of credit and housing bubbles, the global financial crisis, and acute
banking pressures in Latvia contributed to a severe crisis in late 2008. Markets became
concerned over the sustainability of the peg, and the likelihood that contingent financial sector
liabilities had to be absorbed by the government. All three ratings agencies downgraded Latvia.
Latvia’s Eurobond spread increased to around 600 basis points in the last quarter of 2008 from
less than 100 basis points in the beginning of 2007. Latvia’s credit default swap (CDS) spreads
skyrocketed, approaching 1,000 basis points. Liquidity demands from non-resident depositors
aggravated these developments. With deposit withdrawals putting pressure on international
reserves and the fiscal position deteriorating due to a steep drop in revenues and mounting
banking costs, Latvia approached the IMF and EC for emergency financial support in November
2008.3

9.       The Latvian government responded to the crisis with a reform program supported
by the EC, international financial institutions, and bilateral donors. The program goals were
to arrest the immediate liquidity crisis and to ensure long-term external stability, while
maintaining the exchange rate peg through strong domestic policies. Its key elements included:
(i) immediate measures to stem the loss of bank deposits and international reserves; (ii) steps to
restore confidence in the banking system in the medium-term; (iii) fiscal measures to limit the
substantial widening of the budget deficit, and to prepare for early fulfillment of the Maastricht
criteria; and (iv) incomes policies, including the adjustment of nominal wages both in the public
and private sector as well as structural reforms to rebuild competitiveness under the fixed
exchange rate regime.

10.    The core of the reform program requires a sizeable fiscal adjustment. Expenditure
cuts dominated the adjustment at the outset of the program, contributing more than three-quarters
of the consolidation (Box 1). Spending was cut by 14 percent of GDP during 2009-2010 as
compared to projected fiscal outcomes prior to the program. As a result, the fiscal deficit
declined to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2010, from 7.1 percent in 2009 (or in ESA95 terms to an
estimated 7.7 percent of GDP from 9.7 percent).

 The financial rescue package amounted to €7.5 billion, of which the IMF committed €1.7 billion, the EC €3.1
billion, the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway) €1.8 billion, EBRD €0.1 billion, and the
Czech Republic, Poland, and Estonia €0.4 billion. The Bank committed €400 million through DPL operations. The
IMF operation was approved on December 23, 2008 and the EC operation on January 20, 2009.


                                                   3
Box 1. Composition of the Fiscal Adjustment during 2009-10
A comparison of the projected fiscal outcomes prior to the program and the actual fiscal outcomes suggest that fiscal
adjustment measures reduced the fiscal deficit from 23.9 percent of GDP to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2010 (Table 1).
Public expenditures contributed 14 percentage points of GDP of the consolidation.

Tax policy changes redirected resources from consumption to production. Revenue-based adjustments, that brought
about 3 percentage points of fiscal savings, relied on increases in indirect tax rates but also on the broadening of the tax
base and simplification of the tax system. The personal income tax rate was increased by 1 percentage point to 26 percent
(in net terms); the tax-free personal income tax allowance was cut from LVL 90 (EUR125) to LVL 35 (EUR50) per month;
the VAT rate was increased from 18 to 21 percent and the reduced rate from 5 to 10 percent; and changes in the real estate
tax were introduced. In addition, a diversion of second pillar pension contributions increased revenues by more than one
percent of GDP.

Across-the-board spending cuts lowered expenditures, Spending cuts contributed the remaining 14 percent of GDP of
the deficit reduction. The expenditure adjustment relied predominantly on cuts in subsidies (by 4.7 percent of GDP during
2009-2010) and the public sector wage bill (by about 4 percent of GDP in the same period). Wages of central government
staff and teachers were reduced more than those of local governments and state-owned enterprises. A number of ministries,
including defense, education, interior and agriculture, cut administrative costs by merging agencies. Investment spending
fell by more than baseline projections. Interest spending was reduced by about 2 percent of GDP. Structural reforms in
health and education buttressed these cuts. The exception was pensions, where expenditures increased as a share of GDP,
partly due to the Constitutional Court decision of December 21, 2009 that reversed the initial pension cuts (which were 10
percent across-the-board and affected 70 percent for working pensioners). Adequate funding was ensured for the ESSNS.

11.     Latvia’s economy bottomed out in 2010. The economy recorded three consecutive
periods of quarter-on-quarter growth in 2010. Real GDP growth was close to zero in 2010 (Table
2). A build-up of inventories and further expansion of exports was behind the growth rebound.
Latvia’s exports have grown since mid-2010, outperforming a number of Central European
Countries. Exports of goods and services increased by more than 19 percent year-on-year, more
than imports, in 2010.4 Domestic demand remained relatively weak in the first half of 2010, but
spillovers from export gains enhanced consumption and investment in the last two quarters of
2010. Therefore, the second half of 2010 saw some rebalancing of GDP growth towards
domestic demand (Figure 2). Average real wages in 2010 contracted by 2 percent after a 7
percent decline registered in 2009, and the contraction in credit to the private sector eased, due to
stabilization in funding from foreign-owned banks (Figure 3).

12.     The economy has since stabilized and economic activity is picking up. The turnaround
in domestic demand is visible in balance of payments dynamics. From a surplus of over 8
percent of GDP in 2009, the current account surplus narrowed to 3.6 percent of GDP last year. In
addition, last quarter of 2010 saw Latvia post its first quarterly current count deficit since first
quarter of 2008. Latvia’s 5-year CDS spread has fallen along with some others in the region, and
is now well below 300 basis points. The interest rate on Latvian Eurobonds on the secondary
market narrowed to below 200 basis points, from about 700 in April 2009. In parallel, the
Treasury has succeeded in extending maturities in the domestic debt market. Greater confidence
in the sustainability of the peg has led to significantly lowered local interest rates.

13.    The improvement in competitiveness has, however, slowed down. After several
quarters of decline, unit labor costs stabilized in 2010 as nominal wages bottomed out. The ULC-
REER depreciated by about 10 percent between end 2007 and beginning of 2010, but remained
almost unchanged through last three quarters (Figure 4). The Consumer Price Index-based real

 The Bank of Latvia’s analysis shows that for many major trading partners, such as Germany, the U.K., Finland,
Poland, Russia and Lithuania, Latvia’s market shares expanded in the second half of 2010. The key drivers of
exports were wood and wood products (Latvia’s largest export category), metals and metal products (mainly iron
and steel) as well as agricultural and food products.

exchange rate has also stabilized at about 10 percent below its peak at end-2008. Analysis of the
competitive position of Latvia economy prepared last year gave mixed signals. While the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggested a continuing competitiveness gap, macro-
balance and external sustainability approaches produced a range from a -3 percent
undervaluation to a significant competitiveness gap, depending on the size of the output gap and
the natural rate of unemployment used.5

14.     Despite high unemployment rates, inflation has started picking up. Unemployment
increased from 10.1 percent at end-2008 to a high of 20.7 percent in the third quarter of 2010
(and fell to 17.2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010). The private sector adjusted more through
job losses than wage cuts. Despite the ongoing recession in many EU countries, migration
increased: one percent of Latvia’s population has left since end-2007. However, after a year-long
deflationary episode driven by the collapse of domestic demand, annual inflation turned positive
in September 2010 and reached 2.4 percent year-on-year in December 2010. Prices were pushed
up mainly by supply-side factors, such as higher food and fuel prices, and an appreciation of the
U.S. dollar, but the base effect was also important. While headline inflation has remained low,
inflationary expectations have moved up quickly since August 2010.

2.2. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15.    The economic recovery is projected to continue. Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.3
percent in 2011 and 4 percent per annum in 2012 and 2013 (Table 2). Domestic demand is
expected to increase at a modest pace in 2011. Improved consumer confidence suggests that
private consumption will increase despite increased taxes, and food and fuel price shocks.
Investment is also projected to increase owing to improved corporate profitability even though
access to credit remains difficult. The ongoing recovery in Latvia’s trading partners is expected

  Caution should be exercised in interpreting these indicators, as they may be influenced by the large cyclical decline
in imports rather than undervaluation.

to sustain export growth, although this will largely be offset by rising imports. As a result,
unemployment is projected to decline.

16.     Inflation is projected to increase further, but is set to remain in the low single digits.
Prices will continue rising moderately, driven mostly by increases in global energy and food
prices but also by the increase in the VAT rate. Inflation is expected to average around 3.2
percent in 2011, followed by a decline to around one percent in 2010. However, the persistent
output gap, high unemployment and continued fiscal consolidation are expected to keep core
inflation subdued. Based on current projections, the Maastricht inflation criterion (inflation of no
more than 1.5 percent above the average inflation rate of the three European Union (EU) member
states with the most stable price level) remains within reach. These projections are sensitive,
however, to developments in food and energy markets. The authorities are considering a range of
measures that could help contain inflation.

17.      With the 2011 budget, Latvia is moving towards meeting medium-term fiscal
targets. Parliament passed the 2011 budget on December 21, 2010, and a supplementary budget
on April 13, 2011. These budgets include fiscal consolidation measures totaling around L350
million, although not all yield permanent savings. The fiscal deficit is expected to reach 4.8
percent in 2011—an improvement of half a percentage point since July 2010 (IMF Article IV
Consultation). The ESA95 deficit is projected to fall below 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011, ensuring
that the Maastricht criterion of a fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2012 remains within
reach. The 2011 budget (include the two supplemental budgets) contain measures for 2.6
percentage points of GDP: of which, 1.8 percentage points of GDP are for measures focused on
increasing revenues. These include (i) increased VAT collection by raising both standard and
reduced VAT rates, and decreasing the categories for which the reduced VAT regime applies;
(ii) increased employee social security contributions; (iii) increased taxation of private vehicles
and privately-used company cars; (iv) the imposition of a financial stability duty and a fee for
non-bank companies providing consumer loan services; (v) a doubling of real estate taxes; and
(vi) increased excise duties and reduced duty-free allowances on certain products. The budget
also incorporates measures that may yield revenues in the short-term, but are unlikely to lead to a
permanent reduction in the deficit. These include temporary increases in dividend payout ratios
for many state-owned enterprises, and a diversion of second pillar pension contributions.
Expenditure measures include (i) reduced staff and wage costs in the public administration; (ii)
reduced appropriations relative to last year's level in a number of areas, including health
spending, social programs, and defense spending; (iii) reduced subsidies for general education
and financing for education innovation programs; and (iv) a cut in railway subsidies. In addition,
the government has secured fiscal space for additional social safety net spending of up to half a
percent of GDP if necessary.

18.     Additional measures are needed in 2012 to reduce the deficit to below 3 percent of
GDP. Provided the authorities contain the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011, current
estimates suggest that a further LVL150 to LVL180 million (1.1 to 1.3 percent of GDP) in
additional net measures will be needed to achieve the necessary fiscal consolidation. To improve
revenue collection, the authorities are working on proposals to reform property tax, to reallocate
personal income taxes paid to local governments to the state budget, and to implement a
comprehensive strategy to reduce the grey economy. On the expenditure side, reductions in the
public sector wage bill and state subsidies are being considered. A menu of additional options for

                                               7
fiscal consolidation will be prepared by mid-August 2011. The menu will include options for
rationalizing the system of social benefits and improving the sustainability of the pension system.
The government also plans to extend the temporary cap on benefit payments to high earners until
2014, which would otherwise expire at the end of 2012.

19.     The external current account is projected to be in surplus during 2011-2012, moving
to a small deficit thereafter. The current-account surplus will decline to 1.7 percent of GDP in
2011 and 0.5 percent in 2012. Increased risk appetite from foreign investors and rebounding
domestic demand are expected to lead to a small deficit in the latter years of the forecast period.
Export volumes have rebounded strongly, in line with the rapid recovery in external demand, but
their growth is expected to slow down as the global recovery weakens. Despite weak private
consumption and investment, increased demand for materials and components by export
industries implies that imports will continue growing robustly. The income account is expected
to return to deficit from 2011 onwards as corporate finances gradually improve. The balance for
services and current transfers are projected to be in surplus.

20.     External debt is expected to decline gradually. Current account surpluses, equity
recapitalizations, deleveraging by banks and the output rebound are projected to put external debt
on a declining path. Having increased sharply over the past two years, external debt is estimated
to have peaked at 165 percent of GDP in 2010, and to decrease to just below 110 percent of GDP
by 2016. The ratio of external debt to exports is projected to decline from a high of 362 percent
in 2009 to about 200 percent by 2016. These projections, however, are sensitive to exchange rate
and output shocks. They are less sensitive to shocks originating from higher interest rates or from
a non-interest rate current account shock.

21.     With financing seemingly ample, the authorities may not draw on the entire
available international support. So far Latvia has received about EUR4.3 billion of the
available EUR7.5 billion international financial support. Given Latvia’s stronger than anticipated
fiscal and financial position6, the government has decided to draw down remaining resources on
a case-by-case basis. Consistent with the medium-term debt strategy, the authorities intend to
increase reliance on domestic financing, while working to lengthen the maturity structure of
public debt to reduce the rollover risk. The government also plans to access international capital
markets once conditions are favorable, to ensure that it is able to meet external repayment
obligations. In order to limit macroeconomic volatility, the plan is to maintain a smooth domestic
borrowing profile, while limiting the amount of overall borrowing to an amount consistent with
continued debt sustainability. Parent banks have maintained their exposure to the financial
sector.

22.     Planned fiscal adjustment and the growth recovery are projected to reverse the
recent sharp rise in public debt. Under the baseline macroeconomic scenario (as in Table 3),
public debt will reach a peak of 50 percent of GDP in 2014, before going down to 42 percent of
GDP in 2015. Overall, the sustainability of public debt is most dependent on the size of the
primary deficit and the rate of output growth. A reduction in growth by a quarter of a standard
deviation relative to the historical average could push the debt-to-GDP ratios up to 78 percent by
2016 (Figure 5). The same size of shock applied to primary fiscal balance would result in a debt
increase to 62 percent by 2016 (Figure 6). The debt path is less sensitive to contingent liabilities,
exchange rate or interest rate shocks. Thus, continued fiscal adjustment will be essential to

 The international reserve position has improved. Gross international reserves have increased from EUR3.7 billion
in 2008 to EUR5.9 billion (the ratio of gross reserves to banks’ short-term liabilities and amortization minus the
current account surplus increased from 24 percent to 79 percent over the same period).

preserve fiscal sustainability, requiring further expenditure rationalization and—to insure against
risks—a cautious use of budgetary reserves and readiness to take additional action if necessary.

23.    A joint IMF-EC team reached agreement with the government on the Fourth
Review of the ongoing international financial support program on April 15, 2011. Following
discussions with the Latvian government, the EC-IMF reached agreement at staff level on the
main elements of the Latvian government’s policy program. In their concluding statement, the
IMF stated that the government’s policy agenda for 2011 sets the stage for meeting the
conditions for euro adoption in January 2014 and for sustaining the economic recovery. The
government and lenders have agreed on the main directions for 2012 budget consolidation
measures, most of which will be carried out by reducing expenditures, combating shadow
economy, increasing real-estate tax, making effective use of state subsidies, and ensuring the
sustainability of the social insurance system. The government also resolves to carry out structural
reforms in education and health care, and ensure the development of a social security strategy for
2012 and 2013. The IMF is also satisfied with the progress on financial system stabilization. The
IMF Executive Board is scheduled to discuss the Fourth Review under the Stand-By
Arrangement on May 25, 2011.

24.      The macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the proposed
DPL. The macroeconomic policies implemented prior to and during the global crisis have helped
to reduce macroeconomic imbalances. The government policies are supportive of sustained
growth, keeping external imbalances in check and narrowing fiscal deficits over the medium-
term. A fast recovery in key trading partners, a rebuilding of inventories and stepped-up
utilization of EU funds helped economy to recover. However, downside risks could weaken
Latvia’s macroeconomic performance. They include a weak recovery in the EU and contagion
from sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries in view of close banking linkages. A
worsening in the external environment could slow down growth in Latvia, and possibly delay the
fiscal consolidation.

2.3. SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CRISIS

25.    The social consequences of the economic contraction in Latvia are deep and
widespread. The World Bank team conducted a simulation analysis of the likely increase in
unemployment and poverty due to the economic contraction (between 2008 and 2009)7 and
updated these simulations for 2009 and 2010 to take into account newly-available data. The
percentage of people in poverty is estimated to have increased from 18.9 to 21.3 due to the
contraction in GDP (affecting mainly trade, hotels and restaurants, construction and
manufacturing) and in employment (concentrated in the same sectors) during 2009 and 2010.8 9
The construction sector was particularly hard hit, with employment halving, contributing roughly
one third of all job losses. The poverty gap, which measures the poverty deficit of the entire
population, is also estimated to have increased, from 5.7 to 6.7 percent during the same period.

26.       Unemployment almost tripled during the crisis. The labor market has been the most
important channel through which the crisis generated adverse economic and social impacts for
households. The rate of unemployment fluctuated around 7 percent on average over 2007-2008,
according to Labor Force Survey data. With a high incidence of layoffs and little or no job
creation, unemployment rose sharply starting in 2009 and reached a peak of 20.7 percent in the
first quarter of 2010. Overall employment rates fell by about 15 percent between 2007 Q1 and
2010 Q1.

27.    The lower-skilled segment of the labor force has suffered disproportionately from
the deterioration in the labor market. The hardest hit groups have been workers with
educational attainment that is equivalent to basic education or less, who experienced a 40 percent
employment reduction between 2007 Q1 and 2010 Q1. Workers with educational attainment of
general secondary school or less (but primary complete) also suffered a large drop in
employment rates, falling by about 21 percent between 2007 Q1 and 2010 Q1. In contrast,
workers with tertiary schooling experienced increased rates of employment between 2007 Q1
and 2010 Q1.

28.     Nascent signs of recovery in the labor market are apparent, with employment
starting to increase and the unemployment rate decreasing since 2010 Q1. At the same time,
the overall activity rate has also increased. The quarterly unemployment rate has decreased to
17.2 percent in 2010 Q4 since its peak of 20.7 percent in 2010 Q1. Despite these improvements,
the labor market recovery is slow, as is often the case with labor market rebounds after deep
recessions. However, the employment rates of those workers with basic education or less are yet
to show a significant improvement. Much of the improvement in employment conditions has
benefited workers with higher educational qualifications. The latest data shows that there has not
been a recovery in employment for the population with basic education or less. The likely
explanation for this is that with high unemployment rates, employers have larger pools of

  A household is in poverty if its total household income is below LVL 90 per capita, or approximately US$6 per person per day.
In Latvia, this line is known as the “needy” line.
9
  The at-risk-of-poverty rate (60 percent of the median household income)—used by the Central Bureau of Statistics in Latvia—
decreased from 25.7 percent in 2008 to 21.4 percent in 2009. The at-risk-of-poverty rate could increase or decrease during a crisis
depending on the impact on the median household’s income. However, the absolute poverty indicator generally increases during
a crisis as household purchasing power decreases due to layoffs or wage reductions.

workers to choose from, and hence hire the more qualified workers. The impact of the recent
increase in the minimum wage from LVL 180 to LVL 200 per month cannot yet be fully
assessed. However, the rise in the minimum wage may cause demand for low skilled labor to
fall.

2.4. SOCIAL SECTOR POLICY ISSUES

29.     The program document for the SDPL 1 reviewed the structural issues in the social
sectors as Latvia’s economic crisis came to a head in late 2008 and early 2009 (Report No.
51434-LV) as did the 2010 PER. During the boom years from roughly 2004 through 2008,
Latvia was able to expand spending on health, education, and social protection without
significantly expanding the percent of GDP spent on these sectors. Administrative expenses were
also allowed to rise quickly. In health, for example, government expenditures rose from 3.3
percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.8 percent (a 16 percent larger share) in 2007, corresponding to a real
spending increase of 59 percent. Education’s share fell slightly from 5.1 percent to 5.0 percent of
GDP between 2004 and 2007, corresponding to a real increase in spending of 35 percent.10

30.      In health, increased spending left the existing system in place and increased the
complexity or intensity of care. Spending mushroomed on specialist and inpatient care, with
little change in the volume of patients, raising the inflation-adjusted cost per inpatient episode in
real terms by nearly 50 percent and specialist care and diagnostics per outpatient by almost 75
percent in just three years, over 2005-2008. In contrast, spending on primary care went up only
by about 20 percent. Excess hospital capacity was not only left in place, much of it was
rehabilitated. Between 2001 and 2008, hospital beds were reduced from 820 to 746 per 100,000
population, leaving this measure of hospital capacity 30 percent above Estonia's and 120 percent
above the U.K.’s. The relatively high volume of hospital beds also reflects the underdevelopment
of the system of long-term care.

31.    In education, virtually no adjustment was made—either through the consolidation
of schools or a reduction in the number of teachers—for the fast-diminishing population of
school-age children after 2000. Enrollments in general education from grades 1 to 12 dropped
by 95,874 to 263,944 (27 percent) from 2001 to 2008, while the number of teaching and
nonteaching staff fell by only 437 to 33,605 (1 percent), and the number of schools fell by 82 to
992 (8 percent). As a result, by 2009 when the crisis arrived, there was scope for cost savings
that might have little or no negative effect on outputs or outcomes in both the health and
education sectors.

32.     Despite high spending by the central government on costly untargeted family
benefits and labor market programs, Latvia had only a few means-tested social assistance
benefits targeted to households with low income when the economic crisis hit. Moreover,
because identification of the poor and financing of assistance for them was a responsibility of
localities, municipal governments had the power and the incentive to minimize spending when
the crisis hit. As a consequence, when the unemployment rate started its swift rise to over 20

percent in early 2009 and households faced with the income loss, Latvia found itself with a
limited ability to offset the economic consequences for affected households.

33.      In active labor market programs, the worker training and retraining program was
characterized by direct provision and provider subsidization. Workers did not have the
freedom to choose the training program to follow, nor were they free to choose the training
provider for a given training program. As a result, training quality remained low as providers had
little incentive to improve quality once they were accredited. However, the training programs
were generally oversubscribed, most likely because of the stipends associated with the program.

34.     Beginning in the mid-1990s, Latvia had put in place a pensions system designed to
be fiscally sustainable over the long term. The system has public notional defined contribution
(NDC) accounts complemented with private individual pension accumulation accounts.
However, distortions had crept into the pension system’s expenditure side by the large increases
in benefits that were made during the boom years. Between 2005 and 2009 the average pension
for new retirees grew 69 percent. Two changes in pension policy encouraged a rapid and
unsustainable rise in benefit spending: first, the expansion to all retirees of what was originally a
targeted supplement to top up low pensions; and second, the introduction of generous benefit
indexation to the growth of salaries as well as to price increases. During the crisis, the robustness
of the system was further reduced by a government decision to divert a portion of second-pillar
contributions to finance current payouts.

35.     The World Bank has provided support to reform education, health, and social safety
nets. The main purpose of this loan series is to support the establishment of an emergency safety
net on October 1, 2009, and to assure adequate funding for it in the 2010 and 2011 budgets. At
the same time, the Bank provided assistance to the social sector ministries to identify
opportunities for structural reforms as part of their efforts to cut back spending in 2009, 2010,
2011, and 2012. This supported efforts to reduce the budget deficit to below a ceiling of 3
percent as Latvia aims to meet the Maastricht criteria. Information about reforms in each of the
social sectors (education, health and social protection) and an assessment of government
implementation in 2009 and 2010 is given in Annex 3. Annex 4 gives an account of the policy
issues in public administration.

                     III. THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM

3.1. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AND THE SOCIAL SECTORS

36.     The government is committed to joining the Eurozone in 2014. This will involve
continued fiscal austerity measures in the 2012 budget. The Cabinet of Ministers is committed to
implementing fiscal consolidation through sound, structural reforms, including in the social
sectors. The most important measures being undertaken in education are the introduction and
continuing implementation of “funds follow the student” per-capita financing in the 2009/2010
and 2010/2011 academic years, and the planned consolidation of vocational schools under the
management of municipal governments. In the health sector, the key reforms are a reduction in
the number of hospital beds, more effective use of co-payments to manage demand for services,
and reductions in excessive costs by shifting health care toward out-patient and hospital day-care



                                                14
procedures. In social protection, the government has committed to improving the long-term
financial sustainability of pensions and other forms of social insurance.
37.     The government has sought to protect the poorest and those that have lost jobs by
increasing social safety net spending. The government started implementation of the ESSNS
on October 1, 2009. This ensures that critical social services are maintained and that the impact
of the economic contraction on households is cushioned. The strategy finances and coordinates
the efforts of national and local government agencies to: (i) maintain pre-primary education and
child development programs for 5 and 6 year old children; (ii) cover the costs of transporting
students from communities where schools have closed to their new places of instruction; (iii)
exempt needy households from health service co-payments and subsidize their pharmaceutical
costs; (iv) improve access to and use of alternatives to inpatient treatment for the entire
population with subsidies to the poor for these services; (v) sustain and improve general
practitioner (GP) and primary health care (PHC) services and access; (vi) increase the coverage
and pay-out period of unemployment insurance; and (vii) increase the coverage and amount of
targeted social assistance benefits administered by local governments. For the growing number
of unemployed who are not covered by unemployment insurance or other social support, the
government has (viii) fortified the ESSNS by expanding and rapidly deploying labor-intensive
emergency public-works programs. The government is committed to keeping the ESSNS in
place until end-2011. Particular attention was paid to governance aspects of the ESSNS, through
the special audit of the program that was undertaken (see paragraph 83 and Annex 5). Annex 1
contains the government’s Letter of Development Policy, which gives give more detail on
policies supported by the operation.

3.2. CONSULTATIONS

38.     The government has consulted with stakeholders affected by the fiscal consolidation
and the structural reform program in the social sectors. Each line minister has held
discussions with stakeholder groups. According to Latvian law, draft reform proposals have been
published online, and social partners have been invited to participate in policy debates. The
government has co-operated with its social partners to get input on the overall strategy and
structural reform program. All ministries have published budget amendments on their web pages,
as well as strategy documents, monthly/quarterly implementation statistics, details of
consultations with non-governmental organizations and information on entitlements for social
service users. The World Bank team has accompanied government consultations with non-
government organizations (NGOs) representing constituents affected by the fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms.11 Consultation discussions have been difficult, but frank. There is a
growing understanding of the circumstances that lead to Latvia’s economic contraction.

39.    To increase public information and transparency, the SDPL program includes key
actions to publicize the activities and performance of the government. For the first operation
11
  These include the Association of Heads Teachers of Latvian Education and Association of Pre-Schools Teachers,
the Association of Local Governments, Association of International Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
(AFA), the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Employers’ Confederation of Latvia (LDDK), the Hospital
Owners Association, the Latvian Academy of Sciences, the patients organization SUSTENTO, the Trade Union of
Education and Science Employees (LIZDA), and the Union of Medical Professionals, the Trade Union of Specialists
of Health and Social Work. The list given here is not exhaustive: the Ministry of Health alone has consulted with
eighty-nine NGOs.


                                                     15
in the program, a critical prior action was that the government publishes its ESSNS on the
internet and in the local media. This action was intended to increase the level of public
awareness of the measures the government is taking to lower the social costs of fiscal
consolidation and the economic crisis. For the proposed second operation, the State Audit Office
of the Republic of Latvia published their audit report of the implementation of structural reforms
and the ESSNS, and the government published quarterly implementation reports for the SDPL
program on the internet. The aim is to inform the large number of involved NGOs and citizens
on the SDPL activities in order to inform discussions and to be in line with the general
framework of dissemination and consultation that the government has promoted.

              IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

4.1. LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

40.     Latvia joined the World Bank in 1992, and graduated from Bank financing in 2007.
As a borrowing member, it received analytical and advisory support and loans totaling US$416
million for 19 operations that have supported government actions to implement structural
reforms, improve public finance management, modernize the welfare system and the health,
education, and infrastructure sectors, and reduce pollution in the Baltic Sea. The last Country
Assistance Strategy for 2002-2005 was launched during the period when Latvia’s overriding
objective was to prepare for accession to the European Union—a goal which was achieved in
May 2004. Upon graduating from Bank financing, Latvia became a donor to the International
Development Agency (IDA) of the World Bank Group during the 15th replenishment of IDA.

41.     The global financial crisis led to an exceptional request by the government of Latvia
for renewed access to World Bank lending resources. The proposed operation is consistent
with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement. Pursuant to Article III, Section 4 (ii), the Bank may
make loans to any member country, subject to Board approval, if “[it] is satisfied that in the
prevailing market conditions the borrower would be unable otherwise to obtain the loan under
conditions which in the opinion of the Bank are reasonable for the borrower.” The crisis has
exposed underlying macro-vulnerabilities, and the deep economic contraction that followed left
Latvia with significant borrowing needs and constrained access to external financing on
reasonable terms. The World Bank delivered exceptional support to Latvia through SDPL
assistance comprising two parallel programs. To accompany this, a PER was conducted jointly
with the IMF in 2007, and a follow-up PER was conducted as part of a Bank program of
technical assistance in 2010. The proposed operation is the final operation under the SDPL
support program and would complete World Bank crisis lending activities in Latvia.

4.2. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

42.     Prior to graduating from World Bank borrowing, Latvia maintained an active
series of projects with the Bank. The program draws from these investment, technical
assistance, and adjustment operation activities as well as AAA. Structural reforms to social
protection in the 1990s were supported with resources from the Latvia Welfare Reform Project,
which closed with a highly satisfactory rating in 2003. The objective of the project was to
support the development of a more efficient and effective social welfare system. The Latvia
Health Reform Project—approved in 1998 and which closed in 2001 with a satisfactory


                                              16
outcome—supported government implementation of a health services restructuring strategy. The
Education Improvement Project helped to increase capacity within the Latvian education sector
for continuous improvement of education outcomes by strengthening the management of both
resource and inputs and the learning process.

43.     As part of the current international program of support for Latvia, the Bank
approved a Financial Sector Development Policy Loan on September 22, 2009 and a First
Safety Net and Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan (First Special Development
Loan, SDPL 1) on March 4, 2010. The Financial Sector DPL, which disbursed on November 4,
2009, supports a financial sector reform program, including measures aimed to contain the
financial sector crisis, and structural reforms aimed to enhance the resilience of the system to
future potential shocks. The crisis management measures include measures to strengthen the
banking sector’s solvency and liquidity, as well as measures to facilitate the renegotiations of
corporate and mortgage debts with the objective to avoid the closure of viable firms and the
foreclosure of residential properties wherever possible. The long-term structural reforms include
strengthening banking sector regulation, including asset quality and capital adequacy regulation,
strengthening prudential supervision, especially through the adoption of a Prompt Remedial
Action Plan by the supervisory authority, and conducting a consumer protection review.

4.3. COLLABORATION WITH THE EC AND IMF

44.    The Bank program is an integral part of the international rescue package of the
IMF, EC, EBRD, Nordic countries, and other lenders. The total rescue package amounts to
EUR 7.5 billion, of which the World Bank’s share is EUR 400 million. The Financial Sector loan
was for EUR 200 million. The SDPL 1 operation in the Safety Net Support and Social Sector
Reform program was for EUR 100 million. The proposed SDPL 2 would be for the final
EUR100 million of World Bank support. The IMF operation was approved on December 23,
2008 and the EC operation on January 20, 2009. The World Bank team has collaborated very
closely with the IMF and EC teams, and discussed complementarities and mutually-supportive
measures. The IMF has completed its staff visit for the Fourth Review under the Stand-by
Arrangement, and the IMF Executive Board meeting to discuss the Fourth Review is scheduled
for May 25, 2011.

4.4. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

45.     As macroeconomic imbalances became apparent, the government asked the IMF
and World Bank to conduct a PER in the summer of 2007. This assessment served as an
analytical input for the government’s initial program, revisions to the 2009 budget, and
formulation of the 2010 budget. It examined public investment and outcomes in the social
sectors and public administration, and identified a number of critical structural reforms. In 2010,
the World Bank updated the 2007 PER of the social sectors and public administration. The sector
analytical background presented in this document draws on the 2010 PER.

46.     The Latvia SDPL lending program has been accompanied by a technical assistance
program covering social sector and public administration reform. The Bank has limited
technical assistance resources, which are being deployed according to the following strategic
priorities to provide the technical input needed (in order): (i) to design and implement their


                                               17
ESSNS; (ii) to monitor and (where appropriate) evaluate the impact of ESSNS measures; and
(iii) to evaluate the state of the public expenditure program in 2010 in light of the extraordinary
adjustments that have taken place in 2009 and to assist the government in making strategic
decisions as further adjustments will be required in 2011 and 2012.

47.    The 2010 PER (completed in September 2010) examined options for fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms in health, education, social protection and public
administration. The results of the PER process were shared with the government during
numerous visits to Latvia from March to December 2010, with the aim of informing the budget
formulation process. This technical assistance investment forms the basis for the analysis of the
main challenges facing the policy areas to be supported by the SDPL 2 operation. In addition to
the 2010 PER, the World Bank has provided advisory support on the set-up of the impact
evaluation program for the Workplaces with Stipend (WWS) program.

            V. THE PROPOSED SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

5.1. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

48.     The Safety Net and Social Sector Reform Program focuses on measures to mitigate
the social cost of fiscal consolidation and to ensure a robust safety net for households
affected by the crisis. This is the second (proposed operation) of a program of two loans
focused on social safety net support and medium-term social sector expenditure reforms. The
objectives of the program are: (i) to protect vulnerable groups with emergency safety net support
during the economic contraction; (ii) to mitigate the social costs of fiscal consolidation; and (iii)
to ensure that structural reforms lay a foundation for medium-term improvements in the social
sectors. Given the deep impact Latvia has suffered in the wake of the global crisis, and due to the
emergency nature of this program, the first operation focused mainly on the first and second
objectives. The proposed second operation will expand this focus to the third objective, seeking
to support the structural reform program that the Latvian Government has put in place for the
social sectors. The results for each of the components of the program are summarized in the
following policy sectors, and the updated results and monitoring framework is given in Annex 8.

49.     The government has made good progress in implementing the SDPL program.
Latvia is on track to meet nine out of the eleven of the triggers for the second operation. Two of
the triggers have been merged, so the loan now has eight prior actions. The explanation for the
removal of one of the triggers on a social assistance evaluation report and another on health are
given in the following section. Annex 2 gives a description of the status of each trigger for SDPL
2, compares them to the proposed prior actions and gives a summary of progress under the
proposed prior action. The proposed SDPL 2 would support the expansion and deepening of
these reforms in four areas: (i) Implementation of the Emergency Social Safety Net; (ii) Social
Protection; (iii) Health; and (iv) Education, as described in the following sections.

5.2. POLICY AREAS

5.2(a) Overall Implementation of the Emergency Social Safety Net
50.   Latvia developed its ESSNS between June and August 2009, and started
implementing it on October 1, 2009. The Bank’s program supports the deployment of


                                                18
emergency safety net measures to mitigate the impact on households of fiscal adjustment and the
economic contraction. The first operation in the SDPL program supported the implementation of
the ESSNS to ensure adequate emergency safety net financing for education and health services,
and social protection programs. The proposed prior actions for the second SDPL focus on
continued implementation, and adequate financing and monitoring of the ESSNS (see Box 2).
Furthermore, the program is designed to increase public awareness, transparency and
accountability of government measures in the social sectors. The ESSNS package of measures is
expected to expire at the end of 2011.

 Box 2. Ensure adequate emergency safety net financing for education and health services, and social
 protection programs

 Actions taken prior to Board presentation of SDPL 1
  The Borrower's Cabinet of Ministers approved an Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS) for the
   period from October 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011 on September 8, 2009 (Protocol No. 56, 78§).
  The Borrower has published the Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy on the internet, and in local media on
   December 21, 2009.
  The Borrower has provided adequate resources for and put in place a performance monitoring and impact
   evaluation plan, making use of existing monitoring mechanisms, administrative data, and surveys.

 Prior action for Board presentation of SDPL 2
  The Borrower, through the national and local government agencies, has been satisfactorily implementing the
   Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy as indicated by the maintenance of adequate budget financing in 2010
   and 2011, and evidenced by regular performance monitoring reports submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers
   and publishing them on the web page of the Ministry of Welfare.
  The Borrower, through the Auditor General, has conducted on October 28, 2010 an independent audit of the
   Cabinet of Minister's performance in implementing the Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy.

 Outcome
  Emergency safety net measures are deployed and remain in place through 2011.
  Information on government’s implementation of ESSNS and structural reforms is independently assessed and
   publicly available.
  The independent Audit Report on ESSNS implementation is completed and published on the internet in
   October 2010, and the action plan of audit recommendations is put in place by October 2011.

 Note: A supporting measure, which was not a prior action for presentation of the operation to the Executive
 Board is indicated by italics.

51.     The first prior action for the SDPL 2 ensures adequate financing and monitoring of
the ESSNS in 2010 and 2011. The two indicative triggers given for the SDPL 2 were: “(i)
National and local government agencies are satisfactorily implementing the ESSNS, maintaining
adequate financing in 2010 and 2011”; and “(ii) The Borrower has submitted regular
performance monitoring reports on the ESSNS implementation to the Cabinet of Ministers and
published them on the web page of the Ministry of Welfare”. These have been amalgamated into
one prior action for the second loan “The National and local government agencies are
satisfactorily implementing the ESSNS as indicated by the maintenance of adequate budget
financing in 2010 and 2011, and evidence presented in regular performance monitoring reports
submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers and published on the web page of the Ministry of Welfare.”




                                                      19
52.    The ESSNS continued to be monitored on a quarterly basis and financed adequately
in 2010.12 The budget for ESSNS actions supported by the World Bank was increased by 37
percent by a supplemental budget in 2010. The planned budget including the supplemental
increase was LVL 81.3 million in 2010. By the end of 2010, LVL 79.1 million was spent, close
to 97 percent of the planned amount (Table 4). The expenditure needs of the Workplaces with
Stipend (WWS) program was higher than anticipated initially, while the demand for the
resources allocated for pupil transportation was lower than expected.

53.     Budget resources allocated for the WWS program in 2011 have been supplemented
by a reallocation of European Social Fund (ESF) resources, which brings the available
resources to an acceptable level. The initial budget allocation for 2011 was not sufficient for
the needs of the unemployed not covered by unemployment insurance, with the resources for the
program in 2011 having fallen by 45 percent compared to 2010, representing a halving in the
number of estimated participants. The EU’s ESF finances a large share of the program. The
government requested a reallocation of LVL 5 million of ESF resources into the WWS program.
The EC accepted the proposal in March 2011 and the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal
on April 12, 2011. The additional funding brings the WWS funding to about LVL 19.1 million
(compared to LVL 27.2 million in 2010).

54.     The WWS budget for 2011 is somewhat lower than would be needed to maintain the
same number of full-time equivalent places as in 2010. However, it is likely that the allocation
may prove adequate if the labor market conditions for potential participants improve in 2011.
The government plans to phase out the program by the end of 2011. This is consistent with the
plan for the World Bank-supported ESSNS, which when set up was given an expiry date of end-
2011. As a first step toward winding down the WWS, the government intends to decrease the
stipend from LVL 100 to LVL 80 per person per month from July 1, 2011. The reduction in the
stipend is intended to lead to a narrower targeting of the program, meaning that poorer people
will demand the program than those who would have demanded the program if the stipend was

12
     Available at http://www.lm.gov.lv/text/1843.


                                                              20
LVL 100. Those that quality for the WWS stipend from July 1, 2011, will only participate until
the end of 2011. The motivation for the stipend reduction is that as the economy recovers only
very poor households should access the WWS program, and households with other options
should take up employment opportunities as they arise. A risk is that if the employment situation
does not improve for the affected groups in 2011, it may be necessary to increase the WWS
resources to allow for more than the planned number of workplaces or to ensure that those
queuing for the program have access to Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI).

55.     The second prior action supports the independent audit of the Emergency Safety
Net, which government completed in October 2010. As part of the independent audit of the
ESSNS, the Borrower has evaluated coverage and targeting performance of municipal authorities
administering mandatory social assistance transfers; identified problems; and agreed to an action
plan of corrective measures to reduce targeting errors. A report published by the State Auditor’s
Office in October 2010 on the implementation of the ESSNS identified numerous targeting
errors and inconsistencies, was particularly critical of the targeting systems in place, and
identified important improvements for municipal social assistance offices and the Ministry of
Welfare.13 In an action plan to rectify the weaknesses found in the system, the Ministry of
Welfare—as the institution responsible for national policy and coordination of social
assistance—and other involved government agencies have agreed to undertake twenty-four
measures by October 2011 to strengthen compliance and the implementation of the ESSNS (see
Annex 5 for the Action Plan for the Implementation of the State Audit Recommendations for the
ESSN). The Action Plan measures are grouped around improving monitoring and compliance
with the rules for beneficiaries of the seven ESSNS measures supported by the World Bank loan.
The actions will serve not just to fortify the ESSNS, but also to improve nationally- and
municipally-administered social programs. In particular, the action plan goes some way to meet
problems of decentralized management of social assistance through clarifying qualifying criteria
and improving controls.

5.2(b) Social Protection
56.     In social protection, the proposed second operation would support actions to (i) re-
instate the contribution rate for the second pillar pension system and (ii) secure State-level
financing of the GMI benefit of at least 50 percent of the cost.

57.    As a third prior action, the proposed operation would support a modified goal to
restore the contribution rate for second pillar pensions to 6 percent by January 1, 2013
(Box 3). The government’s original target to restore pensions had been to effect the change on
January 1, 2012. Given the continued fiscal difficulties, the government has decided to retain the
6-percent target, but moved the timetable for its attainment to January 1, 2013. The trigger in the
SDPL 1 program was designed to reflect the policy commitment of the government to reinstate
second pillar contributions to 6 percent. The prior action has been, consequently, altered to
change the date from 2012 to 2013 due to fiscal pressures. The government passed the necessary
changes to the Law on State-Funded Pensions (Amendments to the Law on State Funded
Pensions (Grozījumi Valsts fondēto pensiju likumā ("LV", 206 (4398), 30.12.2010)) on

  The independent audit report has been published on the internet and discussed publicly. The State Audit Report on
the implementation of the ESSNS is publicly available at http://www.lrvk.gov.lv/ (including a summary in English
at http://www.lrvk.gov.lv/upload/PB_soc_drosiba_28Oct2010_EN.pdf ).

December 20, 2010. The provision passed sets out that the 6-percent contribution rate to the
funded tier will be effective on January 1, 2013. In April 2011 discussions, the government has
re-iterated its commitment to the sustainability of the three pillars of the pension system and to
restoring contributions to the second pillar to 6 percent of gross salaries by 2013, provided that
the budgetary situation improves in line with forecasts.

58.     As a fourth prior action, the government has ensured adequate funding of the GMI
program in its 2011 budget to cover 50 percent of its cost from State (central government)
resources. The government will continue to maintain the strengthened safety net for the poorest
households by co-financing from the State budget the GMI and housing benefits in 2011. Both
these programs were fully financed by local governments prior to the crisis. GMI and Housing
benefits are the only mandatory poverty targeted last resort social assistance programs (LRSA) in
Latvia and ensuring these programs have adequate financing while unemployment rates remain
high is crucial to protect the most vulnerable households from the effects of the crisis. The
targeting criteria for housing benefits is determined at the municipal level, but GMI is a top-up
benefit provided to all households whose per capita income is lower than LVL40 per month per
adult and LVL 45 per month per child. During the crisis, as municipality revenues fell and as
demand for LRSA programs increased, municipalities began to ration new LRSA applications.
The State government’s decision to co-finance LRSA spending, introduced in the ESSNS in
2009 (co-financing 50 percent of spending on GMI and 20 percent of spending on the housing
benefit) helped to ensure adequate financing for these programs at the local government level.

59.    The government has maintained the 2011 budget allocation for State co-financing of
the GMI program at close to actual spending levels in 2010. The provision for co-financing of
GMI has been made within the ESSNS budget (discussed in section 5.2 (a)). The latest data
shows that while unemployment is on average slowly falling, there has not been a recovery in
employment for the population with basic education or less. In addition, the number of people
defined as needy and the number of GMI participants have been steadily increasing throughout
2010. Keeping state resources for the GMI program in 2011 at close to the levels of 2010 will
contribute much to ensuring that local governments, especially those that cover poorer
communities, have adequate resources to meet social assistance needs in 2011.

60.     The government is making important changes to improve the performance of the
GMI social assistance program based on the State Auditor’s report. The State Auditor report
mentioned under 5.2(a) above led to an agreement between the Ministry of Welfare and other
involved government agencies on an action plan to address the findings of the Report. These
were: (i) some ineligible households were being enrolled into the GMI program because all the
regulatory requirements were not being met; (ii) changes in welfare status were not always
known because of a lack of coordination across institutions; and (iii) rules were not enforced
uniformly, meaning that some types of households were held to a different standard than other
households. An action plan has been agreed to remedy these weaknesses through compliance and
control measures to be put in place by October 2011 (see Annex 5).

61.    The SDPL 2 indicative trigger for the Borrower to carry out an evaluation of social
assistance programs across municipalities is subsumed under the second prior action
referred to above (audit of the ESSN). The indicative trigger was “The Borrower has prepared
an evaluation of how uniform standards of coverage, targeting, benefits, and financing of


                                              22
municipally administered, mandatory social assistance programs are implemented across
governments, based in part on an evaluation of the experience under the ESSNS.” The indicative
trigger has been dropped, because rather than one assessment, this activity is now viewed as a
sequence of evaluations that need to be carried out building on the data collected and
recommendations of each assessment. Two key evaluations are the audit report and the impact
evaluation of the WWS program.

 Box 3. Social protection

 Actions taken prior to Board presentation of SDPL 1
  The Borrower enacted an amendment to the Law “On Insurance in Case of Unemployment” effective as of
   July 1, 2009, which extends the pay-out period of unemployment benefits to 9 months, effective until
   December 31, 2011, which, inter alia, provides for a decrease in the eligibility requirement for unemployment
   benefits to 9 months of contributions in the previous 12 months.
  The Borrower: (a) enacted an amendment to the Regulations of the Cabinet Ministers No. 1070 dated October
   1, 2009 and No. 1489 dated December 1, 2009 to increase the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) benefit
   amount to LVL 40 per adult and LVL 45 per child in a household; and (b) allocated financing in the 2010
   budget of, at least, 50 percent of the cost of the GMI from state funds, with local governments funding the
   other 50 percent.
  The Borrower introduced amendments to the Cabinet of Ministers Regulation No. 166, dated July 14, 2009 to
   provide temporary employment for the unemployed not covered by unemployment insurance effective as of
   August 8, 2009.

 Prior actions for Board presentation of SDPL 2
  The Borrower has enacted an amendment to the Law on the State Funded Pensions which increased the
   contribution rate to the funded pension pillar to 6 percent of a worker's salary starting from January 1, 2013.
  The Borrower has allocated at least 50 percent of the cost of the guaranteed minimum income in the 2011
   budget, with local governments funding the other 50 percent.

 Outcomes
  Percentage of unemployment benefit recipients whose benefits are extended by the reform to reach 22% in
   2011.
  Individual contributions to the funded pension pillar have risen from 2% in 2009 to 6% from January 1, 2013.
  Municipalities have sufficient financial resources to make timely payment of GMI benefit to all eligible
   individuals.
  Participants in the emergency public works program equaled on average 19,000 (16% of the unemployed not
   receiving unemployment benefits) and 16,500 (13% of the unemployed not receiving unemployment
   benefits) in 2010 and 2011, respectively.


62.     Through technical assistance, the World Bank will continue to support the
government’s efforts to evaluate the impact of the WWS program (see Annex 6). Bank
teams have already assisted the government with advice on evaluation design, survey
questionnaire formulation, and sampling strategy. The impact evaluation of the WWS is
particularly important for Latvia because a culture of rigorous evaluation is nascent. In addition,
given the importance and visibility of the WWS program in the government’s ESSNS,
information and learning about the efficacy and efficiency of the program will be useful when
planning future crisis responses in Latvia and elsewhere in the region. As part of the evaluation,
a dataset of 3,000 households has been produced and is being analyzed by researchers at the
University of Latvia.




                                                       23
63.     The government is in the process of formulating a longer-term employment policy
strategy. The longer-term vision for active labor market programs in Latvia is a demand-driven
model of worker training and retraining. The shift to a demand-driven model entails a move from
the training provider subsidization model to one that subsidizes eligible workers using vouchers.
The voucher recipients would have the freedom to choose the training course and the provider.
Over time, the emergency public works program would be phased out and a voucher-based
worker training and retraining program would be established. This move is an important part of
the government’s plan to shift away from a the crisis response of providing immediate income
support, to the “steady state,” longer-term stance of building and sustaining the human capital to
keep Latvia’s workforce productive and competitive. However, recognizing the need to help
participants cover their costs during this transition, a LVL 70 a month stipend is included.

5.2(c) Health
64.     The introduction of a safety net for health care by the Ministry of Health in 2009
was a policy departure; previously, there had been limited focus on health care access for
the poor. Prior to 2009, the Ministry of Health managed an exemption list of 26 types of patients
who paid zero or a reduced copayment when it was required. Expenditures for these exemptions
were dominated by children under 18, patients being treated for mental illness, pregnant women,
and cancer patients. Only two of the 26 groups qualified specifically on income grounds:
“officially recognized poor people,” and “patients whose monthly pension is less than 60 Lats.”
They were required to pay half the normal co-payments but accounted for only 2.4 percent of the
total exemption subsidies provided by the Ministry of Health in 2008. After paying the 50
percent co-payment upfront, individuals could seek re-imbursement from municipalities.
However, such assistance was not mandatory and fiscally-constrained municipalities had a
budget motivation to limit assistance.

65.     As a fifth prior action, the government has improved the coverage of health care co-
payments for the needy (see Box 4). This measure replaces an indicative trigger that the
Borrower develop a plan to target all health subsidies through the means-tested approach of the
safety net program.14 The Ministry of Health has created Latvia’s first centrally-financed health
care program targeted to low-income households.15 Improvements to the program in 2011

14
   As an indicative trigger for SDPL 2, the Ministry of Health originally proposed to eliminate all 26 existing
categories of exemptions and fold them into the means-tested safety net program. That proposal was rejected by the
Cabinet of Ministers, however, and a decision was made to maintain existing exemptions, while expanding the
exemption scheme to cover eligible needy patients. The replacement prior condition represents an improvement of
the means-tested targeting program that simultaneously contributes to financial protection for vulnerable households
and to the restructuring of the health care system to improve services for all Latvians, particularly by de-
institutionalizing care for the chronically ill and patients with mental problems that are better managed on an
outpatient basis.
15
   The “needy” line was defined as those households with a per capita income of LVL 90 per month. It is
administered—but not funded—by municipalities, which certify eligible families. Because of the nature of some of
the new services that are covered, both hospitals and family doctors also have an incentive to make sure qualified
patients are enrolled. To encourage a reduction in the use of inpatient care, the poor also became eligible for free
overnight “hotel” stays in hospitals (in connection with health interventions that had previously been inpatient
procedures), for home care in the case of the chronically ill, and for day care for the mentally ill. In this way the
Ministry of Health intended to incentivize providers to adopt alternatives to inpatient stays by subsidizing these
options completely for the poor. Under the program, if the individual meets the “needy” or “near-needy” criteria, no
cash changes hands because the provider or pharmacy claims the co-payment directly from the Ministry of Health.


                                                       24
include the following. First, support to the needy for pharmaceutical co-payments was originally
designed as a stop-loss measure, fully financing prescription drugs each quarter after the patient
had incurred LVL12.5 in out-of-pocket costs. In February 2010, this requirement was dropped,
and eligible households now have no out-of-pocket payment requirement. Second, the income
limit for eligible households for the pharmaceutical benefit was raised from LVL90 to LVL120.
Third, eligibility for zero co-payments for most services was also raised from LVL90 to
LVL120, and households with per capita income between LVL120 and LVL150 received a 50
percent subsidy. In August 2010, the Ministry began financing the entire cost of services for
these patients, not just the co-payment, as providers did not have adequate financing outside the
safety net to deliver the services. Fourth, fees for home care and day care for mentally ill patients
were eliminated for all the population of Latvia in August 2010. These four changes were
initiated over the course of 2010 and continue in 2011 as part of the ESSNS.

 Box 4. Health

  Actions taken prior to Board presentation of SDPL 1
  The Borrower provided for an additional public health nurse for approximately half of the general
   practitioners and primary health care providers in the emergency social safety net and financed it fully in the
   2010 budget pursuant to the Cabinet of Ministers Regulation No. 1630 dated December 22, 2009.
  The Borrower allocated in the 2010 budget funds for households with per-capita income less than half the
   minimum wage, at adequate levels, to finance: (a) an exemption from co-payments for general practitioner,
   outpatient, specialist, and inpatient services; (b) an exemption from pharmaceutical charges above LVL 50
   per year per person; and (c) an exemption from the cost of overnight hotel stays in hospitals, home care for
   those with serious diseases and day-care centers for those with mental diseases.

 Prior actions for Board presentation of SDPL 2
  The Borrower, through the Cabinet of Minister’s Regulations # 1046, dated December 19, 2006, as amended,
   has implemented the measures to: (a) strengthen the exemption program for health payments by eliminating
   all out-of-pocket health payments for visits, tests, and pharmaceuticals for patients classified as "needy"; (b)
   provide a limited package of benefits for patients as their incomes exceed the "needy" line; and (c) provide
   outpatient psychiatric and home care for chronic diseases without cost to all the population of Latvia.
  The Borrower has strengthened primary health care services program in the 2010 and 2011 budget through a
   planned expansion of the additional public health nurse or physician’s assistant program to primary care
   practices and a family physician advisory telephone service.

 Outcomes
  Increased hours and outreach services at the Primary Health Care level to compensate in part for reduced
   financing of specialist and hospital care.
  People from households certified as needy are exempt from health service copayments; are receiving
   subsidized prescriptions; and retain access to critical health care services.
  The share of GPs with an extra public health nurse increased from 0% in 2009 to about 21% of GPs in 2010,
   and is to reach 36% in 2011.


66.     As a sixth prior action supported by SDPL 2, the Ministry of Health has prepared a
plan for further strengthening primary health care service and general practitioners and
has started to implement this plan. The government strengthened, initially, approximately 300
general and primary care practices by adding an additional public health nurse (with a possibility
of reaching 500 practices by end-2011). The purpose of this intervention was to increase hours
and outreach services at the primary care level. In implementation, the ministry added a poverty
criterion to determine eligibility of practices for this supplement, so that the initial deployment


                                                       25
targeted poorer rural practices. Based on the positive initial experience with the intervention—an
increase in patient visits by 30 percent in practices with the additional nurse—the Ministry of
Health plans to deploy it to all primary care practices over the next several years. In addition, the
Ministry of Health used safety net funds to begin developing a family physician advisory
telephone service to connect patients to a doctor after hours and on weekends (when family
doctor offices are closed), a low-cost method to extend access to primary care services 24 hours
a day across the country. This service is aimed at the chronically ill and others who have an acute
episode during off hours that otherwise might precipitate an emergency ambulance call or an
emergency hospital visit. This service begins May 1, 2011.

67.     The safety net implementation by the Ministry of Health in 2010 is judged to be in
line with its commitments. While the Ministry of Health substantially overestimated the take-up
of the program, month-by-month volumes increased in 2010 and it used the extra funds to make
pro-poor adjustments to the program, such as dropping the deductible for covered
pharmaceuticals, reducing the ratcheting effect of the single cut-off for eligibility (by adding
income levels with reduced benefits), and making sure hospitals could finance services for the
poor by fully covering the cost (not just the co-payment). As noted above, even with these
expansions, funds were left that were used to encourage structural reforms to shift, where
appropriate, inpatient care to day hospital settings, to outpatient settings for a larger share of
mental services, and to home care for noncomplex longer term care.

68.     The State Auditor’s review of the ESSNS concluded that there were several
problems with implementation of the health portion of the program. First, because subsidies
for co-payments and pharmaceuticals depend on certification of eligibility for the GMI
allowance, the auditor concluded that these subsidies are put in jeopardy by the poor
performance of the certification system (as explained in the social protection section below).
Second, the initial implementation of the additional nurse or physician’s assistant program
targets physicians with relatively more needy people on their rosters of registered patients. The
auditor found that there was no systematic effort to match the entire patient list against a local
welfare department’s list of eligible households. Instead, family doctors tended to justify their
applications for an additional nurse by calculating just the proportion of patients eligible for
safety net assistance who showed up at the office in a given time period. Third, the auditor found
that compensation to hospitals for hotel costs of needy patients exceeded the cost of providing
these services, that the services were poorly specified (2 of 44 hospitals only provide a bed, but
18 provide a bed, food, and medical supervision, for example), and that some hospitals charged
private patients less for the same service than they charged the government for patients it
covered.

69.    The Ministry of Health is required to report by October 2011 how it has addressed
these problems. It considers the first issue to be outside its control, but will work with the
Ministry of Welfare and local governments to address it in the short term. On the second issue,
the Ministry of Health will ask GPs to cross check their lists with the municipality and has the
power to remove the subsidy for the second nurse if they do not cooperate. By expanding the
program to all GPs though, this issue will ultimately become moot. On both issues, the Ministry
of Health would invest more effort to solve the problem permanently if the safety net programs
are continued beyond 2011. In that case, the first best solution from their standpoint would be a
nationally automated certification system so they could match it to their payments center patient


                                                26
data. A second best solution would be to work directly with local governments to improve
certification for the health programs, which is less efficient, but the ministry already works with
them regularly on other health matters. Therefore, the Ministry of Health is confident that it
could overcome the problem. On the third issue, during the next six months the overnight stay
hotel service will be reviewed and better defined, and the tariff will be modified to be in line
with costs for the service.

5.2(d) Education
70.      Latvia has met the indicative triggers in education (prior actions seven and eight in
Box 5). In education, there are two indicative triggers for the safety net. First, the government
agreed to maintain funding for 5- and 6-year old pre-school education. In the Ministry of
Education and Science budget, some safety net funds were put aside for improving the
curriculum and materials for pre-schools and primary schools. This activity is funded in 2011 at
LVL 949,703. More importantly, the earmarked grant to local governments for pre-school
education was LVL12.3 million in 2010 and remains the same in the 2011 budget. Enrollments
in the program have steadily expanded, reaching 68,512 in 2008 and 71,057 in 2010, bucking the
trend toward lower enrollments at all other levels of the system. This program is well
institutionalized and will continue beyond the safety net.

71.      The second program in the safety net is the provision of transportation to another
school for children whose schools have been closed, if needed. The Ministry of Education and
Science has established a benchmark that children will not have to spend more than 60 minutes
being transported one way to school. However, the transportation program has been implemented
by the Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government16, and two methods have been
chosen. First, as part of the development of the ESSNS, the Cabinet of Ministers issued Order
No 51 on August 4, 2009, which specified that beginning on May 29, 2009 and ending
December 31, 2011, children enrolled in liquidated education and training institutions would be
compensated 100 percent for travel to and from their homes to their new schools. The
municipality was made responsible either to provide public transportation for these students or to
buy tickets for them to use private transportation. The central government would compensate the
municipalities for 90 percent of the cost up to LVL2.50 per school day per student. The forms
and directions for reimbursement are on the State Regional Development Agency website.17 Prior
to this, some local governments did provide funding for the transportation of students, but there
was no particular program in place to ensure transportation costs were met for all children
impacted by the closure of schools.

72.    In addition, the Regional Development Agency prioritized those municipalities
needing to transport students for the receipt of school buses. Eighty-eight municipalities
were chosen to receive 209 school buses, of which 110 buses were financed under a project
called “Implementation of local governments’ activities by ensuring transportation of school
children and related support measures.” This project entailed a procurement process, which was
begun in the fall of 2009, but the first buses were not delivered until September 29, 2010, a full

   The Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government was incorporated in the Ministry of the
Environment and a new institution—the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development—was
established from January 1, 2011.

year after the safety net had been put in place. Fifty-nine municipalities were to receive 110
buses with total co-financing by Switzerland of LVL7.4 million under the Latvian-Swiss
Cooperation Program. The procurement procedures were completed and bus purchase made by
fifty-eight municipalities by the end of 2010. According to the Order No. 446 issued by the
Cabinet of Ministers on July 30, 2010, and Order No. 539, on September 13, 2010, the remaining
99 schools buses were financed under the emergency social safety net. Most of these buses were
purchased in 2010 and some will be acquired in 2011.

 Box 5. Education

 Actions taken prior to Board presentation of SDPL 1
  The Borrower allocated funds in the 2010 budget for pre-primary education/child development programs for
   children starting 5 years of age.
  The Borrower allocated in the 2010 budget funds to cover the cost of transportation of students whose
   schools have closed to replacement schools.
  The Borrower added into the Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 740, dated August 24, 2004 social
   considerations, in addition to merit, to the awarding of state support to students in higher education by issuing
   a Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers No.511 dated June 2, 2009.

 Prior actions for Board presentation of SDPL 2
  The Borrower has allocated in the 2011 budget adequate financing for pre-primary education/child
   development programs for children starting from the age of 5 years old.
  In the 2011 budget, the Borrower has allocated adequate financing to cover the cost of transporting students
   whose schools have closed to replacement schools.

 Outcomes
  Enrollment of 5 and 6 year old children in free pre-primary programs is maintained at least at 94% for 5 year
   olds, and 98% for 6 year olds in 2011.
  The Borrower has allocated in the 2011 budget adequate financing to cover the cost of transporting to
   replacement schools students whose schools have closed.
  Share of children from closed schools receiving assistance for school transportation under the State-
   subsidized scheme reaches at least 77% in 2011 (it increased from 0% prior to May 2009 to 88% in 2010).


73.     Thus, the government provided two options to municipalities to implement the
program, and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development has
been tracking the affected students. In 2010, 76 percent of students from reorganized and
closed municipality schools received transportation assistance (2023 out of 2657). The duration
of the commute for the majority of students was within the 60 minute target each way, with only
0.5 percent of total number of students having to commute for over 60 minutes. The number of
students who received transportation compensation particularly grew in the fourth quarter of
2010 and reached 2349 or 88 percent of the total number of affected students. So far for 2011,
the percentage of affected students receiving compensation remains at 88 percent. The duration
of the commute this year also has been kept within the target, with only 10-11 students having to
make trips of longer than 60 minutes. At all levels, government made an effort to prevent
children from dropping out of school and to offset transportation problems for them. The
measures have been institutionalized and improved based on the experience of the first year,




                                                       28
along with the availability of additional transportation options ushered in by the new school
buses.18

74.     The SDPL 1 supported improving the targeting of state support to students in
higher education. In this regard, an amendment to the Cabinet Regulation on Scholarships was
passed on June 2, 2009 (No. 511), adding social considerations, in addition to merit, as a
criterion for awarding state support to students in higher education. The result has been an
increase in the proportion of students qualifying for state financial support for university based
on social criteria, with the share increasing from 39 percent in 2009 to 60 percent at end-2010.
However, a case has been initiated in the Constitutional Court of Latvia on the non-compliance
of the June 2, 2009 Amendment (No. 511) with the constitution. This has the potential to reverse
the reform.

                              VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

6.1. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

75.     The policies supported by the SDPL program are expected to have a significant
positive social impact, particularly by mitigating the adverse effects of the economic crisis
for the poorer groups in society. The measures in the program have been designed to protect
the funding of basic needs and services for low income households and to boost expenditure on
programs targeted to people affected by the crisis. There follows a discussion of the likely impact
of the measures supported by the program.

76.    Increasing the eligibility threshold at which GMI is provided is expected to have a
positive social impact. This reform has two impacts. First, it leads to higher coverage, and
second, it results in larger transfers to poor households; in doing so, it lowers the poverty gap. In
addition, the state co-financing of GMI allowed a substantial increase in the number of
beneficiaries from 21 thousand in October 2009 to 75 thousand in February 2011 (covering 3.4
percent of the population).

77.     Increasing the incomes of unemployed people either through augmented
unemployment benefits or the provision of public works has positive poverty and social
impacts. Unemployed people are disproportionately represented among the poor in Latvia.
Improving their welfare without affecting incentives to seek regular work is crucial. In this
regard, the government has taken two steps to raise the incomes of poorer households—
increasing the unemployment benefit duration to 9 months and introducing the WWS public
works program. Neither of the measures is likely to have a significant impact on incentives to
rejoin the formal labor force when the labor market starts to recover, because the unemployment
benefit top-up is low and because the public works stipend is lower than the minimum wage.

78.    The health sector measures are intended to lower household financial vulnerability
to the cost of treatment and to broaden access to health care. With more people in poverty
and losing employment, medical care has become more difficult for people to privately finance.
To mitigate these effects, the government is protecting financing for primary health care

provision. Each person has a family doctor, and funding has been protected for this service. By
adding funding for an additional public health nurse, the goal is to enhance the provision of
primary care. It should be noted that while the health system is being re-oriented to strengthen
primary care, needy households do continue to receive the care they require in health facilities
free of charge.

79.     The exemption of low-income households from health co-payments is intended to
lower the burden of out-of-pocket payments substantially. Instead of having to pay first, and
then apply for a partial refund from the municipal social assistance office, anyone in Latvia
certified as needy is eligible to go to their family doctor and receive care free of charge, with the
insurance system covering the co-payment. With referrals from their GP, other services are
treated in the same way. In addition, pharmaceutical charges for covered drugs are financed fully
once the patient has paid a small out of pocket. This measure is a complementary to the previous
one—trying to get the needy households in particular to use their GPs. The measure is intended
to eliminate variations across localities in assistance and create an incentive for the poor to seek
care—exactly what is needed if the health system is to contribute to better outcomes. The impact
of this measure was enhanced in 2010 when the Ministry of Health increased the needy threshold
to cover a greater proportion of lower income earners.

80.     The protection of financing for pre-primary education for 5- and 6-year old children
that is supported by the SDPL program is likely to have long-term, positive social impacts.
International evidence consistently shows that pre-school education performs a vital role in
improving learning opportunities for children from low-income and poor households. Economic
literature suggests that these programs have a strong impact on the later success of children in
school. Local governments are charged with the provision of preschool education. Following the
onset of the crisis, there was a risk that the poorer municipalities would not be able to continue
financing these programs. Therefore, the World Bank supported the introduction of an earmarked
subsidy from the state to protect the provisions of pre-school program education. In its absence,
poorer localities would have had great difficulty in maintaining participation. Participation in
pre-school programs has been maintained at the pre-crisis rate of 98 percent (for 6 year olds). Of
total participants, 24.5 percent were from the lowest income quintile.

6.2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

81.     The specific policies supported by the proposed development policy loan are not
likely to have significant effects on Latvia’s environment, forests, and other natural
resources. Unanticipated and unintended risks of adverse effects to the environment and natural
resources are likely to be minor. Latvia has adequate environmental controls in place. Latvia’s
environmental legislation and regulation is reinforced by EU environmental directives, including
the EU’s guidelines on adoption of environmental assessments at the planning and programming
level (June 2001) and the EU’s Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for
damage to properties and natural resources (April 2007).

6.3. IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION

82.   In putting in place the ESSNS, procedures and adequate financing were
incorporated to allow close monitoring of its implementation and evaluation of its impact.


                                                30
On monitoring, the government regularly monitors around 35 indicators pertaining to the ESSNS
and publishes the information on the internet.19 Baseline and updated data are provided by the
respective specialized agencies for the pertinent functions and tracked according to the indicators
and outcome measures as shown in the Monitoring and Results Framework (see Annex 8).

83.     The State Audit Office of the Republic of Latvia (SAO) has evaluated the
government’s performance in implementing the ESSNS supported by the proposed loan.
The State Audit Office reports independently to Parliament and is a key institution for public
sector accountability. The audit of the ESSNS has been has been disseminated by the State Audit
Office, including being made publicly-available on the internet. The audit made extensive use of
country databases and information to cross-check the implementation of the ESSNS at the
national and municipal level against the stated policies and aims of the program. The audit came
up with a number of recommendations for improving control and compliance for the
implementation of the ESSNS strategy, and the relevant government agencies have agreed to an
Action Plan to put in place these recommendations by October 2011 (see Annex 5 for the action
plan). The audit and its use by the government represent an innovative use of country systems by
the government of Latvia to monitor and evaluate a Bank-supported program, and to use the
results to improve implementation and results. Given the complex nature of structural reforms
and emergency assistance supported by the program of development policy lending, it would
have been difficult for the Bank team to conduct such a comprehensive and thorough evaluation,
and hence, the SDPL series has benefitted much from the institutional set-up for conducting
audits of government programs in Latvia.

6.4. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.4(a) Public Financial Management System and Budgetary Resources
84.    The most recent World Bank diagnostic work are the 2007 and 2010 PERs, which
focused on selected sectors of public expenditure. This analytical work was complemented for
the purpose of this development policy loan with ongoing monitoring by the World Bank of
Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms and previous diagnostic work conducted by other
external organizations.

85.     Overall, the Latvian PFM system is supported by a well-established legal and
institutional framework. In recent years Latvia has introduced a series of PFM reforms and
enhancements. The most significant reforms were the phased introduction of program and
performance based budgeting, a medium term expenditure framework, capacity building at the
State Audit Office, and implementation of the web based IT system supporting budget planning
and execution, separate reporting on EU funded projects. These reforms have resulted in a
stronger PFM system characterized by centralized cash management within a single treasury
account structure, a web-based on line reporting system updated twice per month, timely
submission of audited government financial statements and strong audit capacity at the State


19
  The Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government had the initial responsibility for monitoring
implementation of the ESSNS, and for submitting regular reports to the Cabinet of Ministers on progress. This
responsibility shifted to the Ministry of Welfare following a restructuring of government ministries on January 1,
2011.


                                                        31
Audit Office (supported by private sector sworn auditors) involved in auditing the Bank of
Latvia and local governments.

86.     In spite of these accomplishments, there are still areas where further improvement
is needed, especially in “on the ground" implementation of the most recent reforms. More
efforts are required in: improvement of the budgetary framework allowing for counter-cyclical
fiscal policies, proper implementation of medium-term planning and performance budgeting,
adequate budgetary expenditures monitoring and enforcement also at the local government level,
effective control over the state owned enterprises, better and more transparent tax administration,
resolving deficiencies in accounting at the ministerial and local government level resulting in
negative audit opinions, and stricter accountability framework for the sector ministries.

87.    Based on the above status of PFM in Latvia, the fiduciary risk associated with the
proposed program of operations is moderate. Nevertheless, some governance risks remain,
and therefore the special role of the independent State Auditor is being maintained for this
operation.

6.4(b) Foreign Exchange Environment
88.     The Bank of Latvia is a member of the European System of Central Banks, and its
legal independence is granted by the Law on the Bank of Latvia. The main objective of the
Bank of Latvia is maintaining price stability in Latvia and the primary tasks include management
of foreign currency and gold reserves. The Bank of Latvia acts also as advisor to the Parliament
and the government with regard to the monetary policy, following ECB practice. The Bank of
Latvia does not engage in any commercial activity, and its operations related to the execution of
its tasks are mainly financed from income from the management of foreign currency and gold
reserves. The Parliament has supervisory role over the Bank of Latvia.

89.     The IMF completed a Safeguards Assessment of the Bank of Latvia in July 2009 and
the World Bank reviewed external audit reports of the central bank. The Bank of Latvia
financial management and operations are transparently disclosed and presented on its website.
The Bank of Latvia’s annual financial statements are regularly audited by the audit commission,
whose members are approved by the Auditor General of the Republic of Latvia, and the most
recent audit reports, for 2007-09 have unqualified audit opinions. The IMF’s 2009 Safeguard
Assessment concluded that the Bank of Latvia operates robust internal audit and control system.
The recommendations included (i) establishing a formal arrangement between the Bank of Latvia
and Treasury related to the Treasury’s reserves holding, managing and reporting, (ii) amending
of the mandate of the Bank of Latvia audit committee, and (iii) improving the financial statement
disclosures. The authorities have already started implementation of the IMF recommendations.

6.5. DISBURSEMENT, AUDITING AND PROCUREMENT

90.     The proposed lending program will follow the World Bank’s disbursement
procedures for development policy lending. Loan proceeds will be disbursed in one tranche to
the foreign currency account at the Bank of Latvia. Disbursement will be made upon Borrower
meeting prior actions and declaration of loan effectiveness and submission of a withdrawal
application to the IBRD. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the IBRD will deposit the
proceeds of the loan into the deposit account at the Bank of Latvia which forms part of the


                                               32
country’s official foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of
the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount is credited to the Single Treasury Account also
kept in the Bank of Latvia and that is available to finance budgeted expenditures. Disbursements
will not be linked to specific purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The
government shall maintain accounts and records with respect to the deposit of loan proceeds in
the Bank of Latvia. If the loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the loan
agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to refund the amount directly to IBRD.

91.     No additional fiduciary arrangements will be required beyond the role of the State
Auditor. The Bank will not require an audit of the deposit account, but will require the
government to provide a confirmation to the Bank in the form of an official letter from the
Ministry of Finance on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the
budget management system (Single Treasury Account) within 30 days of receiving the funds. As
noted, the State Auditor will continue her special role in this second operation.

                            VII. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

92.    Risks to the program of lending are moderate to high. The risks are related to the
economy, political support for the ongoing fiscal adjustment program, the negative social impact
of the crisis, fiscal contraction, and continued high unemployment. Program risks include the
possible adoption of a more gradual timetable for the restoration of second pillar pension
contributions than that supported by the World Bank’s SDPL loan series.

93.    Economic risks are moderate. Overall, the macroeconomic outlook has notably
improved since the previous World Bank loan was approved and risks have diminished. Growth
performance was better than expected in 2010, as was the fiscal outturn. An improvement in
external conditions, particularly the fast recovery of key export partners was an important factor.
The macroeconomic policies implemented prior to and during the global crisis have helped to
reduce macroeconomic imbalances. The improved economic outlook and achievements of the
government’s stabilization program have resulted in increased confidence in the exchange rate
peg as evidenced by declining interest rates and a better outlook for sovereign credit ratings. But
downside risks remain. These include a weaker than expected recovery in the EU and contagion
from increased sovereign risk in some Eurozone countries. A worsening external environment
could slow down growth in Latvia and possibly delay the ambitious fiscal consolidation plans.

94.     Political risks are moderate to high. Political risks relate to the challenge of
maintaining the support of the governing coalition and society at large for the ongoing fiscal
stabilization program. The outcome of the parliamentary election on October 2, 2010—with the
coalition now headed by Prime Minister Dombrovskis winning 58.6 percent of the vote—was an
endorsement for the position of the Prime Minister who had campaigned on the need for
additional fiscal cuts in order for the country to join the Eurozone by 2014. While these election
results show some backing for the fiscal adjustment program, the 2011 budget consolidation
discussions revealed tension within the governing coalition on identifying fiscal cuts to meet EC-
IMF program targets.

95.     Social risks are moderate. The severe economic contraction, high unemployment and
large fiscal adjustment have entailed heavy social costs for Latvia. However, despite the difficult


                                               33
economic conditions faced by the population, social stability has endured. The last large street
protests occurred in January and February 2009. The lack of widespread protest and the results of
the 2010 national election indicate a certain public acceptance of measures taken to stabilize the
economy. The option for Latvians to migrate abroad—which was greatly facilitated by the
accession to the EU in 2004—has provided an alternative opportunity for those facing
unemployment or diminishing wages, and possibly reduced the social tension caused by the
economic contraction.

96.     The implementation risks for the program supported by the SDPL loan series are
moderate for 2011. The performance of the government in implementing its ESSNS has been
impressive, and the recommendations of the State Auditor will only improve it. It appears that
budgetary provisions in 2011 are for the most part adequate, so risks associated with the ESSNS
are expected to be minimal in 2011. With regard to the structural reform agenda, there has been
much progress in the implementation of reforms by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of
Education and Science. There is a risk that there may be a reversal of the structural reform
program if fiscal pressures ease and political pressures for increasing schools/hospital
infrastructure and staffing mount. On education, a court case has been initiated to challenge the
constitutionality of the addition of social considerations to the criteria for awarding state support
to students in higher education. This has the potential to reverse the reform supported by SDPL
1. Regarding pensions, the government has reiterated its commitment to preserving the
sustainability of the three pillars of the pension system and to restoring contributions to the
second pillar to 6 percent of gross salaries by 2013, provided that the budgetary situation
improves in line with forecasts. There is, however, a risk that a more gradual restoration in the
second pillar pension contributions may occur and that the 6 percent rate may not be put in place
by 2013.

97.     Overall, governance risks are moderate in Latvia. The government operates a highly
transparent budget system and all government documents—including draft policies—are
published on the web.20 Inevitably, corruption risks will remain, but are mitigated by the
transparent budget process, the role and strength of the State Auditor, and its Anti-Corruption
Bureau and supported by the SDPL 2. The government has already shown its willingness to take
action even against political figures found to be involved in corruption.

98.      The SDPL program will help to mitigate the economic and social risks of the
stabilization program. The proposed SDPL 2 facilitates the fiscal reforms in the social sectors.
The technical assistance program that has accompanied the SDPL program has supported the
fiscal stabilization program. In supporting the implementation of the ESSNS, the SDPL program
lowers the social costs inflicted by the rapid fiscal adjustment and sector structural reforms. In
supporting the monitoring and making public the results of the ESSNS—including the use of
country systems to audit, evaluate and feed into program re-design—the SDPL supports greater
governance and accountability.

         ANNEX 3: SOCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY ISSUES


(a) Social Protection

1.      The economic crisis exposed systemic problems with Latvia’s social welfare system
that were addressed temporarily by the ESSNS. As explained below, the State-financed social
welfare system is for the most part not targeted and provides low benefits to a broad base. The
unemployment insurance system was designed for short bouts of unemployment and contains
strong incentives to obtain another job. The only national entitlements that are means tested are
the GMI and housing assistance. However, these targeted benefits are financed at the local level,
where eligibility is also determined, albeit against national standards.

2.      Transfers under Latvia’s Social Insurance system have been maintained to a large
degree. After the decision to reduce pensions, which took effect July 1, 2009, was reversed by
judicial decree, only limited pension measures of been enacted to reduce the high cost of
pensions, as detailed below. The result is that other parts of the budget must bear the brunt of
cuts, resulting in the extraordinary cuts in other programs, such as health, all levels of education,
and science that are included in this document. In addition, the second pillar has been diverted to
finance first pillar deficits, and increases in taxes are paid by active economic agents for the most
part. Many of the benefits enjoyed by pensioners were added during the boom years just
preceding the crisis, and these for the most part have been maintained despite the effort at
internal depreciation in all other parts of the economy. The 2010 PER recommended a number of
limited measures for pensions that would have generated enormous savings, but it remains a
challenge for the government to implement any of them, particularly after the October 2010
election in which promises were made to limit cuts. The result, though, is a huge transfer of
resources from the young to the old, from the sick to the old, and more generally from the
economically active population to the retired. This is an unintended structural result of the
economic crisis.

3.      Latvia’s social welfare system provides benefits that can be categorized into three
main groups: social insurance, state social benefits, and municipal social assistance (see
Table A.3.1). Social insurance guarantees people who make contributions compensation for the
loss of income in certain situations, such as when a person reaches retirement age, becomes
unemployed or disabled, loses his or her main income provider, becomes sick, has an
occupational accident or disease, or takes off from work for childbirth. People covered by social
insurance—by virtue of paying contributions from their earnings—are entitled to the pensions,
benefits and compensations to ensure they can sustain their consumption when they are unable to
receive an income due to any of these circumstances. Social insurance is administered by the
State Social Insurance Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Welfare.

4.     State social benefits complement the state social insurance system and provide
support in the form of cash payments to certain population groups in vulnerable situations,
due to reduction or loss of income, such as: (i) people who are not covered by social insurance
or whose insurance contribution record is not sufficient to receive social insurance benefits (state
social maintenance benefit); and (ii) in statutory cases when income to cover additional
household spending is needed but the state social insurance system does not envisage any


                                                53
protection (e.g., the state family benefit, the child care benefit and the child birth benefit). State
social benefits are financed entirely from the national budget, and like social insurance, are
administered by national agencies of the Ministry of Welfare. These benefits have not been
means tested in the past and have been treated as universal benefits.

5.      In addition, and to underpin nationally financed and administered programs,
municipally-administered and financed social assistance programs are available to low
income and needy households. The housing benefit and the GMI transfers are the principal
targeted social assistance benefits administered and financed by municipalities, although by
mandate of the national government. Local authorities also provide other social assistance
benefits on a voluntary basis, as well as one-off, lump sum emergency benefits to residents who
have suffered shocks. Most of these voluntary benefits and the emergency benefits are not
income tested.

6.      Spending on social insurance pensions makes up the largest share of social welfare
spending in Latvia, which is a result of the rapidly ageing of the population. Social
insurance programs in 2009 made up 83 percent of Latvia’s social welfare spending. Of these
social insurance programs, pensions make up a 72 percent share.21 Spending on non-contributory
transfers in Latvia has been comparable to that of its immediate EU neighbors. However,
spending on “exclusion” benefits (which in Latvia mainly takes the form of the GMI benefit)
was (prior to the crisis) 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007, making it—along with Estonia—the lowest
in the EU.22

Crisis-response social programs

7.      Most social welfare programs in Latvia are “universal” or put more precisely are
“categorical”, which means that eligibility is based on household circumstances other than
low income. This is an intentional social choice to extend the safety net beyond just those who
are poor or vulnerable to poverty, and to pursue social objectives in addition to poverty relief and
consumptions smoothing. There are social welfare programs that are explicitly designed to act as
a buffer in case of job-loss and other shocks to income. First among these is unemployment
insurance, which is part of the social insurance branch of the social welfare system, financed
from the social insurance special budget. However, the low share of registered unemployed who
are eligible for unemployment insurance indicates how this program left many Latvians who lost
their jobs unprotected.23 The low levels of protection reflect eligibility criteria and pay-out
periods that make it difficult for the program to act as a broad automatic stabilizer. To make up
for this shortcoming, the government eased eligibility requirements and extended the benefit
period of unemployment insurance in 2009.

8.      Other social welfare instruments that helped households cope are the system’s
“active” employment assistance programs (Figure A.3.1). Among these, programs designed
to help workers augment their skills with training and which provide job search assistance are
unlikely to be very useful in the wake of a massive demand shock when jobs disappear (although
participants receive accompanying stipends which may have indeed been very important). For
this reason, although spending on all forms of employment assistance increased to respond to
higher demand from households, the government chose to expand more direct forms of
assistance to the unemployed who do not have access to unemployment insurance in the form of
public works, with the introduction of the WWS program in 2009.

9.     The public works WWS has been rolled out across Latvia by the State Employment
Agency (SEA) and its regional affiliates. The program is self-targeting to needy households,
with low stipends relative to the binding minimum wage and a requirement for full-time, labor

21
   72 percent represents the average pension spending for 2009 and 2010. There were pension underpayments in
2009 which were compensated in 2010 causing recent fluctuations in the pension share of the overall social
insurance budget.
22
    Although spending on housing benefits—which are typically, although not uniformly targeted across
municipalities—was higher than in some of Latvia’s neighbor countries, this benefit did not become a part of
mandatory targeted municipal social assistance until 2008.
23
   Latvia is not alone in this regard. It is also the case in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that the
registered unemployed are not eligible for such benefits.

intensive work. Participants in the program must be registered as unemployed, cannot be
receiving unemployment insurance benefits, and are selected on a first-come, first-served basis.
The availability of WWS work places depends crucially on the performance of municipal
authorities in creating work sites. The most recent data (from September 2010) indicate that
work places are being created in the regions of Latvia with soaring unemployment and in regions
where the demand for the program, measured by the length of the waiting list, is high. This
reflects very favorably on the responsiveness of national and local authorities in deploying the
new social welfare program quickly and where it is needed most.

10.     The social assistance programs financed directly from municipal budgets can also
be critical to how effectively households can cope with income shocks. Municipalities offer a
wide array of social assistance benefits and services, in cash and in kind. Two programs are
mandatory: the housing benefit targeted to low-income households (whose income per person is
below LVL 150 or LVL 120 per month, depending on municipality, which can take the form of a
cash payment, fuel for heating or actual housing), and the GMI which is targeted to the poorest
households (presently, with household income less than LVL 40 per adult and LVL 45 per child
per month). Although not mandated by national legislation, most municipalities also offer a
lump-sum emergency benefit to households that seek assistance, regardless of household income.

11.      An assessment of the responsiveness of municipally-administered and financed
social assistance programs to household need is provided in the World Bank’s 2010 PER.
Household need is proxied by the increase in unemployment between December 2008 and
December 2009 in each locality. The 2010 PER examines the reaction of spending on municipal
social assistance to changes in unemployment. The analysis raises concerns about the
responsiveness of municipal social assistance programs to household needs in the wake of the
crisis. Total spending on social assistance has clearly risen in most municipalities and republican
cities. In many cases, spending more than tripled. Although there is some indication of a positive
correlation between these increases and greater need, very little change is observed in several
municipalities with a considerable rise in unemployment.

Evolution of Latvia’s public pension system

12.    The structural reform of 1996 increased the fiscal sustainability of Latvia’s pay-as-
you-go pension system by introducing notional defined contribution accounts (NDCs)24
which were later complemented by funded individual pension savings accounts in 2001.
However, the macroeconomic boom of 2002-2007 resulted in an accelerated accumulation of
pension liabilities as more generous indexation rules were introduced and additional benefit
supplements were awarded. Subsequently, a steep decline in revenues during the recession of
2008-2009 resulted in the emergence of pension deficits.

13.     The government has tried to reduce boom-time pension promises by reducing
pension payments in year 2009, but this attempt had been overturn by the Constitutional
Court and pension underpayments from 2009 were compensated in 2010. Going forward,
pension benefits will remain frozen in 2011 and more conservative price indexation will be
applied in the coming years. However, other pension promises made before the crisis are
expected to be honored in full. Consequently, the projected future evolution of the deficits in the
social insurance special budget, from which NDC system is administered, is expected to follow
the path presented in Table A.3.2.

14.    The performance of the pay-as-you-go NDC system will continue to be challenged
by expected adverse demographic developments, which are summarized by marked
increase in old age pensioner dependency rate26 (see Figure A.3.2). Given the inherent long
term self-balancing feature of the NDC pension system, most of this demographic pressure will
materialize in the form of substantially lower future replacement rates.




24
   Benefits paid under a NDC retirement savings plan are calculated based on an affiliated worker’s accumulation of
“notional” capital (the individually accounted accumulation of contributions to the plan) and a notional rate of
return, which in Latvia’s case is tied to the growth of insured wage. At the time of retirement the “notional” capital
is transformed into an annuity based on observed life expectancy of the pensioners.
25
   While only 20 percent of wages is allocated to notional retirement accounts, around 22 percent of wage bill is
transferred to State Special Budget for Old Age Pensions to meet current pension payment obligations. The 2
percent difference is subsidized from other social insurance programs.
26
   The dependency rate is equal to a number of old age pensioners that have to be supported by 100 contributors.

Diversion and restoration of contributions into funded individual accounts

15.      Meanwhile, contributions to funded individual pension accounts have steadily
grown to 8 percentage points by the time the financial crisis hit in 2008. As a short-term
crisis measure this revenue stream has been partially diverted to the pay-as-you-go NDC system
and only a 2-percentage point contribution to the funded accounts retained. The government had
initially planned to raise funded pillar contributions to 4 percent in year 2011 and to 6 percent in
year 2012 where it was planned to remain afterwards. However, given the depth and duration of
the crisis, this schedule has been shifted by one year into the future with the aim of moving from
a 2 to 6 percent contribution rate in 2013. The postponement is expected to result in additional
state social insurance pension budget revenues in the amount of LVL 44.9 million or 0.35
percent of GDP in 2011. Similar additional revenue will result in 2012. The NDC system deficits
presented in Table A.3.2 take these latest plans into account.

16.     The reduction of contributions to the funded pillar and subsequent postponement of
contribution restoration schedule are raising some questions about the government’s
commitment to the multi-pillar pension system structure. The reshuffling of revenue streams
between the two mandatory pension system components has also reduced the fee base for the
private pension fund managers. While most of these companies can survive such temporary
changes, an extended period of diverted contributions could cause some fund managers to start
leaving the market. This could reduce competition in fund management services, and would very
likely increase account administration fees. For these reasons, it is important for the authorities
to adhere to the planned path for restoring contributions to the funded pillar. The expected
decline in future replacement rates from NDC pension component underscores the crucial role
that the funded pillar is designed to play in delivering benefits for future pensioners.

Retirement age increase

17.     To address medium-term fiscal challenges and long-term downward pressure on
replacement rates, the government has committed to increasing the retirement age from
age 62 to age 65. Latvia plans to increase the retirement age starting in 2016. The retirement age
will be increased by 6 months per year with the goal of reaching 65 for all individuals in 2021.
The Ministry of Welfare has drafted the required amendment to the State Pensions Law for the

                                                     58
increase in the retirement age to 65 for both men and women. The government has to review and
approve the law before it is sent for adoption to the Saeima. This is unlikely to take place in the
first half of 2011. Although commitment to this long term reform is commendable, this measure
is not expected to generate fiscal savings in the short run. However, the policy will contribute to
medium-term fiscal sustainability (Figure A.3.3).

18.     There are several sound reasons for the government not to increase the retirement
age before 2016. The current early retirement option expires in 2011. Given the recent rush to
early retirement and disability, this could mean very few new old age benefits are awarded in
2012-2013.27 This means that an increase of the retirement age before 2014 would not generate
any significant savings and could be counterproductive in the immediately post-recessionary
environment. Furthermore, the cohort turning 62 in 2014 will already have experienced a
significant increase in the effective retirement age (70 percent of previous cohort will have
retired early, while most representatives of this cohort will have to wait until 62), so it would be
inequitable to increase their burden further.

19.      The expected savings from increasing the retirement age are presented in Figure
A.3.3 and can be compared with the projected deficit (based on the assumption that reform is
to start in 2016). Savings for the pension scheme from a retirement age increase are expected to
climb to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2021 as the number of pensioners declines and the number of
contributors rises. After this, annual savings start to decline as longer careers start to translate
into higher pensions. However, it is reasonable to expect additional benefits from this measure to
arise elsewhere: increasing the number of taxpayers could boost revenue not only with additional

  It is expected that among the cohorts turning 62 in 2012 and 2013, around 70 percent will already be receiving
either an old age or disability benefit.

contributions to the social insurance special budget as a whole, but also to the State budget
through the increase in the wage income tax base.

20.     Another important benefit from increasing the retirement age would arise in higher
replacement rates both from the notional and funded pillars. The effect on notional
replacement rates is presented in Figure A.3.4, which shows an increase of newly granted
pension benefits of around 25 percent which will be badly needed in the future when the
generosity of the notional pillar is expected to decrease dramatically. A similar positive impact
of retirement age increase can be expected on the replacement rates from funded pillar, to which
6 percent of affiliates’ wages will be allocated from 2013.

(b) Health

21.     From 2008 to 2010, real spending on health fell by 16 percent, and almost all of that
occurred in 2009. In per capita terms, real spending dropped by 13 percent, less than the total
drop because of declining population. As a percentage of GDP, government spending on health
actually went up in 2009 and 2010, due to the sharp contraction in GDP.

22.      During the economic crisis, the Ministry of Health prioritized emergency services,
general practitioner services (each Latvian is enrolled with a primary care doctor),
subsidized prescription medicaments, and services for children and mothers. With tight
limits on overall funding, this strategy turned hospitals and inpatient care into a budgetary
residual. Table A.3.3 shows that total spending from domestic funds on health fell from LVL 564
million in 2008 to LVL 462 million in 2010, or by 18 percent.28 This table is divided into two
parts, the spending for medical services financed through the insurance system (Payments Center
in the table) and the amount financed through the Ministry of Health administrative budget
(Ministry of Health in the table). A further drop to LVL 443 million, 4 percent lower than in

     For this period, we can safely ignore inflation.

2010, is anticipated in 2011.29 Our expectation is that actual spending in 2011 will meet or
exceed the total for 2010 if the anticipated additional cuts in inpatient care do not materialize.
Most of the cuts from 2008 to 2011 were in inpatient care, communicable disease programs, and
administrative costs. The table clearly shows that the Ministry of Health made reductions across
the board, but it protected its stated priorities: outpatient care, medicines, and emergency
services.

23.      To achieve the change in budget priorities, cuts were made in the number of
hospitals contracted for inpatient services. For example, Riga Hospital #1, a 600-bed
institution, was shifted from an inpatient contract to an outpatient contract on January 1, 2010,
cutting its contract value by 70 percent. The hospital’s inpatients could be absorbed by other
large hospitals in Riga. The hospital still maintains primary and secondary outpatient and
diagnostic clinics, offers day surgery, and offers the whole range of services, including inpatient
care, to private patients who pay out of pocket or via private insurance. Riga City finances social
care beds at the hospital.

29
  Additional taxes of about 7 million Lats must be paid out of this budget, so the net available budget is planned at
about 441 million Lats for 2011.

24.     The number of inpatient contracts fell over 2008-2010: Table A.3.4 shows the
number of hospitals with inpatient contracts declining from 78 in 2008 to 39 in 2010. The
number of contracted beds fell from 17,001 to an estimated 12,929 at the beginning of 2010.
This reduction brings a key indicator, contracted beds per 100,000 population, down to 575 or
almost at the European average. However, Latvia cannot support even this level of infrastructure
with the allocations made for inpatient care in 2009, 2010, and planned for 2011. Therefore, it
still has to make tough decisions about further reductions in inpatient capacity, even if it is a
question of removing or altering contracts rather than really closing the excess infrastructure. In
2009 and 2010, additional resources were added to the budget at the end of the year to finance
hospital arrears, and this may happen in 2011 unless inpatient infrastructure is cut further.

25.     The number of primary care visits to General Practitioners (GP) has been stable for
many years, but these probably need to increase, especially for men. Secondary outpatient
specialist visits (for specialists, diagnostics, outpatient surgeries, and so on) fell from 3.22
million in 2008 to 2.93 million in 2009, but are estimated to rise to 3.18 million in 2010. They
will likely continue to increase as medical care shifts out of hospitals. A huge drop in hospital
inpatients has occurred, from 473.4 thousand in 2008, to 373.3 thousand in 2009, and to an
expected 322.3 thousand in 2010, a drop of 32 percent in just two years. In the next few years the
Ministry of Health expects them to stabilize at around 300 thousand. The Ministry of Health has
been successful in shifting some inpatient stays to outpatient care, with day care or day surgery
patients increasing from 26.3 thousand during the first 8 months of 2009 to 50.9 thousand for the
same period in 2010. In prior years these were nil. The shift from inpatient to outpatient care will
continue, which further reduces the need for inpatient infrastructure. The ministry has found that
in removing a hospital’s inpatient contract, approximately 30 percent of the inpatient cases
disappear, and 70 percent move to other hospitals, which is indicative of the level of inefficiency
accommodated by the excess infrastructure.

26.     The Ministry of Health has prepared and presented its medium-term strategy for
strengthening the health sector. On November 4, 2010, the Ministry of Health presented its
strategy for 2012 to 2014, which is to be considered and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in
2011. It has been discussed by the State Secretaries and is currently undergoing a process of
internal and external consultation managed by the Ministry of Health. This document proposes to
continue the structural reforms begun in 2009, reducing the number of acute care hospital beds to
350 per 100,000 population, approximately the level of Denmark and well below the average for
the EU. It would halve the number of acute care psychiatric beds. Lengths of stay would fall and
occupancy rates would rise in the remaining hospitals. Underlying these goals is a program to
further develop alternatives to inpatient care through an advanced secondary outpatient system


                                                    62
coupled with short-stay hospitals. In addition, an effort would be made to continue strengthening
primary care by adding a second doctor to any practice having over 2000 patients registered.
Also, the aim would be to reduce the proportion of primary doctors with such high patient loads
so that they could see more of their patients, thereby encouraging primary care visits to rise. Two
programs started under the emergency safety net—the additional nurse to extend the hours and
outreach of family doctors, and the family physician advisory telephone service—continue to be
implemented and developed.

27.     Specific measures to implement the health strategy include interventions across the
board to improve the quality and performance of primary care, emergency medical teams,
emerging day hospital services, outpatient care for the mentally ill, and home care. The plan
proposes new payment systems to improve providers’ financial incentives, further development
and expansion of the pharmaceutical subsidy system, increased efficiency by rationalizing
casualty wards of hospitals, and an effort to rationalize long term care by putting patients in
social care beds rather than in medical care beds, and increasing the ratio of nurses to doctors in
providing care. Table A.3.5 shows the indicators proposed by the ministry; our experience with
the ministry in the past two years suggests that the extensive implementation program included
with the strategy will be carried out as planned once the Cabinet of Ministers approves.

28.    Latvia continues to face many hurdles in the health sector, including a persistently
low proportion of GDP spent on health relative to other countries in Europe, high out-of-
pocket spending, shockingly poor adult health, and low satisfaction levels among the
population. Its fundamental shift in expenditure priorities has the potential to make the health
system more responsive to the health needs of the population. The proposal by the Ministry of


                                                                 63
Health to continue its restructuring efforts over 2012-2014 will go a long way to improve the
performance of primary and secondary outpatient care, while reducing the tendency to
institutionalize patients in costly acute care and psychiatric hospital beds. Risks remain as it will
take a long time to reform the incentives created by the existing payments system. Also, excess
hospital infrastructure still exists and may come roaring back onto the budget after 2014. Also,
the underlying problem of poor adult health has been extremely resistant to improvement so far.

29.     Impressive strides have been made to improve overall efficiency and efficacy of the
system, and the use of public funds for health care. When combined with the equity
improvements made under the ESSNS, health policy makers in Latvia have created an
opportunity out of a budget crisis to reset strategy, restructure the budget to fund core priorities,
and force the service delivery system to adjust. Whether they succeed, whether health indicators
respond positively, and whether the population increases its satisfaction with the system, remains
to be seen. All such changes take a long time to observe.

(c) Education

30.     The response to the economic crisis in the education sector was to slash budgets, as
shown in Table A.3.6. From 2008 to 2010, nominal State spending on education, science, and
sports fell by 37 percent. Preschool30 and special education were cut the least, by 26 and 15
percent, respectively. General, vocational, and interest education31 were cut by almost a third, 29,
31, and 30 percent respectively.32 But the real cuts were reserved for higher education, science,
and administration, which were reduced by 66, 60, and 67 percent, respectively. All of these cuts
are large, but for science and higher education, they are extraordinary. For 2011, total education
revenues from domestic sources remain essentially the same as in 2010, although there has been
another round of cuts in science and administration. University spending rises by 2 percent, and
vocational education gets a 19 percent boost. The details should not obscure the facts: few, if
any, countries have experienced such large and sudden cuts in education spending: education
expenditures were cut by a third overall and roughly two-thirds for higher education and science.




30
   Pre-school education refers to 0-6 year olds. Mandatory pre-school refers to 5-6 year olds. The majority of
children start pre-school at the age of 2 years. There are a few children that start pre-school before celebrating their
first birthday.
31
   Interest education is defined as the realization of the individual educational needs and desires of a person
regardless of age and previously acquired education. These are non-compulsory theatre, dance, folk, art,
environmental and technical interest classes. There are no entrance criteria for attendees and no license requirement
for programs for education institutions. For private companies that are not education institutions, a license
requirement is still in force. Teachers are paid by the state. See http://visc.gov.lv/intizglitiba/jomas/info.shtml.
32
   It should be noted that EU funds offset some of the reductions between 2008 and 2011, but EU funds for the most
part are previously planned investments in computers, equipment, renovations, and a revamping of vocational
education (which causes a large jump in vocational spending above what is shown in the table for 2011 when the EU
funds are allocated to specific areas of education).

preschool and special education.
3/ In 2011 Climate Change Finance Instrument (CCFI) funding is included and became the main reason for the increase in

31.    As a consequence, the core structural reform in the budget is reflected in the
reallocation of spending away from universities, science, and administration to cushion the
blows to general, vocational, preschool, special education, and interest education. General
education in 2011 is expected to absorb 52 percent of a much smaller budget, up from 46 percent
in 2008. Similarly, preschool, special, vocational, and interest education have risen as a
proportion of spending. Higher education has fallen from 12 to 7 percent of spending, and
science has dropped from 4 percent to 2 percent. Administration has dropped in the total from 7
percent in 2008 to 3 percent in 2011 (Table A.3.7).

32.     In 2008, Latvia was spending less per student in higher education than in primary
and secondary schools (see Table A.3.8). By 2011, the subsidy in higher education has dropped
by almost half and is less than 40 percent of the per-student subsidy in vocational. Without doubt
there are serious structural problems to address in higher education, including how to consolidate
supported institutions so that State funding can be concentrated on fewer of them to improve
quality and international competitiveness, how to further integrate science and university funding
to encourage synergies and a stronger market focus for research and development, and how to
modify student subsidy patterns to increase accessibility to higher education by poorer students.
But a first priority must be to increase spending at this level both through fresh funds as they
become available and by reconsidering priorities within overall education spending. In the
coming years, the student population in higher education will experience an unprecedented
decline, which will make it easier to improve per student subsidies, while still encouraging the
system to adjust to the demographic change.

33.     In addition, the Ministry of Education and Science made a long-overdue structural
reform in the financing of general primary and secondary education. For the 2010 school
year, the basis for the State education grant to municipalities for teachers and support staff was
shifted from inputs (the number of classes being taught in each school) to a formula based on the
number of students in the jurisdiction with weights for types of students and whether the student
is in a major city or the countryside. At the same time, the lowest starting salary for a workload
of 21 hours was cut by from LVL340 to 245, or 28 percent. The minimum salary for a school
director was cut from LVL612 per month to 447, or 27 percent. Although the change is
calculated as a reduction in salaries, in fact when combined with the funding reform, it simply
meant that localities would receive a smaller grant for teachers and support staff. Within this
envelope, school directors and local officials had the option of choosing some combination of
cutting teachers (and support staff), keeping them all and lowering their salaries, or
supplementing salaries from local funds. The funding per student dropped approximately by half
from September 2008 to September 2009. In January 2010, as previously agreed with the
teachers union, an additional allocation of funds was made available for salaries, so the overall
decline was about 33.5 percent in per-student funds.33

34.     Comparing the result with the 2008 school year, in 2010, the number of students
continued to decline to 216,307, a reduction of 10 percent in only two years (Table A.3.9).
Overall, the reduction in educational staff from 2008 to 2010 exceeded this current decline in
students, and the reduction in the number of schools and staff was concentrated at the primary
level (-21 percent for schools and -25 percent for staff). The number of teachers declined less
than overall staff, falling 11 percent between 2008 and 2010 (approximately matching the
decrease in students). Teaching workloads, however, declined by 24 percent indicating that less
work was available for each teacher employed. Therefore, many teachers were able to keep their

much more that could be done given the 27 percent decline in general education students from
2001 to 2008.

35.    A further adjustment in the 2011 school year would have been expected, given that
local authorities had so little time to adjust to the change of incentives in 2010 and that the
system has yet to adjust to the decline in student populations from 2001 to 2008. In fact,
while enrollments continued to drop from 2010 to 2011, only 9 more primary and 7 secondary
schools were closed. The number of educational staff, teachers, and workloads increased by 2
percent, 2 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. Hours were expanded for many teachers who
were kept on board during the crisis in 2009 and 2010 with reduced workloads.

36.     There has also been some catching up by education employees in terms of their
hourly pay and total earnings. In 2008, average monthly earnings in public administration
were LVL 700; in education, LVL 479 (32 percent lower). In 2010, earnings were LVL 515 and
395, respectively (23 percent lower in education)—a narrowing of the gap as all public sector
salaries plunged. In 2008, the hourly cost of labor in public administration was LVL6.3; in

education, it was LVL 5.3 (16 percent lower). In 2010, it was LVL 4.7 and LVL 4.3, respectively
(9 percent lower in education).34

37.     A detailed analysis of municipal behavior in 2010 found that there were significant
efficiency gains in response to the initial reforms: average class size went up by almost 5
percent, and the number of students per teaching workload increased by 13 percent.
Smaller schools with fewer students per teacher and higher costs per student were more likely to
be closed or merged. Lifting of restrictions on class size, numbers of administrative and support
staff, and compensated hours allowed school directors more leeway in managing their budgets
and schools, which they have used to introduce performance-based pay and to pay more to
teachers in larger schools.

38.    However, the per-student financing model extends only to the municipal
government. Within localities it is clear that there were reallocations in 2010 from larger
schools to subsidize smaller ones, and opportunities for cooperation across county lines will take
more time to emerge. The adjustment seems to have been most severe in the nine largest cities,
where classes were merged and workloads increased (the allocation formula provides 27.5
percent more per student outside of these nine cities) and in the smallest rural counties. Medium-
sized cities, which have adequate scale and 27.5 percent more funding than the largest cities,
reformed the least, in fact hardly at all.35

39.     Going forward, the education system continues to struggle to develop strategic
solutions to move the sector forward following the large budget cuts of the past three years.
In general education, the system has stabilized in 2011 with spending either flat or showing small
increases. There is still substantial potential to adjust to the shrinking of the student population,
and given that the decline will continue, there is no option but to keep reducing primary and
secondary education capacity. If overall spending on education remains constrained, a question is
whether policy makers are comfortable to allow general education to take a larger share of a
reduced overall expenditure effort, as it does now. If not, even more adjustment will be required.
However, decisions on funding for general education are dispersed between local and central
governments, with local governments owning the infrastructure. This adds complexity to policy
making. The World Bank’s advice has been to expand per-student grants for education beyond
just salaries to include the full average cost of a student, so that school directors and local
authorities can shift money between salaries and other costs and a higher floor is put on subsidies
between richer and poorer local governments. Some have argued that the per-student grant
should follow the student all the way to the school so that local authorities cannot subsidize
schools that are not economically viable. Finally, the World Bank recommended in the 2010
PER that the system of institutionalizing primary and secondary special needs students at high
cost should be reviewed. While special education funding per student appears high at LVL3,510
per student (Table A.3.8), funding includes medical treatment costs and so is not comparable
with the other per capita spending measures. However, the sector has been slow to adjust to

declining student numbers. This spending category merits careful review, although of course it is
a sensitive area.

40.     For vocational education, the Ministry of Education and Science is making major
investments and consolidating schools prior to turning over vocational education to
municipalities. Of 26 vocational schools today, the ministry expects to end up with 9 regional
centers for the next school year, beginning in the fall of 2011. Using EU funds, large investments
are being made in schools and teacher training to increase the attractiveness of vocational
education as an alternative to general education. Currently about 42 percent of eligible students
are in vocational education, and the Ministry would like to move that up to 50 percent before
turning the funding and the schools over to the municipalities in 2015. Funding at that point will
be folded into the per-student grants.

41.     Higher education is embarking on a major restructuring exercise. It was relatively
simple for the government to cut funding for higher education because the institutions are
autonomous and can raise other sources of funds, at least in theory. So funding was cut in the
expectation that the institutions would at least partially replace it. A reform plan for higher
education was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in August 2010. It proposes to focus State
subsidies on quality programs of adequate scale and to encourage institutions of higher learning
to combine programs to improve efficiency. It would encourage universities to attract
international students to Latvia and integrate offerings better with demands from the labor
market and the needs of the economy. Currently all study programs are being evaluated to reduce
overlap and to determine how future subsidies can be concentrated on those identified to be the
highest quality. In the end, a reduced number of programs will qualify for State funding. In the
past two years, a handful of institutions have been reorganized to become units of larger
universities, but scope for more consolidation remains. In the short run, funding for students has
been reduced most for liberal arts type degrees to emphasize those in the sciences. A major
problem remains in becoming more export oriented, as the language of instruction remains
Latvian by law.

42.    Prospects for science funding remain dim. Although Latvia has committed itself to the
Europe 2020 goal of achieving 3 percent of GDP for public and private research and
development expenditures, it ranked near the bottom of R&D effort in Europe at 0.46 percent of
GDP in 2009. Expanding this share will not be easy for either the public or private sector without
the resumption of economic growth at a rapid pace. As in higher education, the strategy in
science is to allocate funds to high priority fields (not to institutions) and within fields to fund
proposals competitively.

combination of pay cuts and redundancies. Prior to the adjustment Latvia’s public sector
seemed somewhat overstaffed relative to comparator countries and overpaid relative to the
private sector. In 2008 Latvia’s wage bill peaked in nominal terms, making up 26.8 percent of
public expenditure and 10.4 percent of GDP.36 Between 2008 and 2010 the wage bill was
reduced by more than a third in nominal terms37 through a combination of redundancies and
reduction of pay levels. By the end of 2010, it dropped to 8.7 percent of GDP and 20.6 percent of
total public expenditure38, which are below the averages in the European and Central Asia (ECA)
region. In 2010 average pay in the public administration was only slightly higher than the private
sector average.39 As economic growth returned, public sector salaries and staffing began to
recover slightly in mid-2010.40 According to the 2011 budget approved by Parliament in
December 2010, the wage bill is due to grow in 2011 by 3 percent in nominal terms (after having
being cut by 17 percent in 2010). This is partly due to increases in the minimum salary and a
reversal of pay cuts for the judiciary, which was mandated by a decision of the Constitutional
Court.

2.      If further cuts occur, then it would be useful to have a thorough analysis of their
likely impact on government functions. Despite the lack of a public employee register, which
would have provided detailed data on the size and composition of public employment, the
government targeted redundancies in a manner aimed at limiting the impact on policy functions
and public services. This was done primarily by consolidating back office functions and merging
agencies with related functions. Functional reviews conducted in 2010 have resulted in selective
cuts to ministries’ budgets, including through the merger of the Ministry of Regional
Development and the Ministry of Environment, as well as savings from the abolition and
amalgamation of agencies. Between 2009 and 2011, the number of central budget organizations
has been cut by 59 percent.41 However, only few of the reviews’ recommendations have so far
been implemented with a modest fiscal impact. The implementation of more of the reviews’
recommendations could enable the government to make additional savings through the
consolidation of subordinated agencies and further staff reductions in selected government


36
   This calculation is based on IMF GFS methodology. According to Eurostat’s European System of Accounts GFS,
the figure for 2008 was 12 percent of GDP, dropping to 11.9 percent in 2008 and to 8.8 percent in Q3 of 2010.
37
   Budget execution data reported by the MoF show a reduction of 33.6 percent in the nominal wage bill between
2008 and 2010.
38
   These percentages are calculated based on wage bill data reported by the Ministry of Finance (cash basis) and
GDP data reported by the State Statistics Bureau. According to the Eurostat accounting method, the wage bill
accounted for 8.8 percent of GDP in Q3 2010.
39
   According to the Central Statistical Bureau, in the first three quarters of 2010 the average salary in the general
government sector was 0.7 percent higher than in the private sector, compared to 17.4 percent higher in 2008.
However, an alternative methodology used in labor market surveys commissioned by the Government, which
compare remuneration for equivalent posts in public administration and the private sector, suggests that salaries for
professional and managerial staff in the Government represent some 75-80 percent of pay in the private sector.
40
   According to MoF data total wage bill expenditure in 2010 was LVL 1.112 billion, which was 15 percent higher
than the budget appropriation; total budget over-execution in 2010 reached 10.6 percent. Staffing increased by 5
percent in the central Government and 2 percent in local government in the last two quarters of 2010.
41
   The total number of central-level budget organizations was cut from 229 in early 2009 to 94 in early 2011.

bodies.42 In the medium term, a series of sectoral functional reviews could deliver further
efficiency gains, especially if implementation results in increased automation and streamlining of
work processes.

3.      A public employee register and a further streamlining of the public sector salary
system would contribute much to sustainable wage bill management in the future. As pay
levels have already declined very substantially and workloads have increased as a result of staff
cuts, public sector productivity is likely to have increased. In these conditions, further across-the-
board pay cuts are not advisable, as they would risk eroding public administration capacity to a
level that might be difficult to restore, once public finances recover. Further policy actions could
focus on ensuring adequate staff retention and fiscal sustainability through longer-term staff and
wage bill planning. Creating a comprehensive public employee register, which could ideally
include local government staff, would be an essential step in this direction. As of 2011,
municipalities have started report staffing levels to the Treasury, which will facilitate fiscal
planning.

4.      Further streamlining of the salary system would also be conducive to improved
wage bill planning and increased transparency, though the reform might need to be
gradual to moderate the fiscal impact of pay equalization. Indeed, the adjustment effort has
prompted a streamlining of the public sector salary system, which has reduced previous pay
differentials among government bodies. Judicial personnel have been brought into the public
administration pay structure, while legally binding pay caps have been introduced for elected
officials and local government personnel. However, the co-existence of salary bands within the
salary steps of the current grid system continue to give rise to pay distortions among different
ministries and agencies, complicating wage bill planning. The salary bands for ministries were
narrowed (to up to 49 percent difference within the same salary step) in late 2010, but still
remain wider among subordinated agencies. Further efforts to narrow the salary bands could be
pursued in the future taking into account the available fiscal resources required for pay
equalization.

5.      The crisis exposed weaknesses in the oversight of state owned enterprises (SOEs),
whose status and governance needs to be reviewed. Latvia has a significant number of legal
entities with SOE status, engaged in a wide array of activities, not all of which relate clearly to
the provision of public goods and services. SOEs are subordinated to different ministries and
municipalities. As a result, responsibility for SOEs’ oversight has been fragmented, leaving the
government without a clear picture of the benefits derived from its ownership of SOEs. Some of
the SOEs perform core functions of government agencies (e.g. procurement, regulatory
functions), with SOE status apparently intended to give them increased flexibility over their
expenditure, notably salaries. Other SOEs, notably in the transport sector benefited from sizeable
subsidies (e.g. Riga airport, Latvian Railways), as did numerous entities in the sports and culture
sectors. Others are profitable but enjoy a monopoly status (e.g. Latvian Forests). The fiscal
adjustment has affected loss-making SOEs through reduced subsidies and profitable ones
through higher dividend payments to the budget. As of April 2010, SOEs in receipt of budget

42
  The 2011 budget includes savings of LVL 3.7 million based on the functional reviews of ministries; however,
these reviews had identified a maximum of LVL 41 million worth of savings, e.g. through further manpower
reductions in the Ministries of Defense and Interior.


                                                   72
subsidies and those with monopoly status have been prohibited from paying bonuses to their
staff. However, salaries of SOE staff have declined less (by some 11 percent on average in 2008-
2010 according to the Ministry of Finance) and remain substantially higher than those of
government employees. The government has developed an inventory of SOEs and plans to
prepare a strategy on SOE management based on the OECD principles for SOE governance.43
The strategy will review the appropriate legal status of each SOE (some of which could be
transformed into government agencies or privatized) based on its activities and the government’s
policy priorities. Reducing the government’s ownership stake in SOEs has the potential to raise
revenues in the short term, but also to increase competition in the economy in the longer term. At
the same time, defining the mandate of those SOEs providing public goods ought to result in
clear norms and performance standards for allocating budget subsidies. Relevant policy actions
and planned reforms are referred to in the Letter of Development Policy.

                 ANNEX 6: WORKPLACES WITH STIPEND PROGRAM


Description of Workplaces with Stipend program
1.      In response to rapidly rising unemployment in the wake of an 18 percent real contraction
in GDP, the Government of Latvia launched a public works program know as the WWS program
in September 2009 as part of its ESSNS. The WWS program targets individuals who have lost
their job but are not receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Workplace creation and work
supervision is the responsibility of municipalities, but the Employment Affiliates (de-
concentrated offices of the State Employment Agency) are tasked with ensuring that WWS rules
are met by the municipalities. The central government finances the stipends, which account for
more than 80 percent of the budget, and the materials needed, but administration and supervision
overheads are borne by municipalities.

2.      Participants are required to work full time (40 hours a week, 8 hours a day), are employed
in labor-intensive tasks, and receive a monthly stipend of LVL 100, which is 80 percent of the
legal net minimum wage. The relatively low stipend rate has been shown internationally to
achieve “self targeting”, i.e. attracting low skilled unemployed people, which makes the
programs more effective at reaching those who need the most support, and lowers the risk that
constituencies will develop that push for the program to remain in place once crisis conditions
have passed and privately created jobs are available.

3.      Between September 2009 and October 2010, more than 6.6 million full time equivalent
WWS days of participation were created and more than 72,000 unemployed people participated
in the WWS program, albeit for varying time intervals. On average, WWS participants enroll in
the program for about 4 months, which is 2 months less than the limit on how long a person can
participate. Exit from the program occurs mostly because the participant breaks the rules (47
percent), but 16 percent of participants also exited the program because they found another job.

4.      At any given time, there are between 14,000 and 22,000 work places available for WWS
participants, with the higher number usually coinciding with the summer months when labor-
intensive projects are easier to organize. Approximately half the WWS participants are women.
Although there is variation in the efficiency with which workplaces are created by
municipalities, WWS participants are generally more numerous in locales where there are more
unemployed people on the waiting list. This reflects very favorably on the responsiveness of
national and local authorities in deploying the new social welfare program quickly and where it
is needed most.

5.     Since the WWS program was launched, the program has been over-subscribed. More
than 40,000 people are on the waiting list for the WWS program. The high demand for the
program signals a weak labor market, but it also suggests that the stipend amount might be
higher than it needs to be to serve as a last resort safety net, rather than an alternative form of
employment.

6.      Despite strong lobbying, the government was able to exclude state- and municipal-owned
enterprises from benefiting from the WWS program. This was an important move, because


                                               83
allowing WWS participants to work in these entities would have created strong budget incentives
for these employers to dismiss workers to whom they pay the minimum wage. More recently,
there have been requests by businesses for wage subsidies for their employees. Wage subsidies
offer some short-term value to support labor demand, but often have been plagued by high
deadweight costs if they postpone necessary industrial restructuring and withdrawing them can
be politically unpopular. Wage subsidies also can result in job substitution rather than job
creation.

Planned evaluation of the Workplaces with Stipend program
Objectives and Organization
7.      The main objective of the impact evaluation of the Latvian Public Works Program
(WWS) is to assess the effectiveness of the program, and to give clear policy recommendations
for an expansion or contraction of the intervention under the ESSNS in Latvia. The evaluation
will also provide evidence that will shape the design of crisis-response safety net programs at the
international level. The impact evaluation of the WWS program will measure the impact of the
temporary income support program on beneficiaries’ welfare and employability.

8.      The three most prominent questions that will be asked vis-à-vis this impact evaluation
are: (1) Did the WWS program act as a safety net, i.e. how many jobs were created for people at
the lower end of the income/welfare distribution? (2) How did the WWS impact the welfare of
program participants, i.e. what are the net income gains? (3) How is the presence of the program
affecting labor markets in general?

Evaluation Design/Identification Strategy
  Propensity score matching, difference-in-difference, and instrumental variable design: This
    design employs a predicted probability of group membership based on observed predictors
    (similarities between individuals in the treatment and control groups). It would work from a
    matched sample of recent public works program graduates matched with individuals on the
    waiting list. The design then utilizes retrospective data that will be collected through the
    survey instrument to reconstruct baseline information on the currently-enrolled population.
    Finally, to control for endogeneity that may be occurring due to reasons individuals enter the
    program, an instrumental variable(s) will be identified.
  Regression discontinuity design: This portion of the evaluation will compare the effects of
    the public works program to those of the standard unemployment insurance benefit. This
    design will exploit eligibility criteria used for program participant selection from the pool of
    equally eligible applicants: ineligible individuals, who are just barely ineligible for the
    program can be used as a control group. The cut off point for the RD design will be those
    individuals who either just barely qualify for the WWS or those who just barely qualify for
    unemployment. So, for example, excludability could be based on months worked
    immediately prior to unemployment. Using this methodology it is important to consider
    omitted variable bias to be sure that the change exhibited is attributable to the intervention.

Timing and Funding
9.     The survey field work was carried out from December 2010 to February 2011. Data
cleaning took place over February 2011 to end-March 2011. The data was then provided to the

team responsible for carrying out the analysis of the data in end-March 2011. The draft
evaluation is due to be available in May 2011.

10.    The evaluation is funded using EU-provided ESF finances (approximately LVL 40,000)
and is government executed, but the World Bank is providing technical assistance on a number
of aspects. The World Bank has helped with the evaluation strategy, questionnaire design,
sampling strategy, and identifying households to be interviewed. In addition, World Bank staff
members have received the clean data set and intend to carry out some of the more rigorous
impact evaluation work.

   Central Statistical Bureau produced data from HBS and EU-SILC surveys on special request of Ministry of Welfare using methodology which is close to the methodology used in the income assessment for granting
needy persons status. The kinds of income which are not taken into account in granting needy persons status, were excluded from the income categories by the CBS according to this methodology.
51
   The category “needy” is defined in the Regulation of Cabinet of Ministers No. 299, “Procedures by which a Family or Person Living Separately Shall be Recognized as Needy” (adopted on 3 March, 2010, in force
from April 1, 2010), and amended by Regulation of Cabinet of Ministers No 1140 (adopted on 21 December, 2010). The definition is as follows: “A family (person) shall be recognized as needy, if the income per each
family member during the last three months does not exceed 90 Lats and if: (1) it does not own monetary accumulations in credit institutions; (2) it does not own property excluding property, mentioned in these
Regulations; (3) it has not entered into a maintenance contract; (4) it is not on full support of the State or local government; and (5) A person who is able to work and who does not work shall, prior to requesting the
benefit, register with the State Employment Agency, except for the cases referred to in Law on Social Services and Social Assistance.”
52
   In 2008, according to Household Budget Survey (HBS), 13.9% of the population lived in household whose per capita income (measured by the HBS survey) is equal to or less than half the minimum wage, equivalent
to approximately 311.4 thousand people. According to the statistics of municipalities, 120.3 thousand people were certified as needy or 5.3% of population in 2008.

   The initial target in SDPL 1 was set for rural GPs, but the program has been expanded to also provide an additional public health nurse to GPs in urban areas. Therefore, the indicator has been changed from “rural GPs”
to “GPs.”
56
   In compliance with Regulations of Cabinet of Ministers No.1046, one half of 668 GPs’ practices are allowed to employ the second nurse. As it takes time to study, to train and to sign an agreement with the nurses who
are interested in engaging in primary care it is planned to have a gradual roll-out and hence only half of General Practitioners’ practices are to employ the second nurse in 2010.
57
   The ratio of 2010 is increased by 60% on average, taking into account the number of medical persons who will retrain and the time needed for retraining.
58
   The average coverage ratio of patients registered with GP.
59
   The average coverage ratio of patients registered with GP increased by 10% is used for estimates, as it is planned that the second nurse will engage in the care of needy persons.
60
   The ratio of 2010 is increased by 10%, because after engaging the second nurse in the primary care network the coverage of patients will increase.
61
   Calculations are made based on actual Q4 2009 data and the projected increase in the number of needy persons (revised from SDPL 1 based on actual Q1 2010 data). The targets are based on the assumption that after
decreasing the number of hospitalizations and the average length of stay, a certain number of home care services need to be provided.
62
   According to the proposal of Ministry of Health to update expected results by the actual forecasts of the Ministry of Health.

   The reform extended the duration of unemployment benefits for those eligible from 4 to 6 months to 9 months at a rate of LVL45 per month (a quarter of gross minimum wage in 2010) for months 5-9, and for those
eligible for 6 months, also at a rate of LVL45 for months 7-9.

   According to the statistics of municipalities 27.4 thousand people received GMI benefit or 1.2% of the population of the previous year

   In 2010 Q4 and the next quarters the assumption is that there will be 100.0 thousand GMI recipients or 4.4% of the population (assuming that the number of population is not changed).
83
   According to statistics of municipalities in 2008, 120.3 thousand people were certified as needy, and 27.4 thousand people received the GMI benefit. (27.4 /120.3 x100%= 22.8%).

     According to the statistics of municipalities, the average pay-out/period of GMI benefits is 4.05 months in 2008. It is calculated as the (number of participant-months) / number of participants.
87
  As of October 2008, the restriction to receive the GMI benefit for only 9 months was canceled. The assumption is that due to the economic decline, the average length of the benefit pay-out period will increase, but
once the economy starts to recover, the average pay-out period will decrease.
88
     The target indicator is the share of State co-financing outlined in the relevant legislation.

   Percentage of registered unemployed ineligible for unemployment insurance and participating in Workplaces with Stipend program was 17% in Q4 2009 (16476 unemployed were participating in the program at the end
of period and the number of unemployed not receiving unemployment benefits was 98531 in Q4 2009)..

   The database of the State Employment Agency captures the starting and finishing date of the period that a person participates in the WWS program. The period includes days that are free (like week-ends), days when a
person is counted as a participant in the program but does not earn the stipend (e.g. because of unjustifiable absence) or days when participants have a justifiable paid or non-paid absence (according to the rules of the
program). Therefore, to calculate the indicator—person months—the number of days (total duration of participation) is divided by 30 (the average number of days per month in a year including weekends etc.). Target:
Starting from the first day of participation until December 31, the total duration of participation was 1363997 days (including weekends etc.), if divided by 30 the result is 45467.
