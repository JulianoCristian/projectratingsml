water scheme which would\n            draw water from the existing irrigation dam on Cuautitlan\n            River at Guadalupe, and treat and transmit it to two service\n            reservoirs; (iii) Cuautitlan: expansion of an existing well\n            field located 35 km north of the city and a 1.83 m diameter\n            conduit to convey the water to the metropolitan area; (iv)\n            Los Reyes: a well field with a 1.83 m diameter conduit to\n            the metropolitan area; (v) Apan: a well field with a 2.40 m\n            diameter conduit to the metropolitan area and a second stage\n            expansion of this field to be built after the Project is\n            completed, with adequate transmission capacity provided for\n            it under the first stage; (vi) Texcoco: a multipurpose\n            scheme to produce groundwater for water supply, treat\n            wastewater for agricultural and industrial use; provide\n            treated wastewater for a 4,000 ha irrigation zone; extract\n            industrial quality salt from saline waters; regulate surface\n            waters; reclaim 6,000 ha of land through afforestation and\n            develop a 500 ha urban zone; (vii) Social Public Works:\n            Attached to each of the above sub-projects are certain\n            public works."}, "docdt": "1973-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
