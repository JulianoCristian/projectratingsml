To meet the\n            short-term traffic requirements of these ports, the project\n            would provide containerized cargo handling equipment at all\n            three ports, as well as bulk coal handling equipment at\n            Huangpu. The project would also include the training of\n            personnel in the operation of the container and coal\n            terminals, and computerized management information systems\n            for container operations. As part of the project, the\n            Government would undertake a containerization study of the\n            hinterlands of the ports of Huangpu, Shanghai, and Tianjin,\n            to identify intermodal terminals, other facilities and\n            transport equipment required to optimize the door to door\n            transport potential of the containerization of cargo through\n            these ports."}, "docdt": "1982-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
