Population Project is to assist the Government in improving\n            the health and well-being of Benin's population, with\n            particular emphasis on its most vulnerable segments (women,\n            children, and the poor). In support of Benin's\n            population policy, the project will assist in the further\n            development and expansion of the family planning program.\n            The project will also support implementation of the three\n            main reforms included in the national health sector strategy\n            for the period 1995-1999. These reforms, aimed at improving\n            the quality, coverage and efficiency of basic health\n            services and at rendering the health system more accountable\n            to the population are: 1) decentralization and strengthening\n            of sector management and administration; 2) reconfiguration\n            of the referral system and strengthening of its capacity to\n            provide technical support services to primary health care\n            and nutrition; and 3) expansion of the participation of\n            multiple stakeholders, including beneficiaries, in the\n            planning, implementation and evaluation of national health\n            policy and programs."}, "docdt": "1995-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
