had a satisfactory outcome with unlikely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development\n            impact, satisfactory performance by the Bank and an\n            unsatisfactory performance by the Borrower.  Due to the slow\n            project start and the unsatisfactory performance, a detailed\n            review was undertaken. As a result, baseline performance\n            indicators and expected outcomes were established and the\n            implementation handbook was revised.  Key lessons learned\n            are: A good understanding of the roles and responsibilities\n            of all actors at the start of project implementation is\n            crucial to prevent execution delays.  Support for community\n            participation structures must be maintained.  Having\n            financial professionals monitor and implement financial\n            management procedures increases the likelihood of project\n            success.  Competency in and compliance with procurement\n            procedures promoting competition will have a positive impact\n            on the project.  A policy emphasizing local development,\n            including a devolution of planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation responsibilities improves coordination in a\n            countrywide project.  Foreign assistance coordination helps\n            allocate resources more efficiently.  Making project\n            interventions sustainable remains a major challenge\n            requiring a long-term commitment.  More resources are needed\n            to ensure that programs are implemented in a cost-effective\n            fashion and that vulnerable groups are not excluded from the\n            health system because of cost recovery policies at health\n            centers.  Quality infrastructure and technical equipment are\n            project achievements, however, the major challenge is to\n            raise the usage level of services and to provide quality\n            health care to beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
