Some lessons\n            learned included: creation of the specialized unit for\n            procurement within the railway, headed by someone with\n            international procurement experience, and the retention of\n            that specialist throughout implementation, was an immense\n            help. Continuity of task manager from the preparation phase\n            through implementation yields considerable benefits in terms\n            of the efficiency and consistency of the Bank's role. A\n            broad initial project in a sector can prove valuable in\n            opening the door for subsequent lending operations which\n            then pursue in more detail and in narrower fields the\n            institutional band policy reforms analyzed under the first operation."}, "docdt": "1997-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
