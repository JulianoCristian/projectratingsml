The project\n            comprises four main components : a) repair and modernization\n            of equipment and facilities for railway rolling stock, track\n            maintenance and signaling and telecommunications; b)\n            measurement and laboratory equipment for maintenance and\n            repair of the highway network; c) technical assistance to\n            introduce an improved management information system ( MIS )\n            and to investigate long term strategic issues in the sector;\n            and d) training for senior managers of sector institutions."}, "docdt": "1990-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
