MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND
THE POLISH STATE RAILWAYS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A FIRST TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on two proposed loans,
one to the Republic of Poland for US$8.0 million equivalent and the other to
the Polish State Railways for US$145.0 million equivalent, is submitted for
approval. The proposed loans would be on standard IBRD terms with a 17 year
maturity and would help finance a transport project. European Investment Bank
(EIB) is cofinancing a separate component estimated at U¢$2O million
equivalent.
2.          Background.  As noted in the latest Country Brief, the environment
for effecting real reform has recently greatly improved and the new Government
has initiated measures aimed at moving towards a market-oriented economy with
a view to improving the efficiency and productivity of the economy, promoting
growth, and improving socioeconomic conditions.  In this context, deposit and
lending interest rates have been liberalized.  On January 1, 19?S, the zloty
was devalued and exchange rates unified, and administrative ;.rice controls
were removed on most goods and services.  These measures are part nf a
comprehensive macroeconomic/stabil4zation program that has recently been
agreed with the IMF. In the short term, high priority is being accorded to
sharply reducing the rate of inflation, mitigating the country's severe
external debt problem and beginning the process of restoring the country's
creditworthiness. In the longer term, priorities will focus on restructuring
the economy, including the development of a strong private sector beth through
fostering new private sector initiatives and through privatization of existing
public-sector enterprises.
3.          Transport is an important sector in Poland.  It directly employs
close to one million people, about 5X of the work force, contributes some 5%
to GNP, invests more than one billion US dollars equivalent per year (about 7
to 81 of total centrally planned investments), and requires Government
subsidies of about US$1.2 billion equivalent annually, corresponding to 2% of
GNP. The transport system is extensive, mainly in state hands and operates
through large, vertically integrated companies. There is little competition
between different modes and most prices have been set administratively.
Within this system of administered prices the overall financial results of
transport sector companies appear satisfactory, but substantial subsidies are
paid by the Government to cover the cost of providing low-priced rail and road
passenger service. Unlike passenger service, freight transport is financially
self-supporting. Due to lack of foreign exchange over the past eight years,
investments, even in vitally important areas, have been insufficient, and
severe operating and maintenance constraints have developed. The three major
priorities for the transport sector are: (i) to reform its organization and
operating systems to improve efficiency, including introduction of competition
and preparatory work for privatization of selected activities; (ii) to catch
up with a backlog of deferred maintenance/investment; and (iii) to undertake
major technical modernization.

4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy is
designed to support Poland's development objectives--namely to improve
efficiency and productivity of the economy and enable it to grow in a
sustainable way in the future and to improve socioeconomic conditions. To
reach these objectives, the Polish authorities are establishing improved
macroeconomic and debt management policies as well as pursuing a major reform
of their economy to more market-oriented systems and policies. Through the
proposed project, the World Bank would assist the Polish authorities to
implement parts of their systemic reforms by improving the institutional
structures and management techniques for the railway and road transport
subsectors as well as assisting senior managers to acquire knowledge of
Western methods of strategic planning, economic analysis of investments, and
management of transport enterprises. During project preparation a monitorable
program to improve the efficiency of railway operations was formulated.
Through the project, the Bank is helping to translate the Government's
macroeconomic management efforts into specific sectoral actions, including
reducing subsidies through a combination of improved operating efficiency,
closing down uneconomic lines and raising prices, and ensuring that investment
is allocated to highest return activities.
5.          Project Objectives.  The project's objectives are to:  (i) support
the Government's efforts to restructure the transport sector, eliminating
rigidities, central commands, excessively engineering - oriented and capital-
intensive solutions, and introducing instead modern organizational forms and
management strategies in line with the market-based economy currently being
developed in Poland; (ii) introduce more efficient internal management
systems and maintenance procedures as well as provide financing for the
equipment necessary to support this; (iii) train managers in modern management
techniques; (iv) increase competition in the transport sector; and (v) improve
the economic, financial and operating performance of Polish State Railways.
6.    Proiect Description.   The project includes activities needed to support
tht- Government's transport sector restructuring program as well as components
which deal directly with railways and highways. It would be implemented during
1990-95. The restructuring of the transport sector in Poland aims at: (a) a
decrease of Government subsidies through better cost recovery; (b) improved
efficiency; and (c) increased market responsiveness. The structure of PKP
with its more than 60 subsidiary units in construction, industrial production,
services, etc. will be changed with the following objectives: (a) the
subsidiary unics will be required to operate commercially; (b) they will
become largely independent from PKP; (c) they, and PKP, will develop normal
marketing arrangements with each other and with the outside, with PKP and the
units selecting suppliers and customers on a normal competitive basis. The
subsidiaries are foreseen to be restructured in three possible ways: (a) into
joint stock companies; (b) privatized; (c) into independent Qtate owned
enterprises. The choice of solution requires studies and an.Lyses from
various points of view. Such studies, in various degree of completion, are
underway in MTME. To support the Government in this restructuring effort this
component focuses on enterprise restructuring and institution-building through
technical assistance, studies and staff training.
7.    The railway components would support investments in those parts of the
railway system which are deemed economically viable in the long-run, including
rolling stock maintenance and repair, railway track maintenance and signalling



and telecommunications. Irvestments include modernization of equipment and
facilities as well as manufacturing of maintenance and replacement parts. Two
PKP subsidiaries, ZWUS and ZNTKS, which manufacture signalling and track
maintenance equipment respectively, would be strengthened and modernized under
the project. PKP organization, management and operational strategies would be
upgraded and modernized throug' the introduction of an improved management
information system to optimize PKPls operations as well as through undertaking
a number of studieF to improve current maintenance practices and policies.
8.    The project would support the activities of the Ilighways Administration
(GDDP) to implement its Pavement Management System by supplying continuous
traffic recorders and other measurement devices to provide a solid technical
and economic base in establishing investment priorities. It would also
provide appropriate laboratory apparatus to control the production and laying
of bituminous pavements. Training and professional contacts with Western
institutions and transport agencies for senior transport managers is included.
9.    The sector reform components would consist of:
(i)   technical assistance, training and studies for sectoral reform;
(ii)  a program to reduce uneconomic railway lines and stations;
(iii) an annual review by the Bank of the transport sector investment
program with an increasing stare of this program being based on
economic analyses;
(iv)  a monitorable program to improve PKP efficiency, both financial
and physical, which is expected to reduce subsidies through a
combination of improved operating efficiency, closing down
uneconomic lines, raising tariffs, and ensuring that investment is
allocated to highest return activities; and
(v)   sectoral studies dealing with development of combined transport,
road transport organization and development, and road user
charges.
10.         The total project cost is US$216.5 million equivalent, of which
US$173.0 million is in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loans of US$153
million equivalent (US$8.0 million to the Government and US$145.0 million to
PKP) together with a loan of $20.0 million equivalent from EIB would meet 100l
of the foreign exchange requirements of the project. US$20 million and
US$7.75 million of the loan funds will be allocated at commercial terms from
PKP to ZWUS and ZNTKS respectively.   Local costs are expected to be financed
by the beneficiaries from internal cash get ration for the revenue earning
entities and from their normal investment budgets for MTNZ and GDDP.
11.         All procurement and the selection of consultants will be in
accordance with Bank guidelines.  Procurement of 72X of the Bank-financed part
of the project would be through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and
22X through Limited International Bidding/International Shopping. The balance
of 61 would be used for studies and other consulting services. Except for the
expansion of the section of ZWUS currently manufacturing intrinsically fail-
safe relays of Swedish design, no proprietary procurement of any significant
magnitude is expected. Most procurement under Bank financing is unavailable
from local manufacturers. In those few cases where domestic manufacturers may
participate in bidding, they would be accorded a 151 preference or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. Technical specifications and



- 4 -
evaluations are handled by PKP and considerable technical assistance has been
provided by Bank staff to ensure the adequacy of the bidding process and, in
particular, the quality of the bidding documents.
12.         For contracts not exceeding US$200,000, Statement of Expenditures
procedures would be used. To facilitate access to loan proceeds, a Special
Account will be established for each loan in an amount of DM500,00C and DM4.0
million for the loans to the Republic and PKP respectively. The '.roject is
expected to be completed by June 1995 and the loan closing date is December
1995.  A breakdown of costs and tfa financing plan are shown in ScheuleA
The procurement methods and disbursement schedule are in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the Status of Bank Group
operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8431-POL, dated 03/28/90, and a Map (IBRD 20327R-POLAND)
are also attached.
13.         The project deals with the environmental consequences of all
relevant project components and it will contribute significantly towards
environmental improvement by (i) eliminating the spillage of an estimated
500,000 tons of coal dust annually from defective wagons, and (ii) improving
the treatment of flue gaz.es and effluents from three major workshops.
The sector-wide environmental issues related to transport are mainly those
having to do with v 'ticle emissions. Fuel efficiency of cars and trucks is
low and the gasolin. used is leaded. These issues are being addressed in the
overall environmental strategy which is presently under elaboration with Bank
assistance.
14.         Actions Agreed.  The following agreements were reached during
negotiations: A. Sector related: (i) that the Bank annually review and
comment on the transport sector investment program and that an increasing
proportion of this program, starting at 201 in 1991 and reaching 80X in 1994,
be subjected to economic analysis accr .ing to a methodology agreed with the
Bank; (ii) that the findings of studi   covering various transport policy
questions be discussed with the Bank     agreed actions promptly implemented;
(iii) that ZWUS and ZNTKS maintain a rate of return on revalued average net
fixed assets of not less than 161 before additional investments in excess of
DM200,000 equivalent be undertaken.  L _ Project related:  (i) that at least
1,000 km of uneconomic railway lines and a number of stations to be specified
each year, will be closed before 1995 with not less than 2G0 km of lines per
annum beginning in 1991; (ii) that PKP undertake to improve its physical and
financial performance with the objective to increase efficiency and thereby
reduce transport costs and subsidies in accordance with the following
indicators: (a) operating targets to be reached by 1995 in accordance with a
timetable acceptable to the Bank: electric locomotive availability 911;
electric locomotive use 510 km/day; wagon availability for total fleet 86%,
for coal wagons 87X; speed restrictions on main lines 400, on turnouts 250;
traffic units (million) per employee 0.37; (b) financial targets: operating
ratio excluding subsidies: 1991 - 104, 1992 - 102, 1993 onwards - 100;
operating ratio including subsidies: 1991 onwards - 90. This would mean a
gradual cumulative reduction in real terms of Government subsidies to PKP of
61 in 1991, 18% in 1992 and 30% in 1993 and remaining at this level for the
rest of the project. Further reductions in subsidies will be discussed in
conjunction with future operations; (iii) that PKP adjust tariffs in line
with inflation plus the necessary increase to meet the agreed operating ratios



5 -
at least four times per annum on the first day of each quarter, in accordance
with a formula satisfactory to the Bank; (iv) that GovernmenW. will not
contribute equity to PKP unless the debt equity ratio exceeds 20:80 and that a
debt coverage of not less than 1.3 be maintained. C. Environment related:
(i) that PKP will carry out an agreed program of works which will upgrade the
performance of the existing equipment for the scrubbing of the gases and other
effluents; (ii) that supervision and reporting of the environmental effects
be carried out according to norms acceptdble ta the Bank. The loans will be
effective when the Project Coordinating and Monitoring organization is
established and its officers are appointed.
15.         Benefits.  The proposed investments would result in more efficient
procedures reducing the required amounts of staff and material inputs, and
corrective actions generally. Economic benefits from the project would come
from (i) enhanced maintenance efficiency obtained through the lowering of
resource inputs resulting from the use of more efficient machinery and
equipment and appropriate material inputs; (ii) improved operating efficiency
through heavier trains and lower turnaround times, and, for the highways,
lower road maintenance and vehicle operating costs; (iii) saving from the
closure of uneconomic railway lines and -tations. They will accrue initially
to the organizations where they are implemented, i.e., PKP, ZWUS, ZNTKS and
the Highways Administration and will lead to a generalized improvement of the
quality and a reduction of the cost of transport services, thus benefitting
most parts of the economy, including exporrs. The project also provides for
the environmental benefits described in para. 13, promotes competition and
provides for preparatory actions necessary r. future privatization.
16.         Risks.  The achievement of the central objectives of the project
depends on the progress of the overall economic reform; any slowdown or
reversal in the latter would be reflected in the transport sector. The
specific investment projects in plant and equipment are, however, not likely
to be much affected by the macroeconomic circumstances since they are
justified under a wide range of scenarios. On a different level, the main
risks are those inherent in any first project, i.e., uncertainties about the
implementation in a sustained fashion of the recommended policies.   with
respect to the estimated ERRs, the components remain viable under a wide range
of assumptions regarding costs and benefits. The single most important factor
influencing the ERRs is the valuation of foreign exchange. Assuming an
increase of about 50 in foreign exchange cost from the value used, the ERR
would fall to 181.
17.         Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loans.
