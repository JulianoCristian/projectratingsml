MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBT.IC OF BURUNDI FOR A
MUYINGA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to
Burundi for SDR 7.9 million (US $10.0 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years to help finance agriculture and livestock
development and soil conservation in the Muyinga province.
2.       Background. Burundi has a sound record of development
achievements in the post-independence period but faces deep-seated
problems mostly related to the pressures of population on scarce land
resources. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy contributing an
average 601 of GDP, 88S of export earnings (841 of which from coffee in
1986) and employing over 842 of the population. Burundil's population of
4.8 million vakes it one of the most densely populated countries in sub-
Saharan Africa with average farm sizes of about 1 ha. So far, food
production has kept up with population growth estimated at 2.92 per year
but at a cost: rising population densities are inexorably leading to
further fragmentation of holdings, overgrazing by livestock, declining
soil fertility and erosion, severe deforestation to satisfy energy
needs, and the opening up of Increasingly marginal lands for
cultivation. Experience gained under two ongoing IDA financed
integrated rural development projects (Kirimiro, Credit 1165 BU and
Ngozi III, Credit 1192 BU), both esec,.ed by autonomous regional
development companies (RDCs), have led to the following broad sectoral
strategies: (a) to focus the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock's
(MOAL) intervention in the agricultural sector on service and promotion
type activities (research and extension) at a cost sustainable under the
national budget; (b) to the extent possible, promote private sector
involvement in the processing and marketing of agricultural produce and
in the production and retail marketing of agricultural inputs; (c) to
increase the returns from Burundi9s major export crop, cot -e; and (d)
to promote activities to protect the natural resource base. The project
aims at pursuing some of these goals In the Muyinga province.
3.       Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project would Increase
agricultural production, develop crop and input marketing through
cooperatives and the private sector and promote environmental protection
in the Muyinga province.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project would be implemented
over a six year period and comprise: (a) the strengthening in the
Muyinga province of MOAL's services for agricultural research and
extension, forestry and agro-forestry, animal health, swamp development
and protection, and rural road improvement with a view to increase food
crop, coffee and livestock production and Improve soil conservation



through the creation of protection forests, on-farm erosion control and
agro-forestry; (b) the strengthening of the Muyinga Cooperatives Union
(and member cooperatives) to promote the sale of farm inputs and produce
through cooperatives and private traders; (c) the strengthening of
cooperative accounting and management in the Muyinga province through
support to the Cooperatives Department of the Ministry of Rural
Development (MRD); and (d) support to the Credit and Savings
Cooperatives for their establishment in the Muyinga province. It is
estimated that about 35,000 farmers in the province (58S of total) would
directly benefit from the project. Total project cost is estimated at
US $1W.6 million with a foreign exchange component of US $ 9.0 million
or 571. Proposed IDA financing amounts to US $10.0 million (641 of
project costs). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule
B. Disbursement amounts and schedule are presented in Schedule C. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Grouip
operations An Burundi are given in Schedules D and E, respectively.
Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6511-BU dated
August 20, 1987, is being circulated separately.
S.       Rationale for IDA Involvement,   In support of the Government's
strategy to maintain eadequate food production at sustainable costs, the
project would strengthen agricultural research, extension and animal
health services, and at the same time, ensure the careful management and
protection of the natural resource base. The project would promote
greater efficiency in the marketing of agricultural inputs and produce
through an Increased involvement of the private sector (traders and
cooperatives).
6.       Actions Agreed.  In line with the aims of the project to
strengthen and sustain services and to develop private sector
involvement, a number of project-specific agreements were obtained
during negotiations, the most important of which are: (a) in order for
the Credit to finance part of the project's production of coffee tree
plants (for onward dibtribution to farmers free of charge) the
Government would provide IDA with its action and financial program to
replace and expand its coffee plantings, thus allowing IDA to review and
comment on the Government's policies and practices in thir! regardt (b)
leasing agreements between the Government and the cooperatives for
project funded equipment and buildings would have to be acceptable to
IDA; (c) assistance to the forestry department (for forestry and fruit
tree production) and ISABU (for reseach) would be the object of annual
agreements between these agencies and the project unit; (d) Government
financing of existing sa'zries and operating costs in Muyinga province
would continue to be funded through the recurrent budget rather than
through the development budget; (e) agricultural inputs for resale would
be sold at retail through private traders and cooperatives rather than
through Government services; and (f) a Project Implementation Unit (PrU)
would be created for the duration of the investment period only for the
purpose of coordinating and monitoring project activities in the course
of implementation.



- 3 -
7.       Justificrtion.  The project Is justified by the institutional
development benefits arising from the strengthening of MOAL services in
the Muyinga province and from increased private sector participation; by
the environmental benefits stemiang from the creation of protection
forests, soil couservation, agro-forestry and swamp protectiong and by
the Incremental food crop, coffee and livestock production valued at US
$3.5 million per annum by the end of the project period. The economic
rate of return has been estimated at 392.
8.       Risks. The project vwuld institute a number of innovations as
regards the role of cooperatives and the private sector.  Although the
scale of these innovations has been kept to mwdest levels, th-..
capability of cooperatives and the attitude of the Government are still
untested. The Government has expressed its commitment to these
innovations. Strengthening of monitoring and evaluation has been built
into project design to generate the information necessary for close
supervision of the Implementation of these innovations by the Government
and IDA.
9.       Recoumendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
