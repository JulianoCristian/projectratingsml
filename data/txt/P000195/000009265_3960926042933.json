      improve the quality of food crop, coffee and livestock\n            production and to increase farm income.  More specifically,\n            in attempting to achieve this objective, the project seeks\n            to address the issues of the agricultural sector as they\n            apply to Muyinga province, within the context of the\n            Government's broader policies.  To that end, the\n            project consists of:  (a) strengthening of research and\n            extension services in Muyinga; (b) improvement of marketing\n            channels through strengthening of agricultural cooperatives\n            in Muyinga; and (c) promotion of agro-forestry and\n            environmental protection through reafforestation and erosion\n            control.  In addition, the project entails:  (d)\n            strengthening animal health services and promotion of the\n            integration of agriculture and livestock activities; and (e)\n            greater utilization of swamp areas for food production\n            through swamp infrastructure improvements."}, "docdt": "1987-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
