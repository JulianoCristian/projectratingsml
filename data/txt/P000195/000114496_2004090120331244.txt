Re:
Credit No. 1857 BU (Muyinga Agricultural Developmemnt Project)
Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
 Excellency,
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement), dated February 
9, 1988, between the Republic of Burundi (the Borrower) and the International 
Development Association (the Association) for the Project captioned above, as amended 
to date.
Further to your request for an increase in the percentages of expenditures to be 
financed under the Credit during the difficult transition period being faced by the 
Borrower, we are pleased to inform you that the Association accedes to your request 
and hereby agrees to amend the Agreement as follows:
"The percentages of expenditures to be financed under Category (5) of the 
table set 
forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement are increased form 
their current level 
to read as follows: 100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of 
local expenditures. This 
increase will be effective as of the effective date 
of this amendment and apply until the 
Closing Date of the Project, or December 31, 
1996, whichever comes first. In the latter 
case, as of  January 1, 1997, all 
percentages will revert to their previous levels as they 
were in effect on December 
31, 1994."
      Please kindly confirm your agreement with this amendment by signing and dating 
the two original copies of this letter in the space provided therefor and by returning 
to us one duplicate original duly signed and confirmed.
This amendment shall become effective upon receipt by the Association of one 
duplicate original of this letter duly signed and confirmed.
Sincerely,
