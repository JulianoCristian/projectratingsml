APPRAISAL OF THE FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUQJ4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.       ~East Cameroon and West Cameroon gained independence in 1960 and
1961 respectively, and joined to become a Federal State in October 1961.
'Jhile the Federation is still in a transition period and some administra-
tive responsibilities at Federal and State levels have not yet been firmly
established, the task of unifying the country is being pursued with energy
and relative success. Part of this task involves the improvement of the
transport links between the important population centers of the country,
to stimulate and support the evolving integration of the national economy.
ii.       The economic growth of Cameroon, as in most African countries,
hinges on its agricultural development. Cameroon has considerable produc-
tive potential, but development of important inland regions has been ham-
pered by the limitations and unreliability of the transport system on which
the export of agricultural output depends. Recognizing the decisive impor-
tance of transportation to the country's economic growth, the Gover-nment
has emphasized the improvement of the network in its development plans.
This emphasis is strongly reflected in the Second Five-Year Development
Plan (i966/67-1970/71) which allocates about one-third of total public and
private investment, or about CFAF 58 billion (IJS$209 million), for major
improvements of all transport modes.
iii.      The country is highly dependent on land transport since it has
no natural waterways except the Benue River, a linmited capacity route that
flows from northern Cameroon to ports in Nigeria. The Government considers
its single most important prograni in the development of land transport to
be the improvement of the Transcameroon route, a vital inter-regional and
international link about 2,000 km long. This route connects the heavily
populated and potentially highly productive northern provinces with the
rest of the country and the sea, particularly to Yaounde, the capital, and
Douala, the main port, and serves the southwestern part of land-locked Chad
as well. The Transcameroon program involves the improvement of the main
railway line from Douala to Yaounde, extension of this railway to N'Gaoundere
sclieduled for completion in early 19714, and the much needed improvement of
the road from N'Gaoundere, through Garoua and Mora, to Fort Foureau, oppo-
site Fort Lamny in Chad.  The railway extensions are being financed with the
assistance of FAC, FI), USAID and EIB.  Improvements to parts of the road.
are being financed and are expected to be financed by the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaurbau of the Federal Republie of Germaay. The Government has
requested Bank Group financing for improvement of the remaining major road
section of this important road/rail route.
iv.       The proposed project includes the improvement of the section of
the Transcameroon road linking N'Gaoundere and Garoua (273 km) for which
feasibility studies and detailed engineering have been undertaken as a
part of IDA Engineering Credit S-3CM, and the feasibility studies and
detailed engineering for the Garoua-Mora link (254 km). The existing



- ii -
N'Gaoundere-Garoua link is a low-standard gravel road. Its reconstruction
will not only reduce transport costs but also permit all-weather transport.
v.        A new road between Tiko and Victoria in West Cameroon is also
included in the proposed project. Victoria is an important port and com-
mercial center serving West Cameroon, and the Government is anxious to
link it effectively vith Douala in East Cameroon as a step toward inte-
gration of the two States. To this end, a greatly shortened road between
Tiko and Douala has recently been completed and is expected to generate
considerable traffic between Douala and Victoria. But the remaining sec-
tion of the existing road linking these two centers is inadequate for
present traffic estimated at about 1,500 vehicles per day. The proposed
road between Tiko and Victoria (22 km) will have increased capaclty,
through widening, realignment and construction of a stronger foundation.
The feasibility studies and detailed engineering for this road were car-
ried out as another part of the IDA Engineering Credit S-3CM.
vi.       The project includes a feasibility study and detailed engineering
for the improvement of the Douala-Pont du Nkam road, one of the most heavily
trafficked roads in East Cameroon (2,000 veh/day). l'he road was not des-
igned for this heavy traffic and the pavement is deteriorating rapidly.
vii.      The total cost of construction and consultants' services, includ-
ing contingencies, is estimated at US$23.7 million equivalent. Bank Group
financing of us$17.6 million equivalent, i.e. 74% of total costs for this
part of the project, is proposed. This amount includes US$15.8 million
equivalent for foreign costs and US$1.8 million equivalent for local costs.
Financing of this portion of local costs (23%) is considered justified on
country grounds. The balance of US$6.1 million equivalent will be made
available by the Federal Government. The project also includes financing
by the Bank Group of US$865,000 for interest on the Bank Loan e uring the
construction period and US$550,000 for refunding of IDA Engineering Credit
S-3CM. The total of Bank Group financing at US$19 million equivalent will
be provided by an IDA Credit of US$7 million equivalent and a Bank Loan of
US$12 million equivalent.
viii.     The Loan and Credit vill be made to the Federal Government.
The Ministry of Planning and Development, with the technical assistance
of the Public Works Departments of East Cameroon and West Cameroon, vill
be responsible for the execution of the project. Contracts for construc-
tion vill be avarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Supervision of construction will be done by consultants.
ix.       The proposed project will considerably improve sections of ma-
jor road connections, thereby facilitating the transport of important
exports and distribution of consumer goods, as vell as aiding the inte-
gration of the country. The investment is justified, however, on the
basis of savings in vehicle operating costs alone. The quantifiable bene-
fits will yield rates of return of about 13% on the N'Gaoundere-Garoua
road and about 14% on the Tiko-Victoria road.



- iii -
x.        The project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$7 million and a Bank Loan ot US$12 million for a period of 30 years
including a ten year period of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THE FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In June 1964, the Bank made a Techuical Assistance Grant of
US$200,000 to the Federal Republic of Cameroon for a feasibility study of
possible improvements of the 290 km N'Gaoundere-Garoua road. This study,
carried out by the French consultants, Ingeroute, vas part of a major pro-
gram to improve the 2,000 km Transcameroon road/rail route which connects
the main port, Douala, vîth the potentially productive northern provinces
of Cameroon. This route also serves a large volume of import/export traf-
fic for the southwestern region of land-locked Chad. The program includes
the extension of the Douala-Yaounde railway line to N'Gaoundere, vith fi-
nancial aid from FAC, FED, USAID and EIB. Construction of the line has
been delayed and is now expected to be completed early in 1974.
1.02      The delay in constructing the railway in turn delayed further
consideration of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road until January 1968, vhen IDA
made an Engineering Credit (S-3CM) of US$550,000 to help finance the de-
tailed engineering and additional economic studies for this road.  At the
request of the Governient, economic studies and detailed engineering for
the improvement of the Tiko-Victoria road (22 km) in West Cameroon vere
also included in that credit. Under the Engineering Credit, a single con-
tract for both roads vas awarded by the Government with IDA approval to
the Consultants, DIWI-SCET Cooperation, a joint venture of a German firm
and a French firm. The consultants have completed their final reports
and will assist the Government in evaluating the bids for construction
works.
1.03      The Government has nov requested Bank Group financing for the
construction of the two roads included in the Engineering Credit and for
feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the improvement of the
roads in East Cameroon between Garoua and Mora (254 km), part of the Trans-
cameroon route, and between Douala and Pont du Nkam (180 km). The total
cost of the project, vhich includes refunding of Engineering Credit S-3CM
and the payment of interest on the Bank Loan during the construction period,
is estimated at about US$25.1 million equivalent. This amount vill be
financed by an IDA Credit of US$7 million equivalent, a Bank Loan of US$12
million equivalent, and the Goverument's contribution of US$6.1 million
equivalent.
i.o4      This report vas prepared by Messrs. Snel (Engineer) and Wouters
(Economist) on the basis of the findings of their appraisal mission in
March/April 1969, Mr. Snel's- follov-up visit in October 1969, and the
economic and engineering studies carried out by Ingeroute and DIWI-SCET
Cooperation. The report vas edited by Miss J. Murphy.

2. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Cameroon has been a Federal State since 1961; it comprises the
States of East Cameroon and West Cameroon, formerly administered by France
and the United Kingdom. The Federation is still evolving and the respec-
tive functions of the administration at the Federal and State levels have
not yet been clearly established.
2.02      The country is situated on the west coast of Africa and is bor-
dered by Nigeria and Chad on the north, by the Central African Republic
on the east, and by Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republie of Congo
(Brazzaville) on the south. The Federation covers an area of 475,450 km2,
almost as large as that of France. The coastal and southern areas have
high humidity and high temperature throughout the year and are suitable
for tropical crops such as coffee, cocoa, palm oil, rubber and bananas.
In the north near Lake Chad, rainfall is seasonal and conditions are suit-
able for the cultivation of cotton, groundnuts, rice and other cereals.
Between these areas lies a high, sparsely populated plateau vith good
grazing potential.
2.03      Population is estimated at about 5.5 million and is growing at
an estimated rate of 2.1% per year. Population densities are highest in
the southwest, in the northern provinces, and around Yaounde, the capital.
These are also the areas vith highest production.
z.04      About three quarters of the working population is engaged in
agriculture, predominantly on a smallholder basis. There are few planta-
tions and a large part of the exports is being produced by individual farm-
ers as a cash crop. Because Cameroon has few known minerals and, as yet,
few manufacturing industries, the economy is largely dependent on the ex-
port of its agricultural products, such as cocoa, coffee and cotton. De-
velopment efforts have focused on increasing agricultural production and
transporting it to market areas efficiently.  Foreign trade accounts for
about 40% of Gross Domestic Produet (GDP). In recent years, total output
has grown at a rate of 5% per year, and per capita GDP is about US$140.
B. Transportation System
2.05      The transport system is not extensive, consisting of a few kilo-
meters of navigable river, 830 km of railways, and only 8,000 km of roads
maintained regularly by the Public Works Departments. Like the country's
economy, this system is highly oriented tovard external trade. It serves
mainly to export the agricultural products of the country and to bring in
imports of consumer goods, raw materials, and capital goods for productive
investment.
2.o6      The Benue river, the only navigable waterway of Cameroon, is
shallov and its use is limited to three months during the rainy season.



- 3 -
Its transport capacity is therefore only about 60,000 m tons annually.
Transport is very slow, frequently taking up to nearly one year for export
cargoes to reach the sea. The northern provinces exported their agri--
cultural products via the Benue to Atlantic Ocean ports before the river
was closed in 1966 because of hostilities in Nigeria. During the inter-
ruption of river traffic, exports had to be transported entirely via the
Transcameroon route. The improvement of the Transcameroon route will con-
siderably reduce transport costs and enable year-round and speedier ship-
ment entirely through Federal territory.
2.07      The railway network consists of two main lines: the Northern
Line, 187 km long, between Douala and Nkongsamba, and the Central Line,
345 km long, vhichn connects Douala to Yaounde. The latter is part of the
Transcameroon route. A 296 km extension to Belabo vas opened to traffic
last April; the construction of the 328 km extension to N'Gaoundere is
expected to begin early in 1970 and be completed by 1974. As noted earlier,
these extensions are being financed with the assistance of FED, FAC, USAID
and EIB. Traction on the railway is entirely dieselized. The system is
owned and operated by the Regie des Chemins de Fer du Cameroon (REGIEFERCAM),
an autonomous public corporation, although subject to general policy direc-
tives by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The volume of
freight carried by the Central Line has increased during the past five
years at an average rate of 4% per year; in 1968 it amounted to 826,000
tons. This line serves an area with considerable growth potential; it
will open timber resources in the region south of Belabo, and the extension
of the line to N'Gaoundere should attract substantial additional traffic.
2.08      The level of railway service on the Central Line needs improve-
ment. Worn out rails, poor track alignment and lack of rolling stock
cause delays and limit the capacity. The Government has dravn up an im-
provement program and has requested the Bank Group for financial assistance.
The Government's request is presently being considered by the Bank Group.
2.09      Douala, the main port of Caneroon, annually handles about 1.4
million tons of cargo. The lighterage ports at Tiko and Victoria in West
Cameroon handle a total of about 110,000 tons annually. Traffic through
Tiko and Victoria has declined gradually since 1960 because of a decrease
in export production in West Cameroon and attraction of traffic to the
deep-water port at Douala. The Douala Port Authority and the Government,
with the assistance of the French/German consulting firm, OCCR/DSBY/SOGREAH,
are currently studying the possibility or improving conditions in this
congested port or developing a new deep-sea port elsewhere, probably near
Victoria.
2.10      The Government attaches consiterable importance to transportation
development.  The Second Five-Year Development Plan (1966/67-1970/71) allo-
cates about one-third of total public and private investment or about CFAF 58
billion (US2029 million equivalent) for major improvements of all transport
rnodes (T'able 1). A major emphasis of this program is the further develop-
ment of efficient and reliable means of transport to and from the sea to
increase the competitiveness of the country's primary export produets. The



- 14 -
Federal Government is also faced with important tasks of economic and so-
cial integration for which the existing network was not developed. Thus,
a second major focus in transportation planning is the development of
links to stimulate and support the evolving integration of the national
economy. These two major emphases of development strategy for transpor-
tation are to a large extent embodied in the improvement of the Trans-
cameroon road/rail route and the Douala-Pont du Nkam road, and in the
development of a direct link between Victoria and Douala. Sections of'
these important routes comprise the proposed project.
C. Transport Adinistration
2.11     lIo Ministry has full responsibility for overall transport problems,
such as coordination of the various modes, or establishment of investment
priorities within the transport sector. Although the Ministry of Planning
and Development tries to keep abreast of problems as they occur, coordi-
nation as such is done only on an ad hoc basis as difficulties present
themselves. These problems include: competition between road and rail
transport; rapidly shifting traffic patterns vhich may affect investment
priorities; differences in road and bridge design standards and vehicle
regulations between the tvo States (para. 3.13); and deficiencies in the
collection of traffic counts and other transport statistics (paras. 3.06
and 3.07). During negotiations, the Government informed the Bank Group of
its intention to study the modifications required for the coordination and
strengthening of the transport sector, and it agreed to collect periodically
highway transport and highway traffic data.
3. THE HIGI1WAY SECTOR
A. Administration
3.01      Administration of the highway network is carried out by the
Public Works Departments (PWDs) of the States of East Cameroon and West
Cameroon. Each is responsible for the national and main roads within its
state, whereas local and feeder roads are administered and maintained by
the local authorities.
3.02      Although the PWD of East Cameroon (Chart 1) is assisted by qual-
ified French engineers under a FAC technical assistance program, the per-
sonnel of the Roads and Bridges Section and of the Road M4aintenance Section
is insufficient for their needs. The staffing at headquarters should be
strengthened to enable foreign experts to assist in the training of
Cameroonian engineers. The Maintenance Section within the PWD coordinates
the road maintenance operations of the area divisions and provides liaison
between the PWD and a Central Equipment Pool which hires out most mainte-
nance equipment (para. 3.11).



- 5 -
3.03      In West Cameroon, the PWD is organized similarly to that in East
Cameroon, except that this State's smaller size makes possible the coordi-
nation of maintenance operations by a Chief Engineer of Roads (Chart 2).
Here too, there is a lack of qualified engineers, especially in the area
divisions, three of wnich are headed by sub-professionals. However, IJSAID
has provided some training of Cameroonian engineers, and this is not so
pressing a problem as in East Cameroon.  The PWD of West Cameroon also
provides some technical assistance to the Community Development Program
in that State, through which local and feeder roads are built. During
negotiations the Government agreed to take measures to strengthen the
staffing of the PWIDs and to provide on-the-job training of Cameroonian
engineers.
B. The Higtvwav Network
3.o4      The density of the highway network varies considerably vithin
the country. The populous regions in the southwest and the north have
the most extensive networks, but there are few interconnections. Parts
of the country, particularly the southeast, have no road or rail con-
nections at all. While Cameroon does have some road links with neigh-
boring countries, they are of low quality and traffic is negligible.
However, traffic to and from Chad is exDected to increase considerably
when the Transcameroon route is fully improved.
3.05      The total length of the road network is about 20,700 km, about
17,500 km in East Cameroon and about 3,200 km in West Cameroon. But of
this, only about 8,000 km is maintained regularly by the PWDs. Although
the general condition of the road system is still less than satisfactory,
it has imnproved considerably in recent years as a result of a concerted
effort by the Government and the PWDs of both East and West Cameroon.
Table 2 shows the growing road network, according to type, which is being
regularly maintained by the PWDs.
C. Traffic Characteristics
3.06      Statistics regarding the motor vehicle fleet of East Cameroon
are inexact because vehicles are registered only when they are imported
(Table 3), and retirement from service is not officially recorded. The
number of vehicles in operation is estimated at about 30,000, of which
about 20% are trucks, about 19% light delivery vans, 52% passenger cars
and 9% motorcycles, etc.  In West Cameroon, vehicles are registered an-
nually; the number in operation at present is about 6,soo.  The composition
of the vehicle fleet is similar to that in East Cameroon. Annual growth
of the fleet for the country as a whole is tentatively estimated at 10%
for passenger cars and 4% for trucks and vans. This low truck growth rate,
however, does not reflect the increasing capacity of the newer bulk goods
carriers.
3.07      Traffic densities vary from about 2,000 vehicles per day on the
road froin Douala leading northwards to Pont du Nkam to 10 vehicles per day
on the track from Mora to Maltan in the north of Hast Cameroon. Traffic



- 6 -
counts have been taken regularly on the main roads in East Cameroon since
early 1968, as requested by the Bank under Engineering Credit S-3CM.
In West Cameroon, traffic counts have been carried out regularly since
1960; only during the last few years, however, have fairly consistent
results been obtained. These few statistics, fuel consurmption data and
vehicle registration figures suggest an annual growth rate in truck traf-
fic of ù;% and in passenger cars of about 15rf.
D.  P1annin and Financin!
3.08      Planning of future roads is performed by the Ministry of Planning
and Development with the assistance of the PWDs of Xast and West Cameroon.
The second Five-Year Development Plan (1966/67-1970/71) shows a irooposed
investment of CFAF 16.5 billion (US'l5( million equivalent) for roads and
bridges. By early 1969, about 27% of the proposed investment had been
secured through external aid from FAC, FED, USAII) and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KF4). Financing of about 43% has been or will be requested
frorm the Bank Group, FAC, FED and KFW. No formal requests have so far
been made for the remainder of the investment.  The program for the high-
way sector is ambitious and it is doubtful whether the necessary external
financing can be found in time. The Plan does not establish clearly an
order of priority among the planned highways, but the Government considers
roads to and from the Atlantic sea ports and roads which serve the country's
integration of utmost importance.
3.09      A UNDP financed study of the development of transport in south-
eastern Cameroon and the adjacent part of the Central African Republie has
recently been carried out jointly by the consulting firms BCEOM (France)
and NEDECO (Netherlands). The Bank, as Executing Agency for the study,
has reviewed the consultants' final report. The consultants' recommen-
dations do not affect the proposed project as their study was mainly direc-
ted toward assessing the economic potential of southeastern Cameroon and
evaluating transport alternatives for that region.
3.10      Revenues from highway transport derive from import duties on
vehicles, taxes on fuel and licensing fees. These revenues are roughly
estimated at CFAF 4,100 million (US$14.8 million equivalent) of which 75Z
is contributed by fuel taxes. The expenditures on highways appear as
various items in the budget. The total 1968/69 highway budget of East
Cameroon amounts to CFAF 1,500 million (about US$5.4 million equivalent)
including a modest amount of CFAF 195 million (US$0.7 million equivalent)
for new construction and about CFAF 968 million (US$3.5 million equivalent)
for maintenance. There are no figures available for total 1968/69 high-
way expenditures in West Cameroon, but the allocations for maintenance
and rehabilitation amount to about CFAF 147 million (US$0.5 million equiv-
alent). The total of these highway expenditures is adequately covered by
the revenues from highway transport.

E. Maintenance
3.11      PWD roads in East and West Cameroon are maintained by mechanized
maintenance forces of the area divisions. The PWDs also provide some road
maintenance equipment and technical assistance for the maintenance of lo-
cal roads while the local authorities provide labor forces. In 1968,
all maintenance equipment was combined into a Central Equipment Pool from
which the area divisions obtain necessary equiDment for their maintenance
operations. The Government also installed central workshops for equipment
inspection and repair. This reorganization allows for regular replacement
of equipment and makes possible an accurate accounting of plant costs in
road maintenance. Although the Government is confident that sufficienit
equipment and personnel for operations and servicing are available, actual
road maintenance is not satisfactory. Additional steps to improve the
strength of highway management are being studied by the Goverrment.
3.12      The CFAF 1,115.6 million (tSit4.o million equivalent) allocated
for highway maintenance in the 1968/69 budget (Table 4) includes actual
cost of materials, the hire of maintenance equipment and its repair, but
does not include the cost of labor involved which is financed under a
different heading in the budget. Although this procedure makes it dif-
ficult to determine actual total expenditures for maintenance operations,
the appropriations per km seem reasonable. During the past few years,
substantial external financial aid has been given to Cameroon for the im-
provement of road mainterance operations. FAC provided a technical as-
sistance mission to East Cameroon in 1965 and financed the purchase of
equipment. USAID has assisted West Cameroon through technical aid ancL
financed the purchase of road construction and maintenance equipment.
F.  EnAeering nd Construction
3.13      The PWDs, together with the Ministry of Planning and Development,
determine the need for road construction. Most new roads are designed by
consultants. The main task of both PWDs is the preparation of rehabilita-
tion works and maintenance. One of the urgent problems before the PWDs is
to agree upon design standards and vehicle regulations for both regions of
Cameroon (para. 2.11).  The (overnment confirmed during negotiations that
it intends to study this problem.
:3.14     Major highway construction works are nornally carried out by
contractor3. Tlhere are few local contracting firms; however, some French
firmrw have estal)lished themselves in Cameroon. Construction materials
are available throughout most of thie country. But continuous heavy rain-
fall in the coastal area severely hanpers roadworks and raises construction
costs while in the north, operations have to be suspended for long periods
during the rainy season.

4.  Tf1H PROJECTI
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of the following (see Map):
(1) Road Construction
(a)  Improvement of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road (273 km)
in East Cameroon, including supervision of construc-
tion by consultants.
(b)  Improvement of the Tiko-Victoria road (22 km) in
West Cameroon, including supervision of construction
by consultants.
(2)  Consultants' Services for Feasibility Studies and
Detailed EnUineerin  for:
(a)  Improvement of the Garoua-Mora Road (254 km).
(b) Improvement of the Douala-Pont du Nkam road (180 km).
(3)  Refundin  of Enineering Credit S-3CM
(4) Interest During Construction on Bank Loan
B.  Imrrovement of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua Road
4.02      This road is part of the Transcameroon route (para. 1.01).  The
Waza-Maltam section of this route is being paved with financial aid from
the Federal Republic of Germany (KFW); at the present time, these improve-
ments are about 80% complete. The same agency is expected to finance the
improvement of the connecting Mora-Waza section. The construction of the
railvay line from Belabo to N'Gaoundere (para. 2.07) is expected to begin
early this year and is scheduled for completion in 1974.  The N'Gaoundere-
Garoua road and the Garoua-Mora road would be the remaining unimproved road
sections of the Transcameroon route.
4.03      The existing N'Gaoundere-Garoua road (290 km) does not allow ail
weather traffic over sections totalling 233 km. Transportation costs on
this part of the road are very high because of frequent interruptions of
the traffic during the rainy season, a poor quality surface course and a
poor alignnent.  The remaining part of the road is reasonably well sur-
faced. The new road vill have improved alignnent, shortening its length
by 17 km. A bituminous pavement of 6 m width will ensure all-veather
service. The design standards (Table 5) are adapted to the topography and



- 9 -
are satisfactory. Detailed engineering and bidding documents, financed
under Engineering Credit S-3CM, have been completed by the consultants,
DIWI-SCET Cooperation.
4.o4      The N'Gaoundere-Graroua road will link directly with the future
railhead at N'Gaoundere. In addition, a road of about 4 km length, by-
passing 1t'Gaoundere, will provide a direct link for traffie from the roads
souttl of the city to the new Garoua road.  It will also conneet the local
airport with the project road.  The cost of detailed engineering and con-
structîon of this short connection is included in the project.
C.  Imnprovement of the Tiko-Victoria Road
4.05      The Tiko-Victoria road (22 km) is the extension of the new road
from Douala to Tiko, which was opened for traffic in March 1969. The
traffic on the existing road averages 1,500 vehicles per day. The road
traverses mountainous terrain and some sections are winding; the asphalt
pavement is narrov and not able to withstand the present traffic. Costly
repairs of the pavement have to be carried out to keep traffic moving.
Since the foundation of the existing road is inadequate, repairs to the
road surface would provide only a very temporary improvement and would not
increase the bearing capacity of the pavement. Improvements of the road
will consist of constructing a new foundation, widening the asphalt pave-
ment to 7 m, reducing the gradient in some sections and realigning some
very winding sections. Some single lane bridges will be widened and some
bridges showing folndation failures will be replaced. The design stan-
dards (Table 5) are suitable, taking into account that the road traverses
rolling to mountainous country.
4.06      Preliminary engineering studies for the improvement of the road
were initially carried out by the PWD of West Cameroon. Detailed engineer-
ing and bidding documents, also financed under Engineering Credit S-3CM,
have been completed by the consultants, DIWI-SCET Cooperation.
F. Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering for
the_Improvement of the Garoua-14ora Road
)1.oyf    This road (254 km), which is the northern extension of the
N'Gaoundere-Garoua road, has several sections of varying standards. 13e-
tween (;aroua and Maroua, 71 km were paved in 19621, but recent pavement
failuires need to be investigated. Further north, the road between Maroua
and Mora is in a very poor condition and requires improvement.  Engineer-
ing studies for an improvement of the M4aroua-Mora road vere financed by
'EED in 1965, but no financing for the construction of this road could be
obtained due to excessive estimated costs. Since the Garoua-Mora road,
if left in its present condition, is likely to affect adversely the traf-
fic on the proposed N'Gaoundere-Garoua road, a feasibility study and de-
tailed engineering of its improvement is included in the project. The



- 10 -
feasibility study will identify sections which should be improved and estab-
lish priorities of future construction, whereas the detailed engineering
will give particular attention to cost reduction possibilities. USAID has
financed an economic study of a 145 km road from Maroua via Mora towards
Maiduguri in Nigeria (total length to Maiduguri - 220 km). This study is
expected to be completed in April 1970 and the Terms of Reference for the
Garoua-Mora road study will require the consultants to analyze the resuits
of the USAID-financed study as a part of their own assignment, so as to
avoid duplication of work.
I<.  Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering for the
In_provement of the Douala-Pont du Nkoam Road
4.08      Average annual traffic on this road (180 km), which linlcs Douala
to an important, densely popuilated agricultural region, is estimated at
about 2,000 vehicles per day. The road was paved during 1953/1954 and
designed for maximum axle loads which have now been largely exceeded.
The pavement is deteriorating rapidly and repairs to the road surface
vill only be a temporary remedy. The PWD of East Cameroon has carried
out technical studies for the strengthening of the pavement and for local
improvements to the alignnent. These studies are, however, not complete,
and, provided the findings of the feasibility study are affirmative, com-
plementary technical studies will still have to be carried out. The fea-
sibility study vill give particular attention to the existence of the
Northern Railway line (para. 2.07), which runs parallel to the existing
road.
F. Refunding of Engineering Credit S-3CM
4.09      The design and cost estimates for the construction works of the
pronosed project are based upon consultants' services financed by Engineer-
ing Credit S-3CM. Except for their assistance to the Government in the
bidding procedures and the evaluation of bids, the consultants have com-
pleted their assignment.  It is proposed to refund the amount already
disbursed under Engineering Credit S-3CM, and to carry out the uncomrleted
parts of that project, under the proposed project.
G.  Interest on the Bank Loan Durinf Construction
4.10      To assist the Government in the financing of its transportation
development program, it is proposed to include in the project, as an elî-
gible foreign exchange cost, the interest and other charges on the Loan
accrued before the completion of the project.
H.  Execution of the Project
4.11      The Federal Ministry of Planning and Development will have over-
all responsibility for the execution of the project and will be assisted



- il -
in technical matters by the PWDs of East and West Cameroon. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory and vere confirmed during negotiations. Unit
price contracts will be avarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding by prequalified contractors.  Assurance was obtained from the Gov-
ernment during negotiations that the Bank/IDA Guidelines will be followed
for the bidding procedures. The N'Gaoundere-Garoua road will be divided
into three approximately equal sections, and contractors will be invited
to submit bids for any combination or all of the three sections. Assuming
that the Loan/Credit becomes effective in April 1970, construction of this
road is expected to begin in the fall of 1970 and to be completed by mid
1973. The improvement of the Tiko-Victoria road will be avarded as one
contract.  The works period will be from late 1970 to mid 1972.
4.12      Since the PWDs of East and West Cameroon are understaffed, the
project includes the services of consultants for the supervision of con-
struction on the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road and the Tiko-Victoria road. For
reasons of continuity the (lovernment would like the consultants vho drew
un the detailed engineering (DIWI-SCET) to supervise the construction.
This is a satisfactory arrangement.
4.13      The Governnent gave assurances during ne,gotiations that the con-
sultants for feasibility studies and detailed engineering vill be selected
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank Group.  The feasibility
and engineering studies will begin in mid 1970 and should be completed in
nid 1972.

- 13 -
4.15      The construction estimates are based upon the consultants' calcu-
lations of quantities and estimated unit prices. The cost of supervision
of construction is estimated at 7.5% of construction costs. The cost of
detailed engineering for the N'Gaoundere bypass is estimated at CFAF 4.0
million or US$14,000 equivalent, and the feasibility and engineering studies
are based on the costs of similar studies in neighboring countries. In
the total cost of the project are included contingency allowances of 10%
for a possible increase in physical quantities of the improvement works
and of engineering services and of 10% for a price escalation for the
improvement works and engineering services. The interest on the Loan during
construction is based on a construction period of about 2.5 years for the
Ni'Gaoundere-Garoua road and of about 1.5 year for the Tiko-Victoria road;
construction of both roads is expected to begin in the fall of 1970.
4.16     i'he foreign currency compcnent of the construction costs of the
N'Gaoundere-Garoua Road is estimated at about 65% of total costs.  The
estimated percentage for the Tiko-Victoria Road is 70%, because its execu-
tion requires a higher proportion of equipment. The estimated foreign
currency component of the cost of supervision is 70% and of the feasibility
and engineering studies, 75%.  These percentages are based on actual costs
of similar services in other countries of West Africa and on the actual
costs of the feasibility and engineering studies of both roads under En-
gineering Credit S-3CM. The estimated total costs of improvement works
and consultants' services, including all contingencies, is estimated at
US3'$23.7 million equivalent. Bank Group financing of US$i7.6 million equiva-
lent, representing 74% of total costs for this part of the project, includes
US$l5.8 million equivalent for foreign costs and IJStl.s million equivalent
for local costs. Financing of this portion of local costs (23%) is consid-
ered justified on country grounds. %efundingr of IDA Engineering Credit S-3CM
(1JSg:550,o00) and interest on the Bank loan during construction (us$865,000)
raises the total of Bank Group financing to US$19 million equivalent. The
goverament has indicated during negotiations that US$6.1 million equivalent
will be made available for the remaining local costs.
4.17      The amounts already withdrawn from the account of Engineering
Credit S-3CMl will be disbursed from the proposed Credit.  Any amounts re-
quired to complete the project financed by Engineering Credit S-3CM will
also be disbursed froin the proposed Credit. Disbursements for improvement
works will be against tlhe monthly statements of the contractors. The Bank
Group will. finance 74% of' all construction costs and costs for consulting
services.  'Plie disbursement will be made from the IDA credit and af'ter
exlhaustion of this Credit, will continue to be made from the Loan.  Any
surplus in tlhe Loan account will be cancelled.

5. ECONOMIC ]VALUATION
A. General
5.01      The objective of the proposed project is to promote and support
the economic growth and integration of Cameroon through the improvement
of important transport links. The project will improve a section of the
Transcameroon route which extends into one of the most populated and poten-
tially productive areas and vill improve a heavily travelled road serving
areas of both East and West Cameroon.
B. Imxrovement of the À'Gaoundere-Garoua Road
5.02      The N'Gaoundere-Garoua road (273 km), a part of the Transcameroon
route, is an important inter-regional and international route vhich links
the heavily populated (1.5 million of Cameroon's 5.5 million inhabitants)
cotton production areas of northern Cameroon and southwestern Chad to the
future railhead at N'Gaoundere and thus to the port at Douala and the
vorld market. This route is the most logical and economic for the region.
An analysis of distance and costs shows that, vhen fully improved, this
route will be the most economic of the possible routes to the sea for both
northern Cameroon and part of southwestern Chad.
5.03      Northern Cameroon's economy depends on the export of its main
agricultural products: cotton, rice and some fish and meat. The improve-
ment of the Transcameroon route as far as Garoua vill greatly aid the
efficient transport and marketing of these products. Its improvement
should also encourage the expansion of this region's infant industries
(cement, beverage and textiles).
5.04      At present, transport costs on the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road are
high. Over 80% of its length, the gravel surfacing has all but disappeared.
The alignment is poor and during the rainy season, traffic is frequently
interrupted. Substantial savings in vehicle operating costs of up to
30%-40% (Table 6) can be expected from the improvement of the road.



- 15 -
5.05      Present traffic averages about 100 vehicles per day.  Volume of
freight was about 110,000 tons in 1968, reflecting the high percentage of
heavy vehicles, including an almost 20% proportion of truck trailers with
up to 35 ton carrying capacity. The existing traffic is expected to grow
at about 5% per annum whether the link is improved or not.  The Trans-
cameroon railway, when completed to N'Gaoundere in 1974, is expected to
attract considerable traffic from other routes. For the most part this
would consist of traffic from northern Cameroon and the Fort Lamy area of
Chad now using the longer and more costly Nigerian route, and southern
Chad traffic now using the transequatorial route (via CAR and the Congo B).
Further diverted traffie from central Chad is foreseen when the Trans-
cameroon route is improved the entire distance to Fort Lamy.  Because the
export crops of this inland area far fromn the sea are especially sensitive
to costs, the reduction in transport costs and the greater transport re-
liability resulting from the road and rail investments are expected to
generate substantial additional traffic. The overall growth in traffic on
the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road in the early years of the project would thus
be very rapid, reaching about 180 vehicles per day or about 190,000 tons
in 19714 (Table 7).
5.06      Additional factors have been taken into account in estimating
future traffic on the road. The reopening of the Benue river route may
attract about 25,000-30,000 tons from the projeet road. This estimate is
'based on river traffic before the hostilities in Nigeria, and is probably
an overstatement since the attractiveness of the river route compared to
the improved Transcameroon route is questionable. Also, a direct link
from southern Chad to N1'Gaoundere is being considered by the Chad Govern-
ment. This road, which is of high economic priority for Chad, would com-
pete with the project road for much of southern Chad traffic. But the
feasibility study for this link has not yet been carried out; it is there-
fore unlikely that the road would be completed before 1976. Thus, by 1977
it is estimated that most of Chad traffic using the N'Gaoundere-Garoua
road would be diverted to this new link. However, because this would not
take place until at least 4 years after completion of the project, and
affects only a small proportion of the total projected traffic of the
N'Gaoundere-Garoua road, its impact on the economie justification of the
project is slight.
5.07      On the basis of the savings in vehicle operating costs given in
para. 5.04 and Table 6, reconstruction of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road
would yield an internal rate of return of about 13% over 20 years. An
alternative was considered: namely, building the road now to high class
gravel road standard and paving it later. This would yield a lower rate
of return thian immediate paving of the road.  Immediate bituminous paving
of the project road is therefore preferred.
5.08      In addition to the benefits considered above, it is expected
that the road will promote and support the economie and administrative



- 16 -
integration of the southern and northern parts of the country, will further
improve the financial position and economics of the Transcameroon Railway,
and will also generally assist the economic development of the wider Chad
basin area, including parts of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria.
C.  Improvement of the Tiko-Victoria Road
5.09      The Tiko-Victoria road (22 km) is a major artery from Victoria,
the former capital of West Cameroon and an important port and commercial
center. When reconstructed, it will complete the Victoria-Douala highway,
linking East and West Cameroon; the new Tiko-Douala highway was completed
in March 1969, and has shortened the distance between the two ports from
250 km to 80 km.
5.10      The project road serves the surrounding agricultural region,
carrying the rubber, banana and palm products to market, and is also a
part of the road linking Victoria and Tiko with Buea, the new adminis-
trative center of West Cameroon. It carries high volumes of traffic,
averaging about 1,500 vehicles per day. The traffic is expected to in-
crease significantly because of the recent opening of the Tiko-Douala high-
way (Table 7).  New industries in Douala (cement, shoes, textiles, fertil-
izer, etc.) foresee outlets in West Cameroon: and the beaches around
Victoria should attract numerous week-end tourists from the Douala area.
5.11      The existing Tiko-Victoria road is structurally inadequate to
serve the heavy traffic it now carries, resulting in high vehicle operating
and road maintenance costs. The improvement of this road, which will be
widened, as well as shortened by nearly 2 km, is estimated to yield a rate
of return of about 14% based on savings in vehicle operating costs (Table
6) and road maintenance expenditures.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  the course of action to be taken by the Government in
respect of coordination of the transport sector (para.
2.11);
(b)  the collection of highway transport and highway traffic
statistics (para. 2.11); and
(c)  the strengthening of staffing of the PWDs and the pro-
vision of on-the-job training of Cameroonian engineers
(para. 3.03).



- 17 -
6.02      The Ministry of Planning and Development will have overall re-
sponsibility for the execution of the project and vill be assisted in
technical matters by the PWDs (para. 4.11).  Consultants vill supervise
the construction works and vill carry out the feasibility studies and
detailed engineering (paras. 4.12 and 4.13).
6.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
Credit of US$ 7 million equivalent and a Bank Loan of US$ 12 million equi-
valent, for a term of 30 years, including a ten year period of grace.
