1.        I submit the follouring report and recomncndation on a proposed
loan and credit in anl amount in various eurrencierc equivalent to US$12.0
million and US$7.0 million respectively to the Federal Republic of Cameroon
to assist in financing a road project.
PART I - HISTORICEL
2.        The Governnent of Cameroon has requested the assistncee of the
Bank and the Association in fiu=ncing a road project.  In 1964 the Bank madc
a US$200,000 technical assistanice grant to Camoroon for a feasibility study
of the N'Gaoundere-Ga.oua road in northern Cameroon.  This was followed in
1968 by a $550,000 engineering, credit for the detailed enginecring of thi.s
road and of the Tilko-Victoria road in We-ot Cameroon. These studies have
now been completed.
3.        The proposed. projOct, which Invrolves the improvement of these tiwo
roads and feasibility rnd engineering stut.i&V  for two other roads w,a3 ap-
praised in March 1969, with a follow-up visit bein!v made in October.
Negotiations with a  .elegction led by 1Mr. N. A. IMiouliom, Secretetyt General
of the Ministry of Finance, were completed in Washington on Docember 18,
1969.
4.        The follouing is a sum-mary of Bank loans and IDA credits to
Cameroon as of December 31, 1969:

Disbursements for the CAMDEV Project are inevitably slow because of the long
period required to complete it.  The IDA credit is being disbursed before
the Bank loan.
5,        The feasibility studies included in the present project my lecA
to requests to the Bank Group to finance the construction of the correspond-
ing roads. The Bank has just appraised a railwa.y project and is discussing
agricultural and po-ts projects.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        The resort 'ADDraisal of the First Highway Project - Cameroon"
(PTR33a) is attached.  Cameroon's transport system consists of about 630
kilometers of railway-s and 20C,00 kilometers of roads of which only 8,000
kilometers are regularly maintained.  The Benoue river is navigable about
three months in the year.  The Government is givina high priority to transport
develonment: the second five-year plan includes investments for improved
lin:s with thie sea both to incrcase cornDetitiveness of exports and to
intezrate the regions into the national economr.  The creation of a new.
Transcameroon rail/road route is the Principal manifestation of this Dolicy.
'Fnis involves exDanding the port of i)ouala, increasing the capacity of the
railway line from Douala to Yaounde. constructinz a railway from Yaounde to
lW'Gaoundere and improving the roads from U'Gaoundere through Garoua and Mora
and to Fort Foureau on the Lrontier with Chad. In addition to Bank and IDA
assistance, the Government is receivina funds from the United States, France,
the Federal ReDublic of Germany, the European Develonment Fund and the
Euronean Investment Bank for these projects, and the Government is also
making a substantial budgetary contribution.
10.       The completion of the Transcarcroon route will also assist the
economic develonment of the wider Chad basin area, including the Fort Lamy
zone in Cnad. A new road linking Moundou, in that country, directly to
xq'Gaoundere is under discussion.
11.       The Governvment is also imDroving the historically inadequate trans-
nort links with West Cameroon;  The road. from Douala to Tiko has recently
been rebuilt with French financing, and the oresent project would extend
a hirh standard paved route through to Victoria.  The Government also wishes
to develop the heavily used route from Docoala to Nkongsamba and the Nkam
rai.lry in the densely nopulated agricultural area of the Bamileke, as well
as other inter-regional links.
12.       The Federal Ministry of Planming and Development has overall
resnonsibility for tranr,ort olanninfr. Ti'he administration of road transoort
is the responsibility of the Departments of Public Works in East and West
Cameroon and no single entity is resn)onsible for overall coordination of
transnort nolicies.  The G.overnment intends to imnrove transport coordina-
tion and transport planning services and to strenrrthen the Departments of
Public Works. and will exchange views with the Bank about these matters.
13.       The N'Gaoundere-Garoua road will connect the currently isolated
northern regions of Cameroon and southwestern Chad with the future railway
to N'Gaoundere.  T'he nroject would imorove the realignment of the existing
road and the current low standard gravel 3urface would be upgraded to
bituminous nravement, oermitting all-weather transDort and reducing transport
costs.  Traffic is nxpected to grow rapid ly following the imorovement of
thtc road.  Tte projetrct is to be completed durinLg 1973, shortly before



the new railway will be opened. The estiomated internal rate of return to
the economy is 13 per cent.   The project also includes the feasibiliLy and
engineering studies of the Garoua Mora road.   This road iG the northern
extension of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road, and will be instrumental itl
ensuring the growth in traffic on it.
14.       The Tiko-Victoria road will link Victoria, tile main port and
communication centre in West Cameroon, to the existing Tiko-Douala road.
The construction of a stronger foundation, as well as the widening and
realignment of the road will increase its capacity. The estimated return
on this nart of the nroject is lb per cent.
15.       The Douala-Nlcongsamba-Pont du lNkam road carries heavy traffic and
the existing pavement is now breaking up. The proposed studies would assess
the economic justification and determine the best technical solution for the
improvement of that roadl.
16.       The overall cost of construction, engineering supervision and
feasibility and engineering studies is estimated to be equivalent to about
US$ 23.7 million, including contingencies. The Government will contribute
US$ 6.1 million and the Bank and IDA about US$ 17.6 million, or approximately
7£t Der cent. The size of the Government contribution takes account of the
size of the Government investment Drogran over the next three years and the
likely level of public savings (see paraaraph 24 below).   The Government
is making satisfactory efforts to contribute to this nr6gram as a whole and
to this large pro.ject.
17.       In addition to financing the above contracts, the Bank and IDA
will disburse an estimated US$ 865,000 for interest during construction on
the Bank Loan and US$ 550,000, as provided for in the draft Credit Agreement,
for the reimbursement of the S3CM engineering credit. As the first repay-
ment on that credit is due on March 1, 1970 and since the proposed new credit
may not be effective by that date, it is proposed, if the credit is approved,
to defer the payment of the first installment of the S3CP1 credit, amounting
to US$ 34,375, from Mlarch 1, 19'70 to September 1, 1970.
18.       Total Bank and IDA financing will, therefore, be US$ 17.2 million
for the estimated foreign costs and about US$ 1.6 million for local costs,
the balance being financed bv the Governmen-t. As described below, local cost
financing is justified in Caneroon on country grounds and it is particularly
important in this case, one of the largest development projects to be carried
out in the country.
19.       Construction contracts will be sublect to international bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. There is to be no retroactive
financing.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUiYHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Renublic of Cameroon
and the Bank, the draft Development Credit Agree.ment between the Federal
Republic of Cameroon and the. Association, the Recommendation and the ReDort
of the Committees provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of AqreeTnent of the Bank, and Article V section I (d) of the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Assodiation, respectively, and the draft resolutions
anprovinr the pronosed loan and develooment credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors senarately.
21.       The draft Loan and Development Credit Agreements conform generally
to the nattern of agreements for projeets of this kind.  The particular
covenants included in the draft DevelonDment Credit Agreement are incorpo-
rated by reference in the draft Loan.Agreement. Section 4.03 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement contains certain undertakings in respect of
transnort coordination and establishment of uniform transport policies and
regulations. In addition the drafts provide that, to the extent practic-
able, the IDA credit will be disbursed first except for the interest and
commitment charges on the Bank loan which would be met out of that loan
during -the construction period.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
22.       A report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the Federal
ReDublic of Cameroon' (AF79a), August 8, 1968, was distributed on September 4,
1966 (P68-171).  The conclusions of this report remain valid.  Basic data
on the economy are attached.  A Bank economic mission vill visit Cameroon
in March 1970.
23.       Since 1959, real GDP has increased by about 5 per cent ner year,
almost 3% per capita. Agriculture, which still emnloiys three-quarters of
the working population, accounts for 37 per cent of GDP, providing most of
the country's foodstuff' and 70 percent of exports. Manufacturing has
Drogressed ranidly durinr the past few years, as has the service sector.
The main bottleneck to growth is transportation.
24.       Government expenditures are divided between the Federal Government
and the two State Government budgets. 'The Federal Government's manarement
of fiscal and economic affairs has been good, taking into account the diffi-
culties arising after indenendence, the establishment of the federation
between two different re-ions, and the progressive elimination of preferences
in the French market.  The financial situation has been stable in recent
years except for 190;f when credit to the private sector exnanded rapidly,
resulting in a sudden increase in imports. The consequent decline in foreivn
exchange reserves was, however, reversed in early 1966.  Good fiscal per-
formance is reflected in consolidated Grovernment savings amounting to about
US$ 16 million in 1967/68, or 10 per cent of current receints.  The Federal
Covernmment develonment budzet, for 1969/70 -provides for expenditures amount-
ing to about US* 12.4l million compared with US$ 8 mnillion in 1968/69.*
* Calculated at the exchange rate of CFAF 276 per US$1.0 prevaillng since
August 10, 1969.



- 6 -
25.       The second five-year develooment plan (1966/67 to 1970/71) des-
cribes the Government's long-term develoDment stratery: gross domestic
product is expected to double'by 1(380 as a result of increasing the rate of
investment from 10 per cent to 16 ner cent of GDP distributed eq,ually 'be-
tween the private and public sectors.   The allocation of investment between
the various economic sectors is sound. The plan includes a substantial
allocation for investment in trrissport, particularly for the completion of
the Trans-Caineroon Railway.  During the Plan period, Cameroon should 'be able
to finance almost two-thirds of gross domestic investment from its own
resources. Public savings, however, which have increased greatly since the
early sixties, are unlikely to contribute more thmn 25 to 30 per cent over
the next three years to the public investments warranted by the country's
increasing absorptive ca.pacity. As a result, total external capital requir-
ements will exceed the foreign exchange component of Drojects suitable for
external financing; thus some local cost financing, is justified.
26.       Cameroon's debt service burden is moderate, amounting to about
3-1/2 per cent of export earLnings.  We have therefore been lending to
Cameroon on Bank terms in the past, and intend to continue to do so, as in
the present instance. Some IDA lending is justified, however, in view of
the country's low income and limited savings capacity, despite the ef'forts
which are being made to mobilize domestic resources for economic development.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH AITICLES OF AGR?EEtENT
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and of the Association resp)ectively.
PART VII - RECOM.MENDATION
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.
