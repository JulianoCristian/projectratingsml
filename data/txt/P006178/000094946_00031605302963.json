satisfactory: the project achieved its key objectives and 1)\n            established a regulatory framework that not only helped in\n            implementing the capitalization program but provided the\n            state with the capability to properly regulate the\n            capitalized enterprises in the future; developed an\n            accountability mechanism and a legal framework guaranteeing\n            the rights of all relevant parties; and 3) maximized the\n            value of the Bolivian's share in key petroleum sector\n            entities before and after capitalization, among other\n            objectives. Project sustainability is highly likely.\n            Similarly, both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            highly satisfactory. Key lessons learned were: Quality staff\n            with a clear mandate, sufficient autonomy, and authority is\n            critical to implementing reform programs, particularly\n            privatization of state-owned enterprises. To succeed, the\n            reforms have to be not only economically but also\n            politically sustainable. The privatization process should be\n            transparent with continuous education of the public. For\n            privatization to lead to greater competition, the regulatory\n            framework must be transparent prior to the divestiture\n            process. Bolivia's capitalization process where the\n            capitalization's sales money is invested in the\n            enterprise might be worth duplicating in other countries."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
