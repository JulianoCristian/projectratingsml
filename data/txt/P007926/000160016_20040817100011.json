The Panel did not substantiate the\n            requesters' claim that the reservoir causes constant\n            flooding of urban creeks. The Panel also finds that the\n            reservoir does not cause contamination of the Parana River\n            and the creeks. With respect to the claims that the\n            reservoir has caused the spread of diseases and severe\n            health problems the Panel notes that the Yacyreta reservoir\n            is not the cause of the polluted water used by the\n            complainants for washing clothes and that there are\n            potentially many different reasons why such skin irritations\n            might occur. The second set of claims alleges that a\n            proposed wastewater treatment plant, to be built in\n            Encarnacion, would further pollute the environment. The\n            third set of claims alleges that the families affected by\n            the raising of the reservoir level were not all identified.\n            The fourth set of claims alleges that the resettlement and\n            income restoration programs are not being properly\n            implemented. The Panels finds that the impacts of specific\n            resettlement sites were not fully assessed, and that\n            alternative sites for resettlement areas were not considered."}, "docdt": "2004-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
