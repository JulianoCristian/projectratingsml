                                   Background


1. On M a y 17, 2002, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection related
    to the Yacyreta Hydroelectric Project (the Project).

2. The Yacyreta Project i s a joint venture between Argentina and Paraguay created
    in 1973 with the bi-national Treaty of Yacyreta, which set forth the terms of the
   joint undertaking and created a semi-autonomous bi-national entity, the Entidad
    Binacional Yacyreta (EBY), to implement the Project. The Project's civil works,
    constructed on the Parana River, consist o f two 40 meters (m) high, five
    kilometers (km) long, concrete dams and 65 km o f embankment dam.                The
    works also include a 1.2 km long powerhouse containing 20 turbines, spillways
    and a navigation lock. In addition, the Project provides for a large program o f
    infrastructure relocation, population resettlement, and environmental impact
    mitigation. The dam was designed to be maintained at a level o f 83 meters above
   mean sea level (masl), which would create a reservoir of 1065 square km. In
    1994 the reservoir was filled to 76mas1, as part o f a phased filling plan according
   to which 83mals would have been reached in 1998. However, a number of
   resettlement, environmental and complementary civil works activities have yet to
   be completed. Thus, as o f today, the reservoir's water level has not been raised
   higher than 76mas1, and the dam i s still operating at 60 percent o f its capacity.

3. On August 23, 2002, the Panel submitted it Report and Recommendation to the
   Board recommending the Board to authorize an investigation o f the claims
   presented in the Request. The Board approved the Panel recommendation on
   September 9, 2002. The Inspection Panel carried out the investigation and on
   February 24,     2004,   issued its   Investigation Report        (Inspection   Panel
   Investigation   Report    Paraguay:   Reform      Project   for    the   Water    and
   Telecommunication Sectors and Argentina: SEGBA V Power Distribution
   Project - INSP/RQ02/1 Report No. 27995). On April 6, 2004, Management
   Report submitted to the Board its Report in Response to the Panel's findings
   (Report and Recommendations in Response to the Inspection Panel Investigation
   Report - INSP/R2004-0003).

4. On May 6, 2004, the Board o f Executive Directors reviewedthe Inspection Panel
   Investigation Report and Management's Report and Recommendations in
   Response to the Inspection Panel Investigation Report. During the Board
   meeting, the Executive Directors approved both Reports and requested from
   Management a Progress Report and several Additional Measures related to the
   implementation o f this Project.

5. More specifically, the Board:

    "approved the management action plan, and welcomed management's decision
    to provide them with a progress report that will detail what further measures



                                                                                    3

           will be taken to addressproblems identified by the Panel. The Inspection Panel
           will review management's Action Plan and implementation measuresfor the
           Board. (emphasis added)
           This report, which will beprovided within 90 days, will include:
                        8  Progress made in the implementation of the Bank's actionplan
                           and additional measures identijied, including social and economic
                           impacts of theproject and measures taken with respect to the
                           2,416families already relocated and the 6,000families waiting to
                           be relocated in Paraguay;
                        8  Progress on grievance procedures;
                           What the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is doing with
                           respect to Yacyreta, and how the IDB and the Bank have been
                           collaborating on issues identijied during the Inspection;

                           water level, and their potential impacts.I
                           What decisions have been taken with yesCect to the reservoir's

     6. On August 6, 2004, Management submitted the Progress Report to the Board o f
     Executive Directors on a non-objection basis for release to the public after August
     25, 2004. On August 26, 2004, the Panel informed the Board that, consistent with
     the Board's decision that the Panel "will review Management's Action Plan and
     implementation measures for the Board," the Panel would provide the Board with
     comments on Management's Progress Report.2

                                     Inspection Panel Review

     7. This report presents the results of the review that the Panel has conducted as
         instructedby the Board o f Executive Directors.

The Review Process

    8. To conduct its review, the Panel met and consulted with Management and the
         Project Team, reviewed and analyzed Project documentation, consulted with the
         Requesters and other affected people, and hired two external independent
         consultants who visited the Project area and assisted the Panel in ascertaining the
         facts with respect to progress made and the Project's implementation status.

    9. Duringthe course o f the 90-day period set by the Board for Management's report
         (from the date o f the Board m e e n g to August 6, 2004), the Panel Team at
         Management's request, met three times with Management and staff to discuss the
         Panel findings and outstanding issues, and to be informed o f steps being taken to
         implement Management's Action Plan and the Board's decision.

    10.After the Progress Report was submitted, the Panel interviewed several members
        o f the Project Team and requested information from Management about the
        results o f a High Level Meeting (including senior representatives o f the

         Updating o f Yacyreta Resettlement Action Plan" that took place inBuenos Aires
         October 4-5, 2004 and o f a subsequent supervision mission that took place in the
         Project area and Buenos Aires on December 13-20, 2004. A hrther meeting
         between Management and the Panel took place on January 14,2005.

     11. The Panel also reviewed considerable correspondence, which it received from
         the Requesters, and additional documentation provided by Management to the
         Panel, including Management's Progress Report o f August 6, 2004, Aide
         Memoires and Back to Office Reports related to supervision missions in (July
         2004 and December 2004) and meetings with Project stakeholders.

     12. As noted above, the Panel retained two independent consultants - Professor
         Carlos Tucci, an experienced Brazilian hydrologist, who served as the Panel's
         consultant on the Investigation and Ms. Sheila Abed Zavala, a well-known
         Paraguayan attorney. Ms. Abed visited the Project area during late October and
         early November, and Prof. Carlos Tucci from November 12-13, 2004. Ms.Abed
         met with staff o f the Asuncion country office.           During their visits to
         Encamacion, the Panel's consultants met with Project-affected people and with
         officials o f Entidad Binacional Yacyreta (EBY), made field observations and
         reviewed additional Project documents collected inthe field.

GeneralComments

     13. The Panel wishes to acknowledge, as it did before the Board on M a y 6, 2004,
        that many people among Bank Management and Staff have worked hard to "get
        the Project right."3 The Panel also expresses its appreciation for Management's
        cooperative approach during the post-investigation period and notes the
        considerable effort Management has made thus far to ensure that the Action Plan
        included inManagement's April 2004 Report be implemented.

    14. The Panel again observes that a number o f essential but costly social and
        environmental activities have yet to be completed as the water level o f the
        Yacyreta reservoir i s to be raised hrther. The Panel notes that in discussions
        about a one-meter increase to the current water level, Management has insisted
        that, in accordance with Bank policies and procedures, these measures be taken
        before raising the level o f the reservoir, as provided in the legal documents for
        the loans supporting the Project.

    15. Management's Action Plan includes measures that, if implemented, will ensure
        that fundamental social and environmental activities are undertaken before the
        Yacyreta Project i s completed.          These include establishing an independent
        mechanism to monitor the reservoir level; addressing the drainage issues in the
        Arroyo Pora resettlement sites to prevent flooding o f the houses located

           downstream; establishing an independent grievance redress mechanism; updating
           the resettlement plan (PARR); preparing a Social Communication Program;
           granting the brick makers continued access to clay in EBY's own properties;
           building a sewerage and water treatment system in Encarnacidn and making
           plans and drawings related to the sewerage system available to affected people.
           Management also committed to assigning a social specialist to the Bank's
           country office in Asuncion to deal, inter alia, with the many social problems
           related to the execution o f the Project.

       16. The Panel notes that Management plans to report back to the Board about
           progress in implementing these measures after one year, which would be in
           August 2005. According to the Progress Report, "[sleveral spec@ actions are
           expected to be completed during that time, including monitorable actions by EBY
           concerning specijk environmental and social issues (particularly the social
           communications program and the updated PARR); various consultancies
           (particularly concerning a study of options for an independent grievance
          mechanism and independent verlfication of reservoir water levels); and a
          determination by IDB regarding its ongoing and future involvement in the
          Project."     Management also states that EBY and the two governments may take
          one year or more to complete the necessary steps for affected people to benefit
          from infrastructure improvements and compensation. It adds that "there are
          many implementation variables over which the Bank has no or limited influence.
          Backtracking, unforeseen events, and thus setbacks and delays, arepossible."

      17. The Panel welcomes Management's plan to report back to the Board about
          progress made. The Panel also understands that many complex factors may at
          any time hinder the sound and timely implementation o f the environmental and
          social measures necessary to complete the Project, as the history o f this
          undertaking has long shown. For this reason the Panel once again notes that
          Bank supervision is a key factor to ensure that implementation proceeds as
          rapidly as possible. It also notes that, given the complexities o f this project and
          the number o f factors that may affect its implementation, Management's
          commitment to the Board to report on a yearly basis seems insufficient for the
          Board to monitor implementation progress effectively. The Panel observes that
          semi-annual reports could be more appropriate.

      18. The Panel i s aware that rapid implementation o f the measures included in the
          Action Plan - e.g., independent mechanisms for monitoring the water level and
          redressing grievances - was not feasible within the 90-day period Management
          proposed in M a y 2004 for evaluating progress. Since time is needed to obtain
          substantial improvement, the Panel decided to wait for the completion o f the
          December 2004 Bank supervision mission before finalizing its comments on
          progress inaddressing the Project's outstanding problems.

      19. However, there have been considerable delays even in the steps promised. The
          Panel notes that some proposed measures could have been more readily
          implemented; their execution still lags behind and has increased the mistrust o f
          the affected people towards both EBY and the Bank - e.g., still pending drainage
          issues in Arroyo Pora, lack o f clarity on whether the brick makers continue to
          have access to clay, and problems and delays inthe dialogue between the Bank's
          social expert based in Asuncion and the area's affected people. The Panel i s
          concerned about the lack o f consultation with affected communities inthe design
          o f measures that will affect them directly, such as the social communication
          program and the grievance mechanisms.

     20. This report analyzes in detail the progress and the current status o f selected
          outstanding Project issues that the Panel identified in its Investigation Report and
          Management addressed in the Report and Recommendation in Response to the
          Panel findings, which includes the related Action Plan. For each issue taken into
          consideration, the Panel's findings included in the February 2004 Investigation
          Report, and the action/measure Management subsequently proposed to address
          such issue are initially presented. These are followed by an account o f the
          progress in implementing the proposed measure as identified in Management
          Progress Report submitted to the Board in August 2004, and by the Panel's
          comments in relation to such progress and the current status o f implementation
          (as o f January 30,2005).


                  IndependentMonitoring:of the Reservoir's Water Level


Panel Report Findings; The Panel finds that the Yacyreta reservoir is frequently
operated under conditions that produce a water level in excess o f 76 mas1 at Encarnacibn
and that this is not consistent with both the loan agreement and the Third Owners
Agreement, as amended.6

ManagementAction to be Taken: ReservoirLevel VerificationManagement will urge
the Governments o f Argentina and Paraguay and EBY to establish a means for
independent verification o f the reservoir level. Bank staff will monitor this and confirm
that the reservoir is operated at 76 mad, in accordance with the Legal Agreements.
Management will also request EBY to validate the height-flow rate curves every year.7


Progressduring90-day period(May 6,2004 -August 6,2004)

     21. The Aide Memoire o f the July 2004 Bank supervision mission reported that the
         deadline to establish the independent verification mechanism was October 15,
         2004. According to the Management Progress Report dated August 6, 2004, the
         Bank would contract the University o f L a Plata, Argentina, (Universidad
         Nacional de L a Plata, UNLP), for a period o f five months to "monitor the

          reservoir level and to confirm that the reservoir is operated in accordance with
          the Operational Manual."* The Report further stated that UNLP has established
          a team o f water resources engineers from the Universidad de Asuncion in
          Paraguay and Universidad de la Plata inArgentina.

     22. The contract between the World Bank and the UNLP was signed on August 9,
          2004. Annex A o f this contract includes the Terms o f Reference (TORS)for the
         consulting services to be provided by UNLP, whose scope is "to develop an
          independent verijication mechanism of the water level in the Yacyreta reservoir,
          in the tract Posadas-Encarnacibn to ascertain whether the Yacyreta Power Plant
          is operated in accordance with the Legal Agreements concluded between the
         governments of Argentina and Paraguay, the Yacyreta Bi-national Entity, and
         the World Bank."' The consultant i s to collect the data related to the water level
         and the water flow, which are registered daily by the Argentine and Paraguayan
         Coast Guards at Corpus, Posadas-Encarnacion, the power plant, Restitucion and
         Ituzaingo, and by EBY at the power plant; to analyze the data and to monitor the
         reservoir water level based on the provisions o f the Yacyreta's Operational
         Manual for reservoir level 76masl; and to evaluate the overall operation o f the
         reservoir in accordance with the requirements and the restrictions included in the
         Operational Manual. In coordination with the Argentinean and the Paraguayan
         Coast Guards the consultant also i s to validate the height-flow rate curve at
         Encarnacih-Posadas and at the power plant. The consultant is to present
         monthly reports and a final report at the end o f the contract, whose duration i s
         five months (August 9, 2004-January 8, 2005). These reports are to be published
         on the Universities' websites.

    23. With respect to the verification mechanism after the Bank's contract with UNLP
         has terminated, the Bank's Progress Report states that EBY has agreed to assume
         responsibility for financing a similar independent verification mechanism to
         monitor the water level, no later than the beginning o f 2005 (end o f above
         mentioned contract), On September 9 and 10, 2004, the IDB hosted the Fifth
         HighLevel Meeting between the governments o fArgentina and Paraguay, EBY,
         the World Bank and the IDB itself. The Aide Memoire o f the meeting states that
         "EBY has approved a system of verijkation and dissemination of the reservoir
        level. I n addition, the World Bank has contracted services of universities in
        Argentina and Paraguay, of recognized professional and scientijk hydraulic and

        verifji and disseminate the level of the Yacyreta reservoir...It was agreed that,
        hydrological expertise, to start the execution of an independent mechanism to

        startingfrom January 1, 2005, EBY will continue [operatingJ this verijkation

Panel's Commentson Progress

     24. Inmeetings with the Inspection Panel held in July 2004, Management stated that
         the data on the level of the reservoir are released by the Argentine and
         Paraguayan Navy, thus EBY was not to be involved in this process. According
         to Management, the above-mentioned contract would be first financed by the
         Bank and then, based on the results; it may be taken over by EBY.This would be
         a pilot exercise that the Bank would finance and supervise for six or seven
         months. After this period Management foresaw that if everything went right, the
         source o f financing would not matter because the monitoring would rely on
         independent universities that have the best expertise inthe two countries.

     25. The Panel notes that, while the contract between UNLP and the Bank is nearing
         termination, Management informed the Panel that no specific plan has been
         defined yet with respect to the future of the independent monitoring mechanism.
         The Panel observes that the independent mechanism i s an important step forward
         in addressing key issues that the Panel had identified in its investigation report
         and in restoring the trust o f the affected people inEBY and the Banks. Thus, the
         Panel emphasizes that, although Management could not identify a timeframe to
         resolve this issue, a solution is promptly needed.

     26. According to the contract concluded with the Bank, UNLP was to prepare and
         publish on the University's website a monthly report on its independent
         monitoring activity. The Panel found that UNLP posted the data collected from
        August to November on its Internet page sometime in December 2004.
        Management also informed the Panel, in a meeting on January 14, 2005, that the
        analysis of the data collected in November and December had been completed
        and the resulting report was to be submitted to the Bank ina few weeks.

    27. After reviewing the data publishedon UNLP's website, the Panel notes that the
        published data are not thorough enough to draw proper conclusions, because the
        daily mean water level at the power plant and in Posadas for the considered
        period, and the description o f the dam's operational conditions are yet to be
        made available. In addition, the Panel observes that the information released to
        the public i s very technical and not understandable to a non expert eye.
        Management itself acknowledged this problem and emphasized that the
        upcoming report analyzing the data needed to be clear and comprehensible to
        everyone.



                      Works inthe ResettlementSiteArroyo Pora

PanelReport Findings:The Panel finds that new resettlement construction should have
had adequate environmental and social impact assessments. The Panel finds evidence that
host populations near resettlement sites are, in some cases, adversely affected by the
design and construction o f the resettlement sites, or by added burdens on local



                                                                                      9

 infrastructure due to the influx o f resettled population. OD 4.30 and OD 4.01 require that
 such impacts be assessedand mitigated."

 Management Action to be Taken: Resettlement sites and civil works Management
 will request that EBY update the screening process for non-dam related civil works to
 include a quality assurance protocol. Bank will continue to monitor engineering
 supervision and contractor insurance practices and will request improvements, as
 necessary.
 Bank will monitor the system EBY has in place to supervise civil works; request that
 contracts continue to include required clauses; and. continue to pay careful attention to
 construction deficiencies.'*

 ProgressDuring90-day Period

      28. Management's Progress Report states that the Bank has assisted EBY in
           updating the screening procedures (procedures aim at enhancements in design,
           construction, and quality assurance o f remaining civil works at existing and
           future resettlement sites).  The Bank i s also committed to ongoing enhanced
           supervision o f the environmental aspects o f the resettlement sites and civil
           works.

     29. Regarding specific issues in Arroyo Pora, the Report asserts that the Bank has
          recommended general improvements in EBY's infrastructure design and
           implementation procedures and insisted on several occasions that EBY do
          everything possible to resolve a pending drainage related problem involving
          several host populations.

     30. In the July 2004 meetings with the Panel, Management stated that the Bank was
          discussing with EBY and the contractors how to fix the various problems, and,
          according to Management, EBY claimed that the construction would be finished
          in6 months. The Bank thought that this was too long a time and tried to reach a
          different agreement with EBY.

     31. In these meetings, Management further stated that the Bank supervision team
          met, during the July mission, with people living in the Barrios Tacuary and
          Americas, who claim that they are affected by flooding caused by the
          constructions in Arroyo Pora.      According to Management, some residents of
          these barrios claimed that the flooding i s very frequent, and others that it
          happened only once nine months ago. The Bank informed the Panel that these
          people are physically preventing the contractors from bringing their machinery
          into the work area. According to Management, they asked the Bank to meet
          three requests in order to allow the construction work to proceed. The three
          requests were:


               0   Supply drinkingwater

                 0 Give cash compensation based on how close they live to the ditches that
                   are going to be built.

       32. Management stated that EBY started supplying drinking water to the residents
            six months earlier. Management also noted that the Bank has always discouraged
           EBY from compensating people for impacts not directly related to the Project
           because this would set a precedent very difficult to reverse. For this reason, the
           Bank i s not pushing EBY to compensate the washer women. According to the
           Bank, the people in Barrio Tacuary have no basis for not allowing the
           construction works to proceed.

  Panel's Comments on Progress

       33. The Panel's independent consultant found a number o f design and construction
           problems with the solutions proposed for the drainage channel issue in the
           Arroyo Pora resettlement site, which the Panel identified in its investigation
           report and which still exists. The consultant visited Arroyo Pora in November
           2004 and found that the channel had been completed, but the design and quality
           o f the construction was such that the channel was full o f sediment and was
           clogged. The risk o f flooding o f the houses located downstream n o w appears to
           be greater than before remedial action was taken. Moreover, a new problem has
           emerged. The diameter o f the pipes used i s too small for the amount o f water
           flowing in, so new flooding may occur. The Panel notes that, in the Aide
           Memoire related to the mission conducted in December 2004, Bank staff
           confirmed the Panel consultant's observations and expressed concem that a
           resolution o f the drainage issue i s still pending. They requested EBY to complete
           the necessary works within 90 days from the date o f the Aide Memoire.

      34. Management reaffirmed its knowledge o f the alleged blocking o f the
           construction in Arroyo        Pora by people residing in the           downstream
           neighborhoods inthe January 2005 meeting with the Panel. However, neither the
           Contractor nor the people residing in the downstream neighborhoods reported
           such events to the Panel's consultants who visited the project area in November
          2004.


                                EncarnacidnSewerage System

  PanelReport Findings:The Requesters claimed that the sewerage system will not cover
  some o f the resettlement areas. The Panel finds that it is planned that the resettlement
  areas in question will be linked to the reticulated sewerage system. The Panel notes,
 however, that confusion may have arisen over the coverage o f the wastewater treatment
 because the detailed drawings o f the planned sewerage reticulation system for
 Encamacion were not publicly available inthe EBY information office. l3

 The Panel also noted with great concern" that "although according to Management the
                         "
 sewerage system has been designed to cover the city of Encarnacidn, the works describe
 in the current bidding documentsfor the construction of the system seem to cover only
 the southern part of Encarnacidn (zona sur).    "I4


 Importantly, the Panel finds that responsibility for the cost o f connection to the sewer
 system may become a significant source o f conflict in the not too distant future. The
 Panel finds that this issue needs the urgent attention o f Bank Management and that an
 effective means for financing the connection o f houses to the sewer network is required,
 especially for poor comm~nities.'~

 ManagementActionto be taken: Sewerage System

 Management will request EBY to make all relevant drawings o f sewerage systems,
 pumping stations, and the wastewater treatment plant, as well as any other non-dam-
 related civil works, available to the community.

 Bank will monitor inclusion o f activities to clarify the areas being covered and the
 proposed time frame for the coverage inEBY's social communications program.
 Management will confirm that the sewerage system has been completed prior to the
 raising of the reservoir level to 78 masl, inaccordance with the pertinent provisions o f the
 Legal Agreements, and will urge EBY and the Paraguayan authorities to pursue IDB or
 other financing for the household connections.

 It is expected that actions pertinent to transfer and supervision o f the sewerage system in
 Encarnacih will be undertaken by IDB prior to the raising o f the reservoir level to 78
masl.I6

ProgressDuring90-day Period

       35. The Progress Report states that the construction o f the sewerage system in
           Encarnacion southern zone and the construction o f a wastewater treatment plant
           for the city o f Encarnacion with IDB funding are underway, with completion
           tentatively planned for 2006.     Management claims that it has urged IDB to
           finance the construction o f the sewerage system in Encarnacion's northern zone,
           in addition to those parts of the system whose construction is already supported
          under its existing loan. However, should this financing not materialize, EBY is
           said to be exploring alternative technical and financial options. The Bank has
          also insisted that EBY identify the institutional and financial arrangements
          required for installation o f household connections in the southem zone and
          construction o f the sewerage system for the city's northern zone.

      36. Management informed the Panel in July that the Bank agreed with the Panel's
          finding that the sewerage network needs to be connectedto the houses but that as

          o f July the IDB had not included this item in their financing plan. The Aide
          Memoire o f the latest HighLevel Meeting does not mention this issue.

      37. With respect to Management's request that EBY make all relevant drawings o f
          sewerage systems, pumping stations, and the wastewater treatment plant, as well
          as any other non-dam-related civil works, available to the community, the High
         Level Meeting's Aide Memoire reads that "the plans for the sewerage system
         and other civil works important for the area were made available to the
         municipality of Encarnacibn and to the public."" According to the Requesters,
         this did not occur before then.

 Panel's Comments on Progress

     38. The Panel confirms that, as o f November 2004, the drawings and plans related to
         the sewerage system for Encarnacion are now available to the public. However,
         the Panel was also informed that it is not possible to make copies o f such
         documents for a more detailed review by affected parties. The Panel thus
         observes that meaningful access to the documentation is not yet fully available.

     39. With respect to the need to connect the sewerage system to the households, EBY
         informed the Panel's consultants that the household connections will be included
         in the construction o f the sewage system for the Southern part of Encarnacion.
         However, they confirmed that the construction o f the sewerage system for the
         Northern part i s still pending because o f a lack o f financing sources.

     40. Inview o f the foregoing, the Panel finds that there are a number o f issues still to
         be dealt with regard to Encarnacion's sewerage system before raising the level o f
         the reservoir further.


                                    Grievance Procedures

Panel Report Findings: Although the Panel was informed that there were some
procedures to rectify any omissions in the 1990 census, the Panel finds that at best these
procedures were ad hoc arrangements that allowed some corrections to the census.'8

Most people who felt excluded did not have a clear and objective procedure for bringing
their concerns to EBY. The Panel further finds that procedures for correcting the census
or other resettlement related omissions and errors are inadequate, and notes that a
standard and transparent appeals procedure is not available to affected pe0p1e.I~

Management Action to be Taken: Dispute resolution / grievance procedures: Bank
will oversee a review during the second quarter o f 2004 o f existing claims against EBY
inorder to address issues of dissatisfaction, and propose a renewed effort (together with

 continue to work closely with EBY to establish this process as soon as possible.
 Management will urge EBY (and provide guidance as necessary) to include in the
 grievance procedures a means for the reception and solution o f claims that could emerge
 from host communities duringthe resettlement process.*'

 ProgressDuring90-dayPeriod
      41. In July 2004, Management informed the Panel that both the governments o f
         Argentina and Paraguay agreed that this mechanism i s very important for the
          affected people and the Project. Consultants hadbeen hired to assist EBY to:

             0  Document the procedures to solve the claims as the current procedure i s
                very informal. The Bank recognized the need to formalize these
                procedures ina written mode and inform the affected people about their
                rights, procedural steps required and possible outcomes;
             0  Improve such procedures to respond to and solve claims. A database will
                be compiled to collect data/statistic to how efficient EBY is inresponding
                to the complaints.

     42. According to the July 2004 supervision mission Aide Memoire, EBY was to
         prepare by October 15, 2004 a proposal for a grievance redress mechanism that
         included: (1) redefinition o f rules and procedures; (2) a system to manage and to
         resolve claims considering conciliation methods and (3) issues and procedures
         that would also be included inthe Social Communication Program.

     43. The Progress Report stated that the Bank commissioned a study about possible
         options for independent grievance resolution mechanisms. For this purpose, the
         Bank retained a lawyer with experience in arbitration, mediation and
         conciliation. In July, Management told the Panel that the two governments and
         EBY concurred on the need for an independent grievance mechanism and that
         the IDB had agreed to finance it. Management Report stated that EBY was
         setting up a financial reserve fund as part o f its Project Completion Plan to
         finance awards that may come out o f these processes.

     44. During their November 2004 visit, EBY informed the Panel's consultants that it
         has approved an internal regulation regarding claims filed by individuals and
         groups and submitted it to the Bank for review. The Aide Memoire o f the Bank
         December supervision mission states that "EBY has submitted a procedure to
         deal with compZaints9j2` but it does not state whether this procedure is
         satisfactory to the Bank and gives no other explanation or detail about this new
         procedure or the review process. Management informed the Panel that the Bank

                                                                                        14

         hired a law firm on a consulting basis, Baker & McKenzie, to develop a "claims
         response system JJ22 Management expected this work, which includes developing
         a relational database and a typology o f claims, detailed analysis o f a subset o f
         200 claims, the preparation o f didactic materials and presentations to EBY, to be
         completed by December 2004. On January 14, 2005, Management informed the
        Panel that the consultant completed its work and the final report was to be
         submitted to the Bank within few weeks. (The Aide Memoire o f the December
        mission states that the consultant's report was to be available by January 17,
        2005.) The December 2004 Aide Memoire also states that Management agreed
        with EBY that the new claim response system be implementedby June 2005.

    45. With respect to the creation o f an independent redress mechanism, the Aide
        Memoire o f the Bank's December 2004 mission, states that both EBY and the
        Bank have supported initial research activities about conflict mediation by two
        consultants. Management informed the Panel in January 2005 that several
        options are still being analyzed but no decision has been taken yet. The law firm
        Baker and McKenzie i s also reviewing legal redress mechanism options in
        Paraguay. According to Management, EBY will evaluate the reports o f the
        consultants and will submit its own comments to Management within 60 days
        from the date the law firm submittedits report to the Bank.

    46. In light o f the foregoing, the Panel notes that while important steps are being
        taken to address these issues, the establishment o f an independent and
        transparent grievance procedure i s unfortunately only in the early stages.
        Important issues need also to be considered, such as the situation o f those
        families who claim that their compensation was inadequate when they had to
        choose between either accepting nothing for their homes (and acting through the
        court system), or accepting the EBY offer at the time the water was raised to the
        76m level. The Panel notes that inthose cases where the owner lodged a protest
        within a specified period, re-examination o f compensation paid should be
        allowed.

    47. In summary, EBY still lacks a clear set o f procedures to resolve claims filed by
        affected people. In addition, the existing procedures are very informal.. EBY
        employees themselves expressed their distress about this situation with the
        Panel's consultant. They claimed that quite often they spend considerable time
        replying to claims they had already addressed, as clear rules are missing. EBY
        seems to lack trained personnel on conflict management and resolution. The
        claims are handled by social workers.

    48. The Panel finally observes that, to date, no public discussion or consultation with
       the affected people has taken place as part o f the effort to establish an
       independent grievance mechanism. The Panel notes that Management i s
       discussing the different options for redressing o f grievances with civil society
       organizations, but also notes that these discussions occurred only on an informal

           basis because, Management states, it is EBY's responsibility to solve the claims
           and/or pay the necessary compensation.


                                         BrickMakers

 Panel Report Findings: The Panel found in its visit to the San Pedro site that while
 families had reestablished their brick making activities, many complained about losses in
 their income level and about lack o f continued access to raw material because the five-
 year clay supply had ended.23

 Management Action to be Taken: Brick makers Management will request that EBY
 continue to provide small brick makers with access to clay deposits. Management also
 will monitor inclusion inEBY's social communications program (to comply with Plan B)
 o f activities to ensure brick makers are aware o f the location o f clay deposits on EBY-
 owned property. Medium and large sized industries will continue to have access to clay
 deposits on the land that EBY owns until the reservoir level i s raised.

 Management will request EBY and the Paraguayan authorities to meet the 2004 timetable
 for disbursing benefits under the Productive Fund to the informal workers already
 identified. Management will also request that EBY make every effort to identify former
 workers o f brick and tile-making industries who did not previously receive compensation
 for loss o f employment due to their informal status and utilize the Productive Fund to
 provide them with appropriate compensation. Finally, Management will confirm with
 EBY that the updated PARR component o f the Revised EMP includes provisions for
 employment alternatives for both informal and formal workers who lose their
 employment due to industry closure or r e l ~ c a t i o n . ~ ~

      49. The Progress Report states that EBY i s expected to continue efforts to build and
          maintain awareness among brick and tile makers o f the procedures for access to
          clay deposits on EBY's property, and the Bank is committed to closely
          supervising the treatment o f brick and tile makers and workers under the updated
          PARR.

      50. The July 2004 mission's Aide Memoire states that the goal is to ensure
          resolution o fproblems o f oleros (brick makers) including: (1) maintain access to
          clay deposits on EBY-owned property as long as the level o f the reservoir allows
          it and (2) meet the 2004 timetable for disbursingbenefits under the Productive
          Fundto the informal workers already identified. By October 15, 2004, EBY was
         to submit a document to the Bank where it determines its final decisions with
         respect to this issue.

     51. According to the Requesters, there was no communication with the oleros about
         their continuing free access to clay inEBY's own property, and inany event, two

           main problems seem to have been overlooked: the brick makers do not have
           either the means to extract the clay or to transport it to their work place.

       52 With respect to the brick workers who have yet to receive their compensation.
           Management refers inthe Progress Report to the Productive Fundthat, according
           to the Action Plan, would be used to provide the workers with appropriate
           compensation. However, the progress report does not specifically mention the
           brick workers. According to Management, the Fund was created by the GOP to
           support productive projects for people who were affected when the reservoir was
           filled to 76masl but were not included in the PARR. In addition, problems
           related to the eligibility criteria for the beneficiaries have thus far delayed the
           Fund's implementation.

 Panel's Commentson Progress

       53. The Panel notes that, in spite o f Management assurances on this issue, it is still
           unclear whether the brick makers, whose clay deposits are now underwater,
           continue to have access to the deposits located in EBY's own property after the
           5-year clay supply provided under the PARR has ended. Brick makers
           interviewed by the Panel's consultants duringtheir November 2004 visit reported
           that in reality they have no access to such clay deposits. They added that EBY
           officials accused some brick makers o f trespassing EBY's private properties and
           promised compensation only to those who meet certain requirements. EBY, in
           turn, states that accessto clay deposits has been granted to brick makers from the
           neighborhood o f Pacu Cua and Itapua. The Panel also observes that, even if
           access to clay deposits were possible, the brick makers may not have the
           resources to extract it or transport it to their factories.

       54. The Panel found that there i s a growing perception of unfairness among brick
           makers interviewed by the Panel because they do not clearly know whether and
           who has access to clay deposits. This fact underscores the urgent need for an
           appropriate Social Communication Program.

                               Social CommunicationProgram

Panel Report Findings: The Panel also interviewed many people who were extremely
confused about the PDA program, its purpose, who was included and when and whether
they were supposed to relocate. The Panel finds that under OD 4.30 Management must
ensure that affected people are systematically informed and consulted about their options
and rights during the preparation and implementation o f the PDA program.25

The Panel also finds that there was inadequate effort on the part o f the Bank to ensure
that the host population was informed and consulted with in planning and carrying out
construction o f the resettlement sites.26

      55. According to the Progress Report, the Bank has assisted EBY in designing a
          social communications program. A World Bank communication specialist and a
         consultant worked with EBY in June and July 2004 in order to develop a
         framework, options, and content for a social communications program to reach
         all affected groups. EBY has also earmarked resources for the implementation
         o f this social communications program. EBY plans to complete the preparation
         o f the social communications program during the last quarter o f 2004. The
         program i s expected to include organizational changes within EBY to facilitate
         effective management oversight and follow-up.         The Bank is committed to
         ongoing enhanced supervision o f the social communications program and its
         outreach to both the general public and to all affected groups.

 Panel's Commentson Progress

      56. The Aide Memoire o f the December 2004 mission addresses the draft Social
          Communication Program that EBY prepared and submitted to the Bank, makes
          recommendations on how to improve it, and points out a number o f
          shortcomings. However, the Panel notes that no mention i s made about the fact
          that no consultation with, and participation o f affected people has taken place for
          the drafting o f the program. Until the Bank supervision mission visited the
          project area in December, the area people seemed unaware that a social
          communication program was under preparation. Neither EBY nor the Bank
          officials had spoken with them about this.

 families already relocated and the 6,000 families waiting to be relocated inParaguay.

Measuresfor resettledpopulation:

     57. The Progress report identifies the additional measures as:
                 FundofUS$3.7millionremaining available created by the GOP to support
              productive projects for people who were affected when the reservoir was
              filled to 76masl but were not included in the PARR (Productive Fund).
              Problems in the identification o f the beneficiaries are delaying the
              implementation.
              0  WB-funded Pilot Community Development Project (PRODECO -
              US$9m) makes CDD (community driven development) funds available to
              communities in three departments, including Itapua where Yacyreta
              communities are.
                 Fundo f US$500,000 set up by EBY and managed by an NGO to provide
              CDD-type support to productive projects for resettled families as part o f the
              rehabilitation programs included inthe PARR. (Social Investment Fund)
              0 Bank and IDB have proposed that EBY and local municipalities
              strengthen their institutional links to better integrate project planning and
              investments with municipal management.29

Measuresfor people to be resettled:

     58. According to the Progress Report, EBY agreed on a timetable and a
         methodology for updating the PARR. The process will be integrated with the


29Progress Report, 6 , l 15-20.


                                                                                        19

           social communications program. EBY has also agreed that the methodology for
          the updated PARR will use up-to-date technology (including a geo-referenced
          database), techniques and procedures to ascertain the status o f the population to
          be resettled.      The PARR will update the Project's socioeconomic baseline
          infobation in order to better design different resettlement alternatives and
          rehabilitation programs for families, businesses and industries being relocated,
          and programs to better integrate resettled populations with host communities.

      59. In addition, during the second semester o f 2004, EBY is expected to hire
          international staff to oversee the preparation and implementation o f the updated
          Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan. At EBY's request, the Bank plans to
          provide training by the end o f the year to the Governments o f Argentina and o f
          Paraguay and to its own staff indeveloping resettlement and rehabilitation plans.

 Panel's Commentson Progress

      60. Management has informed the Panel that a technical meeting to discuss the
          revision o f the Yacyreta Action Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation took
          place on October 4-5, 2004, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which included
          representatives o f the Bank, EBY and the IDB. As already mentioned, a follow-
          up supervision mission took place inDecember 2004.

      61. With respect to the additional measures proposed for affected people who have
          been already resettled, the Panel notes that the implementation o f both the
          Productive Fund and the Social Investment Fund unfortunately i s still subject to
          the same problems affecting the execution o f many other components o f the
          Yacyreta project, such as implementation delays and cumbersome eligibility
          criteria and procedures.

     62. Management stated that IDB contracted a consultant to review the current status
         o f the PARR and that the consultant presented "a very critical report of EBY's
         procedures and the status of their data."30According to Management, based on
         this report, which the Panel has not had the opportunity to review, a "set of
         measures to be completed by EBY"j' were prepared and agreed upon. EBY
         agreed to revise its data about families eligible for resettlement and rehabilitation
         on a "household-by household basis without referring to it as a census" because
         it fears that a new official census would increase the influx o f new people
         moving into the affected area. Management stated also that EBY agreed to unify
         and geo-reference its database on a digital basis, to strengthen control o f the
         affected areas and to develop "effective communications with the affected
         communities before embarking on the household ~ u w e y . ' ' ~ ~

     63. The Panel has noted several times in its Investigation Report and in this review
         that communication between EBY and the affected people is inadequate and

           hopes that EBY will abide by its commitment to strengthen its dialogue with
           affected people as soon as possible.

      64. The Panel notes that o f the three areas o f improvement listed for the updated
          PARR, it is especially o f interest that the PARR will include "a geo-referenced
          database    1133 regarding the status o f the population to be resettled. Presumably,
          this can be checked on regular visits, or even checked in detail from a distance.
          It is    less clear how "updating the Project`s socioeconomic baseline
           information   J'34 (a third proposed improvement in the updated PARR) can be
          done at this point. Retroactively positing the socioeconomic baseline at the start
          o f this Project i s somewhat speculative and subject to considerable argument.
           Studying the current socioeconomic baseline is more direct but arguably
          irrelevant since the socioeconomic status o f every affected person has already
          been severely affected by the Project. It would be interesting to know which
          direction this proposed updating will take.

      65. The Panel also wonders about the sequence o f approval o f the proposed updated
          PARR, in the sequence o f activities for completion o f the project.
          Management's Progress Report states that "Management will confirm that the
          updated PARR component of the Revised Environmental Management Plan
          (EMP), when completed, is in full compliance with OD 4.30 and the Legal
          Agreements, before the reservoir level is raised beyond 78 ma~l."~'This implies
          that current procedures will remain in effect until that time, i.e. up to 78 masl. If
          78 masl is measured at Encarnacion and the existing PARR will continue to be
          used until that point, the Panel notes that an additional meter must be vacated.

      66. In this context it is important to note that in mid November the Bank has
          received a request from EBY to raise the water level to 77 masl. The Bank i s
          currently considering this request. Management informed the Panel that, before
          givingits no-objection, the Bank needs to consider whether the required security
          band o f 1-2 meters i s free o f homes and other structures that could be subject to
          flooding in case o f fluctuations o f the reservoir's water level. The Panel also
          observes that other issues need to be urgently addressed as well, inparticular the
          completion o f the sewage system o f Encarnacion.

   Panel's Commentson Progress

        68. In August 2004, the Panel was informed that the role o f the civil society
            specialist had not been defined and that a visit to Encarnacion had not taken
            place. The Panel was also informed that a delegation composed o f members o f
            the FEDAYIM, the Requesters, had to go to Asuncion to meet with the
            specialist.

       69. In October the Panel's consultant met with the social specialist. The Terms of
            Reference (TORS) for the position in the Bank's Asuncion country office
            apparently did not specify any specific assignment related to the Yacyreta
            Project, although the specialist visited the Project area once. On December 2,
            2004, however, Management informed the Panel that the TOR for the social
            specialist calls for spending most or all the time on Yacyreta issues. The second
            visit of the social specialist to the Encarnacion area took place as part o f the
            December supervision mission. On that occasion the specialist met with the
            Requesters for about 3 hours. The Panel notes the importance of having a social
            specialist fully engaged inthe Yacyreta Project.
