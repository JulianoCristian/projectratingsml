negligible; Bank\n            performance is unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            unsatisfactory. The following are lessons learned from this\n            project: 1) Project design: a) Over ambitious project\n            objectives are likely to do more harm than good, as there is\n            the risk of none achieving them or, in the worst case, to\n            leave unfinished investments yielding little or no economic\n            return; b) multiple project objectives are likely to end-up\n            in failure to achieve them if there is not an adequate\n            prioritization or if there are no adequate criteria to\n            resolve potential conflicts among objectives; and c) lending\n            large amounts of money to an utility that historically has\n            been unable to generate funds for investments and to service\n            its debts is a major risk for the borrowing country, as it\n            is likely that the government end-up servicing the debt. 2)\n            Technical assistance: a) technical assistance is not an\n            effective method to mitigate project risks related to\n            adverse public opinion and political opposition to reform;\n            and b) technical assistance is not an effective method to\n            turn around a utility which for years had been inefficient\n            and financially weak. 3) Bank's knowledge: a) ignoring\n            evidence available in the Bank in documents like the Country\n            Assistance Strategies and Public Expenditure Reviews\n            regarding the viability of sector reform is likely to result\n            in poor quality projects; and b) paying pro-forma attention\n            to the lessons in evaluation reports by the Operations\n            Evaluation Department is likely to result in poor quality\n            projects. 4) Water supply markets: the Paraguayan government\n            decision to enter into agreements with currently  informal\n            service providers is an approach which could help in\n            accelerating the provision of water and sanitation services\n            to population without adequate service."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
