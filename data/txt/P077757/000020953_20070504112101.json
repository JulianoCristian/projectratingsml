Cundinamarca Education\n            Quality Improvement Project in Colombia were as follows:\n            outcomes were highly unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: (a) Ensuring implementation readiness\n            conditions prior to negotiations leads to a more effective\n            and timely physical and financial execution cycle; (b)\n            Change of Governments increase the likelihood for\n            modifications of policy and execution strategy along with\n            changes in key players resulting in slow physical and\n            financial implementation; (c) Bottom-up and demand-driven\n            initiatives as a way to improve quality and relevance of\n            education; (d) Those that prepare ought to be the ones to\n            implement to avoid an early functional disconnect likely to\n            obstruct project implementation; (e) Political support and\n            ownership as good predictor of success; (f) Impact\n            evaluation and monitoring are needed as a means to correct\n            course if it becomes necessary.
