In particular, the project\n            will include substantial technical assistance; training at\n            MSc and PhD levels in Indonesia and abroad; and physical\n            development of research centers and institutes. Risks\n            regarding the orientation and applicability of the\n            agricultural research assisted under this project will be\n            mitigated by research review procedures and linkages with\n            agricultural extension services, ensuring that the research\n            will be production-oriented and responsive to farmers' needs."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
