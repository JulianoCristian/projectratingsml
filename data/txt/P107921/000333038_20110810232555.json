         risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: both the\n            assessments of previous budget support operations, the\n            programmatic Programmatic Support for Institution Building\n            (PSIB) series Implementation Completion Report (ICR), and\n            this Development Policy Grant (DPG) show that the instrument\n            can be designed in ways that mitigate the significant risks,\n            while still having a meaningful reform program. Also, in\n            deciding whether to move forward with a programmatic series\n            versus a stand -alone operation one has to carefully assess\n            political risks. This DPG successfully mitigated political\n            risks, the uncertainty of an election year, by designing the\n            DPG as a stand-alone operation. But, in times of less\n            uncertainty, pursuing a programmatic series may be a more\n            appropriate approach that can have a wider impact with\n            reforms that have more of a medium-term time horizon. The\n            operation was more successful in areas where there was a\n            stronger sense of ownership at the Ministry of Finance.\n            Overall, ownership by the government was strong, with the\n            DPG team in the Minister's office engaging constantly\n            with stakeholders, and the Minister of Finance even taking\n            on personal commitments. This ownership has to be\n            established at the preparatory stage. Thus, by involving\n            counterparts early in the preparation phase, the operation\n            can ensure a common understanding of what is expected of\n            them during implementation. This ICR's assement of the\n            risks to the sustainability of outcomes suggests the need\n            for a follow-up instrument to consolidate the gains and take\n            account of the overall medium-term objectives of the wider\n            Public Financial Management (PFM) and public administration\n            reforms. These reforms are not fully consolidated, and\n            without follow-up action the processes supported by this\n            operation could revert - particularly those related to the\n            legal and regulatory framework. An important, unintended\n            outcome of this DPG was the signal it sent to the donor\n            community that the World Bank felt Afghan Authorities could\n            be accountable for a larger share of donor contributions.\n            The donors perceived the Bank's willingness to provide\n            budget support as an endorsement, which served to encourage\n            others to consider channeling more resources through the\n            Afghan budget. This important outcome is at the heart of the\n            country's interim strategy note and increasing\n            on-budget funding is a stated government objective from the\n            Kabul Conference 2010."}, "docdt": "2011-07-18T00:00:00Z"}
