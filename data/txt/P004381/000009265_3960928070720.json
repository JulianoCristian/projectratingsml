Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) in their\n            institutional development. Specific components will: (a)\n            rehabilitate about 27,000 existing subscriber lines; (b)\n            expand local telephone service by about 10,000 new\n            subscriber lines; (c) install new transit exchanges; (d)\n            expand and rehabilitate the long-distance network; and (e)\n            replace the international earth satellite station. It will\n            also: (f) introduce data communications and improve telex\n            services; (g) replace obsolete high frequency radio\n            communication stations with new stations; (h) assist the\n            Department of Finance and Planning to improve the\n            performance monitoring of PTC and train its staff; and (i)\n            train PTC's national engineers. Finally, it will: (j)\n            second PTC national engineers and managers to appropriate\n            telephone companies; (k) introduce a modern management\n            information system; (l) increase PTC's customer focus\n            by the creation of district offices; and (m) improve\n            PTC's organizational structure."}, "docdt": "1989-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
