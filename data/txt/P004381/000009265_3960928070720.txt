PAPUA NEW GUINEA
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower   The Independent State of Papta New Guinea
Beneficiary   The Post and Telecommunication Corporation (PTC)
Amount  US$17.2 million equivalent
Terms   Twenty years including a five-year grace period, at the Banl's
standard variable interest rate.
On-Lending Terms   The Government will on-lend US$16,250,000 to PTC at 3%
above the IBRD interest rate for 15 years including a 5-year
grace period. The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project Description   The project would help rehabilitate and expand telecommuni-
cation facilities in Papua New Guinea and assist the
Government and PTfc in their institutional development.
Specific components would (a) rehabilitate about 27,000
existing subscriber lines, (b) expand local telephone service
by about 10,000 new subscriber lines, (c) install new transit
exchan ,es, (d) expand and rehabilitate the long-distance
network, (e) replace the international earth satellite station,
(fC introduce data communications and improve telex services,
(g) replace obsolete HF radio communication stations with
new stations, (h) assist the Department of Finance and Plan-
ning to improve the performance monitoring of PTC and train
its staff, (i) train PTC's national engineers, Cj) second PTC
national engineers and managers to appropriate telephone
companies, (k) introduce a modern management information
system, (1) increase PTC's customer focus by the creation of
district offices, and (m) improve PTCs organizational
structure.
Project Benefits
and Risks   Business and nrual subscribers would be the primary bene-
ficiaries of expansion of the network. However, all subscribers



- v -
would benefit from overall improved quality of service,
reduced tariffs and increased availability of public telephones
throughout Papua New Guinea. Project risks relate to delays
in (a) implementing the policy changes, (b) institution build-
ing, and (c) land acquisition. To address these risks, the
following measures have been taken: (a) the Government has
adopted a Telecommunications Policy Paper which includes
(i) clear targets for the growth of the sector and access to
service, (ii) cost reduction objectives, and (iii) service quality
improvement steps; (b) long-term consultants will be provided
to the Government to monitor PTC's performance; and (c) the
the Government and PTC have already taken steps to secure
the three sites required for the project.

NOTES
1. The May 1988 DCL study found PTC tariffs 13th highest among 75 countries compared overall,
based on Siemens's 1985 review of telephone charges (Siemens, "Study on National Telephone Tariffs
worldwide,' August 1985).
2. The AIC is derived by apportioning investments into three categories: local calls, long-distance calls
and international calls, in the same proportions as traffic flows are divided. Annuities were calculated
assuming 10% interest and a 10-year term. Operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses were
apportioned using the same methodology as for investments and then added to investment annuities.
Each year costs (investment plus O&M) were discounted with the same interest rate as above, and
the sum of terms used as the numerator. Traffic quantities were projected at 3% p.a. growth. The
present value of these quantities was then calculated using the same interest rate as above, to be used
as denominator in the AIC formula.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Telecommunications Policy Paper 1/
Major Recommendations
Objectives
1.       The balance of emphasis between providing services and generating
government revenue will shift toward providing service.
Village Access
2.       PTC will begin installing pay phones, initially in approximately 400
villages or areas with population of 500 or more persons within a 5-km radius.
- The government program will be funded by grant aid.
- The Government will appoint PTC as its agent in sourcing aid.
- PTC will account for this program separately and will monitor
performance.
- A review of the program by government and PTC will be undertaken
at the end of the second year.
Urban Penetration
3.       PTC aims to increase the number of citizen household subscribers by
5% p.a. by economic pricing strategies and awareness campaigns.
- The government will evaluate the effect on subscriber growth of the
telephone tax and the proposed provincial government sales tax.
Network Security
4.       PTC will utilize technological advances including digitalization,
fiber optics and satellite transmission to complement its existing microwave
system.
Tariffs
5.       Tariffs will decline relative to prices of other goods and services
as measured by the CPI by 2% p.a.
1/ The paper is available in the Asia Project Files.



- 39 -                            ANNEX 7
Page 2
PTC will adjust tariffs annually within this cap.
- Under the Prices Regulation Act all tariffs, including postal
tariffs, will be subject to a 3-yearly review which will include
external expert evaluation and customer representation and will set
annual key tariff ceilings for the ensuing 3 years.
Productivity
6.       The Government will review the appropriateness of the SCNC Act to PTC
with a view to replacing it with a productivity-bafed program.
-   PTC will aim for labor productivity growth of 3% p.a. as measured by
the number of employees per 1,000 main lines.
-  The Government will raise to K 1 million the limit of capital
expenditure decisions requiring prior ministerial approval.
Financial lerformance
7.       rhe financial parameters set down in NEC 163/83 continue to apply
except that, consistent with the change in emphasis amongst objectives, the
Government will consider reducing the minimum required return on investment to
12.5% and the dividend pay-out to one third of earnings beginning in 1991.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Consultancy to Strengthen the Capability
of the Department of Finance and Planning to Monitor Performance of PTC
Background
1.       The Government of PNG has approved a Telecommunications Sector
Policy Paper that establishes, inter alia, a revised framework for
Government control of the Post and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC).
The policy represents a significant change in emphasis: the Government has
exercised oversight of PTC primarily through a wide range of controls over
inputs to the decision-making process rather than concentrating on the
results the enterprise is expected to achieve. Revised policies emphasize
the need to establish and monitor performance against key indicators of
financial and nonfinancial performance. In line with these new
initiatives, the proposed consultancy aims to build the Government's
ability to monitor PTC's performance.
ScoRe of Work
2.       The Commercial Division within the Ministry of Finance is
responsible for oversight of Commercial Statutory Authorities (CSAs). The
unit is seriously understaffed: until recently, three of a total of four
approved positions were vacant. Two additional staff were recently hired.
The consultant therefore will be required to carry out this assignment in
three phases as follows:
Phase I--The Initial Phase (1.5 years)
The consultant will have direct line resonsibility during the
first year and a half of this assignment and will be responsible for the
following tasks:
(a) identifying with PTC the data to be provided, the frequency of
reporting, and the report format to allow the CSA unit to assess
financial performance, quality of service, expansion of service
and operational efficiency; the consultant will define anld
establish the necessary data base;
(b) monitoring PTC's performance against initial targets, recommending
revisions, if any, in targets for subsequent years and effecting
liaison with PTC's board and other Ministry of Finance officials;
and
(c) developing operational guidelines and job descriptions for CSA
staff who will be responsible for performance monitoring. The
consultant should specify the unit's role and degree of



- 41 -                             AEX 8
Page 2
interaction with PTC and other Ministry of Finance units with
respect to the preparation and approval of PTC's corporate plan,
review of annual reports, and briefing of PTC's board members and
other Ministry of Finance officials.
Following completion of job descriptions and operational guide-
lines, the consultant will assist with recruitment and training of national
counterpart staff. Counterpart staff should be in position within six
months of the start of the assignment.
Ebase 2--Advisory Phase (6 months)
The national counterpart staff will assume line responsibility
after one year of training. During this phase, the consultant will support
and advise line stafE and make any adjustments necessary in guidelines and
procedures.
Phase 3--Follow-up Phase (2 years)
During the 2-year period following the end of Phase 2, the
consultant will return for two 1-month assignments. The objective of these
follow-up assignments is to monitor the effectiveness of the CSA unit and
help develop solutions to any problems that may arise. It is expected that
these assignments will coincide with such key decision-making points as the
renegotiation of performance indicators and the second 3-yearly tariff
review which will be done by the telecommunications advisor.
Oualifications
3.       The consultant should be an experienced financial analyst with a
technical background and knowledge of and experience with telecommuni-
cations entities.
Staff-months Required
4.       It is estimated that 26 staff-months will be required for this
assignment.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Telecommunications Policy Advisor
Background
1.       The Government of PNG has approved revised telecommunications sector
policies as defined in a telecommunications sector policy paper submitted
jointly by the Minister of Finance and Planning (DOFP) and the Minister of
Communications. In accordance with these policies, the Department of Finance
and Planning will review and approve the Pcst and Telecommunication
Corporation's (PTC's) tariffs on a three-year cycle. Tariffs are to be set on
the basis of forward-looking investment and strategic plans rather than past
historical costs, and they wil;. take into account expected productivity
improvements and expansion targets as well as revenue requirements. The
proposed telecommunications advisor will assist the DOFP with the review of
PTC's tariffs and provide independent advice to Government on policy issues
that may arise.
ScoRe of Work
2.       The advisor will carry out two 3-yearly tariff reviews during the
per.,od in which he/she is retained, the first in 1990 for tariffs coming into
effect in 1991, and the second in 1993. In carrying out the reviews, the
advisor will look at (a) the structure of tariffs vis A vis marginal costs,
(b) government social objectives as outlined in the policy paper, (c) the
levels of tariffs vis & vis feasible targets for real reduction in operational
costs, (d) cash generation requirements, and (e) financial targets. The
advisor will establish and document the methodology used in carrying out the
review. At the end of each review, the advisor will recommend to the Ministry
of Finance and the price controller unit in the DOFP a packet of tariff
adjustments for the next 3-year period.  These recommendations will be
supported by an extensive sensitivity analysis indicating the effect of
variations in the underlying assumptions.
3.       The advisor will also be available to the Government for consultation
on policy issues that may arise. A separate contract will be negotiated for
any request requiring more than one staff-month.
Exoertise Required
4.       The advisor should be a senior policy specialist-economist with
extensive experience with policy and regulation of telecommunication entities,
in particular with determination of telecommunications tariffs.  An individual
consultant or a telecommunications policy and regulatory body will be
considered.

Resource Reguirements and Timing
5.       The advisor will be retained by the DOFP for an initial period of 4
years. Each tariff review will require four staff-months; the retainer fee
will allow for the equivalent to four staff-months of additional time.

Terms of Reference for Management and Professional Develogment Program
Backgr,nd
1.       PTC faces a major 5-year network modernization and expansion program
while at the same time it is restructuring and strengthening its organization.
2.       Since indepandence, the Govermnent of Papua New Guinea has
accelerated the rate of localization of staffing in public-sector emploqiooc.
PTC has responded well to the Government's policy:  only 6.7% of its staff are
expatriates. Currently, however, expatriates comprise 58% of senior managers,
24% of managers anti supervisors, 29% of professionals and 6% of technical
staff, and PTC plan to reduce expatriate staffing by 3.4% by 1994.
3.       PTC has recognized the need to develop national staff for the
increasingly difficult tasks of running a telecommunicati3ns enterprise with
complex modern technology and, in 1987, initiated a program to strengthen
managerial and profesu.ional staff resources using foreignL training
institutions because of the unavailability of suitable lcical institutions.
There is an urgent need to support PTC's pler-' to upgrade its training program
as a key element in ii:s institution-building plans.
Obiectives
4.       The objectives are:
(a) to enhance the abilities of PTC'g national managers;
(b) to upgrade the professional standing of PTC's professionals,
particularly its engineerz;
(c) to gain the benefits of an effective and confident management style
and an effective and positive professional approach to problem-
solving by exposing managers and professionals to practical
experience.
Method of Deliverv
5.       The project will fund 12 scholarships (18 staff-years) over the
period 1990-93 to provide MS- and MBA-level training for 1 or 2 years at
accredited foreign tertiary institutions.
ParticiRation
6.       The target group of national senior managers, managers, engineers and
other professionals in the Telecommunications Division and associated areas



-45                               ANNEX 8
Page 6
(Finance, EDP, Corporate Planning, Manpower Planning, Training and
Development) will number an avera,e of 83 per year over the 4-year program
period. The selection of staff of appropriate age (to ensure, as far as
possible, an adequate return on investment) will be through PTC's staff
Performance Review, Career Development and Succession Planning process.
Release of staff for this and PTC's funded program would not exceed 5% of the
target group per year, an acceptable and achievable level.
SQe2
7.       The scholarships will provide 18 staff-years of MS- and MBA-level
development training for PTC nationals over 4 years at an estimated yearly
cost of K 38,000, for a total cost of US$0.8 million equivalent.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Traininy to Strengthen the Capability of
the Ministry of Finance and Planninig to Monitor Performance of PTC
Background
The Government of Papua New Guinea recently adopted new telecom-
munications sector policies with NEC Decision 232/89, which approved the
telecommunications policy paper submitted jointly by the Minister of Finance
and Planning and the Minister of Telecommunications. The new policies
emphasize establishment of performance targets and government control of PTC
through performance monitoring rather than detailed day-to-day operational
controls.
In order to implement the new telecom policies, an experienced
financial analyst will be hired to help establish a database and develop job
descriptions for the Commercial Statutory Authority Branch of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning, which oversees all CSAs. The CSA branch of the Ministry
of Finance and Planning also needs to be strengthened. The unit is currently
staffed with three graduate economists, two of whom were recently hired. An
additional staff member will be recruited in early 1990. The staff lack
expertise in evaluating and assessing company perfor,ance, knowle4ge of the
operations of the telecommunications sector, and experience in public sector
management.
Obiective
The objectives of the proposed training program are therefore to:
(a) upgrade the professional skills of staff in the Branch, and
(b) expose the staff to operations of regulatory bodies and and other
similar public enterprise management units.
Scoge
In line with these objectives, two types of training will be
provided over a three-year period. Firs-:, 12 staff-months of training will be
provided in the areas of public enterprise management, financial analysis and
project evaluation and appraisal as well as basic training in key telecommuni-
cations issues such as telecommunications tariffs, economics of telecommuni-
cations, etc. Second, eight staff-months of hands-on training will be
provided through secondments to telecommunications regulatory authorities and
other public sector management units.

foreign exchange costs of travel, per diem, training fees and charges from
host organizations.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.       The proposed project is an integral part of PTC's 1989-93 development
program which also includes ongoing works, other works and initial investment
for future works. The benefit period extends from 1989 to 2014, at the end of
which period, on average, all the equipment provided under the program is
expected to have completed its useful life. Capital costs include preinvest-
ments in 1988 for the proposed project.
2.       Benefits are (a) revenue from the estimated 13,000 new telephone
subscribers to be connected and the 32,000 current subscribers, end (b) incre-
mental revenues from existing telephone subscribers as a result of network
expansion and improved call completion rates.
3.       All incremental costs and revenues have been deflated to bring them
to 1989 price levels. A summary of the project's incremental costs and
benefits at 1989 price levels is given in Table 1 below. The projected
financial rate of return on this basis is 24.4%, a highly satisfactory return.

Economic Rate of Return
4.       Financial benefits based on incremental revenues to PTC understate
the economic benefits of the project: the economic value of telecommuni-
cations services exceeeds the price charged. In calculating the economic rate
of return, taxes and duties have been eliminated. On this basis, the economic
costs and benefits are shown in Table 2.

result of a sensitivity analysis carried out on the economic rate of return is
summarized in Table 3.
