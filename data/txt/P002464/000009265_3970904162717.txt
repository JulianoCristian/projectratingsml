CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Somali Democratic Republic
beneficiary:       Ministry of Agriculture
Amount:            SDI  10.7 million (US$10.6 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard
Cofinancing:       SI( 7.05 million (US$7.0 million) equivalent from the
International Fund for Agricultural Development and
US$5.4 million equivalent grant from the European

Project
Description:       Objectives:
Over a five-year period, the project would (i) increase
small rainfed farmer incomes and subsistence through
improved production of grains (sorghum and maize) by soil
and moisture conservation, adaptive research, extension,
farmer training and the supply of farm inputs, (ii)
increase fruit and vegetable production from the small
irrigated gardens through construction of new gardens,
rehabilitation of existing gardens, technical support,
research, extension and the supply of fara inputs and
(iii) strengthen local institutional capacity to
implement projects and to improve services to farmers.
Components:  (a)  Rainfed components would include soil and water
conservation works onto 25,000 ha, a pilot watershed
program and appropriate extension and research.
(b) Irrigation components would include 50 small irrigated
farms, appropriate extension and research and
establishment of a new horticultural research farm.
(c) Water points
(d) Farm input and equipment supply
(e) Training
(f) Project Management Unit
(g) Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Agricultural Development at

Benefits:  The principal benefits would be increased production of sorghum,
maize, fruits and vegetables estimated at full development (year
10) to be about US$3.4 million annually; farm household income
for rainted farmers raised from So.Sh. 12,530 (US$480) to 33,170
(US$1,260) and for irrigated farmers So.Sh. 81,120 (US$3,090).
The project would affect 42,000 persons in rainfed and 3,000
persons in irrigated farming and create additional job
opportunities in the agricultural sector in the region. The
project would continue the process of institution building to
sustain the provision of services to farmers and involve private
sector participation in input supply and marketing.
Risks:     Project risks include security in the region and continuity of
staff employed in the project. Security problems have
diminished but such risks in this area of Somalia cannot be
excluded. Staff incentives applied in the first project would
continue to be used in Phase II, thus helping to attract and
retain qualified staff.

NORTH-WEST REGIUN AGRICULTUKAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
background
1.01      Somalia is located in the northeastern corner of Africa, bordered
by hthiopia and Kenya to the west and south and the Gulf of Aden and the
Indian Ocean to the north and east (Map IBRu No. 18256). The length of the
coastline is about 3,000 kilometers, and the land area is about 63 million
hectares. The topography is varied and includes hot and arid coastal
plains, rugged mountains and plateaus, and lowlands of varying fertility
and rainfall. Approximately 13% (about 8 million hectares) of the land is
estimated as potentially suitable for crop production, but with water the
limiting constraint, only a small part (about 0.7 million hectares) of the
area is cultivated.
1.02      The resident population is estimated between 4.5 and 5.5 million
and the retugee population, between 0.7 and 1.0 million. About 60% of the
labor force are nomads and semi-nomads who depend on livestock for their
subsistence; about 20% are farmers cultivating land along the Juba and
Shebelli rivers and in the higher rainfall Bay and north-west regions; and
2UX are urban dwellers. The economy is dominated by the livestock sector
which provides a living to the large nomadic population and generates about
35X of the GOP. Exports of live animals represent about 80% of total
exports. Crop production generates about 8% of GDP and roughly the same
share of exports. Rainfed crop production is based primarily upon
sorghum. Crop production under controlled irrigation is centered on
bananas (the principal cash crop and the second largest export commodity),
sugarcane, rice and maize; production under flood irrigation comprises
mainly maize and sesame. Fish and fish products account for about 3X ot
exports and their share of GOP does not exceed 2%.
1.03      Somalia is amongst the poorest countries in the world and is
classified by the United Nations as a least developed country. Per capita
income was estimated to be below US$300 in 1981. Not only is it among the
poorest, but the general lack of infrastructure--physical and
institutional--and the hostile physical environment, poor communications,
lack of modern transportation systems and scattered population centers have
created serious obstacles to development of the country.
1.04      The Agricultural Sector Report of 1981 (Report No. 2281a-SO)
emphasizes the need to strengthen and develop certain key areas of the
sector. Important are those activities which generate increased production
and exports in the short run. The sector strategy calls for development of
underutilized resources (including activating sunk capital), the expansion
of private sector incentives and opportunities and the establishment of
additional export markets to increase foreign exchange earnings.



-2-
Bank Group Role
1.05      The bank assistance strategy for Somalia is to encourage and
assist the Government in the formulation and implementation of rolling
medium-term recovery programs directed simultaneously at restoring
financial equilibrium and rehabilitation and making fuller use of existing
agricultural and industrial capacity, and at establishing the foundations
of longer term growth.
1.06      Since 1970, IDA has extended 24 credits to Somalia, amounting to
about USA193 million, of which roughly 30% has been for agriculture, 25%
for transport and the rest is about equally divided over education, water
supply, ports, energy, industry and technical assistance. Over the last
four years annual commitments have risen from $10 million in 1981, to $15
million in 1982, $23 million in 1983 and $31.5 million in 1984. IFC has so
far made one investment in Somalia-$375,000 loan in 1981 for a molasses
terminal for the Juba Sugar Project. IFC is now focussing its attention on
export-oriented projects. In recent years, the Abu Dhabi F'und, African
Development Fund, Arab Fund, IFAD, Islamic Development Bank, SEC, Kuwait
Fund, Saudi Fund, and USAID have cofinanced projects in Somalia with IDA.
1.07      Ungoing projects in the sector consist of the North-West Region
Agricultural Development Project - Phase I; Drought Rehabilitation Project;
Central Rangelands Project; Farm Management, Extension and Training
Project; and the Bay Region Agricultural Development Project. All of these
projects are, to some extent, institutionally and economically
inter-related and knowledge derived from them can be shared. Physically,
progress has been mixed and some have not done well; however, progress of
the North West Regional Agricultural Development PLoject - Phase I, is
regarded as excellent and the main production rargets estimated at
appraisal have been met or exceeded.
1.0w      Project implementation for the first phase was delayed by about
two years after loan signing, due to postponements in effectiveness and the
security situation in the region. However, by June 30, 1984, the project
had constructed bunds 1/ on about 17,000 ha thus protecting an area of
about 32,00 ha representing 120% of appraisal estimates. Project farms
bunded are 5,25U equivalent to 200% of appraisal estimate. In addition,
the 50 lIvestock and 1OU human water points planned under the project have
been constructed thus improving the supply of water for a part of the dry
season. Targets for buildings and procurement have been achieved; progress
made in the construction of the one ha irrigated gardens (20 completed --
representing 40% of appraisal estimate) and a start made in the provision
of extension services for dryland and irrigated agriculture in the project
area, Average annual incremental sorghum yields derived from sample field
measurements during the four years (19b0 through 1983) have been in the
range of 55X to 78% between bunded and unbunded lands.

at the base and about 120 m in length constructed on the contour at
approximately 2 bunds per ha.



- 3 -
1.09      The first project made provision for partial cost recovery from
beneficiaries. The amount to be recovered is limited to 15Z of the 10-year
average incremental yield. This represents about 50X of the actual costs
of bunding. The cost recovery scheme was agreed by IDA in 1983. Details
of farmer indebtedness were calculated and subsequently passed to the
Treasury in 1984. However, repayments have not yet started because of the
present severe drought in the region. Government has signalled its
intention to proceed with the cost recovery scheme as soon as practicable.
1.10      The first project has been well managed, often under extremely
difficult circumstances of local political unrest and external security
hazards.  It has demonstrated the technical, feasibility and financial
attractiveness of the technology applied. While these operations would
continue during the second phase, major emphasis would be placed on the
integration of the various support service operations Into the national
institutions, such as extension, input supply, credit and marketing.
Project KLationale
1,11      The agricultural sector dominates the economy (paras 1.01 and
1.02). Alth'ough the country possesses an abundance of land relative to its
small population, the low and variable rainfall (less than 600 mm per annum
in most places) places considerable constraints on both livestock and crop
production. In the north-west of Somalia, pressures placed on its land
resources are exacerbated by restricted access of Somali nomads to
traditional grazing in the neighboring Ogaden region and the absorption of
several hundred thousand refugees from disputed border territories.
Consequently, Government is placing high emphasis on sedentarization of
nomads through exploitation of avallablle resources, particularly in
rainfed agriculture. The Bank is assisting with these efforts; the first
phase of the project, the pilot work In the inter-riverine area and the Bay
Region are examples of the strategy. Dissemination of these technologies
would be facilitated by the Farm Management and Extension/Training Project
which is under implementation.
1.12      A promising start has been made under the first phase.  The
project has contributed to more secure food and water supply for the
already settled population in the north-west. The proposed project will
consolidate and expand these achievements and will help relieve the chronic
and sometimes acute shortages of staple grains, and lessen the dependence
on food imports and relief operations.
l.L3      While agricultural operations under these marginal rainfall
conditions are chancy, the proposed project is based on valuable experience
on pilot works which were first started in 1954 and on six years of
in-field experience under the ongoing project. Consultants to provide
technical assistance and prepare a feasibility study for a second phase of
the project were also provided. During this period, a resource inventory,
exploratory drilling for groundwater were also completed. Thus the work
already conducted has improved the data base and provided solid expereience
for the identification and preparation of this project. During
implementation of the first phase, a strong Somali management teamp,
assisted by expatriate staff, has been built up.



- 4 -
1.14      Consequently, the proposed second phase would build on a
successtul and attractive technology and a tested management team. The
technology achievements need to be rerined and consolidated, while the
support services need to be expanded and linked with the national
institutions. Continued Bank involvement is therefore needed to further
the development of appropriate technology and institutions to establish a
sustainable system of extension, input supply and marketing in conjunction
with the private sector. It is the key project in sectoral strategy for
the north-west region. Potentially, even more important is the
replicability and cross-fertilization of the technological messages being
developed with Bank assistance under the proposed second phase, the pilot
effort inter-riverine areas and the Bay Region, all of which are assisted
by the Bank. In addition, support is needed for the development of the
regions potential water resources through a continued Intervention in
small-scaled irrigation. These components of the project would be financed
by the European kEconomic Community (EEC).
II. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.U1      The north-west region in which the project area is situated, is
bounded in the north by the Gulf of Aden; in the south, by Ethiopia; in the
west, by UJibouti and in the east, roughly by a line drawn from the port of
Berbera southward to the Ethiopian border (1BKl Nap No. 16257)2/.  After
the two major river valleys of the south, the north-west region is the next
most important part of the country in terms of population density and
agricultural activity. The region has some 450,UU0 Inhabitants, most of
these being concentrated In Xargeisa, the country's second largest city
(3U0,OUO) and the other urban centers (5U,UUU). The reglon's total area of
some 3.5 million ha, contains less than 100,000 ha of land suitable for
cropplng. The major part of this is concentrated in a relatively narrow
band in the plateau districts of Hargeisa, Gebiley and Boorama--all
contiguous with the Ethiopian border (para. 2.07).
2.02      Stock-rearing is the most important economic activity of the
area. It constitutes the traditional pursuit of the nomad families though
many of these have become partially sedentary and practice rainfed
agriculture along with stock-rearing. Irrigated agriculture has expanded
in a spontaneous manner over recent years on the basis of the initiative of
Individuals with the necessary capital to invest ln well digging and the
purchase of Irrigation equipment. At present, 7bO ha ave Irrigated--490 ha
are irrigated permanently by pumping from the shallow aquifer of the
toggas,3/ wnile 270 ha receive less regular irrigation by the diversion
2/ Government has recently announced that the districts of Borama,
Zeila and Lughaya in North West Region have been grouped under
a new region named Awdal. The project area is situated in both
these regions.

of surface water. The dryland farmers have limited options of cultivating
tineir land, in a region where the rainfall regime is unreliable, and where
work must be carried out carefully to conserve soil moisture and prevent
erosion. Major constraints to the farmers are access to the supply of
agricultural equipment and inputs, poorly organized marketing, lack of
extension services, and medium-term credit.
Climate
2.U3      The climate is semi-arid and crop production is therefore
uncertain. The year can be divided into the dry season from October to
March and the rainy season from April to September when over 8U0 of the
annual rainfall occurs. The average annual rain in the project area is
about 40U mm, but fluctuates widely between years. Hargeisa, for example
which is typical of the project area, averages about 400 mm but has
recorded variations from ZU9 mm to 810 mm per year. Most rain comes in
short intensive storms causing rapid runof2, flash floods and severe
erosion. Ketaininig runoff to Improve crop production and prevent erosion
are the major factors to achieve project objectives. The wind regime is
very regular and the region is subject to the influence of two monsoons,
one trom the northeast fromn Uctober to May and the other from the southwest
from June to September. Plateau temperatures have a mean maximum of 2b°C
with a range ot 24% to .l°C and with a mean minimum of 17'C. Scarce rain
or other water resources are the main constraint to crop production since
temperature would allow year round cropping.
water ieesources
2.04      Although the climate is semi-arid, the region possesses
undeveloped water resources. In hilly sections, rivers take the torm of a
succession of reaches where bedrock is exposed, alternating with sandy
stretches flanKed by alluvial terraces. Very often there are permanent
springs in the rocky sections while in the sandy river bed, the water table
is close to the surtace. Ground water is of good quality for irrigation.
The present use of ground water and spring water represents only a part of
the potential. floods are short, but violent and most of the water flows
quickly through the area towards the coast.Perennial water resources are
small and allow the irrigation of only a few hectares and do not justify
large-scale work. The traditional exploitation is by shallow wells,
extracting from the underflow ot the river beds. This system can be
turther developed and improved.
Soils
2.0S      A soil survey of the region was carried out under the first
project and mapped at a scale of 1/500,O0O. Land use capability was
determined on the basis of soil depth, slope, structure, permeability,
moisture retention and drainage. The areas which would lend themselves to
the development ot rainfed cultivation or to the development of grazing
land cover about 40U,00U ha (12/.) of which an area amounting to lU,000 ha
or 3Z of the north-west region, is suitable for cropping.

Land Use and Tenure
2.06      Because most of the north-west region receives too little
rainfall for crop production, the majority of the land is used to support
livestock. Sedentary herds are mixed cattle, sheep, goats, camels and
donkeys. Sheep and goats are run together in flocks of 50-300 by nomads
who also own smaller numbers of the other species. All are well adapted to
severe environmental conditions but mortality rates can be high in drought
periods especially in sedentary herds. The estimated carrying capacity of
the project area based on biomass is of the order of 350,000 animal units
(AU) or an average of about 10 ha/AU. Livestock counts taken during 1980
showed a population of 40U,OU0 cattle; 120,000 camels and 360,000 sheep and
goets. This was after the drought year of 1979 which produced heavy losses
and had forced migration of most of the herds to the Ogaden. Transhumance
rather than nomadism is practiced and will continue although some small
stock and milking cows are sedentary. Livestock owned by people who live
in or whose home base is in the north-west region amount to about 150,000
cattle, half a million camels and five million sheep and goats. Migration
to the Ogaden enables these numbers to remain productive in normal years.
In times of drought some animals die, their numbers depending on the length
and geographical extent of the drought. Those which remain survive by
frequent relocation, but then put such grazing pressure on the
environment that deterioration in the vegetative succession towards less
palatable and/or productive species may occur. There are an estimated
42,000 nomads (7,000 families) and 45,000 semi-nomadic peoples in the
region that participate in transhumance.
2.07      out of a total population of about 450,0W   in the region only
about 54,000 people (7,700 families) are engaged in rainfed farming; 400
families in pumped irrigated agriculture aDd 60 families in spate irrigated
agriculture. Out of a total cultivable area of about 100,000 ha only
65,000 ha gross area is used--the balance of 3),000 ha being fragmented
patches of land with no easy access or infrastructure, villages, roads and
livestock water yards. Under traditional farming practices long fallow
periods are common so that at present about 40,000 ha is in fallow in any
one year. Production of sorghum and maize predominates.
2.U8      There are at present about 400 small farms averaging about 1.2
ha, which are irrigated by individual pump units. They are mainly situated
on alluvial terraces and water is produced from shallow excavations in
river beds or wells on the banks. Production is mainly citrus, papayas and
vegetables.
Z.09      The distribution of land in the project area is remarkably
egalitarian and based on laws which fix limits on farmed areas based on the
ability of the family to cultivate. Since 1975 farmers have been granted
concessions on the land, valid for 50 years, extendible beyond that period
and transferable only in the direct line of succession. Land use is
strictly controlled and no land can be granted to absentee landlords.
Tenant farming and share cropping are also prohibited by law. Under modern
Somali law, the area of rainfed farms could theoretically be expanded to a
maximum of 60 ha (limited to 30 ha under irrigation), but this is unlikely
as most cultivable land is already occupied.



-7-
Institutions
2.10      Administrations.  The north-west region is administered by a
Governor assisted by Commissioners in the Districts of Hargeisa, Gebiley
and Boorama. Civil order is controlled by the Police Commissioner and his
force while regional and border security is in the hands of the Somali
Army.
2.11      Cooperatives.  The bulk of production is in private hands.  There
are, however, some cooperatives of two main types: (a) service
cooperatives (6, with 1,194 members) which serve as intermediaries between
individual farmers and state organizations of the Agricultural Development
Corporation (ADC) and the Tractor Hiring Agency (ONAT); and, (b) 17 group
farm cooperatives with a total membership of 1,042 members participating in
collective cultivation. The total farming area for all cooperatives does
not exceed 3,UO ha.
2.12      State Farms.  Tug Wajale on the Ethiopian border is the only
state farm in the region. The farm has authority over 70,000 ha but the
majority of this area is still mainly used by the nomads as pastureland.
The farm has been a failure in spite of outside technical and equipment
assistance and is now virtually defunct. In 1976 the most active year,
only 1,500 ha was cultivated but this declined to 350 ha by 1980. The
Lighest recorded yield for sorghum is about 400 kg/ha but recorded data is
suspect.
2.13      Government Services.  A wide range of services are provided by
Government to the agricultural sector. These services include rainfed
farming extension, animal health, domestic and livestock water supply
development, forestry, credit and marketing. All of the institutions
involved, including the Ministry of Agricuilture (MOA) suffer from budgetary
constraints, lack of trained staff, transport and housing. Staff turnover
is high due to the relatively harsh local conditions and isolation from the
mainstream of social and political life and chances of promotion. In the
absence of a solid institutional presence in the north-west region, it was
ceemed necessary to form a Project Management Unit (PMU) to implement the
first project under a Project Ministerial Committee (PMC). Most
agricultural service activities have been vested in the PMU which carried
out farm and water development, developed its own research and extension
and imported small supplies of basic inputs for farm demonstration. While
this arrangement has worked well, it is no substitute for soundly staffed
and adequately financed national institutions and this will need to be
addressed during the second phase (para. 4.02).
2.14      Infrastructure.  Throughout the region, there are about 2,600 km
of roads of which 228 km are asphalted. The balance are poor secondary
and feeder roads servicing scattered communities. All roads are at risk to
flash flooding during which traffic disruption and physical damage are
severe. Transport costs are consequently high. Plans are being studied to
build a coastal road from Berbera to Ujibouti. There are airports at
BerDera and Hargeisa, and landing strips at Gebiley and Boorama.   Markets
for farm produce, livestock, meat, fruits and vegetables exist in the main
towns and villages. They tend to be informal and open air. Grains, when
sold, are generally marketed through private traders on a market price



8 -
basis and not through ADC, although it is legally responuible for the
marketing of grains (para. 5.04). Although there is a hide processing
factory other processing facilities are rudimentary and consist mainly of
small grain mills and local open air butcheries. Water supplies are
critical everywhere and in great demand in all population centers.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objective
3.U1      Over a five year period, the project would (i) increase small
rainted farmer incomes and subsistence through improved production of
grains (sorghum and maize) by soil and moisture conservation, adaptive
research, extension, farmer training and the supply of farm inputs, (ii)
increase fruit and vegetable production from the small irrigated gardens
through construction of new gardens, rehabilitation of existing gardens,
technical support, research, extension and the supply of farm inputs and
(iii) strengthen local institutional capacity to implement projects and to
improve services to farmers.
Project Description
3.oz      The project would be implemented by the existing PMU of the
MUA under the overall policy guidance of the PMC. The project would
include:
(a) expansion of the present soil and water conservation
works onto 25,000 ha of accessible cultivable farm land in the
region and a pilot watershed program based on selected
catchments;
(b) the provision for, and expansion of, advisory services to
all dryland farmers in the total project area;
(c)  the improvement and operation of the adaptive research
facilities of the Aburin rainfed crops experimental farm;
(d)  the development of an additional 50 new small irrigated
farms;
(e)  the provision for, and expansion of, advisory services to
existing and newly developed small irrigated farms;
(f) the establishment and operation of a new site for irrigated
adaptive research;
(g) the establishment of about 100 human water points and 50
livestock water yards using boreholes and equipped with hand
pumps wherever possible;



- 9 -
(h)  the provision of annual farm inputs, ox-drawn farm
implements and irrigation equipment in conjunction with
the private sector and also where medium-term credit
is required with the Somali Development Bank (SDB);
(i)  technical services and training;
(j)  continued support of the project management unit (PMU); and
(k)  continuation of a pilot research program and project preparation
for the semi-mechanized rainfed agricultural development at
Kurtun Waarey and Sablaale.
Detailed Features
Rainfed Components:
3.03      Soil and Water Conservation Works (US$7.3 million).  The project
would provide additional machinery to carry out soil and water conservation
works, such as bunding, terracing and contour hedging (para 4.06). The
most important work is the continued construction of bunds on arable land
with a slope of more than 2Z, to prevent erosion and control water run off
from the brief torrential storms. Bunds therefore have to be unusually
high and stabilized for which mechanically constructed earth banks have
proved to be the most effective. A total of four motorgraders, eight
bulldozers, four tractors, nine 4-wheel drive vehicles, three lorries and
one fuel tanker trailer at a cost of US$2.0 million, as well as two mobile
trailer homes, assorted agricultural machinery such as ploughs, ridgers and
border discs, and miscellaneous camping and surveying equipment at a cost
of US$U.2 million would be provided. Machinery and vehicle operating costs
US$1.4 million, materials for stone pitched outlets and spreaders and
planting materials for the pilot watershed program US$1.5 million (para
4.07-4.09), and labor for the soil arid water conservation works of US$0.8
million would also be financed. A soil conservation officer, surveyor and
chief mechanic would be internationally recruited for a total of 120
man-months. Furthermore, the project has financed under the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) (para. 3.16), the aerial photography and
mapping, preparatory watershed management design which included 18
man-months of short-term technical assistance, two 4-wheel drive vehicles
and surveying and drafting equipment. (paras 4.07-4.09).
3.04      Dryland Farming Extension (US$1.5 million).  The dryland farming
extension service, programmed on the basis of regular visits to the farmers
to explain methods of improving production technologies, would be expanded
to provide assistance to farmers whose fields were bunded under Phase I as
well as those of Phase Li (paras 4.11-4.14). The project would provide 5
tractors and assorted agricultural machinery for preparing demonstration
plots, 6 four-wheel drive vehicles, 25 scooters, and audio-visual equipment
at a cost of US$0.4 million. The operating costs of the machinery and
vehicles US$0.3 million, the five teams and farmer training totalling
US$0.4 million would also be financed. An internationally recruited
extension and training officer would be employed for a period of 48
months.



- 10 -
3.05     Research (US$0.6 Million).  The project would provide 3 four-wheel
drive vehicles, a scooter and a tractor with associated agricultural
machinery at a cost of US$0.1 million(para 4.15). In order to allow a
fuller use of the facilities at Aburin Farm for adaptive research, it would
be essential to improve living conditions and the project would, therefore,
tinance additional prefabricated housing (300 m2), appropriate furnishings,
associated services and maintenance at a cost of US$0.2 million. The
operating costs of the machinery and vehicles US$0.1 million and the
research and other staff, together with the associated costs of the farm
US$0.2 million would also be financed.
Irrigated Components
3.06      Small Irrigated Farm Development (US$0.4 Million).  The project
would develop fifty new one ha irrigated gardens for fruit and vegetable
production at an estimated cost of US$6,00 per garden, total US$0.3
million (para 4.10). This would cover the cost of well construction,
pumpsets with 7 hp diesel engines, garden tools, land clearing, preparation
and planting. In addition, the project has financed under the PPF (para.
3.16) 6 man-months of short-term technical assistance in the small
irrigated garden design, together with a four-wheel drive vehicle and
irrigation equipment.
3.07      Horticultural Extension Service (US$1.2 Million).  The
horticultural extension service -would be expanded to five teams to provide
assistance to all existing small-scale irrigation farmers in the area. The
project would provide 5 four-wheel drive vehicles and 6 scooters at a total
cost of US$0.1 million (paras 4.11-4.14). In order to provide suitable
living accommodation for the team leaders and assistant horticultural
extension officers, the project would finance additional prefabricated
housing (500 m2) and storage (12) m2), including appropriate furnishings
and maintenance at a total cost of US$0.3 million. The operating costs of
the vehicles US$0.1 million, the five teams and farmer training totalling
US$0.3 million would also be financed.  In addition, an internationally
recruited horticultural extension officer would be employed for a period of
48 months and provision made for short term consultancy for project
preparation for future irrigation development in the region.
3.08      New Horticultural Research Farm (US$ 1.1 Million).  The existing
station at Geed Deeble is no longer suitable due to its remote location and
with a water supply system which cannot irrigate more than 3 ha. There is
no possibility of alternative water supply. Therefore, the project would
establish a new station on a 30 ha site located about 30 km west of
Hargeisa. The site is satisfactory and has been transferred to the project
for use as the new horticultural research farm. The project would finance
the cost of development of the site, the infrastructure, prefabricated
housing (U25 m2) and storage and other buildings (450 m2), appropriate
furnishings, associated services and maintenance at a total cost of US$0.5
million. Vehicles and equipment to be provided would include 2 four-wheel
drive vehicles, 2 scooters, a 7-ton truck, 2 tractors and associated
agricultural machinery including a 20 hp pumpset at a total cost of US$0.2



- 11 -
million. The operating costs of the machinery and vehicles US$0.2 million
and the staff and farm costs US$0.2 million would also be financed.
3.09      Water Points (US$0.6 Million).  As water is a major constraint in
the region, the project would continue to develop human and livestock water
supplies within the bunded farming areas. Wherever possible, both the
additional 100 human water points and the 50 livestock water yards would be
developed by drilling in areas of known aquifers and be equipped with hand
pumps.
3.10      Farm Input and Equipment (US$3.4 Million).  To overcome the
chronic shortage and intermittent and untimely delivery of inputs which are
important for increasing production yields, the project would initiate a
system of farm input supply through private wholesalers/retailers (para.
4.18). This would help fill the gap left by ONAT and ADC failure to supply
inputs in a timely way to farmers. The PMU would purchase and resell to
wholesale/retail merchants ox-drawn equipment, sprayers, scraper boards for
bund maintenance, pumpsets, piping, hand tools, fertilizer, insecticides,
pesticides and seeds. An internationally recruited input supply and
marketing office would be employed for a period of 48 months.
3.11      Training (US$0.7 Million).  Overseas training would be provided
through a mixture of courses from 2 to 10 months for 29 staff members in
various disciplines of agronomy, conservation, economics, sociology,
monitoring and evaluation, mechanics and inventory control. In addition,
one 2-year course in finance and 3 post-graduate courses in agronomy, soil
conservation and dryland agriculture would be financed. Details are shown
in Annex 1, Table 12.   Farmer training would be carried out through the
dryland and horticultural extension services.
3.12      Project Management Unit (US$2.4 Million).  The project would
provide 9 four-wheel drive vehicles, house and office furnishings and
equipment, stores equipment and fuel storage at a total cost of US$0.3
million. An internationally recruited technical advisor to the general
manager and a financial controller would be employed for a period of 84
months. In addition, short-term consultancies in monitoring and
evaluation and a study of government recurrent expenditure would be
financed. Uperating costs of the project management unit for staff, the
renovation of the warehouse handed over by ADC to the project, rent and
maintenance of buildings, vehicle operating costs and office expenses would
be about US$1.2 million over the project period.
3.13      Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Agricultural Development (US$0.6
Million). The project would provide funds to the Ministry of Agriculture
to ensure continuation of the large-scale testing of semi-mechanized
rainfed technology at Kurtun Waarey and Sablaale. Under the Drought
Rehabilitation Project (Credit No. 623-SO), Government has carried out, for
six cropping seasons, large-scale testing of semi-mechanized production
technology including moisture conservation, crop rotation, land
preparation, selection of cultivars and management of strip farming. A
Bank mission in May 1964 appraised Government's request and recommended
that a second phase of two years would be required to carry out further
field testing of the production technology and to gain experience in the



- 12 -
creation of institutional arrangements which could ensure sustained and
stable production in the settlement areas. This would require careful
analysis of the land tenure systems, alternatives for cost recovery,
development of marketing and credit incentives, and long-term commitment to
traiuing of Somali farm managers. As pointed out in paragraph 1.14, the
Bank is assisting Government efforts to generate technologies under
marginal rainfed conditions, the second phase North-West Agriculture
Development Project, the Bay Region Development Project and the
continuation of the pilot work in the settlement areas are part of this
strategy. Funds available under Credit 623-SO were exhausted in August
1984 and arrangements have been made to fund the cost of the first of the
two years of continuation from the May Region Agricultural Rehabilitation
Project (Credit 972-SO), while the second year would be financed under this
project.
Project Costs4/
3.14          Total  project  cost  is estimated  at  So.Sh.  1,196.0   million
(US$25.6 million). The foreign exchange component is US$19.0 million
(74x). Investments under the project are free of duties and taxes.

3.15      The cost estimates are based on March 1984 figures updated to
November 1984 baseline price levels and are derived from the preparation

contingencies have been provided for technical assistance, training and
input supplies--1O% has been provided for all other project components.
Price contlngencies have been separately calculated for the foreign
exchange and local currency components, and have been estimated on the
expected annual inflation rates detailed in Annex 2 Table 6.
3.1b      A PPF of US$500,000 has been approved to cover the estimated
foreign costs of: aerial photography and mapping (US$140,000), technical
assistance for watershed management and irrigation development (US$240,000)
and vehicles and equipment (US$120,000).
Proposed Financing
3.17      Project costs would be financed as shown in Table 2.  Under joint
financing arrangements, IDA would contribute a credit of US$10.6 million,
IFAiJ a loan of US$7 million and the EEC a grant of US$5.4 million. The IDA
credit and I1Ad loan would finance, jointly with Government, all the
rainfed components, water points, overseas training and the project
management unit. IDA would also finance the input and equipment supply for
farmers in the rainfed areas and the one year extension of the
semi-mechanized rainfed agricultural development. The EEC would finance
the irrigated components and the input supply and equipment for farmers in
the irrigated areas. Financing of local expenditures for civil works and
operating expenses would be on a decreasing annual percentage basis (90X in
year one decreasing by 15% annually to 30% in year five).

3.18      The proposed IDA Credit would be on standard terms to
Government. The IFA) loan would be on highly concessional terms: interest
at 1% with 50 years repayment, including a 1U year grace period. The EEC
grant would be covered through a separate financing agreement still to be
drawn up. Notification of financing approval of the EEC grant would be a
condition of effectiveness of the credit. Government's contribution would
be US$2.6 million equivalent to about 10X of the total cost. however, over
the ten year period from the commencement of implementation, July 1985, it
is estimated that Government would receive (Annex 2, Table 5) from sale of
farm inputs to wholesalers/retailers and proceeds from the cost recovery
schemes about So.Sh. 300 million (US$6.4 million). Part of the receipts of
the sale of farm inputs, So.Sh. 130 million (US$2.8 million) would be
channeled by Government to the SDB in Hargeisa to meet the credit needs of
farmers (para. 3.19).
3.19      Under the input supply system, the PMU would procure ox-drawn and
irrigation equipment and sell to contracted wholesaler/retailers for cash.
These local currency proceeds would be deposited with the SDB in Hargeisa
to create a revolving fund to meet the credit needs of farmers for the
equipment. Loans to farmers would be at the existing 11% rate of interest
of SUb for medium-term credit.   This is also the rate being used under the
Fisheries Exploration/Pilot Project which was recently approved by the
Board. The credit activity over the project life is estimated to be small
and loans would, in the main, be to low-income beneficiaries. In addition,
the project is situated in a part of the country that has poor natural
resources and is remote from the center of Government. However, if
Government decides to raise interest rates in general, the new interest
rate applicable for agricultural projects would be used.
Procurement
3.20      Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3 below and the
IDA and IFAI procedures outlined in paras. 3.21 to 3.25 were agreed upon at
negotiations. Procurement for those project elements financed by the EEC
would be in accordance with their own procurement procedures.
3.21      Contracts for supply of machinery and equipment, vehicles,
prefabricated buildings and annual farm inputs totalling approximately
US$6.5 million would be grouped wherever possible into contracts valued at
US$IUU,0UU or more and procured by ICB in accordance with the World Bank
guidelines. Assurances where practical would be sought from suppliers on
servicing facilities within the project area.  Qualifying dcmestic
manufacturers would receive a preference in ICB bid evaluation of 15Z or
the import duty, whichever is lower. Miscellaneous items in packages of
less than US$100,000 but totalling no more than US$400,000 would be
procured under the project's local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures
which are acceptable to the Association. For contracts under US$20,000,
but totalling no more than US$300,000, local shopping or purchasing
off-the-shelf after obtaining at least three quotations would be used. In
total, ICB would account for about 92% by value of the purchase of goods
described above.

3.22      Civil works for water points and site development for
prefabricated buildings and infrastructure, amounting to approxi'r&tely
US$1.0 million, because of the small unit cost and dispersed nature of the
works would be let under LCM.
3.23      Spare parts and fuel for the machinery, equipment and vehicles,
amounting to approximately US$5.3 million would be purchased by quotations
from the manufacturers of the equipment, other reliable parts manufacturers
and dealer as appropriate. Other operating expenses include US$1.b million
for local salaries and wages and US$1.2 million for administrative
expenses, such as travel costs and building rentals for which procurement
procedures are inapplicable.
3.24      The qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment of internationally recruited experts and consultants (US$3.6
million) would be acceptable to IDA and IFAD. Assurances to this effect
were obtained at negotiations. Overseas training (US$1.0 million) would be
by direct placement for which procurement procedures are inapplicable.
3.25      All bidding packages for services, works and goods estimated to
cost over US$0.25 million equivalent would be subject to prior IDA review
of procurement documentation. This would result in a coverage of about 75%
of the total estimated value of the contracts financed by IDA. The balance
of contracts would be subject to random post review by IDA after contract
award.
Disbursement
3.26      The IDA Credit and the IFAD Loan would be administered by IDA.
Disbursements over six years against project expenditures would be shared
equally between IDA and IFAU on those goods or service which are to be
jointly financed (para. 3.17). The disbursement profile for IDA Eastern
Africa Ltegion 'All Loans' is nine years with about 83X being disbursed over
the first six years. The shorter disbursement period of six years assumed
for the project is justified because a major part of the project activities
are follow-on activities from the ongoing first project and the PMU is
operative and well managed. In addition, other pre-implementation
preparation has been financed under the 2PF and a significant percentage of
project funds would be spent on the procurement of machinery and equipment
for the follow on activities. The categories of goods and services for IDA
and IFAD financing is set out in Table 4.
3.27    Disbursements against all items would be based on full
documentation, except operating expenses under category 5, which would
require only a Statement of Expenditure (SUE). The PIU has adequate staff
and controls for the preparation of SUE's. Supporting documents would not
be submitted for review but retained at PM4U headquarters for inspection by
IDA supervision missions. A schedule of estimated disbursements is shown
in Annex 2, Table 4.

3.4a    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the project, it is
lmportant that the PMU should have prompt access to the requisite funds,
particularly since the project activities are located a considerable
dlstance from Mogadishu. It would be a condition of effectiveness of the
credlt that Government had deposited in the Project's account with the
Central Bank an advance based on an average of three months expenditure in
the amount of So.Sh. 6,000,0O0 and that Government would replenish the
project account to that level every quarter until project completion. In
addition, to enable the project to procure direct (para. 3.21) and to speed
up disbursement during the course of the project, Government would open two
speclal accounts in foreign exchange in the project's name with the Central
Bank, one for transactions with IDA and one for transactions with IFAD.
The opening of these special accounts would be a condition of credit
effectiveness. LVA and IFAD would each maKe at effectiveness an initial
deposit of USSlOU,000 equivalent into the special accounts. Additional
IDA/IFAD disbursements to the special accounts would be tied to
Government's timely replenishment of the Project account. This was agreed
upon at negotiations.
Accounts and Audit
3.29      The project entity has under the first project established
up-to-date accounts which are maintained in accordance with sound and
generally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to
the Bank to enable the project entity to provide monthly and annual
financial statements to reflect the financial performance and position of
the project. The second project would continue to operate this accounting
system. In addition, the SDB would establish a separate account within the
financial records to identify the funds deposited with the SDB for
on-lending to farmers (para. 3.19).
3.30      An auditor's opinion and report satisfactory to the Bank on the
project statements, the SDB revolving fund and the special accounts would
be provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year. The
auditor's report would include a statement on the adequacy of the
accounting system and internal controls, the SDB revolving fund and on the
reliability of SOEs as a basis for loan disbursements. The foregoing
accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements would provide
adequate and timely information to IDA for supervision of disbursements and
the project generally. The above arrangements together with the
appointment of acceptable independent auditors were confirmed at
negotiations.
Environmental Impact
3.31      The first project has already contributed to arresting soil
erosion in the area where on-farm bunding has been completed. The bund-
ing has permitted retention of water not only for crop production, but also
augmented recharge of the underground aquifers supplying local springs and
wells. This together with the surface run off water yards has improved
water availability in the project area. The seccnd project would not only
extend these benefits to a larger area in the region but it would also
address on a pilot basis the wider aspects of catchment control in order to
stabilize fragile land surfaces and protect the downstream on-farm
investments.



- 19 -
3.32      All chemicals currently used on crops in Somalia are tested for
compliance with prescribed specifications by residue analysis and are
registered by the Plant Protection Department of the MOA. These procedures
are considered adequate. The use of fertilizers has limited applications.
It is not expected that the use of chemicals and fercillzers in the project
area would have any adverse environmental Impact.
Mid-term Review
3.33      The review would consider developments under the project and in
particular Government's proposals:  'i) for the integration of the PHU
services within existing national institutions and the institutional
capacity to sustain development in the follow on period (para. 4.02); (ii)
on the development of the input supply system and plans for its future
operation (para 4.18); (iii) for adjustments in project implementation
procedures which would need to be incorporated within the annual work
program (para 4.22); and (iv) on revisions to the terms and conditions of
the cost recovery schemes (para 5.11 and 5.12). Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that this mid-term review would be held with cofinanciers
no later than June 30, 1988, and that the subsequent implementation plans
would be subject to IDA, IFAD and EEC approval.
IV. UMGANIZAION AND MANAGEENT
Project Ministerial Committee
4.01      The PMC presently represented by the Ministries of Agriculture,
Finance, Planning and tne Somali Development Bank, has the overall
responsibility for the project. The PMC delegates responsibility for
project management to the PHU, which is attached to the MOA for
administrative purposes. These arrangements have proved satisfactory under
the first project.
Project Management Unit
4.U2      The PHU, headed by a general manager assisted by a technical
assistance team, would be responsible to the PMC for the direct
implementation of all project activities.   The qualification and
experience of the general manager would be satisfactory to IDA and IFAD.
This project is the second phase of an on-going development. The PMU,
established for implementation of the first phase, has not yet acheived its
full objectives and it would not be appropriate at this stage that the
various services be taken over by the MOA. Under the second phase, it
would be important that there be a gradual handing over of the various
services, such as extension, research and input supply, and that
Government, in particular the MOA reviews prior to the mid-term review the
organizational arrangements for the activities being strengthened under the
second phase project (para 3.33).



- 20 -
4.U3     The PMU headquarters are located in Hargeisa with decentralization
of field staff in the district towns of Boorama, Vila, and Gebiley and also
at the adaptive research centers of Aburin and at the new horticultural
site (para. 3.08). A small administrative office would also be maintained
in Mogadishu for appropriate contact with the central Government Ministries
and the SiB.
4.04      Under the first project, technical services have been used to
good effect. Technical assistance would not only be continued but
additional assistance would be provided for the pilot watershed program.
In line with the takeover of project services by Government (para. 4.02),
all of these posts would be phased out by the end of the fourth year of the
project.
Settlement Development Agency
4.05      The pilot development program for large-scale testing of
semi-mechanized rainfed agriculture at Kurtun Waarey and Sablaale (para
3.13) would continue to be carried out by the Settlement Development Agency
which is under the Ministry of Agriculture.  These arrangements were
confirmed at negotiations.
On-farm Conservation Works
4.06      The works would be organized and carried out by the project under
the existing arrangements used in the first project. The bunds constructed
would be identical to those successfully constructed under the first
project. Maintenance of the bunds is the responsibility of the farmer and
to assist in this function, scraper boards would be made available through
the input supply system. In addition, terracing, contour ridging, on-farm
shelter wind-breaks and agro-forestry activities would be introduced
following practices described in the soil and water conservation annex of
the consultants preparation report (Annex 6, Report No. 31-0297 R14, Volume
2) The construction teams would be decentralized in the three main
Districts of Hargeisa, Gebiley and Boorama with subcenters at Arabsiyo and
possibly Dila. Actual on-farm interventions would depend on the degree of
slope, rainfall regime, local experience and farmers' choice. Under the
project alternative methods of construction, including use of different
equipment such as border discs would be tried out.
4.07      The existing aerial cover (RAF 1952) is obsolete for planning
purposes. A new aerial survey, funded from the proceeds of the PPF; would
be carried out before the start-up of the second phase. The survey would
cover a plateau area of about 300,000 ha on a 1:25,000 scale. Based on
this new aerial cover, a topographical map of the cultivated area (60,000
ha at a 1:10,000 scale) would be prepared by photogrammetric plotting.
After mapping is completed, a three dimensional model would be constructed
for planning of watershed control and for demonstration at public meetings
with farmers.



- 21 -
4.08      Following completion of aerial photography, mapping and
modelling, additional consultant services, also funded from the procei'!a of
the PPF, would carry out detailed surface evaluation to choose manageable
watershed(s)5/ for pilot work. They would define appropriate techniques
and physicalTy survey and peg the watershed taking into consideration the
factors of rainfall/runoff, topography and soil. Apart from mechanical
interventions, the reintroduction of herbaceous cover would also be
essential. This would require forward planning for the production of
appropriate seedling species (nurseries) and also require the active
approval and cooperation of neighboring clans whose common land use rights
(mainly grazing) would be involved. The actual works to be undertaken
cannot be determined until mapping is available and the pilot catchment
area has been selected. Estimated costs have been determined from a pilot
area of 14,200 ha situated in Gebiley-Arabsiyo which was evaluated by the
consultants to the first project. Details of proposed soil and water
conservation measures are described and costed in report No. 31.0297 K14 -
Volume 2.
4.09      The study would require in the first instance specialists in land
use planning, watershed management and topograhical surveying. Their
recommendations would need to be discussed with villages/clans to gain
their acceptance. Approval in principle needs to be obtained from the
concerned communities for exclusion of livestock during the development
phase and for controlled use after establishment in the pilot area(s).
Meetings have already taken place with farmers in the three major districts
(Hargeisa, Gebiley and Boorama). There is a very close working
rel.tionship between the project staff and the farmers built up under the
first project which would form a firm basis for working with the concerned
tribes and clans involved in the catchments when selected. In addition,
the project would obtain the services of an experienced local social
worker/sociologist who would be an integral part of the team. The program
would be under the direction of the soil conservation officer with the
assistance of a surveyor and implemented by the four teams involved with
the on-farm bunding works.
Small Irrigated Farm Development
4.10      In addition to the 20 one-hectare irrigated farms developed under
the first project, fifty new one-hectare farms would be developed in areas
where known water supplies exist and in other areas where the exploratory
drilling undertaken during the first project indicated adequate supplies in
association with suitable soils and reasonable access.   As in the case of
the first project allocation of irrigated farms would be decided by a
committee consisting of the District Commissioner, the PMU general manager
and the horticultural extension officer. Selection would be on the basis
of experience/practical ability, family labor availability, financial
status, known responsibility and need. Under the project, the
51 Most watersheds in the north-west region are so large and
eroded as to defy control or rehabilitation without major
engineering. This would be outside the scope of the
present project.



- 22 -
rehabilitation of wells or water supplies on the existing irrigated farms
would also be carried out. For the new farms, development would, as under
the first project, consist of land clearing, levelling, construction of
main and lateral water delivery channels, borders, basins, drop structures,
channel lining, pipes, sprinklers, and drainage as are considered
appropriate to each farm. In the case of the water supply, emphasis would
be given to attempts to find alternatives to hand dug shallow wells which
are costly to construct. Water delivery would be done by 7 hp diesel
engine and centrifugal pump which have the capacity to meet an annual water
demand of 15,000 m3/ha at a head of 10 m. Alternative wind and solar
driven methods and further design alternatives would be explored. Under
the PPF short-term technical assistance for those investigations has been
provided. As water tables in the potential irrigable areas are high, low
lift pumping equipment would mainly be used. The main crops would be
citrus, papaya, and a wide range of vegetables of which onions and potatoes
would be predominant.
Project Advisory Services and Training Facilities
4.11      A nucleus service of advisory staff was established during the
first project for both rainfed farming areas and also for irrigated farms.
Some of the existing staff have been trained abroad, and all have been
trained by the consultants or by the recruited experts of the PHU. Farmer
training has been carried out using the facilities at the rainfed research
farm at Aburin and the horticultural station at Geed-Deeble.
Demonstrations have also been conducted on contact farms and at regular
farmers' meetings. Some use has also been made of newspaper bulletins and
the radio. These efforts would continue with the application of a more
systematic extension methodology based on the T and V system, which has
been adopted by the MOA as Somalia's extension approach.
4.12      Both the rainfed and irrigated extension services would be
expanded and would serve farmers benefitting from both the first and second
projects. The rainfed and irrigated services would each be headed by an
internationally recruited extension and training officer, who would also
have responsibility for research activity and be understudied by a national
deputy. The rainfed service would be divided into five teams, each team
being supervised by a group leader and consisting of five extension
agents. This would enable regular contact to be maintained by the group
leader with the extension agents. A regular program of scheduled visits
would be established and supervised through the group leader. Each agent
would serve about 300 families. The irrigated service would also be
divided into five teams. The team would consist of an assistant
horticultural extension officer, extension agent and nursery technician.
Each team would serve approximately 90 families.
4.13      Messages for extension in rainfed areas would concentrate
primarily on soil and moisture conservation methods, maintenance of bunds
with hand tools and planting of wind breaks. General principles of crop
husbandry would also form part of the extension program. The irrigated
team would continue to give technical and material support to existing and
newly developed farms through the improvement of wells and irrigation



- 23 -
networks and by extending improved agricultural practices and advice in
plant protection and fertilizer use. Advice would also be given on
marketing possibilities of crop choices within the limits feasible.
4.14      The National Extension Service (NES), supported under the
Agricultural Extension and Farm Management Training Project (Credit
905-SO), is currently providing a limited extension service in the
north-west region. However, it has been assessed that it is impossible at
present for NES headquarters staff to provide the supervision needed to
ensure effective operations in this part of Somalia, although NkS can and
does play a valuable role by providing pre-service orientation and in
service training in Mogadishu for new field extension agents for the area.
It was agreed at negotiations that the PMU would be responsible for
extension services within the project area and that proposals for transfer
to NES of this responsibility would be decided on at the mid-term review
(para. 3.33).
Research
4.15      Rainf ed.  Trials at the Aburin experimental farm would
concentrate on soil and moisture conservation techniques, both mechanized
and with animal draft, and on improving sorghum and maize production by
variety testing and relevant agronomy and plant protection trials. The
station would provide necessary facilities and support to the National
Sorghum Research Program, part financed by the International Development
Research Center and based at Baidoa in southern Somalia. The station would
also intensify work on testing a range of alternative crops including
fodder and forage production and on soil fertility restoration (para.
4.20). Station staff would liaise closely with extension on trial results
and receive feedback on farmer problems that need research. They would
also conduct a joint and intensive program of adapative trials on farmers
fields. The station would also be available for initial multiplication of
crop seeds of newly recommended varieties.
4.16      Irrigated.  Work would concentrate on the improved use of water
and distribution methods, the introduction of new fruits and vegetables and
the demonstration of cropping methods, disease control, pruning and
multiple cropping. In addition, basic stocks of fruit trees would be
propagated for sale.
4.17      The two heads of extension and training would coordinate the
research programs and decide upon work priorities. They would also
interpret the results, in consultation with the MOA research department,
and ensure that only tested technologies are passed on for extension to the
project farmers.
Input Supply
4.18      To overcome the almost total lack of supply of farm inputs,
ox-drawn equipment and irrigation equipment, the project would establish an
input supply system in conjunction with private retailers/wholesalers. The
PMU has already developed satisfactory procurement and stocking procedures
for project supplies and spare parts and these would ensure adequate
controls for the development of the input supply function. The PMU would



- 24 -
purchase mainly, from overseas, equipment and inputs which would be
initially stocked in the former ADC warehouse in Hargeisa which has been
transferred to the project. The P-MU would enter into contractual
arrangements with retailers/wholesalers for onward sales for cash. The
contract would specify the modus operandi and financial arrangements,
including profit margins. Initially, outlets would be limited to the main
towns. It would be a condition of disbursement of the input supplies
category that these contractual arrangements had been completed in a manner
satisfactory to the Association.
4.19      Sales of annual farm inputs would be on a cash basis to
farmers. However, purchases of ox-drawn equipment and irrigation pumpsets
may be restricted due to lack of suitable credit. Therefore, arrangements
have been worked out with 8DB to set up a credit revolving fund for medium
term credit. The cash proceeds from these sales would be utilized in he
credit revolving fund, which would be opened no later than December 31,
1985.   Details of the scheme were agreed upon at negotiations.  This
component of the project would require detailed supervision and would be
reported on separately in the annual work program (Annex 4). Modifications
and proposals for its future operation, especially in response to the
future foreign exchange needs, would be agreed upon at the mid-term
review. (para 3.33).
Integration of Crop and Livestock Production
4.20      The first project has been concerned almost entirely with
improving crop production primarily by soil and water conservation. The
stage of arable development has now been reached when cultural practices on
bunded land would play an increasing role in improving yields, including
the maintenance and improvement of soil fertility. Although the region's
livestock are in part nomadic or transhumant, many animals are present in
the project area throughout the year. The project would, therefore, seek
ways to use the large livestock population to help build up fertility
within the arable lands and examine the role livestock play in watershed
ecology. The project would examine the farming system in the area to
identify livestock production constraints, and ways in which livestock
could best be used to promote soil fertility. These would include:
(a) Establishment of forage crops in the fallow period of the
rotation. The practice would prevent wind blown soil erosion,
provide fodder to livestock to be kept on the land, and in the
case of leguminous forages add nitrogen to the soil;
(b) Night paddocking of animals on fallow during the 6-9 months prior
to opening for crop production, so as to improve fertility and
graze out the grass cover on that land;
(c) Application of manure to crops and small irrigated gardens; and
(d) Conservation of fodder grown during the wet season for dry season
feeding on arable land.



- 25 -
4.21      These techniques, while successful elsewhere in similar
environments, have not been tested in the project area. The project would
therefore establish a program to test them and other practices as
identified by conducting trials on small areas of land belonging to
cooperating farmers, and in some instances on the project trial farm at
Aburin.
Annual Work Program
4.22      The annual work program, which would cover all project
components, would be a key project implementation mechanism (Annex 4). It
would include:
(a) a review of project implementation in the current year;
(b) detailed description of the work to be carried out in the
forthcoming year including objectives, deployment of staff and
equipment;
(c) requirement for additional staff, equipment and other inputs;
Cd) a budget; and
(e) a financing plan including foreign and local currency
requirements and budgetary support from Government.
The annual work program would enable the PNC to review progress, scrutinize
forthcoming programs and provide the necessary budgetary and other support
needed for the project. The annual work program would be submitted to the
FMC by October 1 and to IDA, IFAD and SEC by November 1 each year for
acceptance, to cover the ensuing financial year beginning January 1.
initial work programs would be prepared within two months of signing of the
credit. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
Monitoring, Evaluation and keporting
4.23      Monthly accounting, quarterly reporting and annual budgets are
already satisfactorily established and in operation under the first
project. These procedures would continue in effect. In addition, the PMU
would also prepare a project completion report no later than six months
after the completion of the project. Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations. All project components would be monitored by the
Planning and Evaluation department of the PMU to provide management with a
continuing assessment of the progress made in achieving project object-
ives. The monitoring and evaluation unit would be headed by a local
socio/economist and assisted by a short-term internationally recruited
monitoring and evaluation specialist. The unit would collect and process
data into a form usable by project management for assessing whether
schedules and targets set out in the project are being met, quantifying
changes from the baseline over the project period and introducing changes
in project interventions when it is necessary. For data collection, the
monitoring and evaluation unit would work in collaboration with the
extension agents and soil conservation staff as investigators to monitor
physical progress in project implementation. The monitoring and evaluation



- 26 -
unit would gradually build up a system for gathering information on the
variables affecting farmer incomes. Such variables include farm practice,
crop production, input supplies, marketing channels available to the
farmers, yield levels, production constraints and indicators of performance
of the institutions serving farmers. The general manager, with the
assistance from tne financial controller, would supervise the work of the
monitoring and evaluation unit and would establish a system for
comaunicating results to IDA, IIAD, .EEU, MOA and the National Monitoring
and Evaluation Section in the Ministry of Planning.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, PRICES, FAKMERfS BENEFITS AND
RECOVERY OF PROJECT COST
Production and Yields
5.01      Rainfed Agriculture.  Farm size varies between 2 to 20 ha.
According to a survey conducted by the project in December 1983, the
area under crop for unbunded land varies from 1.7 ha to 2.5 ha and for
bunded land from 3.2 ha to 6.2 ha. Sorghum is grown on about three
quarters of the cropped area and maize, on one quarter. Straw is a
valuable fodder. Under the project, 5% of the farm area would be occupied
by bunds, but the decrease in arable area would be more than offset by
increased production due to moisture conservation. The cropping pattern
would not change under the project, but the area under cultivation would
increase by about 50% which is consistent with changes in land use observed
under the first project. Table 5 slmmarizes the expected cropred area,
yields and additional production expected from the farms protected under
the second project.
5.02      Yields are based on sample field measurements of the unbunded and
bunded lands in the three main areas of Hargeisa, Gebiley and Boorama over
the four years 1980 through 1983. There is significant variation not only
between but within these areas. However, the average annual percentage
increase from the measurements made within the three areas has been in the
range of 55 to 78 between unbunded and bunded lands. No additional
benefits, for either phase one or two project farms from investments in
research and extension have been assumed (paras. 5.09 and 6.03).
5.03      Small Irrigated Farms.  On the 50 one-ha irrigated farms to be
developed under the project, citrus fruit (mainly oranges) would be grown
on 0.75 ha, papaya on 0.05 ha and potatoes and onions would be double
cropped on the remaining 0.2 ha. Citrus trees would commence fruiting in
the fourth year after planting and increase to full maturity in the eighth
year. Yields are based on existing results from small irrigated gardens in
the north-west region and have been assumed as 7.5 tons/ha for oranges and
onions and 15 tons/ha for potatoes at full development. Total production
of fruit is estimated at 350 tons and of vegetables at 225 tons. No
additional benefits, for either phase one or two project farms, from the
investments in research, extension and input supplies have been included
(para. 6.03).

Markets and Prices
5.04      There is a considerable deficit between production and
consumption of cereals in the region (about 40% in 1981). The food deficit
has a marked effect on prices. ADC despite having the sole legal
responsibility for marketing of cereals, has purchased little of the
production in the region over the last few years. The majority of the
production is consumed on farm. An unknown quantity is marketed through
informal private channels. It is only recently that Government has
permitted private sector involvement in grain marketing and this would
provide satisfactory marketing outlets to enable farmers to dispose of
their production surplus. The region would remain in deficit on cereals
even with the estimated incremental production from the additional bunded
rainfed area under the project. Further increases in total production are
expected from the introduction of technical packages when tested but these
have not been included (para. 6.03).
5.05      In 1983 the fixed and free market prices for sorghum were So.Sh.
3,050 and 8,000/ton, respectively. Prices used in the financial analysis
are sorghum--So.Sh. 7,000 per ton; Maize--So.Sh. 5,400 and Straw--So.Sh.
900. Border prices in the economic analysis for traded items, sorghum and
maize, were derived on an import parity basis using World Bank January 1984
commodity prices. A quality premium adjustment of 25Z was made for sorghum



- 28 -
to allow for the difference between the variety grown locally for human
consumption and the international traded sorghum which is primarily used as
livestock feed. Prices are expressed in 1985 constant terms.
5.06      The market for fruit and vegetables in the region is concentrated
essentially in the main towns. The present level of consumption for fresh
fruits and vegetables is about 11 kg per capita per year, but up to 50 kg
in the families with relatively high income. Present production is
estimated to satisfy about 75X of the region's estimated consumption of
6,500 tons. The produce is marketed by private traders in the open market
place and through small shops in the towns. The products are not graded,
packed or weighed. Although the project would attempt to provide
assistance to farmers in the basics of marketing, there would be no attempt
to change the present marketing system.
5.07      There is a relatively large market in Djibouti for fresh fruit
and vegetables. Present consumption is estimated at about 8,000 tons of
which only about 1UZ is of local origin. Imports are primarily from
Ethiopia with France and Kenya supplying the higher quality end of the
market. Although a small amount of exportation from Somalia, limited
primarily to watermelons and citrus fruits, has been made, the bad road
conditions would make it very difficult for Somalia at this point in time
to exploit this market. Exports of fruits an4 vegetables are not expected
to increase under this project but future production surpluses would need
to find markets in neighboring countries.
5.08      Supply is less than demand in eleven months of the year and
domestic prices are consequently high but also fairly stable. There alre do
true wholesalers and prices are fixed unilaterally by the middleman. tihe
prices used in the financial analysis are based on data of the Hargeisa
market collected by the PMU during 1982 and 1983 and adjusted to farmgate.
In the economic analysis, prices of oranges, potatoes and onions were
calculated on the basis of import parity using World Bank January 1984
commodity price for oranges and FAO Trade Year Book 1981 prices ex US port
for potatoes and onions. The local market price has been assumed for
papayas. Prices are expressed in 1985 constant terms.
karmer benefits
5.u9      Kainfed Agriculture.  The farm budget for a dryland farm, based
on data from the first project postulates that the farm household
incremental income from crop production--inclusive of on-farm consumption
and farmers own labor--is about So.Sh. 12,530 (US$480) annually. As a
result of the project, this would increase at full development in year
seven to about So.Sh. 33,170 (US$1,260). The net incremental cash income
takes into account all costs of production, on-farm consumption,
maintenance of bunds and the payments to Treasury for 50% recovery of the
investments in the soil and conservation works (para. 5.11). Increased
straw production would be consumed on the farm and has been priced at So.Sh
9UU/ton which ignores the possibility of increased livestock
benefits--which have not been quantified. The increased production
included in the farm budget would be due to bunding only, and no account
has been taken of the possible effect of the investments in research and
extension, as the level at which farmers would benefit from these services



- 29 -
is yet to be determined. The introduction of technical measures and
availability of inputs and equipment could bring about substantial
increases in yields of sorghum and maize. The financial rate of return
over a lU-year period on the total investment in soil and conservation
works is estimated at 31Z. Uetails of the farm budget are given in Annex
2, Table 1.
5.10      Small Irrigated Farmers.  At full maturity in year 8, annual farm
household income from the one-hectare irrigated farm is estimated to be
about So.Sh. 81,120 (US$3,090), inclusive of So.Sh. 13,000 imputed costs
for the farmer's own labor and management services. However, the farmers
annual net inflow would fluctuate considerably due to payments to SDi for
equipment on credit, to the Treasury for land preparation and cash payments
for replacement pumpsets and tools. The financial rate of return ove- a
15-year period on the total investment for the farm development is
estimated at 18%. Details of the farm budget are given in Annex 2,
Table 2.
Cost Recovery
5.11      To collect data and provide the Somalia Treasury Department with
the intormation required for cost recovery, the PHU would maintain a cost
recovery unit in its accounting division. The unit would compile annually
the costs of soil and water conservation works on dryland farms and those
of the PMU and individual farm details of the amount of works constructed.
The costs for the pilot catchment control, together with technical
assistance attributed to this work, would not be recovered. As these works
would be carried out on land with common usage, benefits from them could
not be allocated in a meaningful manner to the various beneficiaries. Cost
recovery under the project would be similar to that agreed under the first
phase, and would be set at 50% of the total of direct bunding costs and
appropriate PAU overhead charges of 20Z.  Based on estimated project costs,
the initial linear meter charge would be So.Sh. 15.46 (Annex 2, Table 3).
In addition, the scheme would be amended to include an initial down payment
of 25Z with repayments over five years including a grace period of two
years during which only interest would be paid. Interest would be charged
at 1 p.a., which is the present interest rate in Somalia for medium-term
agricultural loans. An assessment of the scheme would be an integral part
of the mid-term review (para. 3.33). Any revisions to the rates to be
charged would be considered at that time. Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations.
5.12      The land development charges for the small irrigated farms would
be recovered by the Somali Treasury Department on a similar basis to the
on-farm works for dryland farms. The land development charges would be
estimated in advance and cost recovery would be 50Z as is applicable to
dryland farms. The farmer would be required to make a down payment of 25%
and repayments would also be over five years including a grace period of
two years during which only interest would be paid. Interest would be
cnarged at 11% p.a. Any difference between actual and estimated costs of
development would be adjusted in the fourth year. All irrigation equipment



- 30 -
and tools would be provided on credit through the SUB and cost recovery
would be 100x. Terms would be a down payment of 25X with the balance over
7 years with a two year grace period during whlch only interest would be
paid. Interest would be charged at 11% p.a. Aasurances to this effect
were obtained at negotiations.
Government Cash Flow
5.13      The Government cash flow is set out in Annex 2, Table 5.  This
shows that the net inflow on sales of farm inputs from retailers/
wholesalers and medium credit through the SDB would mobilize So.Sh. 79
million from the private sector and with a further So.Sh. 100 million in
cost recovery from the farmers there would be a favorable impact on
limiting outflow of Government funds for project implementation. Over the
first ten years Government's cash outflows would exceed inflows by So.Sh.
25 million or an average of So.Sh. 2.5 million per year, which represents a
modest outflow in relationship to the economic benefits and the regional
development.
VI.  ECONOMIC BkNEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Benefits
6.01      The project would increase production of sorghum, maize, fruits
and vegetables, thus helping to relieve part of the region's deficit. At
tull development (year 10), the net annual incremental benefits (1985
constant prices) would be about So.Sh. 90 million (US$3.4 million).
6.02      The project would help reduce existing levels of under and
unemployment. Project beneficiaries in the total project area (phase I and
11) for the dryland farms are all small-scale subsistence farmers
comprising about 42,000 persons and for the irrigated farms about 3,000
persons. In addition, the project would provide full-time and seasonal
employment to about 60W persons and further employment opportunities would
be created through the input supply and marketing operations.
6.03      The second phase project would expand the benefits to an
increasing percentage of the regions population, continue the process of
institution building to sustain the provision of services to farmers and
involve private sector participation in input supply and marketing. Other
unquantified benefits not included in the economic analysis are increased
sorghum and maize yields from the introduction of improved farming
practices, increased yields from the existing irrigated small farms,
livestock benefits from increased straw production, the arresting of soil
erosion and improvements in groundwater supplies. It would further evolve
the possibilities for the development of appropriate technologies capable
of assisting this type of marginal agriculture.



- 31 -
6.04      The associated costs of rainfed research and extension and half
the irrigated research and extension have been excluded as have the
benefits that could accrue from the introduction of new technical
packages. It has been estimated that an economic rate of return of 25Z
could be achieved on these investments from an additional 5% yield increase
from dryland and irrigated farm production.
Economic Analysis
b.05      The economic rate of return is estimated to be 16% (Annex 3,
Tables 3-5). This is based on about 80% of total project costs. The
associated costs ot rainfed research and extension, half the irrigated
research and extension and the semi-mechanized rainfed agricultural
development have been excluded (para. 6.U4).
6.Ub      The main assumptions used in the economic analysis were:
(a) Project Life. The economic life of the project is assumed to be
20 years. Replacements of project assets with economic lives
shorter than the period are included.
(b) Prices. Border prices for traded items are derived on an import
parity basis using the -World Bank Commodity Price Forecasts
(January 1984)" and where not available, on quoted world market
or local prices. Non-traded items are expressed in local
currency and converted to border prices by applying a standard
conversion factor of 0.5252, reflecting a shadow rate of exchange
of US$1 - So.Sh. 50. The going market wage rates of So.Sh. 50
per day equivalent was applied to all hired and farm family
labor.
6.07      To determine which variables would be most crucial to the
projectts success, sensitivity analysis was carried out using crossover
values. The results were that costs would have to be increased by 53%, or
benefits decreased by 34%, for the net present value of the project
discounted at 10% to be zero.
Risks
6.08      kisks associated with the project have been minimized to a large
degree through the first phase project by introducing low-risk farm
development and through detailed feasibility studies. The major risks for
project implementation concern security in the region and staff
continuity. Security problems have diminished but such risks in this area
of Somalia cannot be excluded. Management and discontinuity of service of
key personnel and technicians has always been of concern. Under the first
project, salary incentives, housing, training and the morale development
have been used to good effect to provide stability in the PffU and these
would continue to be provided ---der the second phase. Gaps would be filled
if they arise by employment or short-term specialists.

VI1. RECOiMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) The qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment of internationally recruited experts and consultants
would be acceptable to IDA and IFAD (para. 3.24);
(b) Additional IDA/IFAD disbursements to the special accounts would
be subject to Government's timely replenishment of the Project's
account (para 3.28);
(c) The project would maintain its accounting system in accordance
with sound and generally recognized accounting practices and
principles, and have such accounts audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association and furnish them to the
Association within six months of the close of the financial year
(para. 3.30);
(d) A mid-term review would be held with cofinanciers not later than
June 30, 19Y8 and that the subsequent implementation plans would
be subject to IDA, IFAD and EEG approval (para. 3.33);

agricultural development at Kurtun Waarey and Sablaale would
continue to be carried by the Settlement Development Agency
(para 4.U5)
(f)  The PMU would be responsible for extension services within the
project area and that proposals for the transfer to the National
Extension Service of this responsibility would be decided upon at
the mid-term review (para. 4.14);
(g) A credit revolving fund to provide medium term credit would be
opened in the Somali Development Bank, no later than December 31,
1985 (para 4.19);
(h) The project would prepare annual work programs and submit them to
IDA, IFAD and EEC for acceptance by November 1 each year. The
inital work program would be prepared and furnished within two
months of signing of the loan (para 4.22);
(i) Government would ensure that the PHU continued the regular
monthly and quarterly reporting established under the first
project and, in addition, would prepare a project completion
report no later than six months after the completion of the
project (para 4.23); and
(j) 'ihe revisions to the cost recovery schemes for the rainfed and
irrigated works for the second phase would be implemented (para
5.11 and 5.1Z).



- 33 -
7.U2      Condition of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) Funds from the EEC financing agreement were available (para
3.16);
(b) An initial payment of So.Sh. 6,000,000 had been made by
Government into the project's imprest account (para 3.28); and
(c) The special accounts in foreign exchange in the project's name
with the Central Bank had been opened (para 3.Z2).
7.03      Condition of disbursement of the input supply category would be
that appropriate contractual arrangements for handling the inputs had beeu
completed by the project with wholesalers/retailers in Hargeisa (para
4. I ).
7.04      With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA credit on standard terms of US$10.6 million. The
borrower would be the Government of Somalia.

C. Recurrent Cost Financing
Background
1.        There is a widespread consensus that the problem of recurrent
cost financing has become a serious problem for government policy makers in
the developing world. The recurrent cost problem refers to the fact that
available budgetary resources may be tightly containe:l in future years,
thus limiting the capacity of future budgets to finance the recurrent cost
of investment projects under consideration today. Failure by governments
to explicitly take account of the recurrent cost implications of projects
at the time these are evaluated and implemented, may lead to insufficient
funds to finance their operations and maintenance at the time of their
completion.



-66- 65NEX 5
Page 6
2.   The emergence of this problem in part reflects the fact that the
momentum of development investment in some countries has engendered a
demand for recurrent expenditure for operations and maintenance that has
outstripped the availability of funds, given the host of other policy
commitments.  In other cases, tbh  failure of the planning and budgeting
process to take account of the recurrent cost implications of investments
has led to inadequate recurrent budgetary allocations for particular
projects, even when the funds are in principle available.
Objectives
3.        The objective of the proposed study is to examine various
approaches to the problem and indicate possible ways of dealing with it.
In general, the study should explore the types of issues that the
government would have to consider in taking account of the recurrent cost
problem, and examine the reforms that are needed in the budgeting and
planning process in order to more adequately take account of the recurrent
cost implications of projects.
4.   Reforms are required at various points in the process, particularly
those relating to project initiation and evaluaticn within the operating
ministries, project coordination within Planning Ministry, budget
formulation and medium term financial planning within the Ministry of
Finance, and manpower planning within the bureaucracy responsible for
personnel establishment and training.
