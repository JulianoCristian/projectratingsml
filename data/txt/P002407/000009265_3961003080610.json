   facilities.  The project supports:  (a) a four year time\n            slice consisting of the first phase of a seven year program\n            for road network rehabilitation and maintenance; (b) the\n            establishment and strengthening of the Sierra Leone Roads\n            Authority to manage the road network; (c) training and other\n            support to strengthen small domestic contractors including\n            training in labor-intensive methods; (d) promotion of\n            non-motorized transport in rural areas to improve transport\n            services to the poor and assistance to nongovernmental\n            organizations for this purpose; and (e) strengthening\n            transport sector planning."}, "docdt": "1992-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
