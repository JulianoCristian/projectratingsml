Lessons drawn from the project implementation suggest\n            that, in spite of difficult conflict situations, such as the\n            case in Sierra Leone, motivated institutions, and staff do\n            succeed in creating the structure to achieve project\n            objectives, as illustrated by the benefit of the \"green\n            field\" approach, where new institutions were firmly\n            established. It is particularly important to note that, in\n            order to consolidate progress in institutional development\n            (to be strengthened by additional funding for road\n            rehabilitation, and maintenance as needed), the\n            implementation of a follow-up project - Transport Sector\n            Project - became paramount, given the context of the country\n            at that time. However, the Sierra Leone Roads Authority\n            (SLRA) Act separating the Road Fund from the Ministry of\n            Works, though an improvement over previous arrangements,\n            would have better improved transparency, and accountability,\n            had the Road Fund's resource mobilization been\n            separated from the SLRA operations. The report also\n            reinforces that in recurrent civil strife, contracts should\n            be as small as possible to avoid lengthy implementation time\n            between bidding, and works completion."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
