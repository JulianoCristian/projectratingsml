the Association and to Mr. Mbindyo's letter dated March 9, 1990, requesting
an amendment to the abovementioned Project to provide for retroactive
financing of up to $300,000.
      This letter is to inform you of our agreement to your request and to
propose the following amendments to the Development Credit Agreement.

to read as in the attachment to this letter.
      2.    Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement is amended to read

            withdrawals shall be made in respect of payments made for
            expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement, except that
            withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not exceeding the
            equivalent of $300,000, may be made in respect of Category (3)
            on account of payments made for expenditures before that date
            but after April 1, 1989."
