Secondly, the\n            project will support GOI's efforts to develop long-term\n            management policies. The main components of the project are:\n            (a) systematic registration of 1.2 million parcels in ten\n            districts in Java, relying on special systematic\n            adjudication teams capitalizing on economies of scale,\n            cadastral surveying by private firms, utilization of new\n            technology such as global positioning systems (GPS), and\n            dissemination of information to the public; (b) development\n            of a database of land laws and regulations, and assistance\n            to GOI's program for reviewing and drafting land laws\n            and regulation; (c) long-term development of the Land\n            National Agency's (BPN's) institutional capacity\n            for land administration, mostly through support to\n            BPN's training and education units, training,\n            scholarships and studies on ways to improve tenure security\n            for customary (adat) land rights; and (d) an integrated\n            program of studies, seminars and workshops on selected topic\n            areas in land management while improving inter-agency\n            coordination and drawing on international experience."}, "docdt": "1994-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
