INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRE(:TORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN l'O
THE REPUBLIC ROAD FUND OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic Road Fund of Bosnia-HerzegovLna with the guarantee of the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the equivalent of US$30.0 million
to help finance a sixth highway project. The loan would have a term of 23
years, including three and a half years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 per-
cent per annum. US$1.6 million of the proceeds of the loan would be relent,
on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, to the road organizations
of the various Socialist Republics and Autonomous Provinces of Yugoslavia
participating in the technical assistance components of the project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in November 1972; its
report entitled "The Economic Development of Yugoslavia" (R74-1) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 2, 1974. An economic updating
mission visited the country in October 1973 and its findings are reflected
in this report. Basic data on the economy are given in Annex I.
Economic Trends and Development Issues
3.        The Yugoslav economy has experienced rapid growth and significant
structural change during the past two decades. GDP at constant prices in-
creased by about 5.5 percent per year and per capita GDP by over 4.5 percent
per year. Average per capita GDP is estimated at around US$900 (1973). The
number of people engaged in agriculture has decreased both absolutely and as
a percentage of the labor force, while the number engaged in industry and
services has correspondingly increased. However, nearly half of the labor
force is still engaged in agriculture, most of it on small private farms.
Industry accounts for 23 percent and services for 26 percent of the labor
force.
4.        Economic development has taken place during a transition from a
centrally planned to a largely market-oriented economy, aimed at evolving
an economic system characterized by efficiency and social justice. Workers'
self-management and decentralization of decision-making are key characteris-
tics. The economic reforms of 1965 and the constitutional changes implemented



in 1971, were important landmarks in the evolution. Increased reliance on
the market mechanism and the openiing-up of the economy to international trade
were important policy objectives in the pursuit of efficiency.
5.        The leading role in economic and social development has been played
by the social sector, which includes government, large scale enterprises and
institutions such as libraries, hospitals, theaters, schools, and which accounts
for 85 percent of the GDP and employs over half of the total labor force.   All
the enterprises and institutions are under workers' self-management and re-
sources are under social ownership. There is a private sector predominantly
comprised of peasant farms (with a 10 hectare limit on land holdings), and in-
cluding small enterprises (with a 5 person limit on the number of non-family
workers), mainly in handicraft, construction, transport and tourism. In the
past the private sector has been relatively neglected by government policy.
However, the government has lately been devoting more attention to the private
sector in agriculture with a view to accelerating the growth of agricultural
production.
6.        Despite a policy of fostering accelerated growth in the less-de-
veloped regions, there are major differences in the levels of development
among republics. The more-developed regions are located in the north and
include 65 percent of the population. But this area includes sizeable
pockets of poverty, particularly in private agriculture. The less-developed
regions are in the south and are generally more mountainous and less densely
populated. This makes agriculture and transportation more difficult. The
southern regions are rich in minerals, coal and hydro-power generating po-
tential. The development of these resources has provided the major stimulus
for growth.
7.        Although the economy of the less--developed regions has been grow-
ing at almost the same rate as the more advanc-ed areas, per capita income
has lagged behind because of faster population growth (1.6 percent per year
as compared with 0.7 percent in the more-developed regions). Consequently,
regional inequalities have widened. Average per capita GDP in the less-
developed regions now amounts to about 50 percent of that of the rest of
the country. Yugoslavia's development policy aims at reducing regional in-
equalities by transferring investment funds from the more advanced to the
less--developed regions. In 1972 these transfers amounted to almost US$300
millior., about one-third of the less-developed regions' investment expenditure.
8.        In addition to significant regional income differences there are
substantial sectoral income differences. For example, per capita GDP in
private agriculture in Kosovo (by far the poorest region), is just over US$100
or about one-ninth of the national average. IMany private farmers there sup-
plement their incomes by working in the social sector but are not able to
maintain an adequate standard of living. Although incomes in private agri-
culture are somewhat higher in other parts of the country, they remain far
below those obtaining in non-agricultural activities.
9.        On the whole Yugoslavia has been relatively successful in tackling
its employment problem. This is the result of the combination of relatively



- 3-
slow growth of the labor force (about 0.8 percent per year), fairly rapid in-
crease in social sector employment (averaging about 2.9 percent per year since
1968) and a high level of migration of workers to Western Europe in the second
half of the 1960s. There is still, however, a significant degree of "surplus"
labor mainly in peasant agriculture. An important feature of the present em-
ployment problem arises from a growing regional imbalance between labor de-
mand and supply with the underdeveloped regions possessing labor surpluses
and the developed regions facing the prospect of growing labor scarcities.
Recent Developments
10.       Rapid economic growth since 1968 was accompanied by inflation and
balance of payments problems. Moreover many enterprises experienced finan-
cial difficulties primarily as a result of over-zealous investment programs
and a lack of financial discipline. To counter inflation and improve the
external payments position the Government, in 1972 and 1973, adopted meas-
ures aimed at restricting monetary expansion. limiting public expenditures,
temporarily strengthening price controls, reciucing the growth of personal
incomes, improving the financial structure of enterprises, and imposing
limitations on external borrowing. In addition, to neutralize the infla-
tionary pressure on the balance of payments, the dinar was devalued by 16.6
percent in January 1971, and again by 18.8 percent in December 1971. Since
July 1973 the dinar has been floating.
11.       As a result of these measures exports increased rapidly in 1972
and 1973 and imports stagnated. Aided by a sharp rise in workers' remit-
tances, up 36 percent in 1972, the current account showed a surplus of about
US$420 million in 1972, the first surplus since 1965. A surplus is also ex-
pected for 1973, although not as large as in 1972. Foreign exchange reserves
have risen from the equivalent of about one month's merchandise imports in
1971, to nearly 6 months at present. There has been no slowdown in the rate
of inflation, however, and most prices continue to rise at the rate of 15-20
percent per year.
12.       While the restrictive measures have been successful in improving
the external payments position and the financial situation of enterprises,
they have reduced economic growth. Real GDP increased by only 4.4 percent
in 1972 as against 8.8 percent in 1971; for 1973 real economic growth is
estimated at about 5 percent.
13.       The Social Development Plan for 1971-75 projected an average GDP
growth of 7.5 percent per year. This was considered feasible if the domes-
tic stabilization measures were successful. A lower growth rate of between
5 and 6 percent per year would be the minimum acceptable were domestic in-
flationary pressures not contained. While the balance of payments situation
has improved more than was foreseen by the Plan, the continuing inflation,
together with the impact of the international energy problem, suggests tlat
average growth during the Plan will not exceed the minimum acceptable level.



-4-
The Energ'r Sector
14.       On a calorific basis 67 percent of Yugoslavia's energy needs in
1973 were met from domestic sources. Domestically mined coal remains an
important source of fuel. Practically, all thermal power plants are coal
fired. About 39 percent of the oil consumed is of domestic origin. Moreover,
Yugoslavia generates more than half of its electricity from2 hydro plants
despite the fact that hydro capacity has been developed only to about one-
third of its potential. The shortages of eleciricity that are emerging are
not due to the lack of hydro generation potential, coal or oil, but rather
to insufficient plant capacity, delayed constriction and a country-wide
drought which has reduced hydropower output.   Yugoslavia maintains friendly
relations with nearby oil producers, so that il_s oil imports are aEsured.
15.       In spite of Yugoslavia's relatively :Low dependence on imported oil,
increases in the price of oil are bound to affect the government's efforts
to improve the external payments position. In 1973 oil imports amounted to
an estimated US$259 million, or 5.4 percent of goods and services imports.
For 1974 oil import payments will be of the order of US$900 million, at an
average c.i.f. price of US$100 per m.t. (US$13 per barrel), equivalent to
about 15 percent of imports of goods and services. The impact on the balance
of payment will probably be to create a substantial current account de'icit
in 1974 and later years, instead of the surpluses Yugoslavia has enjoyed
recently.
16.       Apart from the adverse balance of payments effect, the indirect
consequences of the world energy crisis are unclear. On the positive side
the heavy reliance on coal and hydropower should improve the country's inter-
national competitive position. On the other hand job opportunities for
Yugoslavs working abroad will diminish if economic growth in Western Europe
slows down. Returning migrant workers would exacerbate unemployment and
housing problems and workers' remittances, which have played a dynamic role
in the economy, may suffer. Moreover, stagnation in economic activity abroad
would affect Yugoslavia's exports. The rise in the cost of automobile and
air transportation may irnfluence tourism unfavorably, although it is also
conceivable that the country would attract tourists who would otherwise have
gone further afield and therefore the tourist sector would gain on balance.
Capital Requirements
17.       Yugoslavia is dependent to a large degree on imported equipment
for its economic development. As a result the country has to borrow sub-
stantial amounts abroad. Gross capital inflows have more than tripled
during the last five years, reaching US$1,250 million in 1973, mostly in
medium-term commercial credit. However, due to rapidly rising amortization
payments, an increase of US$746 million in gross inflows between 1967 and
1972, resulted in an increase in the net inflow of only US$224 million.   The



growing discrepancy between gross and net inflows reflects a shift, follow-
ing the 1965 Economic Reforms, from long-term official loans to medium-term
commercial credits as a result of the limited availability of official capi-
tal and the liberalization of foreign trade and borrowing. The United States,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom
have provided most of the commercial credits. IBRD, the Federal Republic
of Germany, and the USSR have been the principal sources of long-term offi-
cial capital.
18.       Until recently it was thought that much of the foreign exchange
needed to finance imports would come from the growth of workers' remittances.
However, the energy crisis makes it doubtful whether this source will continue
to expand at its previous high rate. Moreover, the Government wishes to limit
the migration of Yugoslav labor abroad. Therefore, the country will need to
maintain a high level of foreign borrowing. Its gross long-term capital re-
quirements are tentatively estimated at around US$2.0 billion per year during
1974-79. Around US$500 million of this may be provided in the form of official
development assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources. The remainder
will come mainly from foreign banks and suppliers. Raising such large sums
will be a formidable challenge, but Yugoslavia's success in the past in ob-
taining the funds it requires from the capital markets, and its continued
good credit standing, give grounds for confidence that it will be able to
obtain the capital inflow required to finance its development efforts.
Creditworthiness
19.       In spite of the present unsettled international conditions, the
prospects for Yugoslavia's continued economic growth during the next decade
are good. The country's endowment of natural and human resources, its rela-
tively low dependence on imported energy sources, its pragmatic approach to
economic problems and its readiness to undertake institutional changes, com-
bine to give grounds for a favorable assessment of future prospects.
20.       External public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as of
December 31, 1972 was US$1,730 million. In addition there was US$1,820
million non-public external debt outstanding. Total (public and non-public)
debt service payments in 1972 were US$859 million (mostly in convertible
currencies) equivalent to 20 percent of foreign exchange earnings (24 per-
cent if the debts and earnings in non-convertible currencies are excluded).
With external borrowing projected at around US$2.0 billion per year during
1974-79, the debt service ratio would remain at about the 1972 level, if ex-
ports grow at 15 percent per annum which seems reasonable in the light of
recent export performance and the increases in international prices of
Yugoslav exports. Taking into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and
the measures taken to control external borrowing, as well as the prospective
growth of production and foreign exchange earnings, Yugoslavia should remain
creditworthy for substantial Bank lending.
21.       High priority projects in Yugoslavia, especially those designed to
improve infrastructure and accelerate development in the less-developed re-
gions, have low foreign exchange components due to the relatively advanced
stage of Yugoslav industry and the competitiveness of Yugoslav contractors.
Were the Bank to confine its lending to the foreign exchange costs of proj-
ects, an adequate contribution to Yugoslavia's external capital needs could



-   -
be made only by spreading the lending over a large number of projects, in-
cluding some of lesser priority, thus restricting the Bank's ability to
provide support for specific structural reforms. It, therefore, seems reason-
able to provide some measure of local expenditure financing in the Bank's
lending program.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPE-1T4UkIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
22.       The Bank has made 26 loans to Yugoslavia totalling about US$798.1
million equivalent. The proposed loan would be the tenth for the transporta-
tion sector (US$394.4) and the sixth for highways, making a total for highways
of US$180 million since the first loan in 1963. Apart from transportation
Bank lending has generally been concentrated on power (three loans totalling
US$135 million), telecommunications (US$40 million) and three multipurpose
projects (totalling US$103 million). Loans have also been made for industry
(seven loans totalling US$95.7 million), tourism (two loans totalling US$30
million) and for an agricultural industries project (US$31 million). This
would be the fourth loan to Yugoslavia during the current financial year.
IFC has made 7 investments totalling about US$70 million in Yugoslavia. Its
most recent operation, a loan (with some equity conversion rights) of US$10
million to the Zelezarna Jesenice/ARMCO joint venture for manufacturing spe-
cial steel, was approved by the Executive Directors on January 29, 1974.
23.       There have been delays in the execution of several projects, partic-
ularly the Railway Modernization Program of FY65 (Loan 395-YU), the Belgrade-
Bar Railway Project of FY68 (Loan 531-YU) and the Babin Kuk Tourism Project
of FY71 (Loan 782-YU). An important reason for the delays was the decentral-
ization of political and economic management in Yugoslavia. The earlier
problems have been exacerbated by financial and technical difficulties, cost
overruns and the shortage of domestic financing.   The Bank has increased its
efforts to deal with these problems, especially by providing assistance to
review the situation of the railways and by increasing the number of supervision
and other missions.  The situation is improving.   Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as at March 31, 1974 and notes
on the execution of on-going projects.
24.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are:   (a) to
accelerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; (b) to
promote agricultural development, particularly in the lagging private sector,
by providing basic infrastructure and credit for the financing of farm devel-
opment, equipment and processing facilities; (c) to promote structural reforms
in major sectors of the economy through improved coordination, the strengthen-
ing of institutions and technical assistance; and (d) to provide Yugoslavia
with long-term external capital and thus help reduce the country's dependence
on short-term external borrowings. These objectives are basically the same
as those which guided lending in previous years, but efforts to give special
support to the less-developed regions and the small farmers in the private
sector are being strengthened.



-7-
25.       To achieve these objectives, loans for industrial credit for small-
and medium-scale industries, further support of railway modernization, expan-
sion of the port facilities of Bar, river regulation, urban pollution control,
roads and highways, power generation and transmission and an oil pipeline are
envisaged during the next two years. Also planned for this period is an agri-
cultural credit project to promote the development of private sector farms,
as well as social sector agriculture. IFC is currently investigat.ng several
new investment opportunities to encourage joint ventures which will provide
technical, management and marketing expertise as well as long-term capital.
26.       In addition, the Bank's technical assistance has included reviews
of the power, tourism and transportation sectors. Other current Bank activ-
ities include EDI assistance for a project appraisal training institution;
assistance with a study of the Yugoslav capital market, which should help
improve resource mobilization and allocation; and help with a training program
for auditors in Yugoslavia's Social Accounting Service, which audits all en-
terprises and government activities, including several Bank-financed projects.
27.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia have averaged close to US$100 million
annually in the last three years. Although this represents only a relatively
small proportion of the country's need for external finance, it is equivalent
to almost one-third of the annual long-term official capital inflow in con-
vertible currencies. Assuming a rising level of Bank lending during the next
five years, the outstanding debt to the Bank could rise from 12 percent of
Yugoslavia's total external debt in 1972, to 19 percent by 1978. Service on
Bank loans as a proportion of total debt service would increase from 4 percent
to 7 percent during the same period.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN YUGOSLAVIA
28.       The development of Yugoslavia's transport system was shaped by the
country's topography. The major routes developed along the Sava-Danube val-
ley in the north and avoided mountains in the central and southern regions.
This influence, together with different historical development between the
northern and southern regions, had resulted by the early twentieth century
in an unbalanced distribution of transport infrastructure: while the northern
regions had already a sound transport system, the system in the southern re-
gions remained underdeveloped.  The transport system was heavily damaged
during the second World War and its reconstruction was a major task during
the first postwar decade. Since then the transport networks have been sub-
stantially expanded, through construction and modernization of the national
trunk routes, both for railways and highways, and through expansion of port
facilities on the Adriatic coast. Today Yugoslavia has a well-diversified
system comprising 10,400 km of railways, 96,000 km of roads, 15 airports,
5 major seaports and a sizeable network of inland waterways. The roads and
railways are the backbone of the transport system, together carrying some 90
percent of the total freight and 95 percent of passenger traffic in 1971.



- a -
29.       In spite of many physical improvements during the last decade, the
development of transport infrastructure, in general, has not been adequate
to meet the rapidly growing demand. Tne railways offer slow service; mar.y
of the roads are below standard; and the capacity of some ports needs to be
expanded. These deficiencies are partly due to the relatively low priority
given to the sector by Government authorities and inadequate investments in
transport infrastructure.   T he administ-ration and development of the sector
have been also arfected by the political and economic decentralization in the
1960's in which the responsibility for the sector was transferred from the
Federal Government to the Republics and Provinces. The regional authorities
could only gradually strengthen their own institutions to meet their respon-
sibility particularly for institutional arrangements for financing the sector.
The decentralization weakened transport administration, coordination and plan-
ning. It also aggravated the difficulties faced by many enterprises in the
sector, particularly the railways, in mobilizing funds for investment.
30.       The economic reforms of the 1960's facilitated the liberalization
of the transport industry. From 1960 to 1970 passenger and freight t-raffic
grew at annual rates of 10 and 7 percent, respectively. While the reforms
encouraged growth, they brought about structural changes.    Passenger and
freight traffic on the roads, benefiting greatly from the liberalization
policies, grew at 21 and 20 percent, respectively, while for railways, the
comparable figures were 0 and 2.5 percent. Today the roads carry 46 percent
and 75 percent of the freight and passenger traffic, respectively, compared
to the railways' 42 and 18 percent.
31.       Th,e Yugoslav system, characterized by "social self-management" by
the economic and social units, has made it difficult in recent years to form-
ulate a coherent policy for the development of the transport sector as a whole.
The policies that are pursued, such as the freedom of choice by users to select
their transport mode and competition in a market economy among autonomous
transport enterprises, reflect tlhe nation's prevailing economic climate.
In 1971 a Federal Secretariat for Transport aind Communications was estab-
lished to facilitate more coordinated development of the sector, but it has
been unable, with its limited authority, to perform this role effectively.
While the Yugoslav authorities are increasingly aware of the problem, the
rapid constitutional changes toward decentralization have made it difficult
to find a suitable formula which would provide effective coordination at the
national level and which is also acceptable to the Republics and Provinces.
The Federal Government agreed to take steps to coordinate planning and in-
vestments in the highway sector and among transport modes (Section 3.05 of
the Guarantee Agreement), but what specific action can be taken will depend
on agreement between the Republics and Provinces and various transport orga-
nizations concerned. Within various transport modes, however, coordination
is improving, primarily through voluntary and informal associations among
the enterprises, and among the Republics and Provinces. The railway enter-
prises have gradually strengthened over the years the CormLunity of Yugoslav
Railways (CYR) and more recently the road organizations have formed the
Council of Republic and Provincial Road Organizations (CRO). While CYR and
CRO are not comparable in status and role, the development of CYR offers an
encouraging example for the highway and port sub-sectors.



- 9 -
32.       Bank lending to the transport sector has been aimed at providing
financial assistance for priority infrastructure projects, for which funds
are generally scarce. Another important objective has been to improve coor-
dination of sector investment and planning through bodies like CYR and CRO.
The present loan, the proposed fourth loan for the railways and the proposed
loan for the expansion of the port facilities at Bar would all contribute to
this goal.
The Highway Sub-Sector
33.       Prior to 1955, the development of road transport was rather limited
under a Government policy which accorded priority to the railways. Since then,
both the vehicle fleet and traffic have grown rapidly, reflecting steady eco-
nomic growth and encouraged by the liberalization of the transport sector:
road traffic trebled between 1960 and 1965, and doubled again between 1967
and 1972. The highway network has also increased from 82,000 km in the late
1950's to 96,000 km in 1972, and paved roads increased from 5,000 km in !958
to 30,000 km in 1972. Despite these rapid improvements, the develbpment of
the highway infrastructure has suffered from inadequate investments. and from
weakness in the coordination of highway planning and investment. Consequently
the network is characterized by low density of paved roads, particularly in
the less-developed regions and most notably in Bosnia-Herzegovina; it is, for
the most part, inadequate for the current and projected traffic volume. Many
paved roads, having evolved from gravel roads, are sub-standard and without
adequate foundations. Other paved roads are already congested. Most of the
gravel roads need to be upgraded.
34.       Administration of the highway sub-sector underwent drastic changes,
from a centralized system to a decentralized one, as the responsibility of the
Federal Government was transferred to the Republics and Provinces in 1968.
Since then, each of the Republics and Provinces has established a Road Fund,
Road Council or Road Enterprise (Serbia and Kosovo) as the responsible agency
for planning, design, construction and maintenance of all public roads in its
territory, except those local roads which are constructed and maintained by
communes. The Road Funds have generally large staffs and are directly in-
volved in highway planning, project preparation and supervision. The Road
Councils, with more limited staffs, are subordinated to the Secretariate of
Economy; although they do some planning, their primary function is supervi-
sion of road maintenance. The Road Funds, Councils and Enterprises are managed
by boards, the members of which are appointed by, and are responsible to, the
Republic and Provincial Governments. They generally function as administra-
tive and supervisory agencies, employing consultants for pre-investmnent and
engineering studies, and contracting out construction work and maintenance.
35.       The Council of Republic and Provincial Road Organizations (CRO),
established in 1971 by the Road Funds, Councils and Enterprises to deal with
technical and financial matters of common interest, has been the principal
coordinator of the highway sub-sector. It is an informal association with
no permanent secretariat of its own, but it has been active in standardization
of engineering design, data collection and other technical matters. At pres-
ent, it is preparing uni'orm guidelines for the preparation of feasibility



- 10 -
studies, with assistance from the consultants provided under the Fifth
Highway Project (Loan 751-YU). It has, however, no authority in formulating
policy or establishing plans for highway development. Therefore, the current
five-year highway development plan (1971-75), prepared by the CRO, is essen-
tially a consolidation of the individual plans of the Republics and Provinces.
The Yugoslav authorities recognize the need for a comprehensive highway pro-
gram, prepared on the basis of uniform guidelines and which would provide eco-
nomic priorities for implementation of highway projects. :.n order to improve
project preparation and to provide a sound basis for planning, the Federal
Government has agreed that the uniform guidelines would be aWpplied to the
preparation of feasibility studies for major highways and that a competent
institution would be designated or established to screen these feasibility
studies (Section 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement). The Federal Government
also agreed to take appropriate steps to coordinate the preparation of the
next five-year program for major highways among the Republics and Provinces
(Section 3.05 of the Guarantee Agreement).
36.       Highway expenditures have increased steadily over the last decade
to the present level of about 2 percent of Yugoslavia's GNP, but they have
not been sufficient in view of the existing backlog and the rapid expansion
and modernization of the economy. Under the current five-year plan, highway
expenditures would increase from about $120 million per annum during 1966-70
to an average of about $230 million per annum: actual average annual expendi-
tures during 1971 and 1972 amounted to $210 million. However, these increases
are modest compared to the need. Since the mid-1960's, when the Federal
Government's responsibility for financing highway expenditures was transferred
to the Republics and Provinces, highway financing has tended to depend on ad
hoc resource mobilization, which has not been conducive to long-term planning.
The main sources of highway financing are the earmarked revenues from fuel
taxes, which provided about 45 percent of the total highway expenditures in
1972. The other sources include contributions by the Republics, Provinces
and Communes, the Federal Fund for Financing the Accelerated Development of
the Less-Developed Regions, and loans from the local banks and the World Bank.
The Yugoslav authorities are examining the possibility of allocating an in-
creased proportion of the revenues from fuel taxes to highway expenditures,
in order to provide a better financial basis for highway planning.
37.       Since the first loan in 1963, the Bank has made five loans for
highways. The first two projects (Loans 344-YU and 485-YU) were completed
on schedule in 1966 and 1971, respectively and the Third Highway Project
(Loan 608-YU) is now virtually complete. The others (Loans 678-YU and 751-
YU) are under construction (see Annex II). Implementation of all these
projects has been satisfactory, although the fourth and fifth projects have
experienced some cost increases due to inflation. Since the Third Highway
Project in 1969, the Bank has maintained a close dialogue with the Yugoslav
authorities concerning the institutional problems, and has played a role in
the establishment of the Federal Secretariat for Transport and Communications
and the CR0. The Fifth Highway project included a technical assistance
component, the first in a loan for highways in Yugoslavia, aimed at institu-
tion building. These goals will continue to guide future Bank lending for
highway projects.

of about 140. The Road Fund prepares a five-year highway program, together
with a financing plan, for approval by the Republic Assembly, and within
this program it defines and implements, with approval of the Republic Gov-
ernment, its annual work programs. The financial resources of the Road Fund
consists of earmarked revenues from road-user charges, budgetary stpport from
the Republic, the funds from the Federal Fund for Financing the Accelerated
Development of the Less-Developed Regions, contributions from the communes
and other organizations, and loans. The Road Fund has been a beneficiary
of bank loans under two previous highway projects (Loans 485-YU and 678-YU)
and its performance has been satisfactory except for the initial delay in
project execution under Loan 678-YU due to expropriation procedures.
41.       The Road Fund would be responsible for construction and supervision
under the project, since all the road sections are located in the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As under the Fifth Highway Project, the CR0 would carry
out staff training and the procurement of engineering equipment on behalf of
the participating road organizations. This arrangement would be formalized
in a single Relending Agreement between the Borrower and the other participat-
ing road organizations, through which the former would relend portions of the
loan, on the same term as the Bank loan, to the latter for their respective
participation in these programs (Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement). The
execution and ratification of the Relending Agreement would be a condition
of effectiveness of the loan (Section 9.01 (b) of the Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
42.       The total cost of the project, inctiding taxes and duties, is esti-
mated at US$60.0 million, with a foreign exclhange component of US$22.5 million
(about 37 percent of the total project cost). Details are given in Annex III.
Construction accounts for 96 percent of the total cost. The price contingency
of 25 percent for construction assumes annual price increases of 18, 15 and
12 percent for both foreign exchange costs and local costs during 1974, 1975
and 1976, respectively.   The price contingen:y for the training program is 20
percent, assuming 12 percent annual price increases for both the foreign and
local costs between 1974 and 1977, and 14 percent for the engineering equip-
ment program, based on delivery in the second half of 1975.
43.       The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million would finance 50 percent
of the total project cost, (a) 49 percent of the construction cost (US$28.4
million), including about US$7.5 million, equ:Lvalent, of local costs, and (b)
the foreign exchange cost of the staff training and equipment programs (US$1.6
million). The remainder of the local costs would be financed primarily by the
Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina: a small part of the local cost (US$400,000
equivalent), for the staff training program and the procurement of equipment,
would be borne by the other participating road organizations. The Government
of Bosnia-Herzegovina has issued a preliminary guarantee for the provision
of funds for the construction of the project, including possible cost over-
runs. The ratification and execution of this guarantee by the Republican
authorities would be a condition of effectiveness (Section 9.01 (a) of the
Loan Agreement).

Procurement
44.       International competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines would apply to all contracts for the highway construc-
tion works (US$43.0 million before contingencies).  In order not to delay the
start-up of construction, the Bank has approved prequalification procedures
for construction contractors and these contrzcts are scheduled to be awarded
in mid-1974. Because no foreign firms have won construction contracts under
the previous Bank-financed highway projects (except for one joint venture for
the construction of a tunnel), all the construction contracts are expected
to be carried out by local firms. The engineering and laboratory equipment,
for which there are no domestic manufacturer:s, would be procured through
international competitive bidding to the extent practicable.
Disbursements
45.       The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance:  (a) 49 per-
cent of all civil works contracts; (b) 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of staff training; and (c) 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported
engineering equipment. Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account at
the completion of the project will be used for the purchase of additional
engineering equipment or for staff training, as agreed between the Borrower
and the Bank. Disbursements under the loan are expected to take place over
three years from the fourth quarter of 1974 through the third quarter of 1977.
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex III.
Environment
46.       The project is not expected to produce any adverse environmental
effects.
Justification
47.       The Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has the least-developed
highway network of all the regions in Yugoslavia, and has given high priority
to the expansion of the network to further the economic and social development
of the Republic. The revised current five-year plan for highways, covering
1973-75, has authorized a substantially expanded program, involving annual
expenditures of about US$67.7 million, compared to average expenditures of
US$27.0 million in 1969 and 1970. All the highway sections included in the
project serve industrial and agricultural areas with relatively high popula-
tion densities in Bosnia-Herzegovina (see annexed map). These highways are
part of major transport routes, and their modernization would help improve
the transportation necessary for the regional development of some of the
poorest areas of the Republic, and would provide better access to markets
for raw and processed agricultural goods in major industrial centers in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia. Both local and inter-regional
traffic would benefit from the project.



48.       The quantifiable economic benefits of the project consist primarily
of unit savings in vehicle operating costs, which are expected to range up
to 34 percent for passenger cars and 55 percent for buses and trucks. The
transport enterprises, which operate for profit, are highly competitive and
are generally well managed, and cost savings accruing from the project would
be passed on to the consumers. The most probable economic returns on the
individual highway sections range from 14 to 31 percent. Tihey would range
from 11 to 26 percent under a pessimistic as,umption of 15 percent increase
in construction cost.  Although riost of the Aiighaway sections share the same
service area as the railways, they would not divert signirffcant traffic from
the railways because specialization of traffic between these modes has largely
taken place. The improvement of the highway sections would result in reduction
of overall vehicle fuel consumption (some 10,000 m. tons in the first year of
road opening).  Furthermore, with higher .uel prices the new roads would
provide greater savings in vehicle operating cost in relation co increases
in construction cost and the current energy crisis would have the effect of
increasing the economic returns for these roads.
49.       Benefits accruing from the staff training and the engineering equip-
ment programs are not quantified. These bernefits would be of long-term nature,
arising from improvements in highway planning, project preparation and admin-
istration of the sub-sector. The economists and engineers to be trained under
the project would provide a nucleus of Yugoslav experts for preparing and
screening feasibility studies according to proper procedures. The partici-
pation of CRO, as the coordinator and executor of the technical assistance
programs under the project, is expected to contribute to institution build-
ing in this sub-sector.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreeiment between the Bank and the Republic Road
Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia aid the Bank, the Report of the Comnittee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan Agreement
contains the Borrower's obligation to enter into a Relending Agreement with
the road organizations of the participating Socialist Republics and Socialist
Autonomous Provinces for relending the proceeds of the loan allocated to the
staff training and the procurement of engineering and laboratory equipment
programs (Section 4.01 of the Loan Agreement).
51.       Features of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 31, 35, 41, 43 and 50 of this Report.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 395 Railway Modernization Program: US$70.0 million Loan of December 11,
1964.
The loan was fully disbursed on October 31, 1972, after the Closing
Date had been postponed from December 31, 1969. However, completion of the
project has been delayed to 1976, due to financial and techn_cal difficulties.
Project cost estimates increased nearly threefold in dinars (two-fold in US
dollars) between 1963 and 1973 because of inflation, devaluation of the dinar,
revaluation of some European currencies and as a consequence of additional
increases in quantities. After 1966 the Yugoslav Railways suffered a con-
tinuous deterioration of their financial position and liquidty for a number
of related reasons. Payments for railway freight services were held back by
the lack of liquidity in the whole economy. The five Railway Transport
Enterprises which, under the Yugoslav system, are expected to operate on a
commercial basis, were restricted by Government regulations in their ability
to respond to clhanged market conditions. Furthermore, the responsibility of
the Federal Government to meet railway deficits has been transferred to the
Republican Governments, which only now are in a position to assume it.
In order to be able to make proposals for dealing not only with the
difficulties with the Bank project, but also with the difficulties facing the
Yugoslav railways as a whole, it was agreed with the Government in 1971 that
the Bank would undertake a thorough review of the railways' problems. Follow-
ing this review, which was carried out with the assistance of a consulting
team, the Bank discussed its findings with the Federal and Regional Governments
and the Railwavs. The response of the Governments and the Railways was very
favorable and they agreed to take concerted action to improve the railways'
situation. In view of this, the Bank agreed to consider making a further
loan (proposed for FY74) to assist completion of the 1964 modernization
program, provided that certain conditions could be met. These are the clari-
fication of government responsibility for the railways and an overall plan of
action both for the Yugoslav railways as a whole and for each Railway Enterprise
(including clear marketing and related operational and financial objectives),
a revised tariff policy, investment and disinvestment proposals, and proposals
for dealing with labor redundancy problems and for improvement in management.
The Governments and the railways have taken and are taking measures to meet
these conditions, and several missions visited Yugoslavia to assist in the
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

preparation of new action plars.   The appraisal mission visited Yugoslavia
in December 1973.   The final size of the proposed project has now been deter-
mined, as the Republics have clarified the availability of local resources
and local agreements have been worked out to clarify the respective respon-
sibilities of the Governments and Railways. N1egotiations for the proposed
fourth loan were substantially completed on May 2, 1974, and a recommendation
to the Executive Directors is expected to be made in the near future.    This new
financiaL assistance would be concentrated on the comtpletion of the 1964
modernization program of main lines.
Any further delay in carrying out a minimal modernization program
could furtlher jeopardize the competitive position of the railways in relation
to road traffic and would extend the period in which the economy would not
benefit fully from the large investments in the Modernization Program made
withi Bank assistance since 1964.
Loan 531  belgrade-Bar Railway:   US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The completion of this project was originally scheduled for 1973 but
geo-technical and other construction difficulties in mountainous terrain are
expected to delay operation of the line at least until 1975. The Closing Date
has been postponed from December 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $225.5 million to $290.0 million. There is at )resent a
financing gap of about $35 million.   The Federal Government and -hh Republic
Governments of Serbia and Montenegro have alreAdy taken some measures to close
this gap so that financing for all the works to be carried ^ut in 1974, as well
as part of works in 1975 is identified. The necessary financing for the bal-
anice of work to complete the project is expected to be secured in the course
of this year.
Loan 608 Third iiichway:   US$30.) m4lLion Loan of June 5, 1969;
Closing Date: August 31, 1974.
Construction works under the loan h<ave been substantially completed,
except for the access road in Zagreb, whichi is expected to require several
additional months. Tlhe Closing Date of the Loan was postponed from December
31, 1972 to December 31, 1973. A second postponement to August 31, 1974, has
been agreed. In view of increases in costs, the disbursement percentage has
been reduced from the original 42 percent to 27 percent, in order to continue
disbursements until the completion of these woriks.   Disburse-ments are proceed-
ing on schedule.  A supervision mission is scheduled for May 1974.
Loan 654  Industrial Projects - 1970:   US'18.5 million Loan of January 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974.
All Ltree sub-projects under the loan are making satisfactory pro-
gress after exnporiencing delays of up to ;i mcnths due to slow deliveries of
local anu i:i,ported goods.  T,.e ,osing Date was postponed from June 30 to

Decerher 31, 1973, to allow paynents of 10 percent retention money under
already concluded contracts of Crvena Zastava and Sisak, and a second time
on December 28, 1973 by seven months to July 31, 1974, to allow disbursements
of final guarantee payments.
Loan 657 Telecommunicationis: US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Delays in civil works have occurred whichi will delay completion of
the project until late 1975. With the exception of the earth satellite
station, only preliminary works have been completed. A cost overrun for
orders already placed amounting to US$5.1 million, is expected due to cur-
rency revaluations. Following a revision of the disbursement schedule, dis-
bursements are now in line with the revised projections.
Loan 673 Fourth Highway: US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica sections because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily and six of the nine sections
have been substantially completed. However, due to delays on the remaining
sections, the completion of the project is likely to be delayed substantially
beyond the present Closing Date.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. On the basis of a re-
vised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 the disbursement
percentage has been revised from 43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973.
Disbursement is proceeding in line with the revised projection. A supervision
mission, scheduled for May 1974, will review the revised cost estimate, and
the need for changes in disbursement percentages and for postponement of the
Closing Date.
Loan 751 Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions for
effectiveness of the loan, construction work is now making satisfactory prog-
ress on all sections. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal cost estimate is
expected, and the disbursement percentage will be revised when more accurate
revised cost estimates are available. Disbursement under the loan is about
one year behind the appraisal estimate. A supervision mission is scheduled
for May 1974.

Loan 752  Bernardin Tourism: USS10.C million of Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After the 'Loss of more than one year owing to delays in making the
loan effective and in appointing consultants, the impleientation of the proj-
ect experienced a further delay of one an,d a half months. As a result, dis-
bursements are behind schedule. Prelir.inary estimates indicate that the
project, if it were to be implenmented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximately US$34 million instead of US$24 million. Tnis in-
crease is mainly due to rapid inflation, but also to realignmnent in exchange
rates. As only a small anount of additional financing appears to be forth-
coming, the project might have to be reduced to some 1,500 to 2,000 beds by
elimninatirng the most expensive structures with the lowest returns.  Such re-
duction will result in a less favorable economic rate of return, but it is
expected that the project would still be viable.
Loan 777  Ibar I4ultipurpose W1ater:  US$45.0 m-illiorn Loan o June 30, 1971;
__losin_ Date: December 31, 1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. However, the
responsible agency, the Ihar-Lepenac Enter;)rise, is now well established and
good progress is being made in constructing the project.  It should be pos-
sible to complete most of the project by the end of 1976 (i.e., one year
later than originally planned). Disbursenments are proceeding in line with
the revised schedule.
Loan IS I Rabin _iuk Tourism: US$20.0 iiillion Loan of July 21, 1971;
Closing Date: July__1, 1976.
'i'here have been delays in the ir.nplernentation of the project due to
dtelays in ma'<ing the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants.  Because
of tlhese, disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problemiis have
now been largely resolved, the project is almost two years behind schedule.
This period hias been one of rapidI inflation in Yugoslavia and project costs
are now estimated to have increased by 50 to 60 percent over the estimate at
the time of appraisal. Unless addition1al finance can be found the project
will have to be reduced in scale.  This is miost likely to affect the economic
rate of return adversely, but prelirninary calculations indicate that a re-
duced project would still be viable. The consultants are now perforaming
fairly well and construction of the project is due to start in the third
quarter of 1974.
Loan .36  Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
After sorme delays in preparing tender documnents, bidding procedures
are now under way. Following the supervision mission in October 1973, pro-
curement is moving faster. The Bank has already approved proposals to award
contracts, representing about 50 percent of the loan amount. However, due



ANNEX II
Page 7
to complex procedures for procurement among the elevensborrowers, disbursements
have only recently started. A supervision mission is scheduled for May 1974.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia): US$31 million Loan of May 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan became effective on November 28, 1973. The supervision
mission in January 1974 found that there was strong credit demand with many
credit applications expected to be received in early 1974. Stopanska Banka
has already granted 13 subloans and disbursements are expected to commence
shortly on schedule.
Loan 916 Naftagas Pipeline: US$59.4 million Loan of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This loan became effective on March 22, 1974, after almost six
months' delay. Procurement of pipes has been delayed due to the need to
re-tender. These delays are now expected to postpone the start of construc-
tion by six to nine months. Disbursements are about six months behind the
appraisal estimates. A supervision mission visited Yugoslavia in April 1974.
