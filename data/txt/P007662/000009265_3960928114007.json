        transmission, distribution and thermal plant renovation.\n            The project is composed of four basic components : 1) a\n            transmission and substation program aimed at expanding and\n            improving installations rated 400 kV to 115kV; 2) a\n            distribution program that will expand and improve the\n            distribution grid; 3) a program to renovate thermoelectric\n            power plants to improve thermal efficiency and availability\n            of CFE's main plants; and 4) environmental and\n            pollution control studies related to the above components."}, "docdt": "1990-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
