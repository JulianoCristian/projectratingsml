Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) Libraries have a strategic role\n            in promoting student and adult reading habits, interest in\n            reading, attainment of student achievement and the\n            establishment of a learned society; 2) Library promotion and\n            socialization programs, with precise targets, are important\n            tools to support library establishment and to gain effective\n            support from various parties for the library development; 3)\n            Intensive and direct approaches to policy makers, at both\n            national and local levels, most often result in more\n            effective political and economic support for the library\n            development; 4) Informal community leadership can often be\n            used to accelerate the acceptance of library development and\n            usage in a specific community; 5) Library participation and\n            usage will be more significant when library services are\n            specifically designed to meet user needs (student, teacher,\n            or community); 6) Library team cooperation and transparency\n            of library management both enable and increase support and\n            participation from various parties during library\n            development; 7) The \"Block-grant\" mechanism is a\n            particularly useful financial tool that encourages the\n            library manager to learn planning and budgeting principles\n            and techniques and to effectively account for library\n            expenditures; 8) Field training and on-the-job training\n            seems to be more cost effective than formal classroom\n            training as approaches to establish/improve library\n            management skills of existing staff; 9) Strong, informed\n            leadership is a key factor in the dynamics and progress of\n            library management at all levels, including the school\n            library, community library, and the district public library;\n            10) The assignment of management responsibility for district\n            and lower level public libraries to local government\n            organizations has proven to be an effective approach that\n            encourages local governments to assume \"ownership\"\n            of those libraries. This in turn, encourages local\n            governments to promote and to finance district and local\n            library development where there is a dramatic need for such\n            services; 11) Standard expenditure in the project\n            allocations are not appropriate given the different\n            geographical contexts (more dispersed areas need a greater\n            proportion of funds devoted to travel); 12) Community\n            libraries are more successful if they also have community\n            and recreational areas (e.g. for group meetings, coffee\n            houses); 13) Libraries that are more successful are those\n            that generally serve their communities and are well managed\n            internally. Not all libraries are truly embedded in their\n            communities; some are add-ons; 14) Personal contact from\n            libraries to district officials can increase support for the\n            library. Other initiatives are somewhat useful, although\n            largely seen as ineffective since they do not target key\n            decision-makers who control financing. These include book\n            fairs and outreach activities to communities; and 15)\n            Libraries that are only project driven do not succeed. Those\n            closely linked to religious institutions or youth groups are\n            more successful. Mobile libraries are potentially important\n            in getting greater variety of books (one reason why\n            libraries are not used is because clients have read all the\n            books of interest to them)."}, "docdt": "2007-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
