been outlined in a Letter\n            of Development Policy submitted to the Bank. The principal\n            aim of the program is to restore a sustainable medium-term\n            balance of payments position while maintaining the growth\n            momentum of the economy. To achieve these objectives,\n            specific action will be taken over the next twelve months\n            to: (i) promote a coordinated approach in strengthening\n            public sector resource mobilization and efficiency of\n            resource use; (ii) increase the effectiveness of public\n            institutions guiding the structural adjustment process;\n            (iii) improve the structure of industrial incentives; (iv)\n            improve the efficiency of energy use; and (v) promote\n            agricultural growth and exports. The foreign exchange\n            provided by the loan will be used to finance essential imports."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
