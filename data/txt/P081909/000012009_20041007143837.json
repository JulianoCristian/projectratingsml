The original Credit is 95 percent\n            disbursed, and the remaining funds are fully committed for\n            use in October 2004. As such, a reduction in the scope of\n            the original project is not feasible; and, processing of a\n            free-standing project runs the risk of disrupting the\n            national, and global polio eradication efforts, both of\n            which are on accelerated timetables.
