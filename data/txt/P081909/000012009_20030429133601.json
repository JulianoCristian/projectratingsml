eradicate Poliomyelitis, by supporting the\n            supply of additional oral polio vaccines (OPV) for the\n            country's 2003-05 supplementary immunization\n            activities. The project will provide financing for only the\n            first component, i.e., the procurement of OPV, to immunize\n            all children of up to 5 years of age. Vaccines will be\n            procured through the United Nations Children's Fund\n            (UNICEF). The second component, entails supplemental\n            operations through three main activities: maintenance of a\n            cold chain, social mobilization, and training. Before each\n            round of immunization, extensive micro-planning, social\n            mobilization campaigns, and training of participants will be\n            conducted to ensure effective implementation, particularly,\n            in reaching targeted groups. The third component provides\n            support for epidemiological, and laboratory surveillance. A\n            technical advisory group will meet periodically, who will\n            provide the Government with detailed analysis of the program\n            performance, its status, and recommended actions."}, "docdt": "2003-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
