       FOR THE PARTNERSHIPFOR POLIO ERADICATION PROJECT




A: Introduction

1.      The following report proposes a supplemental credit to the Islamic Republic o f
Pakistan, for SDR 14,700,000 (US$21.5 1 million equivalent). The proposed credit will
provide additional financing for the ongoing Partnership for Polio Eradication Project
(Cr. Number 37610). The project will help meet increased financing requirements for
procurement o f Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) for Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative
(PEI). The proposed credit will be on standard International Development Association
(IDA) terms with a special provision for a third party funded Trust Fund to cover the
service and commitment fees and purchase the credit at its net present value once the
project has beensuccessfully completed in accordance with the terms o f the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA).

2.      Pakistan has made significant progress towards polio eradication with confirmed
polio cases decreasing from tens o f thousands per year inthe 1980s to 1803 in 1993 and
only 103 in 2003. Despite heroic efforts during supplemental immunization activities
(SIAs) around the country, low intensity transmission o f the wild polio virus persists in
Pakistan. SIAs need to be intensified as recommendedby the Technical Advisory Group
(TAG), a panel of national and international experts, that regularly reviews Pakistan's
progress toward polio eradication. Additional financing2o f $21.51million i s required for
procurement o f OPV to help implement the strategy recommended by the TAG. The
supplemental credit will be executed by September 2004 and closed in June 2006 as in
the original project.

3.      IDAwould support PakistanPEIand global eradicationefforts inpartnership with
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and United Nations Foundation (UNF).IDA'S
partners will cover the costs o f the service and commitment fee o f the project and "buy
down" (annex 4) the net present value o f the credit once agreed performance measures
are achieved.

improving, but the pace o f the progress i s slow relative to its GNP per capita o f U S $
6523.A relatively highinfant mortality rate o f 82/1000 live births in2000/014 and a high

fertility rate of 4.8 children per woman5 are among the highest in South Asia. Much of
the mortality and morbidity is caused by preventable or readily treatable diseases, with
communicable diseases accounting for 40% o f total disease burden. The health system
faces a number o f challenges including low and inefficient public spending, poor quality
o f implementation, govemance issues, uneven quality o f services in the public and
private sector, and weak regulatory framework.

5.       The GOP is trying to address the above challenges by addressing governance
issues through the devolution initiative aimed at improving accountability at the local
level and the medium-term human development strategy, outlined in GOP's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The proposed supplementary credit i s consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on June 11, 2002 (
Document # 24399-PAK) and CAS Progress Report discussed by the board on April 28,
2004 (Document #28262-PAK). The CAS i s fully aligned with the PRSP. Inthe social
sector, the CAS aims to improve equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender
equitypolicies. Inhealth, it supports key interventions o f immunization, communicable
disease control, and maternal and child health programs; improving govemance and
efficiency o f the public sector expenditures through devolution o f powers to the local
governments;        and improvement o f monitoring and evaluation.           The proposed
supplementary project supports the CAS objective o f improving equity through
supporting pro-poor policies, and health sector priorities. The poor with low levels o f
immunization coverage and residing incrowded unhygienic conditions are at greatest risk
from polio.        Polio related disability severely limits a child's potential by reducing
capacity to benefit from education and employment opportunities. The project seeks to
eradicate polio from Pakistan and contribute to its eradication from the world.

C: PARTNERSHIP FOR POLIO ERADICATION PROJECT

6.       Current Polio Situation: Pakistan has made significant progress towards polio
eradication. The number o f confirmed cases have decreased from tens o f thousand o f
cases during 1980s, to 1803 in 1993 and only 103 in 2003. In2004, only 14 confirmed
cases have been reported in the first quarter o f 2004, a decline o f two thirds from the
same time period in 2003. Despite Pakistan reporting the lowest ever wild polio virus
transmission during the second half o f 2003, the traditional high season, the number o f
confirmed cases increased from 90 to 103 cases. This indicates low intensitytransmission
o f the wild polio virus despite effective implementation o f SIAs duringwhich an average
coverage o f 95% o f the target populationwas reached. The table below outlines Pakistan
progress towards polio eradication since 1997.

7.      Project Objective: The purpose o f the ongoing IDA-supportedproject i s to assist
GOP in eradicating poliomyelitis from Pakistan. The Pakistan PEI i s part o f the World
Health Organization (WHO) led, multi-country effort in support o f a global public good
i.e. eradication of polio from the world. The objective o f the project i s to support the
procurement and supply o f OPV, needed during 2003-05, for SIAs for immunizing all
children up to five years o f age.

8.      Implementation Experience: The initial project was approved by IDA on May
15, 2003. The credit was signed on June 11, 2003 and made effective August 07, 2003.
The project i s part o f a multi-donor financed framework which has provided funding
amounting to U S $ 71.6 million, o f which IDA financed U S $ 20.0 million for
procurement o f OPV (roughly 50% o f the total OPV need). Besides IDA, principal
financiers include Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), UNICEF and WHO.
The project is employing the innovative IDAbuy-down financing mechanism.

9.      The Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) has three components: (i) procurement
                                                                             the
o f OPV; (ii)supplemental operations including cold chain, social mobilization and
training; and (iii)surveillance. All the elements o f an effective program are working
satisfactorily in Pakistan including quality surveillance; logistics for procurement,
distribution and administration o f quality OPV; micro-planning etc. IDA i s financing
only the first component o f PEI which comprises "the Project". Project supervision
missions in September 2003 and March 2004 rated the development objective and the
implementation progress satisfactory. O f the total allocation, U S $ 19.93 million o f the
credit has been disbursed, a year earlier than envisaged and the remaining amount o f
about U S $ 911,535 i s likely to be disbursed by October 2004. Overall compliance with
the credit covenants i s satisfactory.

10.      There is continued high commitment to polio eradication at federal, provincial
and district government level. The quality o f SIAs has been satisfactory with coverage o f
around 95% at province level during the last four rounds in 2003 and 2004. However,
because o f varied quality across and within districts there i s continued transmission o f the
wild polio virus. The reasons for varied quality include ineffective supervision and
management in some districts and deficient micro-plans to follow up missing children.
The program inconsultation with technical partners, has undertaken actions to ensure that
the missingchildren are vaccinated and supervision improved.

11.     The IDA supported project has contributed significantly to the efforts through
timely procurement and supply of OPV through UNICEF. UNICEF has procured and
made available 166 million doses o f OPV till May 2004. The vaccines delivered since the
project effectiveness (September 2003) were delivered within the stipulated five weeks
prior to the SIAs except for the March 2004 round (the supply was delayed due to EID
holidays inPakistan.)

12.     Pakistan's polio initiative i s guided by TAG, a group comprised o f global and
national polio experts. Based on review o f the surveillance data, T A G concluded that
Pakistan i s making satisfactory progress and i s on track to achieve polio eradication by
2005. However, in view o f the continued low intensity transmission o f wild polio virus,
T A G recommended to intensify SIA efforts during 2004 and 2005:


                                                                                              7

     0  Undertake an additional round o f NID in last quarter o f 2004; and increase the
        number o fNIDrounds from 2 to 4 in2005;
     0  Increase the number o f SNID rounds from 0 to 2 in2005;
     0  Undertake additional mop up operations in 2004 to cover areas not covered
        duringthe first halfo f2004; and
     0  Efforts to improve quality o f SIAs specially inNWFP and Punjab.

The GOP and the Global Technical Consultative Group (GTCG) have endorsed the
recommendations to intensify SIAs and have initiated actions to implement them.

Rationalefor the SupplementalCredit

13.     The proposed Supplemental Credit would finance the procurement o f extra OPV
requiredfor additional SIAs in October-December 2004 and 2005. The proposed credit is
consistent with the original project development objective and meets the requirement o f
OP13.20 on supplemental financing as outlined below:

    Despite achieving 95% coverage o f the targeted population in SIAs, low intensity
    transmission o f the wild polio virus persists. T A G recommended to intensify efforts
    o f SIAs by increasing the number o f rounds. The increased number o f rounds has
    increased the amount o f vaccine requiredand operational costs, placing new financial
    burden on the program. Given the limited resources and other competing priorities,
    the GOP is unable to secure additional financing for the procurement o f OPV.

    The GOP has explored alternate financing options including additional funds from
    other development partners but it has not been successful in the given time frame.
    Polio eradication i s largely financed by the development partners, who are now
    counting on the Bank's contribution (and actively seek to use the leverage o f the IDA
    buy down) for further financing o fthe eradication efforts;

    Overall project implementation progress has been satisfactory; all implementing
    agencies have adequately discharged their responsibilities, activities have been
    executed satisfactorily and the Borrower i s incompliance with the credit covenants.

    The original Credit is 95% disbursed and the remaining funds are fully committed for
    use in October 2004. As such, a reduction in the scope o f the original project i s not
    feasible; and

    Processing o f a free-standing project runs the risk o f disrupting the national and
    global polio eradication efforts both o f which are on accelerated timetables.

14.     Benefits:Procurement and supply o f additional OPV through the proposed credit
will assist inachieving the original project objective. The project will benefit all Pakistani
children below the age o f five, but it will most benefit poor and disadvantaged children.
The project will assist Pakistan to eliminate polio as a public health problem, freeing
resources for other sectoral priorities. As the project i s part o f the global effort to



                                                                                            8

eradicate polio world-wide, an effort that depends on the actions o f each country, its
benefits will go far beyond the national target group and the present and future world
populations.

Implementationof the ProposedSupplementalCredit

15.     ProjectCost and Financing:As inthe initialproject, IDA will be financing only
the first component o f PEI which will comprise "the Project". SIAs during October-
December 2004 and January-December 2005 will require 25 1.5 million doses o f OPV,
costing about U S $ 33.66 million (Annex 1). The GOP has been able to mobilize U S $
10.35 million from JICA, U S $0.90 million from its own resources and U S $ 0.90 million
from the existing IDA project. The shortfall o f US $21.51 million equivalent will be met
from the supplemental financing under the proposed project7. The breakdown o f the
project cost, project financing plan and disbursement schedule are outlined in Annex 2
and 2A.

16.     Implementation Arrangements and Procurement: The Supplemental Credit
does not require additional implementation capacity beyond what i s already inplace for
PEIand the existing project i.e. the existing public health structures at federal, provincial
and district level with oversight by the Ministry o f Health. The Supplemental credit will
be monitored through the existing monitoring mechanisms and already functional
surveillance system. The existing procurement and disbursement procedures applied
under the present project will continue. UNICEF will undertake the procurement and
supply o f OPV through its international procurement division, based in Copenhagen as
agreed in the present project. A new draft procurement agreement between the GOP and
UNICEFis being finalized.

17.     Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Simplified
acceptable financial management arrangements including accounting and reporting
systems are inplace for the project and will continue for the supplemental credit.

18.     ImplementationCompletionReport : An Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) will be preparedwithin six months after Credit closing.

19.     Environmental and Social Aspects: The project is not envisaged to cause
environmental risks. The environmental category for the supplemental credit i s C. The
project will significantly contribute to the eradication o f wild polio virus from the
environment.

20.     Social Aspects: The project has a strong poverty focus. Poor people living in
unsanitary conditions are at greatest risk for polio. In addition, children in poor families
tend to have the lowest immunization coverage. The project, by supporting SIAs will
target poor, remote and underprivileged communities, and children whose mothers are
unable to take them to health facilities due to restricted female mobility. Vitamin A i s
also administered to children as part o f SIAs. Vitamin A benefits the poor children               by

decreasing vitamin A deficiency blindness and also reduces the risk o f infant and child
mortality.

21.     Safeguard Policies: The supplemental credit as the initial project will support
SIAs in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a disputed area between India and Pakistan. By
financing the supplemental credit, IDA does not intend to make any conclusion on the
legal or any other status o f the disputedterritory or to prejudice the final determination o f
the parties' claim.

22.     Sustainability: GOP, the Provincial and the District Governments are fully
committed to polio eradication and the present project. The supplementary immunization
activities will end once polio i s eradicated globally, so there will be no need to sustain
SIAs and related costs. Polio eradication benefits are immeasurable because the disease
will be eradicated from the world and all transmission will cease.

23.     Risks:The biggest risk is that being a global public good it heavily depends on
each country doing their bit. Failure on the part o f one country will undermine the global
effort. Intensified SIA efforts may not interrupt low intensity transmission and may not
lead to polio eradication by end o f 2005. This could delay global polio eradication
requiringadditional efforts and funds. Inaddition, there is a risk o fweak implementation
and low quality o f SIAs. Until global eradication i s achieved, all countries will need to
maintain immunization. The GOP is fully committed to the project and the Polio
Eradication Initiative. It i s making all possible efforts including involvement o f all
possible stakeholders, three levels o f govemment and collaboration with regional
countries. Weak implementation i s being strengthened through the support o f the
development partners with provision o f intensive and highquality technical assistance.

Introduction
       This annex describes the arrangements for the implementation o f the IDA buy-
down mechanism for polio eradication projects, which aims to convert the terms o f a
normal IDA Development Credit to grant terms through provision o f additional external
donor resources under clearly defined performance criteria. Inthe context o f the Pakistan
Supplementary Credit for the Partnership for Polio Eradication Project, i s the second
operation utilizing this mechanism. The resources for the buy-down will become
available as a result o f an agreement between IDA and the United Nations Foundation
(UNF) with funding from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The buy-down
mechanism complies with IDA'Sexisting financial policies.

The Partnership
       The Bank's Health, Nutrition and Population Anchor explored the possibility o f
partnering with UNF and CDC to assist polio eradication by providing countries with
IDA financial resources but without IDA repayment obligations. The CDC through UNF
agreed to provide funds to an IDA-administered trust fund (the Polio Eradication Trust
Fundor PETF) that will buy down the debt incurredby recipient countries for successful
implementation o f polio eradication projects. In addition, to making commitment and
service charge payments to IDA on behalf o f the recipients during project
implementation, the PETF will, upon successful project implementation, buy down the
net present value o f the principal amount o f the development credit.

The Mechanism
       The IDA DCA will include two special previsions:

    1.     The PETFwill pay the applicable service charges and commitment charges, if
           any, and
    2.     The PETFwill buy down the principal amount of the credit upon successful
           completion o f the project (as determinedby the World Health Organization
           audit).

The buy-down will be funded by contributions to the PETF from the CDC through UNF.
The   buy-down     mechanism        operates   in three   stages-credit signing, project
implementation, and project completion. These stages are described below.

At Credit Signing
       IDA determine the discount rate (the prevailing SDR-basket Commercial Interest
Reference Rates (CIRR) o n the date o f credit signing) and the foreign exchange rate
(SDR:USD) that will be used to calculate the estimated net present value at final buy-
down. The PETF sets aside funds that are denominated in U S D and invested pending
disbursement. The set-aside amount equals IDA commitment and service charge


                                                                                        15

payments over the projected implementation period and the estimated amount needed to
buy downthe principal o fthe credit at the end o fthe implementationperiod. IDAhedges
the foreign exchange risk under its existing currency rebalancingmechanism.

DuringProjectImplementation
       Under the project, IDA, acting on a request from the recipient country, disburses
funds to UNICEF,the agency responsible for procuringthe polio vaccine. UNICEFin
tumsupplies the vaccines to the recipient government.

       The PETF pays the commitment and service charges on the disbursed amounts
duringthe implementation o fthe project.

       Ifthe implementationperiodis substantially longer than initiallyprojected, funds
required to pay service charges could exceed the funds set aside. However, the
investment income on the set-aside buy-down amount provides a cushion against this
risk. Ifthe implementation period exceeds five years, the responsibility for servicing the
credit will revert to the recipient country unless UNF grants an extension.

At Project Completion
       As in the original project, upon completion o f the project, WHO conducts a
performance audit to determine if the IDA funds achieved their intended results. The
performance audit measures the results for two indicators:

1.     Timely arrival o f OPV inthe country at the central level; and
2.     vaccination coverage for OPV duringthe vaccination campaigns.

       Ifthe WHO performance audit evaluates the project as satisfactory, the IDAbuy-
down will be triggered. The PETF will then pay o f f the IDA credit at the net present
value o f the credit based on the defined foreign exchange and discount rates to buy down
the principal o f this credit (Repayment Amount). IDA will inturncancel this credit and
release the recipient from any future liability. Ifthe credit i s not fully disbursed, the final
Repayment Amount will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. If the WHO performance
audit evaluates the project as unsatisfactory, the recipient remain obligated to pay back
IDA on the terms o fthe credit.

       FOR THE PARTNERSHIPFOR POLIO ERADICATION PROJECT




A: Introduction

1.      The following report proposes a supplemental credit to the Islamic Republic o f
Pakistan, for SDR 14,700,000 (US$21.5 1 million equivalent). The proposed credit will
provide additional financing for the ongoing Partnership for Polio Eradication Project
(Cr. Number 37610). The project will help meet increased financing requirements for
procurement o f Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) for Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative
(PEI). The proposed credit will be on standard International Development Association
(IDA) terms with a special provision for a third party funded Trust Fund to cover the
service and commitment fees and purchase the credit at its net present value once the
project has beensuccessfully completed in accordance with the terms o f the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA).

2.      Pakistan has made significant progress towards polio eradication with confirmed
polio cases decreasing from tens o f thousands per year inthe 1980s to 1803 in 1993 and
only 103 in 2003. Despite heroic efforts during supplemental immunization activities
(SIAs) around the country, low intensity transmission o f the wild polio virus persists in
Pakistan. SIAs need to be intensified as recommendedby the Technical Advisory Group
(TAG), a panel of national and international experts, that regularly reviews Pakistan's
progress toward polio eradication. Additional financing2o f $21.51million i s required for
procurement o f OPV to help implement the strategy recommended by the TAG. The
supplemental credit will be executed by September 2004 and closed in June 2006 as in
the original project.

3.      IDAwould support PakistanPEIand global eradicationefforts inpartnership with
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and United Nations Foundation (UNF).IDA'S
partners will cover the costs o f the service and commitment fee o f the project and "buy
down" (annex 4) the net present value o f the credit once agreed performance measures
are achieved.

improving, but the pace o f the progress i s slow relative to its GNP per capita o f U S $
6523.A relatively highinfant mortality rate o f 82/1000 live births in2000/014 and a high

fertility rate of 4.8 children per woman5 are among the highest in South Asia. Much of
the mortality and morbidity is caused by preventable or readily treatable diseases, with
communicable diseases accounting for 40% o f total disease burden. The health system
faces a number o f challenges including low and inefficient public spending, poor quality
o f implementation, govemance issues, uneven quality o f services in the public and
private sector, and weak regulatory framework.

5.       The GOP is trying to address the above challenges by addressing governance
issues through the devolution initiative aimed at improving accountability at the local
level and the medium-term human development strategy, outlined in GOP's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The proposed supplementary credit i s consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on June 11, 2002 (
Document # 24399-PAK) and CAS Progress Report discussed by the board on April 28,
2004 (Document #28262-PAK). The CAS i s fully aligned with the PRSP. Inthe social
sector, the CAS aims to improve equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender
equitypolicies. Inhealth, it supports key interventions o f immunization, communicable
disease control, and maternal and child health programs; improving govemance and
efficiency o f the public sector expenditures through devolution o f powers to the local
governments;        and improvement o f monitoring and evaluation.           The proposed
supplementary project supports the CAS objective o f improving equity through
supporting pro-poor policies, and health sector priorities. The poor with low levels o f
immunization coverage and residing incrowded unhygienic conditions are at greatest risk
from polio.        Polio related disability severely limits a child's potential by reducing
capacity to benefit from education and employment opportunities. The project seeks to
eradicate polio from Pakistan and contribute to its eradication from the world.

C: PARTNERSHIP FOR POLIO ERADICATION PROJECT

6.       Current Polio Situation: Pakistan has made significant progress towards polio
eradication. The number o f confirmed cases have decreased from tens o f thousand o f
cases during 1980s, to 1803 in 1993 and only 103 in 2003. In2004, only 14 confirmed
cases have been reported in the first quarter o f 2004, a decline o f two thirds from the
same time period in 2003. Despite Pakistan reporting the lowest ever wild polio virus
transmission during the second half o f 2003, the traditional high season, the number o f
confirmed cases increased from 90 to 103 cases. This indicates low intensitytransmission
o f the wild polio virus despite effective implementation o f SIAs duringwhich an average
coverage o f 95% o f the target populationwas reached. The table below outlines Pakistan
progress towards polio eradication since 1997.

7.      Project Objective: The purpose o f the ongoing IDA-supportedproject i s to assist
GOP in eradicating poliomyelitis from Pakistan. The Pakistan PEI i s part o f the World
Health Organization (WHO) led, multi-country effort in support o f a global public good
i.e. eradication of polio from the world. The objective o f the project i s to support the
procurement and supply o f OPV, needed during 2003-05, for SIAs for immunizing all
children up to five years o f age.

8.      Implementation Experience: The initial project was approved by IDA on May
15, 2003. The credit was signed on June 11, 2003 and made effective August 07, 2003.
The project i s part o f a multi-donor financed framework which has provided funding
amounting to U S $ 71.6 million, o f which IDA financed U S $ 20.0 million for
procurement o f OPV (roughly 50% o f the total OPV need). Besides IDA, principal
financiers include Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), UNICEF and WHO.
The project is employing the innovative IDAbuy-down financing mechanism.

9.      The Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) has three components: (i) procurement
                                                                             the
o f OPV; (ii)supplemental operations including cold chain, social mobilization and
training; and (iii)surveillance. All the elements o f an effective program are working
satisfactorily in Pakistan including quality surveillance; logistics for procurement,
distribution and administration o f quality OPV; micro-planning etc. IDA i s financing
only the first component o f PEI which comprises "the Project". Project supervision
missions in September 2003 and March 2004 rated the development objective and the
implementation progress satisfactory. O f the total allocation, U S $ 19.93 million o f the
credit has been disbursed, a year earlier than envisaged and the remaining amount o f
about U S $ 911,535 i s likely to be disbursed by October 2004. Overall compliance with
the credit covenants i s satisfactory.

10.      There is continued high commitment to polio eradication at federal, provincial
and district government level. The quality o f SIAs has been satisfactory with coverage o f
around 95% at province level during the last four rounds in 2003 and 2004. However,
because o f varied quality across and within districts there i s continued transmission o f the
wild polio virus. The reasons for varied quality include ineffective supervision and
management in some districts and deficient micro-plans to follow up missing children.
The program inconsultation with technical partners, has undertaken actions to ensure that
the missingchildren are vaccinated and supervision improved.

11.     The IDA supported project has contributed significantly to the efforts through
timely procurement and supply of OPV through UNICEF. UNICEF has procured and
made available 166 million doses o f OPV till May 2004. The vaccines delivered since the
project effectiveness (September 2003) were delivered within the stipulated five weeks
prior to the SIAs except for the March 2004 round (the supply was delayed due to EID
holidays inPakistan.)

12.     Pakistan's polio initiative i s guided by TAG, a group comprised o f global and
national polio experts. Based on review o f the surveillance data, T A G concluded that
Pakistan i s making satisfactory progress and i s on track to achieve polio eradication by
2005. However, in view o f the continued low intensity transmission o f wild polio virus,
T A G recommended to intensify SIA efforts during 2004 and 2005:


                                                                                              7

     0  Undertake an additional round o f NID in last quarter o f 2004; and increase the
        number o fNIDrounds from 2 to 4 in2005;
     0  Increase the number o f SNID rounds from 0 to 2 in2005;
     0  Undertake additional mop up operations in 2004 to cover areas not covered
        duringthe first halfo f2004; and
     0  Efforts to improve quality o f SIAs specially inNWFP and Punjab.

The GOP and the Global Technical Consultative Group (GTCG) have endorsed the
recommendations to intensify SIAs and have initiated actions to implement them.

Rationalefor the SupplementalCredit

13.     The proposed Supplemental Credit would finance the procurement o f extra OPV
requiredfor additional SIAs in October-December 2004 and 2005. The proposed credit is
consistent with the original project development objective and meets the requirement o f
OP13.20 on supplemental financing as outlined below:

    Despite achieving 95% coverage o f the targeted population in SIAs, low intensity
    transmission o f the wild polio virus persists. T A G recommended to intensify efforts
    o f SIAs by increasing the number o f rounds. The increased number o f rounds has
    increased the amount o f vaccine requiredand operational costs, placing new financial
    burden on the program. Given the limited resources and other competing priorities,
    the GOP is unable to secure additional financing for the procurement o f OPV.

    The GOP has explored alternate financing options including additional funds from
    other development partners but it has not been successful in the given time frame.
    Polio eradication i s largely financed by the development partners, who are now
    counting on the Bank's contribution (and actively seek to use the leverage o f the IDA
    buy down) for further financing o fthe eradication efforts;

    Overall project implementation progress has been satisfactory; all implementing
    agencies have adequately discharged their responsibilities, activities have been
    executed satisfactorily and the Borrower i s incompliance with the credit covenants.

    The original Credit is 95% disbursed and the remaining funds are fully committed for
    use in October 2004. As such, a reduction in the scope o f the original project i s not
    feasible; and

    Processing o f a free-standing project runs the risk o f disrupting the national and
    global polio eradication efforts both o f which are on accelerated timetables.

14.     Benefits:Procurement and supply o f additional OPV through the proposed credit
will assist inachieving the original project objective. The project will benefit all Pakistani
children below the age o f five, but it will most benefit poor and disadvantaged children.
The project will assist Pakistan to eliminate polio as a public health problem, freeing
resources for other sectoral priorities. As the project i s part o f the global effort to



                                                                                            8

eradicate polio world-wide, an effort that depends on the actions o f each country, its
benefits will go far beyond the national target group and the present and future world
populations.

Implementationof the ProposedSupplementalCredit

15.     ProjectCost and Financing:As inthe initialproject, IDA will be financing only
the first component o f PEI which will comprise "the Project". SIAs during October-
December 2004 and January-December 2005 will require 25 1.5 million doses o f OPV,
costing about U S $ 33.66 million (Annex 1). The GOP has been able to mobilize U S $
10.35 million from JICA, U S $0.90 million from its own resources and U S $ 0.90 million
from the existing IDA project. The shortfall o f US $21.51 million equivalent will be met
from the supplemental financing under the proposed project7. The breakdown o f the
project cost, project financing plan and disbursement schedule are outlined in Annex 2
and 2A.

16.     Implementation Arrangements and Procurement: The Supplemental Credit
does not require additional implementation capacity beyond what i s already inplace for
PEIand the existing project i.e. the existing public health structures at federal, provincial
and district level with oversight by the Ministry o f Health. The Supplemental credit will
be monitored through the existing monitoring mechanisms and already functional
surveillance system. The existing procurement and disbursement procedures applied
under the present project will continue. UNICEF will undertake the procurement and
supply o f OPV through its international procurement division, based in Copenhagen as
agreed in the present project. A new draft procurement agreement between the GOP and
UNICEFis being finalized.

17.     Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Simplified
acceptable financial management arrangements including accounting and reporting
systems are inplace for the project and will continue for the supplemental credit.

18.     ImplementationCompletionReport : An Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) will be preparedwithin six months after Credit closing.

19.     Environmental and Social Aspects: The project is not envisaged to cause
environmental risks. The environmental category for the supplemental credit i s C. The
project will significantly contribute to the eradication o f wild polio virus from the
environment.

20.     Social Aspects: The project has a strong poverty focus. Poor people living in
unsanitary conditions are at greatest risk for polio. In addition, children in poor families
tend to have the lowest immunization coverage. The project, by supporting SIAs will
target poor, remote and underprivileged communities, and children whose mothers are
unable to take them to health facilities due to restricted female mobility. Vitamin A i s
also administered to children as part o f SIAs. Vitamin A benefits the poor children               by

'The IDA project will only finance procurement of OPV, which is not dependant on financing by other
Development Partners as their financing i s not part o f the IDA project.

21.     Safeguard Policies: The supplemental credit as the initial project will support
SIAs in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a disputed area between India and Pakistan. By
financing the supplemental credit, IDA does not intend to make any conclusion on the
legal or any other status o f the disputedterritory or to prejudice the final determination o f
the parties' claim.

22.     Sustainability: GOP, the Provincial and the District Governments are fully
committed to polio eradication and the present project. The supplementary immunization
activities will end once polio i s eradicated globally, so there will be no need to sustain
SIAs and related costs. Polio eradication benefits are immeasurable because the disease
will be eradicated from the world and all transmission will cease.

23.     Risks:The biggest risk is that being a global public good it heavily depends on
each country doing their bit. Failure on the part o f one country will undermine the global
effort. Intensified SIA efforts may not interrupt low intensity transmission and may not
lead to polio eradication by end o f 2005. This could delay global polio eradication
requiringadditional efforts and funds. Inaddition, there is a risk o fweak implementation
and low quality o f SIAs. Until global eradication i s achieved, all countries will need to
maintain immunization. The GOP is fully committed to the project and the Polio
Eradication Initiative. It i s making all possible efforts including involvement o f all
possible stakeholders, three levels o f govemment and collaboration with regional
countries. Weak implementation i s being strengthened through the support o f the
development partners with provision o f intensive and highquality technical assistance.

Introduction
       This annex describes the arrangements for the implementation o f the IDA buy-
down mechanism for polio eradication projects, which aims to convert the terms o f a
normal IDA Development Credit to grant terms through provision o f additional external
donor resources under clearly defined performance criteria. Inthe context o f the Pakistan
Supplementary Credit for the Partnership for Polio Eradication Project, i s the second
operation utilizing this mechanism. The resources for the buy-down will become
available as a result o f an agreement between IDA and the United Nations Foundation
(UNF) with funding from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The buy-down
mechanism complies with IDA'Sexisting financial policies.

The Partnership
       The Bank's Health, Nutrition and Population Anchor explored the possibility o f
partnering with UNF and CDC to assist polio eradication by providing countries with
IDA financial resources but without IDA repayment obligations. The CDC through UNF
agreed to provide funds to an IDA-administered trust fund (the Polio Eradication Trust
Fundor PETF) that will buy down the debt incurredby recipient countries for successful
implementation o f polio eradication projects. In addition, to making commitment and
service charge payments to IDA on behalf o f the recipients during project
implementation, the PETF will, upon successful project implementation, buy down the
net present value o f the principal amount o f the development credit.

The Mechanism
       The IDA DCA will include two special previsions:

    1.     The PETFwill pay the applicable service charges and commitment charges, if
           any, and
    2.     The PETFwill buy down the principal amount of the credit upon successful
           completion o f the project (as determinedby the World Health Organization
           audit).

The buy-down will be funded by contributions to the PETF from the CDC through UNF.
The   buy-down     mechanism        operates   in three   stages-credit signing, project
implementation, and project completion. These stages are described below.

At Credit Signing
       IDA determine the discount rate (the prevailing SDR-basket Commercial Interest
Reference Rates (CIRR) o n the date o f credit signing) and the foreign exchange rate
(SDR:USD) that will be used to calculate the estimated net present value at final buy-
down. The PETF sets aside funds that are denominated in U S D and invested pending
disbursement. The set-aside amount equals IDA commitment and service charge


                                                                                        15

payments over the projected implementation period and the estimated amount needed to
buy downthe principal o fthe credit at the end o fthe implementationperiod. IDAhedges
the foreign exchange risk under its existing currency rebalancingmechanism.

DuringProjectImplementation
       Under the project, IDA, acting on a request from the recipient country, disburses
funds to UNICEF,the agency responsible for procuringthe polio vaccine. UNICEFin
tumsupplies the vaccines to the recipient government.

       The PETF pays the commitment and service charges on the disbursed amounts
duringthe implementation o fthe project.

       Ifthe implementationperiodis substantially longer than initiallyprojected, funds
required to pay service charges could exceed the funds set aside. However, the
investment income on the set-aside buy-down amount provides a cushion against this
risk. Ifthe implementation period exceeds five years, the responsibility for servicing the
credit will revert to the recipient country unless UNF grants an extension.

At Project Completion
       As in the original project, upon completion o f the project, WHO conducts a
performance audit to determine if the IDA funds achieved their intended results. The
performance audit measures the results for two indicators:

1.     Timely arrival o f OPV inthe country at the central level; and
2.     vaccination coverage for OPV duringthe vaccination campaigns.

       Ifthe WHO performance audit evaluates the project as satisfactory, the IDAbuy-
down will be triggered. The PETF will then pay o f f the IDA credit at the net present
value o f the credit based on the defined foreign exchange and discount rates to buy down
the principal o f this credit (Repayment Amount). IDA will inturncancel this credit and
release the recipient from any future liability. Ifthe credit i s not fully disbursed, the final
Repayment Amount will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. If the WHO performance
audit evaluates the project as unsatisfactory, the recipient remain obligated to pay back
IDA on the terms o fthe credit.
