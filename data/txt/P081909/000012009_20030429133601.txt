A. 
Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
project 
purpose 
is 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
(GOP) 
in 
eradicating 
Poliomyelitis 
from 
Pakistan. 
The 
project 
objective 
is 
to 
support the 
supply 
of 
the 
additional oral 
polio 
vaccine 
(OPV), 
needed 
during 
2003-05, 
for 
the 
country’s 
supplementary 
immunization 
activities 
(SIAs), 
i.e., 
for 
conducting 
National 
Immunization 
Days 
(NIDs), 
Sub-National 
Immunization 
Days 
(SNIDs) 
and 
“mop-up 
operations”. 
The 
project 
is 
part 
of 
a 
World 
Health 
Organization 
(WHO) 
led, 
multi-country 
effort 
and 
will 
contribute 
to 
a 
global 
public 
good, 
Le., 
the 
eradication 
of 
Polio 
from 
the 
world 
by 
2005. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
following two 
indicators 
will 
be 
used 
to 
measure 
project 
performance: 
0 
Timely 
arrival 
of 
the 
OPV 
at 
the 
central 
stores 
of 
GOP’s 
Expanded 
Program 
on 
Immunization 
(EPI), 
Islamabad, 
Le., 
at 
least 
five 
weeks 
before 
each 
of 
the 
SIAs; 
and 
SIA 
coverage 
of 
80% 
achieved 
in 
the 
remaining 
endemic 
provinces 
during 
2005. 
The 
timely 
arrival 
of 
the 
vaccine 
will 
be 
measured 
through 
the 
EPI’s 
vaccine 
arrival 
reports. 
SIA 
coverage 
will 
be 
measured 
through 
a 
cluster sampling 
survey 
according 
to 
a 
WHO 
approved 
methodology.  Achievement 
of 
these 
indicators 
will 
be 
a 
trigger 
for 
the 
IDA 
buy-down. 
(See 
section 
D.5). 
Also 
the 
number 
of 
reported 
polio 
cases 
will 
be 
an 
outcome 
of 
interest 
and 
will 
be 
reported 
through 
the 
Acute 
Flaccid 
Polio 
(AFP) 
Surveillance 
System. 
The 
details 
of 
key 
indicators 
for 
measuring 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
development objectives 
are 
described 
in 
Annex 
1. 
B. 
Strategic Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document 
number: 
22219-PAK 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
May 
15, 
2002 
General 
CAS 
Goals 
and 
Health 
Sector 
Related 
Objectives: 
The 
CAS, 
in 
support 
of 
GOP’s 
Interim 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
(I-PRSP), 
seeks 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
reforms 
to 
(i) 
strengthen 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
government 
effectiveness; 
(ii) 
improve 
the 
business 
environment 
for 
growth; and 
(iii) 
improve 
equity 
through 
support 
for 
pro-poor 
and pro-gender 
equity 
policies. 
In 
the 
social 
sectors, 
the 
CAS 
supports 
the 
core I-PRSP 
objectives 
of 
empowering 
people 
by 
creating 
opportunities 
for 
increasing 
incomes, 
promoting 
education, 
improving 
access 
to 
health 
services, 
and 
implementing 
safety net programs. 
In 
health, 
it 
seeks 
to 
support 
the 
key 
program 
interventions 
of 
immunization, communicable 
disease 
control, and maternal 
and 
child 
health 
programs. 
It 
also supports 
achievement 
of 
improved 
governance 
and 
increased 
efficiency 
of 
public 
sector 
expenditures 
through 
devolution 
of 
powers 
to 
local 
governments; 
strengthening 
of 
district health 
systems; 
improvement 
of 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation; 
and 
development 
of 
partnerships 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
proposed 
project 
supports 
the 
CAS 
objective 
of 
improving 
equity through supporting 
pro-poor 
policies, 
and 
CAS’S 
health 
sector 
priorities. 
The 
poor 
are 
at 
greatest 
risk 
from 
polio 
due 
to 
their 
unsanitary 
and crowded 
living 
conditions, 
lower 
health 
status, 
and 
low 
immunization 
coverage. 
Polio 
creates 
both 
short and 
long 
term 
impoverishment, 
severely 
limits 
the 
children’s 
future 
potential 
and 
reduces 
capacity 
to benefit 
from 
education and employment opportunities. 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
from 
Pakistan and 
contribute 
to 
its 
eradication 
from 
the 
world.

Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
While 
Pakistan’s 
health indicators 
have 
improved 
in 
the 
nineties, 
they 
remain 
weak 
relative to 
its 
per 
capita 
income 
of 
$440. 
The 
infant mortality 
rate 
of 
82/1000 
live 
births 
in 
2000101 
(Pakistan 
Integrated 
Household 
Survey 
2001/02) 
is 
among the 
highest 
in 
South Asia. 
Total 
fertility 
rate 
of 
4.8 
children 
per 
woman 
(Pakistan 
Reproductive 
Health 
and 
Family 
Planning 
Survey 
2000/01) 
is 
also 
highest 
except 
for 
Bhutan.  One 
out 
of 
30 
women 
dies 
in 
childbirth, 
and 
malnutrition 
among 
women 
and 
children 
continues 
to 
be 
a 
major 
cause 
of 
morbidity. 
Much 
of 
this 
mortality 
and 
morbidity 
is 
caused 
by 
preventable 
or 
readily 
treatable 
diseases, 
with 
40% 
of 
total 
disease 
burden 
related 
to 
communicable 
disease. 
(Pakistan: 
Towards 
Health 
Sector Strategy, 
World 
Bank 
1996). 
The 
health 
system, 
with 
an 
urban 
and curative 
bias, 
is 
characterized 
by 
(i) 
low 
(0.7% 
of 
the 
GDP) and 
inefficient public 
spending; 
(ii) 
uneven 
public 
and 
private 
service 
quality; 
(iii) 
lack 
of 
consumer 
protectiodeducation; 
(iv) 
lack 
of 
risk-pooling 
mechanisms; 
and 
(v) 
a 
weak regulatory framework. 
People’s 
dissatisfaction 
with 
public 
services 
is 
evident 
from 
their 
seeking 
80% 
of 
the 
outpatient 
care 
from 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
government 
tried 
to 
address 
several 
of 
the 
above 
weaknesses 
though 
the 
multi-donor 
supported, 
1992-2001, 
Social 
Action 
Program 
Project 
(SAPP), 
that focused 
on 
programmatic and 
management 
reforms, 
communicable 
disease 
control 
and 
maternal 
health. 
SAPP 
achieved 
limited 
success 
in 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
However, health 
outcomes 
improved 
with 
increased 
resource 
allocation 
for 
preventive 
and promotive 
program, especially 
immunization 
coverage 
of 
children 
which, 
for 
polio, 
is 
still 
around 
58% against 
the 
at-least 80% 
needed. 
Weakly 
implemented reforms, 
staff 
absenteeism, 
weak 
outputloutcome 
monitoring 
and deficient supervision 
impeded 
progress. 
Government’s 
Current 
Health 
Agenda: 
GOP’s 
broader 
devolution 
initiative 
aims 
at 
addressing 
key 
health 
issues 
by 
improving staff 
accountability, efficiency, 
service 
quality 
and 
coordination 
with 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
medium-term 
human 
development 
strategy, 
outlined 
in 
the 
I-PRSP 
and 
in 
the 
2001 
Health 
Policy, 
focuses 
on 
(i) 
strengthening 
preventive 
health 
services 
including 
immunization, 
communicable 
disease 
control, maternal and 
child 
health, 
and 
family 
planning; 
(ii) 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
hospital 
services 
at 
the 
tehsil 
(sub-district)  and 
district 
headquarters 
hospitals; 
and 
(iii) 
strengthening 
management 
capacity at 
the 
district 
level. 
GOP 
has 
increased 
financing 
for 
immunization 
and 
the 
routine 
immunization program 
is 
being 
strengthened. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
WHO-launched 
1988 
Global Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(GPEI), 
the 
largest 
public 
health 
effort 
in 
history, 
has 
been 
highly 
successful. 
By 
2002, 
polio 
cases 
had 
decreased 
by 
99%, 
from 
350,000 
in 
125 
countries 
to 
480 
in 
9 countries. 
However, 
ridding 
the 
world 
of 
this 
disease 
by 
immunizing 
the 
final 
1% 
potential 
cases, 
involves 
reaching 
the 
remotest 
and 
most 
unreachable 
populations 
and 
convincing 
those 
who 
doubt 
the 
vaccine’s 
benefits. 
On 
the other 
hand, because 
the 
number 
of 
polio 
cases 
is 
presently 
small 
in 
any 
one 
country, 
national 
governments 
tend 
to 
see 
polio 
as 
a 
lesser 
priority 
relative to more 
pressing 
health 
issues, 
such 
as 
rapid 
population 
growth or 
high 
infant 
mortality. 
Also 
exhaustion 
has 
set 
in 
among 
the 
governments, 
donors and 
communities 
because 
of 
the 
frequent, 
large-scale 
polio 
campaigns. 
However, 
polio 
eradication 
remains a 
global 
priority 
because 
a 
single 
infected 
child 
puts 
all 
the 
world’s 
children 
at 
risk 
of 
contracting 
the 
disease. 
Pakistan 
is, 
after 
India 
and 
Nigeria, 
the 
world’s 
third 
largest 
poliovirus 
reservoir. 
The 
Global Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(GPEI) 
has 
identified 
ten 
countries 
that 
would 
require 
intense 
and 
sustained 
efforts 
to 
interrupt 
polio 
transmission; Pakistan 
is 
one 
of 
these. 
Achieving 
polio 
eradication 
in 
Pakistan 
will 
be 
a 
-3- 
Page  8
major contribution to 
achieving eradication 
worldwide. 
Pakistan 
initiated 
polio 
immunization 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Expanded 
Program 
on 
Immunization 
(EPI) 
in 
1978. 
It 
started supplemental 
immunization 
activities 
(SIAs) 
in 
1994 
first 
with 
National Immunization 
Days 
(NIDs). 
It 
intensified 
these 
efforts 
from 
1999, 
introducing 
house-to-house 
immunization 
by 
trained 
vaccinators 
in 
2000 
and reaching 
five 
NID 
rounds that 
year, 
each 
round 
covering 
over 
30 
million 
children. 
It 
has 
conducted 
cross-border 
immunization 
activities 
with 
Afghanistan 
and 
Iran 
since 
1997. 
SIAs 
were 
further intensified 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
round 
of 
sub-national 
immunization 
days 
(SNIDs). 
The 
success 
of 
the 
program 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
declining 
number 
of 
confirmed 
Polio 
cases. 
These 
have decreased 
from 
1803

reaching 
and 
maintaining 
the 
highest 
possible 
routine 
polio 
immunization 
coverage 
(90% 
minimum) 
with 
at 
least 
three 
dozes 
of 
OPV; 
NIDs 
to 
deliver 
additional 
supplemental 
doses 
of 
OPV 
to 
all 
children 
below 
five 
years 
of 
age; 
surveillance 
to 
detect and investigate every 
case 
of 
acute 
flaccid 
paralysis (AFP) 
in 
children below 
15 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
all 
suspected 
polio 
cases 
regardless 
of 
age; 
SNIDs 
in 
areas 
with low 
immunization 
coverage 
and districts 
with 
persistent 
polio 
transmission; 
and 
limited 
mop-up 
rounds 
each 
year 
depending 
upon 
the 
circulation 
of 
virus 
earlier 
in 
the 
year. 
The 
intensified 
efforts 
include 
the development 
of 
UNICEF-supported 
community mobilization 
and a 
WHO-supported international-quality 
surveillance 
system. 
The 
latter 
has 
enabled 
the 
identification 
of 
specific 
districts 
with 
persistent 
virus 
circulation 
which 
has 
formed 
reservoirs, 
harboring 
the 
virus 
through 
the 
low 
transmission 
winter 
season, 
and 
re-infecting 
other 
areas 
in 
the 
high 
summer 
season. 
The 
distribution 
of 
cases 
indicates 
circulation 
of 
wild 
polio 
cases 
in 
only 
25 
of 
the 
120 
districts 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
clear 
identification 
of 
high-risk 
districts facilitates 
the 
targeting 
of 
these 
districts 
with 
the 
SNIDS. 
The 
country 
has 
also 
identified 
and 
targeted 
high-risk 
populations 
of 
Afghan 
refugees 
and 
inner 
city 
infants.

Polio 
An 
effective 
polio 
eradication 
program 
is 
in 
place 
in 
Pakistan. 
The Technical 
Advisory 
Group 
(TAG), 
which 
consists 
of 
reputed 
international 
and 
national 
experts 
and 
advises 
GOP 
on 
polio 
eradication, 
has 
noted 
(i) 
a 
sharp 
reduction 
of 
transmission 
in 
the reservoir 
areas; 
(ii) 
improvement 
in 
surveillance 
quality; 
(iii) 
successful 
implementation 
of 
SIAs’ 
high-risk 
area 
approach; 
and 
(iv) 
continued 
improvement 
in 
the 
quality of 
NIDs 
and 
SNIDS. 
It 
has 
also 
noted 
that 
high 
quality 
surveillance 
and 
laboratory 
data 
is 
driving 
the 
program, and that a 
solid 
structure 
is 
in 
place 
with 
the 
potential to provide 
broader 
benefits 
to immunization. 
Pakistan 
needs 
to 
make 
a 
final, 
strong 
push 
to 
achieve 
polio 
free 
status. 
It 
has 
the 
capacity 
and 
clear 
plans 
in 
place 
to 
achieve 
this 
through 
intensified 
efforts 
during 
2003-2005. 
The 
government 
is 
maintaining 
strong 
commitment 
and 
support 
to polio 
eradication, 
but 
given 
the 
pressures 
on 
its 
economy, 
requires 
external 
assistance 
to 
maintain 
the 
momentum. 
IDA 
would 
support 
the 
Pakistan 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI), 
and 
the 
global 
eradication efforts, 
in 
partnership 
with 
Bill 
and 
Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation, the 
Rotary 
International 
and 
the 
United 
Nations 
Foundation.

Strategic 
Choices: 
Polio 
can 
be 
eradicated 
through effective 
routine immunization 
services 
or 
through well-executed 
vaccination 
campaigns. 
The routine 
services 
have 
not proved 
equal 
to 
the 
task, 
and 
strengthening 
these 
services 
is 
a 
medium 
to 
long-term 
effort. 
So 
far, such 
efforts 
have 
met 
with 
mixed 
success 
in 
Pakistan. 
Routine 
coverage 
for OPV 
is 
about 
58% against 
the 
over 
80% needed 
to 
achieve 
interruption 
of 
transmission. 
At 
the 
present 
stage 
of 
eradication 
efforts, 
routine 
services 
can 
control 
the 
disease, 
prevent 
outbreaks 
and 
facilitate 
eradication. 
But 
the 
only 
strategy 
to 
interrupt 
poliovirus 
transmission 
and 
achieve 
eradication 
is 
the 
short-term, focused, 
high 
quality 
supplementary 
immunization 
activities 
(SIAs). 
During 
the 
last 
two 
years, 
SIAs 
have been 
effective 
in 
reaching out 
to 
the hard-to-reach and 
resistant 
populations. 
Accordingly, 
this 
project 
will 
support 
the 
SIAs 
to 
achieve 
polio 
free 
status 
in 
Pakistan 
by 
2005. 
The Government 
of 
Pakistan, 
supported 
by 
GAVI 
and 
other development 
partners, 
best supports 
strengthening 
of 
routine immunization through 
the 
on-going 
initiatives. 
IDA 
can 
support 
polio 
eradication 
in 
Pakistan through 
a 
normal 
IDA 
credit 
or 
the 
special 
IDA 
buy-down 
arrangement 
adopted 
for 
this 
project, and 
other 
similar 
projects 
in 
polio-endemic 
countries. 
This 
arrangement, 
on 
satisfactory 
project 
implementation, 
will 
reduce 
the 
IDA 
credit 
to 
grant 
terms. 
The 
buy-down 
arrangement 
is 
preferred 
over 
normal 
IDA 
credit 
because 
the 
decision 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
is 
a 
global 
decision and 
a 
global 
responsibility, and 
not 
only 
of 
the 
last 
few 
polio-endemic 
countries. 
Investing 
in 
eradicating 
the 
last 
few 
cases 
is 
less 
attractive 
than 
investing 
in 
programs 
with 
larger 
national 
pay-offs, 
such 
as 
reduced 
mortality 
or 
fertility. 
The 
additional 
support 
in 
grant 
funding 
will 
provide 
the 
incentive 
needed 
to 
address 
a 
disease 
with 
greater cross-border 
or 
global 
benefits 
than 
national 
ones. 
Further, 
the 
eradication 
of 
an 
infectious 
disease 
is 
a 
global 
public 
good. 
Once a 
disease 
is 
eradicated, 
every 
child 
born 
in 
the 
world 
is 
protected. 
Also 
the 
IDA 
buy-down 
mechanism, 
which 
will 
convert 
the 
credit 
into 
a 
grant 
only 
on 
satisfactory 
implementation, 
will 
encourage 
the 
government to 
focus 
on 
implementation 
and 
results. 
IDA 
can support 
OPV 
procurement 
or 
some 
or 
all 
components 
of 
SIAs. 
It 
will, 
however, 
finance 
only 
the 
OPV 
procurement and 
supply. 
A 
vaccination 
campaign, apart 
from 
the 
vaccines, has several 
components 
including 
social 
mobilization, 
logistics, 
monitoring 
and evaluation and 
program 
management. 
In 
Pakistan, 
these 
other components 
are 
financed 
by 
GOP and 
its 
other development 
partners 
including 
DFID, 
Government 
of 
Japan, 
the 
Netherlands, 
USAID, 
Center 
for 
Disease 
Control, 
Atlanta 
(CDC) 
and 
Rotary 
International. 
For 
the 
additional 
OPV 
needed 
for 
the 
SIAs, 
however, 
only 
partial financing 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
available 
from 
the 
Government 
of 
Japan, 
and 
CDC 
through 
UNICEF. 
Also 
given 
the 
planned timeframe 
of 
stopping transmission 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2003, 
it 
will 
be 
simpler 
and 
quicker 
to 
prepare, 
implement 
and 
monitor 
a single-component 
project, especially 
when 
other 
elements 
for 
successful 
SIAs 
are 
already 
in 
place.

Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex

for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
The 
project 
will 
support Pakistan's 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI) 
which 
has 
three 
components: 
(i) 
the 
procurement 
of 
OPV; 
(ii) 
supplemental operations 
comprising 
three 
main 
areas: 
cold 
chain, social 
mobilization 
and 
training; 
and 
(iii) 
surveillance. 
It 
will 
assist 
GOP 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2005, 
with 
an 
IDA 
support 
of 
$20.0 
million. 
This 
project 
will 
provide 
financing 
for 
only 
one 
component 
i.e. 
the 
procurement 
of 
OPV 
for 
immunizing 
all 
children 
up 
to 
five 
years 
of 
age, 
under 
Pakistan's 
PEI. 
IDA 
support 
will 
ensure 
timely 
procurement 
-6- 
Page  11
and 
adequate 
supply 
of 
OPV 
needed 
for 
the 
PEI 
during 
the 
period 
2003-2005. 
Vaccines 
will 
be 
procured 
through 
UNICEF 
for 
use 
in 
the 
NIDs, 
SNIDs 
and possible 
“mop-up” 
operations 
carried 
out 
during 
this 
period. 
UNICEF 
is 
an 
established 
agency 
for 
vaccine procurement and 
is 
already 
procuring 
the 
OPV 
for 
Pakistan.

and 
one 
mop-round 
in 
2004, 
and 
two 
NIDs 
in 
2005. 
The 
estimated 
need 
for 
the 
SIAs 
is 
for 
approximately 
393 
million 
doses 
at 
an 
estimated 
cost 
of 
$40.8 
million. 
IDA 
will 
finance 
OPV for 
$20.0 
million 
as 
the 
remaining 
$16.0 
million 
and 
$4.8 
million 
is 
expected 
from 
the 
Government 
of 
Japan 
and 
CDC 
through 
UNICEF 
respectively. 
The 
total 
OPV 
budget 
for 
January 2003 
to 
June 
2005 
is 
as 
follows: 
$21,746,320

The 
second 
component 
of 
the 
PEI 
i.e. 
Supplemental Operations 
has 
three 
main 
activities: 
maintenance 
of 
cold 
chain, 
social 
mobilization, 
and training. 
It 
seeks 
to 
reach 
every 
child 
up 
to 
five 
years 
of 
age, 
through 
expanded 
fixed-site 
and 
house-to-house 
OPV 
delivery, 
with 
special 
attention 
to 
reach the 
remotelresistant 
populations. 
Organizing 
such 
eradication 
campaigns 
is 
a 
complex 
logistical 
exercise. 
In 
Pakistan, 
the 
scale 
of 
the 
operation 
(over 
30 
million 
children 
to 
be 
immunized 
on 
an 
NID), 
the 
very 
short 
time 
frame 
(three 
days) 
with 
over 
90% 
of 
the 
immunization 
posts 
outside the 
primary 
health 
care 
facilities 
(schools, 
mosques, etc.) 
makes 
it 
even 
more 
challenging. 
Before 
each 
round 
of 
immunization, 
extensive 
micro-planning, 
social 
mobilization 
campaigns, 
cold 
chain 
maintenance, 
and 
training 
of 
the participants 
is 
conducted 
to 
ensure 
effective 
implementation. 
The needed 
infrastructure 
is 
in 
place and 
a streamlined 
system 
functions 
well. 
These 
operations almost 
regularly 
reach over 
95% 
of 
the 
target group. 
WHO, 
with 
its 
117 
member 
national 
and 
international 
staff, 
and 
UNICEF 
with 
its 
sizeable 
field 
presence 
support the 
polio 
eradication activities.

Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
project 
does 
not 
aim 
at 
major 
policy 
and 
institutional reform. 
IDA 
supports 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
in 
different 
sectors, 
including 
health, 
through 
the 
federal and 
provincial 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Credits 
(NWFP 
and 
Sindh). 
Also, 
the 
proposed 
HNIAIDS 
Prevention 
Project, 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
IDA, 
envisages addressing 
important 
sector 
issues 
including: 
controlling 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
to avoid 
it 
becoming 
a 
drain 
on 
scarce 
health 
resources; 
introducing 
a 
systematic 
approach 
to 
quality 
assurance, 
and 
establishing 
effective 
mechanisms 
for 
the govemment, 
NGO, 
and 
private 
sector 
collaboration. 
The 
present 
project 
basically 
finances 
the 
supply 
of 
oral 
polio 
vaccine 
(OPV) 
to 
support 
intensified 
supplemental 
immunization 
activities 
(SIAs) 
for 
polio 
eradication. 
It 
could, 
however, 
indirectly

health 
such 
as

in

Benefits and target population: 
The 
project 
will 
benefit 
all 
Pakistani 
children 
below 
the 
age 
of 
five. 
It 
will 
benefit 
especially 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged 
children, 
eventually 
all 
the 
world’s 
children, 
and 
the 
Pakistani 
population 
at 
large. 
The 
project 
has 
a 
strong 
poverty 
focus because 
those 
living 
in 
poor 
and 
unsanitary 
conditions 
are 
particularly 
susceptible 
to 
polio, 
and 
immunization 
coverage 
is 
lowest 
among 
these 
groups. 
The 
project, 
by 
supporting 
the 
NIDs 
and 
SNIDs, 
will 
target 
poor, remote and 
underprivileged 
communities. 
It 
will 
especially 
benefit children 
whose 
mothers 
are 
unable 
to 
take 
them 
to 
health 
facilities 
due 
to 
socio-cultural restrictions 
on 
female 
mobility. 
The 
participation 
of 
Lady 
Health 
Workers 
in 
these 
campaigns 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
poorest 
and 
the 
most 
vulnerable, especially 
the 
girls, 
get 
immunized 
against 
polio. 
Even 
children 
who 
do 
not 
receive 
immunization 
during 
the 
SIAs 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
“herd 
immunity” 
that 
results 
from 
the 
SIAs 
when 
a 
coverage 
of 
80% 
is 
achieved. 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
Pakistan 
in 
eliminating 
polio 
as 
a 
public 
health 
problem 
and 
free 
scarce 
resources 
for 
use 
on 
addressing 
other 
important 
sector 
issues. 
The 
prevention 
of 
disability 
would 
alleviate human 
suffering, 
and 
decrease 
economic loss and 
social 
burden 
caused 
by 
the 
disease. 
However 
all 
the 
above 
benefits 
can 
be 
achieved 
only 
if 
the 
SIAs 
are 
implemented 
effectively 
and, 
as 
planned, 
Pakistan 
achieves 
WHO 
poliofree 
certification. 
The 
repeated 
SIAs 
campaigns 
in 
Pakistan have 
led 
to 
the 
development 
of 
substantial 
capacity 
in 
planning 
and managing 
community 
based 
interventions, 
epidemiology, social 
mobilization, 
diagnostic 
services 
to 
support 
public 
health 
interventions 
and other 
technical 
areas. 
This 
capacity 
will 
eventually 
strengthen 
the 
health 
system 
through 
more 
effective implementation 
of 
other 
public 
health 
interventions and 
thereby 
benefit 
the 
general 
population. 
Vitamin 
A 
is 
distributed 
during 
the 
NIDs 
in 
Pakistan. 
Provision 
of 
Vitamin 
A 
reduces 
the 
blindness 
incidence among 
children 
and 
reduces 
infant mortality 
generally. 
Combining 
Vitamin 
A 
with 
the 
NIDs 
increases 
their 
benefit 
to 
poor 
children who 
are 
most at-risk 
of 
the 
Vitamin 
A 
deficiency. 
The 
project 
is 
part 
of 
a 
global 
effort 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
world-wide. 
Such 
eradication 
is 
a 
global 
public 
good. 
Therefore 
the 
benefits 
of 
this 
project 
go 
far beyond 
the 
national 
target 
group, 
and 
will 
include 
the 
present 
and 
future 
world 
populations. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
and 
monitored 
through 
the 
existing 
government 
structures 
that 
implement 
the Pakistan 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI), 
i.e., 
through 
the 
Expanded 
Program 
on 
Immunization 
(EPI). 
To 
ensure 
timely 
procurement and 
supply 
of 
the 
OPV 
to 
the 
EPI 
and 
to 
monitor 
its 
effective 
use, 
the 
following 
arrangements 
will 
be 
in 
place. 
Procurement: 
OPV 
will 
be 
procured 
and 
supplied 
to 
the 
EPI 
by 
UNICEF 
under an 
agreement 
between 
the 
GOP and 
UNICEF. 
A 
draft 
agreement 
for 
the purpose 
has 
been 
finalized. 
UNICEF’s 
international 
procurement 
division, 
based 
in 
Copenhagen, 
will 
undertake 
the 
procurement 
following 
UNICEF’s 
procurement 
procedures. 
The 
National 
Program 
Manager, 
EPI 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
receiving 
the 
OPV 
in 
Islamabad 
and 
for 
its 
in-country 
storage, 
distribution, 
administration 
and 
use. 
Vaccine 
requirements 
are 
forecast 
by 
the 
National 
Program 
Manager 
EPI 
based 
on 
the latest 
estimates 
of 
the 
population 
of 
children 
under 
five 
years, 
and the 
number 
of 
doses 
to 
be 
given 
per 
child 
during 
a 
given 
year. 
The 
requirements 
are 
estimated 
with 
technical 
support 
from 
WHO, 
UNICEF 
and 
TAG 
and 
are 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Inter-Agency 
Coordination 
Committee 
(ICC). 
The 
program 
requirements 
of 
OPV 
for 
the 
-9- 
Page  14
years 
2003-05 
are 
209 
million 
doses 
for 
2003, 
105 
million 
dozes 
for 
2004, 
and 
79 
million 
dozes 
for 
2005. 
Financial 
Management: 
Simplified 
financial 
management arrangements 
are 
appropriate 
for 
this 
project. 
The 
project 
does 
not 
envisage 
direct involvement 
of 
the 
Borrower 
in 
the 
management 
and 
accounting 
of 
funds. 
UNICEF 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
these 
functions 
under the 
agreement 
for 
OPV 
supply. 
The credit 
proceeds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
directly 
to 
UNICEF on 
receipt 
of 
withdrawal 
applications 
from 
the 
Borrower. 
Expenditure 
will 
be 
incurred 
only 
on 
items 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
agreement 
including 
OPV 
costs, 
freight, 
and 
handling 
charges. 
UNICEF 
will 
submit 
semi-annual 
financial 
reports 
to 
GOP, 
with 
a 
copy 
to 
IDA, 
in 
an 
agreed 
format 
that 
tracks 
funds 
disbursed, 
vaccines 
purchased 
and 
number 
of 
children 
immunized. 
IDA 
will 
use 
these 
reports 
to 
monitor 
the 
outstanding 
balance and 
the 
funds 
received 
and 
spent 
by 
UNICEF. 
Also, 
these 
reports 
will 
enable 
IDA 
to 
verify 
the 
expenditures 
before 
subsequent disbursements. 
GOP 
will 
be 
able 
to 
confirm 
to 
IDA 
the 
receipt 
of 
the quantities 
of 
OPV 
indicated 
in 
these 
reports. 
GOP 
will 
also 
submit 
to 
IDA 
semiannual 
utilization 
of 
the 
vaccines 
received. 
GOP 
is 
not 
required 
to 
appoint an 
independent 
external auditor 
or 
to 
submit 
an audit 
report 
of 
the 
annual 
financial 
statements. 
However, 
the 
Association 
retains 
the 
option 
to 
request 
for 
an 
audit. 
Supplemental 
Immunization Activities 
(SIAs): 
The 
OPV 
procured 
and 
supplied 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
used 
for 
the 
SIAs 
which 
are 
organized and 
implemented 
as 
follows. 
Polio 
eradication 
is 
integrated 
within 
the 
Expanded Program 
on 
Immunization 
(EPI). 
The 
Federal 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
implements 
the 
program 
at the 
national 
level 
through the Federal 
EPI 
Cell, 
and 
with 
technical 
support 
from 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF. 
The 
National 
Program 
Manager, EPI, 
is 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
the 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI) 
and 
SIAs. 
A 
WHO 
team consisting 
of 
a 
CDC 
seconded senior 
epidemiologist, 
a senior 
program 
administrator, 
an 
NID 
controller, an 
EPI 
expert, 
a 
statistician, 
a 
social 
mobilization 
expert 
and 
a 
logistician, 
assists 
the 
National 
Program 
Manager, 
EPI. 
The 
Provincial 
Program 
Manager, 
EPI 
provides 
the 
technical 
and 
managerial 
leadership 
under 
the 
guidance 
of 
the 
Director-General, 
Health 
Services, 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
planning, implementing, 
monitoring 
and evaluating the 
SIAs 
at 
the 
provincial 
level. 
At 
the 
District 
level, 
the 
program 
is 
implemented 
through 
the 
district 
health 
services 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
Executive 
District 
Health 
Officer 
(EDHO). 
EDHO 
and 
the 
district 
EPI 
officers 
undertake 
detailed 
micro 
planning 
to 
ensure 
that 
volunteers, 
health 
and other department 
staff 
and 
transport 
are 
available 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
vaccination 
campaign. 
They 
also 
verify 
that 
calculations 
on 
the 
logistics 
forms 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
target 
population, 
number 
and 
location 
of 
NID 
posts, 
cold 
chain 
needs, 
and 
ice 
requirements 
are 
accurate. 
This 
process 
is 
facilitated 
and 
supported 
by 
the 
Provincial 
and 
Federal 
Program 
Managers 
and 
by 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF 
local 
consultants. 
Coordination 
Committees 
at 
the 
federal, 
provincial 
and 
district 
levels 
include 
government 
officials 
of 
related 
departments, 
local 
political 
and social 
leaders, 
and representatives 
of 
the 
NGOs 
and donors. 
The 
Federal 
MOH 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
procurement, 
storage 
and 
supply 
of 
vaccines, 
cold 
chain 
equipment, 
syringes, 
needles, 
social 
mobilization 
(air 
time 
costs) 
and 
for 
transport. 
The Provincial 
Departments 
of 
Health 
bear 
the 
cost 
of 
staff, 
training, health 
education, 
stationary, 
POL 
(petrol, 
oil, 
lubricants), 
and contingencies. 
A 
national 
level 
Inter-Agency 
Coordination 
Committee 
(ICC), 
chaired 
by 
the 
Secretary 
Health 
coordinates 
partner 
agency 
and national 
support 
to 
the 
EPI 
and 
polio 
eradication activities, 
mobilizes 
resources 
for polio 
eradication, 
advises 
the 
government 
on polio 
related 
policies and reviews 
progress 
towards 
polio 
er'adication. 
Similar 
committees 
function 
at 
the 
provincial level 
chaired 
by 
the 
provincial 
-10- 
Page  15
Secretaries 
or 
Directors 
General 
Health 
Services. 
At 
the 
district 
level, 
Coordination 
Committees 
are 
chaired 
by 
the 
EDHO, 
and 
attended 
by 
the 
District 
Coordination 
Officer 
and 
staff 
from 
other 
departments. 
District-level 
committees 
meet 
monthly, 
and 
more frequently 
close 
to 
the 
actual 
campaigns. 
The 
polio 
eradication 
campaigns 
require 
efficient 
organization 
and 
mobilization 
of 
resources. 
The 
mass 
media, 
religious 
and 
community 
leaders 
play 
a 
key role 
in 
raising 
awareness 
and 
mobilizing 
the 
public. 
Schoolteachers, 
community 
members 
and 
Lady 
Health 
Workers 
are 
all 
involved 
in 
giving 
oral 
vaccine. 
UNICEF 
provides 
strong support 
to 
the 
social 
mobilization 
component 
of 
the 
campaigns. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation: 
SIA 
coverage 
is 
monitored 
by 
an 
analysis 
of 
tally 
sheets 
recording 
the 
number 
of 
children 
immunized 
against 
the 
number 
in 
the 
target 
group. 
The 
1998 
population 
census 
figures 
are 
used 
along 
with 
growth 
rate 
projections 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
fairly 
accurate 
target 
group 
number. 
Output 
monitoring 
is 
undertaken at 
the 
provincial 
level 
and 
the 
impact 
is 
monitored 
at 
the 
national 
level 
through 
the 
AFP 
surveillance 
system. 
Third 
party 
monitoring 
is 
undertaken 
through 
an 
independent 
agency 
which 
monitors 
the 
quality 
of 
SIAs 
in 
the 
high-risk 
and 
other 
selected 
districts. 
The 
Technical 
Advisory Group 
(TAG) 
meets 
periodically 
and 
assesses 
progress. 
It 
analyses 
the 
polio 
eradication 
situation 
and 
provides 
recommendations 
to 
give 
strategic 
directions 
to 
the 
operations. 
These 
reports 
along 
with 
the 
periodic 
assessments 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
SIAs 
are also 
used 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
purposes. 
Surveillance: 
Surveillance 
quality 
in 
Pakistan 
has 
achieved 
and 
maintained international 
standards 
for 
quality 
in 
key 
indicators 
since 
2000. 
This 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
deployment 
of 
WHO 
supported 
surveillance 
officers 
(SOs) 
throughout 
the 
country, 
now 
totaling nearly 
60. 
They 
visit 
key 
reporting 
sites; 
undertake 
advocacy 
meetings 
with 
physicians, 
unregistered 
health 
care 
practitioners and 
faith 
healers; 
and 
conduct 
training 
workshops 
for 
district 
surveillance 
coordinators 
and vaccinators. 
Surveillance 
goes 
through 
periodic 
international 
quality 
reviews. 
D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
The 
project 
is 
one 
of 
several 
similar 
projects 
aimed 
at 
polio 
eradication 
in 
polio-endemic 
countries, 
to 
be 
financed 
through 
a 
partnership 
among 
the 
World 
Bank, the 
Bill 
& 
Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation, Rotary 
International 
and 
the 
United 
Nations 
Foundation. 
Bank’s 
partners 
will 
“buy 
down” 
the net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
credit 
once 
the 
credit 
has 
been 
satisfactorily 
used. 
Different 
project 
alternatives, 
such 
as 
financing 
a 
different 
component, 
some 
or 
all 
of 
the 
components 
of 
the 
Pakistan’s 
Polio 
Eradication Initiative, 
were 
considered.  These 
were 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
financing 
the 
OPV 
procurement 
and 
supply 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
Other 
components, 
such 
as 
surveillance, 
social 
mobilization 
and logistics, 
are 
being 
well 
supported 
and other 
multilateral 
agencies 
are 
better 
positioned 
to 
continue 
financing 
those components. 
WHO 
receives 
large 
sums 
annually 
from 
bilateral 
donors 
for 
those 
components. 
UNICEF, 
the 
other 
main 
partner, supports 
logistics and 
operations. 
A 
clear 
financing 
gap 
exists 
for 
the 
OPV 
needed 
for 
the 
SIAs 
during 
2003-05. 
Rotary International, 
a 
key 
partner 
and 
co-financier 
of 
this 
project, 
preferred 
this 
specific 
use 
of 
the 
funds. 
Simplicity 
of 
project 
design 
is 
especially 
important 
given 
the 
IDA 
buy-down 
mechanism 
and 
the 
limited 
time 
frame 
for 
preparation and 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
-11

Page  16
The 
alternative 
of 
procuring 
the 
vaccines 
through 
the 
government 
was 
considered.  Because 
this 
project 
is 
one 
of 
an 
international 
series, 
and 
because 
specific 
financing 
arrangements have 
been 
agreed among 
the 
partners, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
organize procurement and supply 
through 
UNICEF, 
an 
agency 
well 
recognized 
for 
its 
expertise 
in 
vaccine procurement. 
An 
alternative 
would 
be 
to 
invest 
in 
strengthening 
the 
routine 
program. 
Routine immunization 
coverage 
remains 
low 
in 
Pakistan and 
it 
is 
known 
that 
the 
high 
and 
increasing 
coverage 
of 
supplemental 
activities 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
rapid 
decline 
in 
polio 
cases. 
The 
project 
builds 
on 
that 
strength. 
Also 
strengthening 
routine immunization 
is 
a longer-term, 
program 
type 
intervention 
and 
not 
the 
most 
appropriate 
for 
polio 
eradication, 
where 
immediate 
results 
are 
sought.  SAPP-2 
is 
a 
more 
suitable 
vehicle 
for 
that approach and 
is 
already 
addressing 
the 
strengthening 
of 
routine 
immunization.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
Globally 
polio 
eradication 
is 
benefiting 
from 
some 
of 
the 
important 
lessons 
learnt 
from 
smallpox 
eradication. 
While 
the 
objective 
is 
eradication, 
the 
program 
focus 
is 
more 
on 
disease 
surveillance than 
on 
immunization 
coverage. 
Flexible 
eradication 
strategies 
are 
driven 
by 
regular and 
good quality 
surveillance 
data. 
For 
example, 
Pakistan 
is 
employing 
SIAs 
flexibility, 
based 
on 
surveillance 
data 
indicating 
the 
main 
disease 
pockets. 
A 
similar 
approach 
is 
planned 
for 
"mopping-up" 
the 
final 
cases 
as 
eradication 
nears. 
The 
project 
design 
reflects 
the 
lessons 
from 
earlier 
IDA-supported 
HNP 
projects 
in 
the 
South 
Asia 
region: 
0 
0 
Keep 
the 
project 
design 
simple 
and 
well-defined. 
IDA 
support 
will 
focus 
on 
a 
single 
component 
of 
the 
polio 
eradication program. 
Use 
of 
a 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
may 
undermine 
the 
regular 
structures 
in 
a 
Ministry. 
The 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
using 
the 
existing 
structures 
and 
institutions 
in 
place 
for 
implementation 
of 
routine immunization 
and 
PEI 
activities. 
Establish 
good 
coordination 
with 
the 
other 
partners. 
The 
Resident 
mission 
has 
a senior 
health 
specialist 
who 
will 
provide 
technical 
support 
locally 
and participate 
in 
the 
Inter-Agency 
Coordination 
Committee 
meetings. 
0 
Other 
relevant 
lessons 
from 
the 
completed projects 
in 
Pakistan, 
especially 
from 
the 
SAPP, 
are: 
Focus on 
aualitv: 
SIAs 
provide 
house-to-house, 
convenient 
immunization 
services; 
the 
objective 
itself 
is 
to 
achieve 
a 
coverage 
of 
over 
90% 
of 
children 
in 
the 
targeted districts. 
Decentralize, streamline 
and shift 
to 
community control: 
The 
project involves 
repeated, large-scale 
efforts through 
full 
involvement 
of 
the 
community. 
Without 
such 
community 
support, 
this 
project 
can 
not 
be 
successfully 
implemented. 
Improve 
monitorinp 
and 
evaluation 
and 
the 
value and timeliness of feedback: 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
achieve 
polio 
eradication 
through 
focused, large-scale campaigns 
that 
utilize 
surveillance 
data 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
planning.  Strong 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
on-going 
campaigns 
using 
third 
party 
drives

Address

Sustainability 
will 
not 
be 
an 
issue 
in 
this 
project aimed 
at 
eradication 
of 
the 
disease, 
polio, 
which 
will 
also 
contribute 
to 
its 
eradication 
from 
the 
world. 
Build 
political 
will 
throughout 
the society: 
Repeated 
community participation 
in 
campaigns 
beside 
the 
government 
officials 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
conducive 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
such 
political 
will 
in 
the 
society. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and ownership: 
The 
EPI 
program, established 
in 
1985 
in 
Pakistan, 
is 
a 
high 
priority 
program 
of 
the 
Federal 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the 
Provincial 
Departments 
of 
Health. 
EPI 
was one 
of 
the 
seven 
federally-funded 
public 
health 
programs 
included 
in 
the 
Second 
Social 
Action 
Program Project 
(SAPP-2), 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other 
development partners. 
PEI 
is 
implemented 
through 
the 
existing 
EPI 
program. 
The 
government 
is 
fully 
committed 
to 
eradicating 
polio. 
Recent 
financial 
constraints that 
cut 
into 
public 
health 
expenditure 
largely 
spared 
the 
EPI 
program.  President 
Musharraf 
personally participated 
in 
the 
2002 
spring 
round 
of 
the 
National Immunization 
Day 
(NID). 
The 
Minister 
of 
Health, 
participated 
in 
the 
ICC 
meeting 
and 
high-level 
advocacy 
meetings 
to 
champion 
the 
eradication 
initiative. Overall 
the 
PEI 
enjoys 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
political 
and 
community 
support.

Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
Pakistan’s 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
has 
been a 
major 
national 
effort 
since 1994, 
and 
has 
been 
supported 
by 
several donors. 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF 
are 
the 
lead 
technical 
partners 
for 
polio 
eradication 
globally 
and 
in 
Pakistan. 
Through 
them, 
the 
donors 
are 
providing 
grant 
funds 
for 
the 
operations, 
surveillance 
and 
vaccine 
costs. 
An 
additional 
$20.0 
million 
is 
needed 
to 
meet 
the 
vaccine 
requirements 
for 
2003-2005. 
IDA 
will 
meet 
this 
gap 
through 
a 
normal credit 
that 
will 
be 
reduced 
to 
grant 
funding 
through 
an 
innovative 
IDA 
Buy-down 
mechanism. 
Following 
an 
appeal 
from 
the 
Global 
Polio 
Eradication 
Technical 
Advisory 
Committee, the Bank, 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
Gates 
Foundation 
(GF), 
Rotary 
International 
(RI) 
and 
UN 
Foundation, 
has 
developed the 
IDA 
Buy-down 
financing 
mechanism 
to 
support 
intensified 
polio 
eradication activities 
in 
polio-endemic 
countries. 
These 
countries 
are: 
Afghanistan, Pakistan 
and 
India 
in 
South 
Asia 
and 
Nigeria 
and 
Angola 
in 
the 
Africa 
Region. 
A 
Polio 
Eradication 
Trust 
Fund, 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
GF 
and 
RI 
and 
managed 
by 
the 
World 
Bank, 
has 
been 
established. 
The 
Trust 
Fund 
will 
pay 
the 
service 
fee 
for 
the 
Credit 
during 
the 
implementation 
and 
buy 
down 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
IDA 
Credit, 
reducing 
it 
to 
grant 
terms, 
when 
the 
projects 
are 
successfully 
completed. 
Thus 
IDA 
Credit to 
Pakistan 
will 
in 
effect 
be 
a 
grant 
for polio 
eradication. 
Since 
the 
partners 
will 
buy 
the 
credit 
at 
the 
Net 
Present 
Value, 
it 
enables 
them 
to leverage 
their 
funds 
for 
financing 
polio 
eradication 
in 
Pakistan 
and 
elsewhere: 
they 
need 
about 
a 
third 
of 
the 
funds 
they 
would 
otherwise 
need 
to 
finance 
the 
same 
goods 
and 
services. 
Through 
the 
partnership, 
they 
are 
also 
able 
to 
access 
the 
rigor 
of 
Bank’s 
project 
preparation 
and 
supervision 
in 
support 
of 
their 
efforts 
for 
polio 
eradication. 
Bank 
will 
pilot, 
through 
this 
project, 
a 
new 
financing 
approach 
to 
encourage 
urgent 
action 
on 
a 
global 
public 
good 
with 
significant 
externalities. 
This 
approach 
will 
enable 
the 
Bank to 
engage 
public 
and 
private 
partners 
in 
a 
common global 
cause.

Justifzcation: 
Using 
standard 
public

criteria, 
public 
involvement 
in 
and 
financing 
of 
the 
Supplementary 
Immunization Activities 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
is 
justified. 
Control 
of 
an 
infectious 
disease 
is 
a 
classic 
example 
of 
a 
public 
good 
for 
health. 
Global 
eradication 
is 
a 
global public 
good 
with 
high 
externalities. 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
ERR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
Because 
of 
the 
diversity 
of 
the communities, government 
administrative levels 
and partners that 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Global 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(GPEI), 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
accurately 
quantify 
the value 
of 
the 
financial 
and 
in-kind 
expenditures 
within 
a 
country. 
After 
quantifying 
the 
number 
of 
NIDs 
volunteer hours 
per 
country, 
wage rates 
from 
the 
year 
2000 
World 
Development Indicators statistical 
database 
were 
applied 
to 
establish a 
monetary 
value 
for 
the 
‘volunteer’ 
effort. 
Based 
on 
these 
calculations, 
according 
to 
a 
forthcoming 
WHO 
study, 
between 
1988 
and 
2005, 
world-wide 
polio 
endemic countries 
will 
have 
contributed 
at least US$2.35 
billion 
in 
volunteer 
time 
alone 
for polio 
eradication activities. 
These 
calculations 
do 
not 
account 
for 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
the 
volunteer 
time. 
They 
also 
do 
not 
reflect 
the 
substantial government 
resources 
used 
at 
the 
national, 
provincial, 
district 
and 
community 
levels 
to 
pay 
for 
petrol, social 
mobilization, 
training 
and 
other 
-14- 
Page  19
activities. 
Between 
1988 
and 
2005, 
external 
sources 
will 
have 
provided 
at 
least 
US$2.75 
billion 
to polio 
endemic 
countries 
to 
support 
eradication 
strategy 
implementation 
cost. 
This 
included 
OPV 
procurement 
and 
operational 
costs 
for 
supplemental 
immunization 
activities 
including 
cold 
chain 
refurbishment, 
training 
and social 
mobilization. 
The 
strengthening 
of 
surveillance 
has absorbed 
external 
resources 
for 
vehicles, 
computers, 
other 
equipment, 
supplies, 
training, 
personnel 
and related 
costs. 
External 
resources 
are 
also 
used 
for 
the 
certification 
and 
containment 
processes, 
advocacy 
and 
resource 
mobilization, 
documentation, meetings 
and 
administration. 
Different 
mechanisms 
are 
used 
to 
channel 
these 
resources 
to 
polio-endemic 
countries, 
primary 
ones 
being 
multilateral 
funding 
through 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF, 
and 
direct 
bilateral 
funding. 
Normal 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
does 
not 
easily 
apply 
to 
disease 
eradication. 
While 
the 
costs 
of 
eradicating 
the 
last 
case 
of 
polio 
are 
very 
high 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
by 
then 
very 
low 
burden 
of 
the 
disease, 
the 
benefits 
of 
successful 
eradication 
are 
infinite. 
The 
disease 
will 
be 
extinct 
from 
the 
world 
for-ever, 
unless 
a 
man-made 
mistake 
or 
a 
disaster 
causes 
it 
to 
reappear. 
However, 
ceasing 
immunization 
seems 
no 
longer 
a 
straightforward option. 
The 
recent 
increase 
in 
terrorist 
threats 
has 
impacted 
the 
development 
of 
post-eradication 
certification 
strategies. 
WHO 
estimates 
that 
if 
eradication 
is 
not 
achieved, even 
with 
improved 
routine 
immunization 
coverage, 
the 
burden 
of 
disease 
due 
to 
polio would 
be 
significant. 
Between 
2001 
and 2040 
there 
would 
be 
10.6 
million 
new 
cases 
of 
polio 
worldwide, 
representing 
the loss 
of 
60 
million 
DALYs 
(discounted 
at 
3%), 
nearly 
all 
of 
which 
would 
occur 
in 
low-income developing 
countries. 
Eradication 
would 
result 
in 
cost 
savings 
in 
all 
countries 
in 
which 
OPV 
is 
currently 
used, 
if 
polio 
vaccination 
were 
to 
stop 
in 
2010. 
Even 
in 
the 
‘worst 
case’ 
scenario, 
in 
which 
OPV 
may 
be replaced 
with 
a 
universal 
IPV 
strategy, 
the 
cost 
per 
DALY 
saved 
would 
be 
low, 
at 
approximately 
US$50 
per 
discounted 
DALY 
saved 
in 
developing 
countries. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
Present 
efforts 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
world-wide 
are 
financially 
supported 
by 
a 
large group 
of 
bilateral 
and 
private 
donor 
agencies, 
mainly 
under 
the 
coordination 
of 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF. 
These 
two 
agencies also 
provide 
technical 
support 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
eradication efforts. 
The 
polio-endemic 
countries 
provide 
about 50 percent 
of 
the 
financing, 
mainly 
through human 
resources 
and recurrent 
costs. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
procurement 
of 
the 
OPV. 
The 
quantity 
of 
vaccine 
procured 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
needs 
identified 
by 
the 
polio 
surveillance.  There remains a 
risk 
that 
eradication 
will 
be 
delayed, 
requiring 
additional 
funds 
in 
the 
future. 
In 
that 
case, 
additional 
funds 
will 
also 
be 
needed 
for 
the 
program 
support. 
Commitment 
to 
polio 
eradication 
is 
high 
and continuous 
future 
support 
from 
the 
global 
community 
is 
likely. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
Financial 
sustainability 
is 
not 
an 
issue 
since 
the supplementary 
activities 
of 
the 
polio 
eradication 
program 
will 
end 
with 
the 
disease. 
Improved 
surveillance 
systems 
set 
up 
for 
poliomyelitis 
will 
need 
to 
be 
integrated 
in 
regular 
operations 
of 
the 
health 
sector, 
in 
terms 
of 
functioning 
and financing. 
There 
is 
anecdotal evidence 
of 
positive 
synergies 
between 
the 
polio 
eradication 
program 
and 
health 
systems, 
but 
these 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
fully 
exploited. 
-15-

3. 
Technical: 
There 
are 
several reasons 
why 
polio 
can and 
should 
be 
eradicated: 
(i) 
there 
is 
no 
animal 
reservoir 
to 
sustain the 
disease; 
(ii) 
the 
virus 
has 
a 
limited 
persistence 
in 
the 
environment; 
(iii) 
there 
is 
no 
long-term 
camer 
state; 
(iv) 
permanent 
immunity 
is 
provided 
following 
infection; and 
(v) 
a 
safe, 
highly 
effective, 
and easily administered vaccine 
is 
available. 
Polio 
causes 
paralysis, 
most 
frequently 
in 
children, and 
between 
5-10% 
of 
cases 
die 
when 
the 
breathing 
muscles 
are 
paralyzed. 
Polio 
is 
incurable 
and 
its 
effects 
are 
largely 
irreversible. 
There 
has 
been a delay 
in 
meeting 
the 
global 
eradication 
target 
for 
the 
year 
2000. 
This 
is 
not 
unlike 
similar 
experiences 
in 
the 
Americas 
(9 
months 
late, 1991) 
or 
the 
Western 
Pacific 
Regions 
(2 
years 
late, 
1997). 
Pakistan 
is 
still 
on 
target 
to 
meet 
the 
Global 
Strategic Plan’s 
revised 
target 
of 
2005. 
The 
eradication 
strategies 
are 
proving 
successful. 
At 
this 
point 
in 
the 
initiative, 
the 
most 
significant 
risks 
are: 
(1) 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
routine immunization 
services; 
(2) 
the 
possibility 
that 
political 
support 
may 
decline; 
and 
(3) 
uncertainty 
about 
continued 
funding. 
GOP’s 
three 
year strategic 
plan 
for 
the 
Polio 
Eradication Initiative, 
was 
reviewed 
during 
the 
appraisal 
together 
with 
WHO 
and other 
donors. 
The 
review 
clearly 
indicated 
that 
the 
government 
is 
keen 
on 
improving 
routine 
EPI 
services, 
that 
political 
commitment 
to polio 
eradication 
both 
at 
the 
federal and 
provincial 
levels 
remains 
strong, 
and 
that donors 
are 
willing 
to 
support 
the 
program, 
with 
the 
needed 
funds, 
through 
its 
final 
push 
to 
achieve 
eradication. 
4. 
Institutional: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
project 
will 
be 
implemented through 
the 
existing 
federal, 
provincial, 
and 
district 
structures 
implementing 
the 
routine immunization 
and 
the 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI). 
No 
new 
structures 
will 
be 
created. 
The Federal 
EPI 
cell 
manages 
the 
national 
immunization 
program 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
project 
execution 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
It 
is 
a 
relatively 
strong 
unit 
with 
adequate 
technical 
support, 
from 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF, 
for 
program 
planning, 
surveillance, 
social 
mobilization 
and 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
Other partners 
supporting 
the PEI, 
such 
as 
DFID, 
have 
carried 
out 
institutional reviews 
of 
the 
federal, 
provincial 
and 
local 
structures 
involved 
in 
the execution. 
They 
support 
capacity 
building 
and 
overall 
program 
strengthening 
activities. 
The 
Bank 
will 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
partners 
and 
will 
keep 
informed 
of 
the 
relevant 
institutional 
issues. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
No 
new 
management 
structures 
will 
be 
created 
for 
the 
project. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
OPV 
will 
be procured 
through 
UNICEF. 
The 
Bank 
has 
accepted 
that 
UNICEF 
will 
use 
its 
own 
procedures 
for 
the 
procurement and 
delivery 
of 
the 
OPV. 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
and 
UNICEF 
have 
finalized 
the 
text 
of 
a 
draft 
agreement, 
to 
be 
entered 
into 
between 
them, 
for 
this 
purpose. 
There 
are 
no 
significant 
procurement 
issues. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
-

Page  21
As 
this 
project 
does 
not 
require 
direct involvement 
of 
the 
Borrower 
in 
the 
disbursement 
of 
IDA 
credit, 
and 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
directly to 
UNICEF, 
there 
are 
no 
significant financial 
management 
issues. 
Assurance 
that 
the 
Bank’s 
fiduciary 
requirements 
are 
met, 
especially 
that 
funds 
are 
used 
for 
the 
purpose 
intended 
with 
due 
regard 
to 
economy 
and efficiency, 
will 
be 
obtained through 
the 
measures 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
6 
and 
addressed 
in 
the 
OPV 
Agreement 
to 
be 
entered 
into 
by 
the 
Borrower 
and 
UNICEF. 
Upon 
receipt 
of 
a 
direct 
payment 
request 
from 
the 
GOP, 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
UNICEF for 
the 
procurement 
of 
OPV. 
UNICEF’s 
regular 
financial 
management 
system 
and 
auditing 
procedures 
will 
be 
used 
for 
this 
project. 
Although 
the 
Borrower 
is 
not 
required 
to 
carry out 
annual 
audits, 
the 
Association 
retains 
the 
option to 
request 
for 
an 
audit. 
WHO 
coordinates 
program 
support 
provided 
by 
a group 
of 
bilateral 
donors 
and private 
foundations. 
These 
funds 
provide 
a large 
part 
of 
the 
recurrent 
budget 
for 
the 
SIAs. 
It 
is 
expected that 
WHO 
will 
release 
funds 
speedily 
to 
facilitate 
project 
implementation. 
This 
aspect 
was 
assessed 
during 
the 
appraisal 
and 
it 
was 
found 
that 
there 
have been 
no 
instances 
of 
delayed 
release 
of 
funds 
by 
WHO 
for 
project 
implementation 
of 
SIAs. 
GOP 
is 
fully 
satisfied 
with 
the 
way 
WHO 
is 
handling 
the 
release 
of 
funds 
for 
polio 
eradication activities 
in 
Pakistan.

consultation and 
disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
in 
a 
significant 
way to 
the 
eradication 
of 
wild 
poliovirus 
from 
the 
environment 
and 
will 
contribute 
to 
worldwide 
eradication 
of 
poliomyelitis. 
The 
project’s methodology, 
stimulating 
oral 
vaccination 
with 
the 
attenuated 
virus, 
has 
no 
significant 
negative environmental impact. 
The

in 
action, 
as 
the 
January

coincided 
with 
the 
mission 
dates, 
and 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
no 
significant 
negative 
environmental 
issues 
would 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
under 
the 
project. 
Environmental 
Category: C 
(Not 
Required) 
The 
key 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
project 
are 
children 
below 
5 
years 
of 
age 
receiving 
the 
vaccines. 
Their 
parents, 
especially 
their 
mothers, 
have 
been 
the 
targets, 
for 
the last 
several 
years, 
of 
IEC 
campaigns 
for 
the 
ongoing 
polio 
eradication efforts.  Other 
stakeholders 
are 
the 
provincial 
and federal 
health 
authorities responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
campaign. 
The 
international community 
is 
another 
important 
stakeholder, 
given 
that 
disease 
eradication 
is 
a 
global 
public 
good.  Therefore, 
the 
polio 
eradication 
campaigns 
have 
seen 
an extraordinary cooperation 
from 
many 
donors, 
governments and 
communities. 
The 
Bank‘s 
contribution, 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
campaign, 
is 
coupled 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Gates 
Foundation, 
Rotary 
International 
and the 
United 
Nations 
Foundation.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
project specifically 
aims 
at 
benefiting 
vulnerable and 
previously 
neglected 
groups 
by 
providing 
polio 
immunization.  Poor 
families, 
particularly 
their 
children, 
would 
be 
the 
primary 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
project.  Quantitative 
studies 
have 
found 
low 
utilization 
rates 
at 
public 
health facilities 
catering 
to 
the 
poor. 
Qualitative 
assessments 
of 
other 
health projects indicate 
that 
lack 
of 
physical 
access 
to 
services 
is 
a 
problem 
in 
some 
areas. 
A 
larger 
problem 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
poor 
quality 
of 
health 
services. 
While 
wealthier 
groups 
can purchase 
health 
services 
from 
the 
private 
sector, 
the 
poor 
are 
unable 
to 
afford 
these 
services 
and continue 
to 
rely 
on 
traditional 
practitioners. 
The 
project 
would 
address these 
issues 
in 
respect 
of 
polio 
eradication 
by 
developing specific 
strategies 
and 
by 
using 
surveillance 
data 
to 
reach 
the 
"hard-to-reach" 
populations. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI) 
has 
established a 
framework 
for 
broad, 
on-going 
participation 
largely 
through 
the 
Inter-Agency 
Coordination 
Committee. 
This 
mechanism includes 
representatives 
from: 
(i) 
key 
government 
ministrieddepartments; 
(ii) 
multilateral 
agencies 
(UNICEF 
and WHO); 
(iii) 
bilateral 
agencies 
including 
the 
Government 
of 
Japan, 
the 
Netherlands, 
EU, 
DFID, 
USAID, 
CDC, 
etc.; 
(iv) 
NGOs; and 
(v) 
community 
mobilization 
and 
media 
experts. 
The 
ICC 
meets 
regularly to review 
needs 
and 
strategies 
of 
the 
national 
polio 
eradication 
program, and 
to 
assess 
the 
performance 
of 
supplemental 
immunization 
activities 
(SIAs). 
The 
PEI 
has 
achieved a 
coverage 
of 
over 
90% 
during 
the 
last 
few 
years 
by 
placing 
high 
priority 
on 
mobilizing 
participation 
of 
the 
beneficiaries 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
key 
stakeholders. 
Traditional 
and 
religious 
leaders 
have 
been 
sensitized and 
are 
now 
very 
committed 
to 
the 
cause. 
Rejection 
of 
polio 
vaccination 
now 
concerns 
only 
a 
very 
small 
percentage 
of 
the 
population. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
The 
Program holds 
consultations 
with 
partner 
NGOs 
and 
community 
groups 
which 
actively 
participate 
in 
social 
mobilization 
activities 
for 
SIAs. 
NGOs 
and 
community 
groups 
are 
represented 
in 
the 
ICC 
described 
above, 
and 
they 
participate 
with 
government 
representatives 
in 
joint 
training 
workshops 
for 
the 
micro 
planning 
of 
polio 
activities. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
current 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
the 
PEI 
have 
been 
effective 
in 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
Pakistani 
children immunized 
against 
polio, 
and 
in 
reaching 
certification-level 
acute 
flaccid 
polio 
(AFP) 
surveillance 
(one 
case 
of 
AFP 
per 
100,000 
population 
under 
15), 
and approaching 
the 
international 
standard 
for 
collection 
of 
adequate 
diagnostic 
specimens 
from 
at 
least 
80% 
of 
AFP 
cases 
within 
14 
days 
of 
onset 
of 
paralysis. 
This 
project 
will 
reinforce 
these 
arrangements 
to 
promote interaction 
and 
coordination 
between 
the 
government 
departments, 
international 
agencies, 
NGOs 
and 
community 
groups 
at 
the 
national, 
state 
and 
local 
levels. 
6.5 
How will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
contribute 
to 
polio 
eradication 
in 
Pakistan and 
globally 
through 
the 
supply 
of 
oral 
polio 
vaccine 
to 
the 
Expanded 
Program 
on 
Immunization 
in 
Pakistan. 
It 
will 
do 
so 
by 
providing 
the 
oral 
polio 
vaccine 
for 
use 
in 
the 
supplemental 
immunization 
activities 
(SIAs) 
which 
target 
all 
children

the 
age 
of 
five. 
Even 
if 
some 
children 
are 
left 
out, 
they 
benefit 
from 
the 
"herd" 
immunity 
once 
a 
coverage 
of 
above 
80% 
is 
achieved. 
The project's 
monitoring 
indicator 
requires 
a 
SIA 
coverage 
of 
85% 
in 
each 
province 
in 
2005. 
This 
will 
be 
measured 
through 
a 
WHO 
performance 
audit 
to 
be 
conducted 
within 
three 
months 
of 
the

of 
the

to 
facilitate 
acceptance 
of

Routine 
immunization 
is 
receiving 
strong 
attention 
from 
GOP.  Several external 
partners, 
amongst 
them 
the 
Bank, 
are 
addressing 
the 
strengthening 
of 
routine immunization 
through 
SAPP-2. 
GOP 
is 
strongly committed 
to polio 
eradication. 
Also, 
the 
international 
community 
will 
strongly 
promote 
eradication 
in 
the

could 
generate 
political 
support. 
Coordination 
among

Detailed Project Description 
PAKISTAN: 
Partnership 
for 
Polio Eradication 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
Pakistan 
Polio 
Eradication 
Initiative 
(PEI), 
which 
seeks 
to 
eradicate 
polio 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2005, 
with 
an 
IDA 
support 
of 
$20.0 
million. 
This 
will 
make a 
significant contribution 
to 
the 
eradication 
of 
polio from 
the 
world. 
The 
PEI 
is 
implemented 
at 
the 
national 
level 
by 
the 
Federal 
EPI 
(Expanded 
Program 
on 
Immunization) 
Cell 
under 
the 
overall 
guidance 
of 
the 
Federal 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
supported 
by 
a 
well-established 
structure at 
the 
provincial 
and 
district 
levels. 
PEI 
has 
three 
components: 
(i) 
the 
procurement, 
supply 
and 
use 
of 
OPV; 
(ii) 
supporting 
supplemental 
operations; 
and 
(iii) 
surveillance. 
IDA 
will 
support 
only 
the 
first 
component. 
Supplemental 
Immunization 
Activities 
(SIAs), 
in 
which 
the 
OPV 
will 
be 
used, 
require 
supporting 
activities 
such 
as 
logistics, 
social 
mobilization, 
training, 
surveillance, 
monitoring 
and evaluation. 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF 
will 
support 
these 
activities through 
bilateral 
donor and 
private 
agency 
contributions. 
The 
following 
indicators 
will 
measure 
the 
project’s 
success: 
0 
Arrival 
of 
OPV 
at 
the 
EPI 
cold 
rooms 
in 
Islamabad 
at 
least 
five 
weeks 
before 
each 
of 
the 
SIAs, 
to 
be 
measured 
through 
the 
EPI’s 
vaccine 
arrival 
reports; and 
0 
SIA 
coverage 
of 
80% 
achieved 
in 
the 
remaining 
endemic 
provinces 
during 
2005, 
to 
be 
measured 
through 
a cluster 
sampling 
survey 
according 
to 
a 
WHO-approved 
methodology. 
Government’s 
achievement 
of 
the 
above 
indicators 
will 
be 
a 
trigger 
for 
the 
IDA 
buy-down 
(see 
section 
D.5). 
Distribution 
arrangements 
and 
storage 
of 
vaccines 
in 
the 
EPI 
cold 
rooms 
at 
the national, 
provincial, 
and 
district 
levels 
are 
functional. 
During 
the 
planning 
and 
implementation 
of 
SIAs, 
transport 
of 
these 
vaccines 
through 
vaccine carriers 
to 
the 
children 
is 
coordinated 
with 
the 
vaccination 
teams. 
Social 
mobilization 
and 
IEC 
activities 
with 
parents 
and communities 
are 
organized at 
the 
local, district, 
provincial 
and 
national 
levels. 
Media 
campaigns 
in 
visual, 
audio, 
and 
print 
form 
are 
carried out 
to 
make 
the 
public 
aware 
of 
the 
program 
benefits 
and 
to motivate them 
to 
receive the 
vaccination 
teams. 
Mobilization 
of 
community 
leaders, 
health 
staff, 
and 
volunteers 
for 
planning 
and implementation 
of 
SIAs 
is 
a 
key activity. 
In 
Pakistan, 
about 
700,000 
personnel 
are 
needed 
for 
each 
campaign 
of 
whom 
150,000 
are 
MOH 
employees, 
including 
10,000 
vaccinators 
and 
42,000 
Lady 
Health 
Workers. 
The 
remaining, 
about 550,000 
include 
other government staff, 
NGO 
staff 
and community 
members. 
Training 
and 
advocacy 
with 
these 
groups 
in 
micro-planning, 
supervision, 
administration 
of 
OPV, 
record 
keeping, and 
cold 
chain 
maintenance 
occurs 
prior 
to 
each 
round 
of 
immunization. 
By Component: 
Project 
Component 
1 
- 
US$20.00 
million 
The 
first 
and 
the 
only 
component that 
the 
project 
will 
support 
is 
the 
timely 
provision 
of 
part 
supplies 
of 
OPV 
needed 
for 
eradication 
campaigns 
to 
immunize 
all 
children 
below 
five 
years. 
It 
will 
also 
monitor 
the 
appropriate 
use 
of 
this 
OPV 
under 
the 
PEI. 
IDA 
will 
finance 
the 
procurement 
of 
about 
50 
% 
of 
the 
OPV 
needed 
for 
the 
SIAs 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
from 
2003-2005. 
UNICEF 
will 
supply 
the 
vaccine 
under 
an 
agreement 
between 
GOP 
and 
UNICEF. 
The 
Bank 
has 
accepted 
use 
of 
UNICEF 
procurement 
procedures 
for 
the 
OPV 
procurement.

Page  30
The 
component’s 
success 
will 
be 
measured 
by 
the 
following 
indicators: 
Timeliness 
of 
GOP’s 
request 
for 
funds 
for 
procurement 
of 
the 
OPV: 
GOP 
will 
send, 
within 
three 
weeks 
of 
project 
effectiveness, 
a 
withdrawal 
application 
to 
the 
Bank 
requesting payment 
to 
UNICEF. 
0 
Timeliness 
of 
disbursement 
of 
WB 
funds 
to 
UNICEF 
for 
OPV 
procurement: 
Bank 
will 
transfer 
funds 
to 
UNICEF 
within 
30 
business 
days 
of 
the 
date 
on 
which 
the 
Withdrawal Application 
is 
received 
by 
the 
Bank. 
0 
Timeliness 
of 
procurement and 
supply 
by 
UNICEF; 
the 
OPV 
will 
arrive 
at 
the 
EPI 
cold 
rooms 
in 
Islamabad 
at 
least 
5 
weeks 
before 
each 
round 
of 
SIAs. 
Funds 
will 
not 
be 
handled 
by 
GOP 
and 
will 
be 
transferred 
directly 
to 
UNICEF. 
Accordingly only 
UNICEF 
will 
provide 
financial 
management 
and 
accounting 
for 
the 
funds 
and 
provide quarterly 
reports 
to 
the 
government 
with 
copies 
to 
IDA. 
IDA 
will 
use 
these 
reports 
to 
monitor 
the 
outstanding 
balance and 
the 
funds 
received 
and 
spent 
by 
UNICEF. 
SIAs 
coverage 
is 
monitored 
by 
an analysis 
of 
the 
tally 
sheets 
recording 
the 
number 
of 
children 
immunized 
against 
the 
number 
in 
the target group. 
Output 
monitoring 
is 
undertaken 
at 
the 
provincial 
level 
through 
independent 
monitors, and impact 
monitoring 
at the 
national 
level 
through 
the 
AFP 
surveillance 
system. 
The 
Technical 
Advisory 
Group 
meets 
periodically 
and 
assesses 
progress. 
Its 
reports, 
along 
with 
the 
periodic 
assessments 
of 
the 
SIAs 
quality 
undertaken 
by 
WHO 
and 
other 
technical 
partners, 
are 
also 
used 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
purposes. 
WHO 
will 
evaluate 
this 
component 
within 
three 
months 
of 
the 
project 
closing, 
focusing 
on 
the timeliness 
of OPV 
procurement and 
supply, 
and vaccination 
coverage. 
WHO will 
submit 
its 
report to 
GOP 
with 
copies 
to Bank.

Procurement 
Procurement 
Capacity 
Assessment 
As 
per 
the 
Director 
OPCPR’s 
Memorandum 
dated 
October 17,2002,  a 
formal 
assessment 
of 
the 
procurement 
capacity 
of 
the 
Federal 
EPI 
Cell 
(Project 
Implementing 
Agency) 
is 
not 
necessary 
according 
to 
Procurement 
Services 
Policy 
Group 
guidelines dated 
August 
1 
1, 
1998. 
This 
is 
because 
under 
the 
project, 
UNICEF, 
and 
not 
the 
implementing 
agency, 
will 
handle procurement. 
Procurement 
Planning 
The 
quantity 
of 
vaccine 
required 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
needs 
identified 
by 
the 
Technical 
Advisory 
Group 
(TAG). 
These 
needs 
are 
regularly 
adjusted 
based 
on 
surveillance 
findings. 
If 
surveillance 
shows 
unexpectedly 
good 
results, 
and 
not 
all 
project 
funds 
are 
needed 
for 
procurement 
of 
OPV 
for 
during 
2003-2005, 
through 
the 
first 
quarter 
2005, 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
reprogrammed 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
OPV 
needed 
for 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2005 
and 
in 
2006. 
If 
TAG 
determines that 
are 
no 
longer 
needed, 
the 
available 
funds 
will 
be 
used 
for 
procurement 
of 
polio 
vaccines 
for 
the 
routine 
immunization 
program. 
A 
TAG 
recommendation 
to 
this 
effect 
will 
be 
needed. 
Procurement 
Implementation 
Arrangements 
The 
Federal 
EPI 
Cell 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
project 
execution 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
While 
EPI 
is 
a strong 
program, 
it 
has 
limited 
capacity 
for 
procurement, especially 
for 
large 
scale 
international 
procurement 
of 
the 
kind 
required 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
borrower 
will 
enter 
into 
an agreement 
with 
UNICEF 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
the 
oral 
polio 
vaccine 
(OPV). 
UNICEF 
will 
ensure 
supply 
of 
OPV 
to 
EPI. 
EPI 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
in-country 
storage, 
distribution 
and 
administration 
of 
the 
vaccines. 
UNICEF 
will 
report 
on 
a 
semiannual basis 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
with 
a 
copy to 
IDA 
on 
(a) 
purchase orders 
placed 
by 
UNICEF, 
(b) 
actual quantities 
of 
OPV 
delivered 
to 
NIH, 
and 
(c) 
expenditure 
from 
the 
OPV 
Procurement 
Account 
during 
the 
reporting 
period. 
Payments 
to 
UNICEF 
will 
include 
its 
standard 
handling 
charges 
for 
vaccine procurement, 
an 
amount 
not 
exceeding 
6% 
of 
the 
vaccine 
cost, 
and 
other 
non-freight 
costs, 
if 
any.

Overview 
of

Arrangement 
IDA 
has 
entered 
into 
a 
partnership 
with 
funding 
agencies, 
Le., 
Bill 
and 
Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation, 
UN 
Foundation 
and 
Rotary 
International 
to 
support 
this 
project. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
a 
single 
component, 
Le., 
the 
provision 
of 
oral 
polio 
vaccine 
(OPV). 
It 
is 
piloting 
an 
innovative financing 
mechanism: 
although 
IDA 
financial 
resources 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
(GOP), 
third 
party 
funding 
from 
the 
above 
partners 
will 
"buy 
down" 
the 
service 
charge, 
the 
commitment 
fee 
and 
repayments 
by 
financing 
the 
net 
present value 
(NPV) 
of 
the 
IDA 
credit. 
This would, 
in 
effect, 
mean 
grant 
funding 
for 
the 
program. 
The 
IDA 
credit 
will 
finance 
a 
single 
agreement 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
OPV. 
An 
Agreement 
will 
be 
signed 
between 
the 
GOP 
and 
UNICEF for 
the 
supply 
of 
OPV 
with 
the arrangements 
below: 
OPV 
will 
be 
procured 
by UNICEF 
for 
GOP 
following 
its 
own 
procurement 
procedures. 
The 
draft 
agreement 
between 
GOP 
and 
UNICEF 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
Bank's 
prior 
review 
and 
no 
objection. 
GOP 
will 
send 
withdrawal 
applications to 
the 
Bank, 
authorizing 
the 
Bank to 
make 
direct 
payments 
to 
UNICEF 
of 
amounts 
requested 
by UNICEF 
under 
this 
Agreement, 
through 
an 
initial, 
and 
subsequently 
semiannual, 
withdrawal 
applications; 
UNICEF 
will 
maintain 
a 
separate 
ledger 
account, 
through 
which 
all 
of 
UNICEF's 
receipts 
and 
expenditures 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
providing 
the 
services 
contemplated under 
this 
Agreement 
will 
be 
recorded; 
and 
UNICEF 
will 
report 
semiannually 
to

Financial 
Management Arrangements 
This 
project 
does 
not require direct involvement 
of 
the 
Borrower 
in 
the 
management and 
accounting 
of 
funds, 
which 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
UNICEF. 
The 
credit 
proceeds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
by 
the 
Bank 
directly 
to 
UNICEF 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
GOP 
and 
UNICEF. 
The needed 
quantities 
of 
vaccines 
will 
be 
agreed 
in 
advance 
and 
the 
price 
is 
relatively 
stable. 
The 
Bank 
will 
accept 
semiannual 
reports 
from UNICEF 
as 
meeting 
the 
financial 
information 
requirements 
for 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports. 
The 
assurance 
that 
the 
Bank's 
fiduciary 
requirements 
-

Page  43
are 
met, 
and 
that 
funds 
are 
used 
for 
the 
purpose 
intended 
with 
due 
regard 
to 
economy 
and 
efficiency, 
will 
be 
achieved 
through

items 
agreed 
beforehand (vaccine

charges); 
The 
semiannual 
financial 
report 
from UNICEF 
to 
GOP,

will 
allow 
close 
monitoring 
of 
the outstanding balance 
and 
funds 
received and 
spent 
by 
UNICEF. 
The 
Bank 
will 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
verify 
expenditures 
before 
any 
subsequent 
disbursements; 
and 
GOP 
will 
be 
able 
to 
confirm 
receipt 
of 
the 
quantities 
of 
goods 
indicated 
in

Additional Annex 
11 
: 
IDA Buy-Down 
Mechanism 
PAKISTAN: Partnership 
for 
Polio Eradication 
Introduction 
This 
annex 
describes 
the 
arrangements 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
IDA 
buy-down 
mechanism 
for polio 
eradication 
projects, 
which 
aims 
to convert the 
terms 
of 
a 
normal 
IDA 
development 
credit 
to 
grant 
terms 
through 
provision 
of 
additional 
external donor 
resources 
under 
clearly 
defined 
performance 
criteria. 
In 
the context 
of 
the 
Nigeria 
polio 
eradication project, 
the 
first 
operation 
utilizing 
this 
mechanism, resources 
for 
the 
buy-down 
will 
become 
available 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
agreement 
between 
IDA 
and 
the 
Bill 
& 
Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation 
(the 
Gates 
Foundation)‘. 
Rotary International 
has 
indicated 
that 
it 
will 
finance 
the 
same 
mechanism 
for 
other 
polio 
eradication 
projects. 
The 
buy-down 
mechanism 
complies 
with 
IDA’S 
existing financial 
policies. 
The 
Partnership 
The 
World 
Bank’s Health, 
Nutrition 
& 
Population 
sector 
Anchor 
explored 
the 
possibility 
of 
partnering 
with 
the 
Gates 
Foundation 
to 
assist 
polio 
eradication 
by 
providing 
countries 
with 
IDA 
financial 
resources 
but 
without 
IDA 
repayment obligations. 
The 
Gates 
Foundation 
agreed 
to provide 
funds 
to 
an 
IDA-administered 
trust 
fund 
(the 
Polio 
Eradication 
Trust 
Fund 
or 
PETF) 
that 
will 
buy 
down 
the 
debt 
incurred 
by 
recipient 
countries 
for 
successful 
implementation 
of 
polio 
eradication projects. 
In 
addition 
to 
making 
commitment 
and 
service charge 
payments 
to 
IDA 
on 
behalf 
of 
the recipients 
during 
project 
implementation, 
the 
PETF 
will, 
upon 
successful 
project 
implementation, 
buy 
down 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
principal 
amount 
of 
the 
development credit. 
The 
Mechanism 
IDA 
is 
extending 
a development 
credit 
to 
Nigeria. 
The 
Development 
Credit 
Agreement 
will 
include 
two 
special 
provisions: 
1. 
The 
PETF 
will 
pay 
the 
applicable 
service charges 
and 
commitment 
charges, 
if 
any, 
and 
2. 
The 
PETF 
will 
buy 
down 
the 
principal 
amount 
of 
the 
credit 
upon 
successful 
completion 
of 
the 
project 
(as 
determined 
by 
a 
World 
Health 
Organization 
(WHO) 
audit). 
The 
buy-down 
will 
be 
funded 
by 
contributions 
to 
the 
PETF from 
the 
Gates 
Foundation. 
The 
buy-down 
mechanism 
operates 
in 
three 
stages-credit 
signing, 
project 
implementation, 
and 
project 
completion. 
These 
stages are 
described 
below. 
At 
Credit 
Signing 
IDA 
and 
PETF 
determine 
the 
discount rate 
(the 
prevailing 
SDR-basket 
Commercial 
Interest 
Reference 
Rates 
(CIRR) 
on 
the 
date 
of 
credit 
signing) 
and 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
(SDRUSD) 
that 
will 
be 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
estimated 
net 
present 
value at 
final 
buy-down. 
The 
PETF 
sets 
aside 
funds 
that 
are 
denominated 
in 
USD 
and 
invested 
pending 
disbursement. 
The 
set-aside 
amount 
equals 
IDA 
commitment 
and 
service charge 
payments 
over 
the 
projected implementation 
period 
and 
the 
estimated 
amount 
needed 
to 
buy 
down 
the 
principal 
of

at

end

period.

During 
Project 
Implementation 
Under 
the 
project, 
IDA, 
acting 
on 
a 
request 
from 
the 
recipient 
country, 
disburses 
funds 
to 
UNICEF, 
the 
agency responsible 
for 
procuring 
the 
polio 
vaccine. 
UNICEF 
in 
turn 
supplies 
the 
vaccines 
to 
the recipient 
government. 
The 
PETF 
pays the 
commitment 
and service 
charges 
on 
the 
disbursed 
amounts 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
If 
the 
implementation 
period 
is 
substantially 
longer 
than 
initially 
projected, 
funds 
required 
to 
pay 
service 
charges 
could 
exceed 
the 
funds 
set 
aside. 
However, 
the 
investment 
income 
on 
the 
set-aside 
buy-down 
amount 
would 
provide 
a 
cushion 
against 
this 
risk. 
If 
the 
implementation 
period 
exceeds 
five 
years, 
the 
responsibility 
for 
servicing 
the 
credit 
will 
revert 
to 
the 
recipient 
country 
unless 
the 
Gates 
Foundation 
grants an 
extension. 
At 
Project Completion 
Upon 
completion 
of 
the 
project, 
WHO 
conducts a performance 
audit 
to 
determine 
if 
the 
IDA 
funds 
achieved 
their 
intended 
results. 
The 
performance 
audit 
measures 
the 
results 
for 
two 
indicators: 
1. 
Timely 
arrival 
of 
oral 
polio 
vaccine 
(OPV) 
in 
the 
country 
at 
central 
level, 
and 
2. 
Vaccination 
coverage 
for 
OPV 
during 
the 
vaccination 
campaigns. 
If 
the 
WHO 
performance audit 
evaluates 
the 
project 
as 
satisfactory, the 
IDA 
buy-down 
will 
be 
triggered. 
The 
PETF 
will 
then 
pay 
off 
the 
IDA 
credit 
at 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
credit 
based 
on 
the 
defined foreign 
exchange 
and 
discount 
rates 
to 
buy 
down 
the 
principal 
of 
this 
credit 
(Repayment 
Amount). 
IDA 
will 
in 
turn 
cancel 
this 
credit 
and 
release 
the 
recipient 
from 
any 
future 
liability. 
If 
the 
credit 
is 
not 
fully 
disbursed, 
the 
final 
Repayment 
Amount 
will 
be calculated 
on 
a 
pro-rata 
basis. 
If 
the 
WHO 
performance 
audit 
evaluates 
the 
project 
as 
unsatisfactory, the 
recipient 
will 
remain obligated to 
pay back 
IDA 
on 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
credit.
