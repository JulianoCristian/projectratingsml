By\n            rewarding performance it created incentives for program\n            management at the federal and provincial level for a greater\n            focus on results. The key prerequisite to successful\n            adoption of the buy-down mechanism or more broadly\n            performance based financing is the identification of clearly\n            measurable, feasible indicators that are largely within the\n            control of the implementing agency and a credible monitoring\n            system that provides timely information. Performance based\n            financing can create incentives for developing such systems\n            but more is required in terms of coordinated efforts by\n            development partners to advocate for and support the process\n            technically and financially."}, "docdt": "2007-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
