appoint an arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the Umpire. In case any 
arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section shall resign, die or become unable to 
act, a successor arbitrator shall be appointed in the same manner as herein prescribed for 
the appointment of the original arbitrator, and such successor shall have all the powers 
and duties of such original arbitrator. 
 
(d)

(i) 
The parties shall fix the amount of the remuneration of the arbitrators and

Each party shall each defray its own expenses in the arbitration proceedings. The costs of

provisions of this Section. If, within thirty days after counterparts of the award shall have 
been delivered to the parties, the award shall not be complied with by the Association, the 
Borrower may take any such action for the enforcement of the award against the 
Association.
