Construction would include\n            interchanges and spur roads for access to the new toll\n            facility. The project would provide essential road capacity\n            on the major route from the capital of Jakarta to virtually\n            all of Java and thus provide substantial benefits to the\n            regional economy. Also included in the project are\n            consultancy services for toll road management and for\n            regional transport planning.
