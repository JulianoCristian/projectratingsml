of four\n            sections totalling 86 km and the procurement of equipment\n            for maintenance and for monitoring loadings of vehicles\n            using the primary highway network, including TYH. The\n            benefits of the proposed project, which centers on\n            improvement of TYH, will permeate the entire Yugoslav\n            economy and include improved planning and coordination and\n            aiding Yugoslavia's access to international capital\n            markets. No special risks are expected in the execution of\n            the proposed project."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
