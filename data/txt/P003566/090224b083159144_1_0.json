Despite\n            China\u2019s impressive progress in raising health standards in\n            the 1960s and 1970s, a health divide emerged in the 1980s\n            between poor rural areas and rich urban regions. Infant\n            mortality rates were three times higher in rural areas and\n            maternal mortality rates were twice as high. The problems in\n            rural healthcare resulted from a decline in government\n            support for public health programs, a top-down approach to\n            health planning, and a lack of coordination between various\n            health system levels. In the late 1990s, China, with support\n            from the World Bank and other development partners,\n            undertook to improve basic health services and increase\n            healthcare accessibility for an estimated 47 million people\n            living in poor rural areas through the Eighth Basic Health\n            Project. The Project was set out to help China strengthen\n            its rural health sector by upgrading rural health\n            facilities, improving the quality and effectiveness of\n            health service programs, and increasing the affordability of\n            essential health care for the poor. With improved prenatal\n            care and increased hospital delivery, maternal and infant\n            mortality rates were nearly halved in project areas and\n            health service utilization increased considerably among the\n            rural poor."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T08:37:04Z"}
