Some\n            lessons learned included: Strong ownership and commitment at\n            the highest levels of government, together with a group of\n            empowered, reform-minded professionals charged with the task\n            of implementing major reform projects and who understand the\n            major risks and strategies to overcome them is critical to\n            ultimate success of a reform project. An ability to change\n            project details in response to a dynamic and positive\n            national policy environment is also important. Designed\n            appropriately, projects provide a very good platform for\n            sound policy dialogue and reform strategy design and\n            implementation. Project training can contribute to overall\n            capacity building, support implementation of changed\n            technical protocols and processes for service delivery, and\n            help institutionalize management systems when systematically\n            conducted. Community participation and stakeholder\n            consultations assist with both ownership and clarity of\n            objectives and implementation strategies. The internal\n            policy of Government of China (GOC) which requires\n            under-resourced counties to repay Bank credits creates\n            serious problems for counties (and provinces) and ultimately\n            impacts on the fees charged or the viability of hospitals\n            and service providers to the extent they become liable for\n            the repayment. It also creates, inappropriately, a\n            reluctance to spend on quality enhancing training, technical\n            assistance, and other intangible items of expenditure. On\n            the other hand it probably increases ownership of local\n            governments to expenditures undertaken because they have to\n            repay the loans. Ultimately it is important to get the\n            incentives right and this probably argues for rapidly\n            increasing current national government revenues allocated to\n            local government programs including health."}, "docdt": "2007-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
