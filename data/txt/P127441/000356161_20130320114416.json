the Eighth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Program for Benin is\n            to strengthened public sector management, administration and\n            governance; and strengthened business environment. President\n            Yayi's Government has demonstrated a renewed commitment\n            to a substantive reform agenda since earning a second\n            mandate and enjoying a majority coalition in the National\n            Assembly. Over the past 18 months the Government has\n            implemented difficult reforms at the port of Cotonou, has\n            proceeded with meaningful anticorruption efforts, has made\n            progress in strengthening public financial management,\n            public procurement processes in particular, civil service\n            reform has accelerated, and important steps have been taken\n            in improving the business enabling environment. Some of\n            these efforts were met by stiff resistance, and\n            implementation is proving difficult. The Government has\n            nonetheless demonstrated considerable resolve in proceeding\n            with this reform agenda. Eight PRSC supports this reform\n            effort, strengthens and reinforces the substantial progress\n            achieved in these key areas and provides needed financial\n            resources to help maintain macroeconomic stability."}, "docdt": "2013-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
