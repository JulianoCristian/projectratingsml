         were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: in the presence of significant\n            resistance to reforms and uncertainties, a stand-alone\n            operation as proposed, in place of a programmatic series,\n            proved effective. Delaying the programmatic series and\n            switching the operation to a stand-alone basis was effective\n            in providing needed support for ongoing reform efforts,\n            while allowing time for greater clarity to emerge in\n            difficult areas prior to committing to a new programmatic\n            series and generating the necessary commitment to and action\n            on important reforms. A good understanding of the\n            socio-political dynamics at play is needed to engage in\n            transformational policy reform in Benin. The volatile and\n            shifting links between key public and private players can\n            hamper the sustainability of structural reforms needed to\n            boost economic growth, as witnessed during PRSG-7 and PRSC-8\n            in the port and cotton sectors. Public private partnership\n            arrangements need a sound legal and regulatory framework\n            (PPP Law) for engaging in transparent, fair and sustainable\n            partnerships. Stated objectives and monitored results\n            indicators need to be realistic, focused on indicators that\n            are attributable to supported actions, and consistent over a\n            meaningful period of time. Prior PRSC series focused on\n            indicators situated at a level where attribution was\n            difficult, if not impossible, and where a variety of\n            exogenous factors weighed far more heavily on the\n            achievement, or non-achievement, of results than supported\n            actions. Furthermore, changing indicators frequently from\n            one series to the next does not allow for the tracking of\n            progress in areas where such progress takes considerable\n            time to achieve objectives or effect meaningful change."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
