ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY OF CYPRUS
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank has made two loans to the Electricity Authority of
Cyprus (EAC). The first loan, 335-CY, of $21 million,j/ was made in
1963 to help the Authority carry out its First Five-Year Development
Program (1962-1966), consisting cf the construction of the Moni steam
power station with two 30 MW generating units and the expansion of trans-
mission and distribution systems. The project was completed in 1967. The
second loan, 494-CY, of $2.8 million, was made in 1967 to expand the Moni
station with a third 30 MW unit which was a part of the Second Five-Year
Development Proeram (1967-1971). Progress of this project is satisfactory.
The Authority has indicated that it will request cancellation of about
US$2hlOrOOO from the loan shortlv. This is the result of savings obtained
in procuring British equipment due to the 1967 devaluation of the pound
sterl'n .h
1.02      The Authority has now requeste the Bank to assist in financing
the Third Power Project consisting of the installation of a fourth 30 MW
unit at Yoni nnd the extension of transmssion facilities. The proposed
loan would amount to $5 million and would be used to cover the foreign cur-
rency reqrement of the Project *w,h+ich is 8g of the to.t.l rn.st or 25% of
the Authority's total investment expenditure during the next three years.
1.03      This report covers the appraisal of the Project and is based on
the findings of the appraisal miission consist'ig of "-Iessrs. Hui Huang and
Everardo Wessels which visited Cyprus in September 1969.
V/ Due to savings in construction.costs and reduction in distribution work
in Turkish Cypriot areas, the loan was reduced to $15.3 million.

2.01      Cyprus is the easternmost island in the Mediterranean Sea with
an area of 3e570 square miles, 55% eof %hich. is arable.  It has a poplation
of approximately 621,000 - 80% of Greek origin and 18% of Turkish origin.
The recent natrlal population growth rate is about 1 .1%; emirati+on has
reduced the net increase to about 0.7%.   The most important sector of Cyprus'
econo-.                 -0-+"-;b,,+,   J is aS e   .nU . in .1968 abou+ 21%U 4t Eve 51 ossdor.es+i

asbestos) used o makte a sigrificantCion to the eom              bu 4n A. 968
its share in GDP and exports was only about 6% and 36%, respectively. Manu-
facturing has been cofIed4a .  to light industries and contributed 11% to GDP
in 1968.  However, several large industrial projects, notably the oil refinery
a+ T.--aca, are now be-ing carr-ied ou'.  Tour± sm 'as s'o-  rapid development.
Overall, Cyprus' economy has been achieving an impressive growth despite
political problems;   its gross national product in real terms has increased
at an average annual rate of about 6% in recent years.
2.02      The Electricity Authority of Cyprus is the sole supplier of
electricity to the public and generates practically all the electric
power on the island. There are only a few captive power plants owned
by industries; these are diesel electric instal]lations maintained as
standby, with an aggregate capacity of about 121Y1q, about 6% of the
island's total capacity.   rhe British military base at Dekhelia has a small
combined water distillation and diesel power plant.
2.03      At the end of 1968, all major towns and 400 villages (out of a
total of 632 villages) received power supplies from the Authority. The
Authority estimates that 82% of the rural population (suburban not included)
uses electricity.
2.04      Cyprus possesses no known sources of fossil fuels and, being semi-
arid, has no prospects of hydroelectric power production on a commercial scale.
There is a possibility, however, of incorporating a pumped-storage facility
in a dam which the Government plans to construct to supply water to Famagusta.
The Authority is looking into the matter with a view to future development
for peaking capacity and will keep the Bank informed of the result of the
investigation.
2.05      The island has a water shortago problem, especially in the
Famagusta area. In time, it maY become economical to install a combined de-
salination and steam power plant at the present Dekhelia station of the
Authority, but there is no plan for immediate development.
2.06      For the foreseeable future, the expansion of the Dower sector
wrll continue to be based on thermal generation using imported fuel oil,
to which Cyprus has ready access due to its geographical location.
No difficulty is envisaged in expanding system capacity to maintain
adequate supply.

Organizatimn and M41anagement
3.01      The Electricity Authority of Cyprus was created in 1952 under the
Electricity Development Law as an autonomous government-owned corporation
"for the purpose of generating, supplying, promoting and encouraging the
use of electricity."  At that time only a few towns and villages had public
electricity supplies.  The Authority has since established an island-wide
power system and has achieved an impressive progress in the electrification
of the country.
3.02      The Authority is governed by a Board consisting of a chairman, a
vice-chairman and five members all of whom are appointed by the Council of
Ministers for a period of not more than five years.
3.02      The chief executive officer of the Authority is the general manager,
who is appointed by the Board. The present general manager has been associated
with the Authority for a long period and was appointed to his position in
1961.  He is capable and experienced in both engineering and administration.
The relationship between the Board and the manager and the overall management
of the Authority are good.
3.O)J     Tn connection with t+he previons loans tshe flnvernment and EAC agreed
to inform the Bank of any proposed amendment to the Electricity Development
r.TnT or nnv proposed n jn+nnwtmnt of chief eYecutivep tAnhni ral or financial

whole island. It comprises 440 miles of 66 kV l/transmission lines connect-
iflng to 23 rrmain substations and 1,200 mi,- les of 11  kV overheA and underground
lines (see Map).
Operations
3.06      Despite the political problems in Cyprus the EAC system has grown
at a fairly fast rate and its operations have been satisfactory. SuI'Le
aspects of the most recent operations, in 1968, are described in the follow-
ing paragraphs.
3.07      In 1968 the Authority generated 454 GWh with a system maximum demar.c.
of 102 MW. The annual load factor was about 51%.
1/ Of the total. hO miles have been designed and constructed for 132VT
but, are beirn operated ir.itially at 66 kV.



38 The Authority sold 363 GtW-h +o 1-  9 ,000 consiimners.  Distribuition
according to consumer categories was as follows:
Domestic                                25 5%
Industrial (including mines)           32.6%
IrrigatiJon
Public Lighting                         3.5%
3.09      Tne system losses (i.e., difference bet-ween geeration and sales,
including consumption by station auxiliaries) amounted to 20% of the total
generation. Consumption by residents in the Turkish Cypriot areas not
accessible to the Authority has not been billed for the present and therefore
is not included in the above figure for energy sales (paragraph 3.21).   Taking
into account this consumption, estimated by the Authority to be 30.2 GWh, the
losses would amount to only 13.5%, which reflects a reasonably efficient
system.
3.10      The overall thermal efficiency of the system was 26.7%. The average
operation and maintenance cost of generation (excluding interest and d7epre-
ciation) was 5.9 US mills per kWh generated, with a fuel price of US$12.5
per ton. The average overall cost of operation and maintenance (excluding 
interest and depreciation) of generation, transmission, distribution, con-
sumer service, accounting and administration was 12 US mills per kWh sold.
Average number of consumers per employee was 91. These figures compare
favorably with similar systems in the developing world.
Tariffs
3.11      The Authority may establish the level and structure of tariffs
but is subiect to government approval of rate increases. The Electricity
Development Law provides that revenues should be sufficient to meet operating
expenses and debt service_ and to set aside a reasonable provision for expan-
sion.
3.12      During the last twelve years the tariffs remained virtually
unchanged.  They produce an averagA rAvenue per kWh of about 10 Cyprus mils
(US 2.4 cents) which is adequate (paragraph 3.22). No increase in tariffs
w.oulld be required to finance t+he Project (paragraphs 7.02 and 7.04). A recent
study of the tariff structure was made by the Authority's consultants,
Preece, -ardew &. Rider (fPR) of Fegl-and, *h ich nc con-cluded that the rate struc-
ture is reasonably well balanced.
Present Financial Position

3.15      The loans from the Government were provided from the proceeds of
five public bond issues totaling LC7,83,926 made by hne Goverm-lent LI the
UK and Cyprus between 1953 and 1959 and re-lent to the Authority. The
interest rates vary from 3.64% to 5.75%; the average rate is 4.88o,. ,',IUl
the Government pays full debt service on these issues, the Authority pays
only the interest to the Government. This is the result of a decision made
by the Government to consider the proceeds of the first issue as an equity
contribution rather than a loan to the Authority. The same treatment was
applied to the four successive issues. In an agreement concluded in 1963
between the Government and the Authority, the Government loans are subor-
dinated to the Bank loan (Loan No. 335-CY) in such a manner that, unless
the Bank shall otherwise agree, no repayment of principal will be made until
the Bank loan shall have been fully repaid. The Government agreed to this
provision, which was renewed in connection with Loan No. 494-CY, in order
to allow the Authority to retain funds for the expansion of its electricity
services (see paragraph 7.06).
3.16      Other long-term debt consisted of:
a.  Bank Loan No. 335-CY made in 1963 in the amount of
US$21 million with a term of 20 years and an interest
rate of 5-1/2%. The amount disbursed from the loan
was US$15,268,000; the balance was cancelled;
b.  Bank Loan No. 494-CY made in 1967 for US$2.8 million
with a term of 15 years and an interest rate of 6%.
The amount disbursed on December 31. 1968 was US$506,0oo;
and
c.  Other loans which were taken over from local authorities
at the time plants were transferred to the Authority.
The loans are repayable to the Government and to Barclays
Bank.
3.17      The Authoritv'Is current ponitinn as of December 31. 1968 was
as follows:

3.18     Liquid balances are higher than necessary for normal operations
but will be needed in the next few years to help finance the expansion pro-
gram (see paragraph 7.02).
Audit
3.19     Auditing arrangements have been satisfactory.  The past and pro-
posed loan agreements provide that the Authority shall have its financial
statements certified by an independent accountant acceptable to the Bank,
These statements, together with the accountant's report, must be trans-
mitted to the Bank not more than four months after the end of the Authority's
fiscal year.  The Authorityts auditors are Price, Waterhouse, Peat &
Company, Nicosia.
Earnings Record
3.20     Income statements for the years 1967 and 1968 are given in Annex
5 and selected financial ratios are shown in Annex 7. Revenues rose from
EC3.2 million in 1967 to £C3.7 million in 1968. Operating income declined
slightly from £01,201,000 in 1967 to EC1,179,000 in 1968 because of in-
creases in labor and fuel costs. The Authority granted a wage increase of
about 20% to its employees in 1968. This was in line with the increases
granted to the civil service after the devaluation of the Cyprus pound in
1967. Fuel costs increased from LC4.0 to EC5.2 per ton, due to the de-
valuation and the Suez crisis. As a result, the operating ratio_7 which
was 62.6% in 1967, rose to 68.3% in 1968. The return on average net
nThnt iri opnration was 8.7% in 1967 and 8.5% in 1968.
3.21     The Authori-tyv   Aarnings hnve been depressed since the communal
troubles in 1964 by unbilled consumption in Turkish Cypriot areas (see para-
, aph  .o09).  Lost revenue duet to this c-ause was estimnted at EG2888O00  in
1967 and EC309,000 in 1968. The Government has assured the Authority that
ts claims under this head will be satisfied as part of an.v future general

4.  THE PROGRAM
4.01      To provide a general guide for system pLanning, the Authority's
consultants. Preece. Cardew & Rider, have worktd nout a 20-vpAr r1mvA-.on-
ment plan (1968-1988) for the future high voltage transmission system
(transmissinn lines and suibtaions).   The plan provides that during
this period power generation will be concentrated at the Moni and
Dekiielia aeneai.-Ag stations. * He principal fea+ures of this rl1^ in-
elude:
(a)  a new substation (Athalassa) in the Nicosia area which

communication facilities;
(b)  132 kv trunk transmission lines to connect the two
generat ing stations with the two main substations in
the Nicosia area (Athalassa substation and the exist-
ing naraklis substation); and,
(c) additional 66 kv transmisslon lines to reinforce the
supply to a number of areas.
The plan is to be carried out in stages according to the load require-
ments.
i.O2      The Authority's Second Five-Year Development Program (1967-
1971) is in progress. However, due to higher load growth than previously
forecast, some works which were planned to be undertaken in the Third
Five-Year Program (1972-1976) will have to be brought forward and started
in 1970. Thus the Program for the next five years 1970-1974 will in-
volve the following principal works:
Generation
(a)  installation of a fourth 30 MW generating unit at the
Moni generating station by the end of 1971 (originally
scheduled for completion in 1973); and,
(b) installation of a 60 MW umit at Moni generating station
in 1973.

5. THE PROJECT
Description
5.01      The Project proposed for Bank financing would cover part of
the generation and tranmission works unmder the 1970-1974 Program described
in paragraph 4.02 and would consist of:
(a)  expansion of the Moni generating station with a fourth
30 IrJ turboIgenerator, similar to the three existing
units, operating with steam at 900 lbs per square inch
pr-ess-re ad 900°F temperature,  -ppie4A by a 310,000
lb/hour steam generator;
(b)  construction of 87 miles of 132/66 kV transmission lines;
and,
(c) expansion of the existing Moni substation w-ith two 45 MVAf
66/132 kV transformers and construction of Athalassa sub-
station witlh 66 kV and 132 kV switchgear.
Estimated Cost
5.02      The detailed estimated cost of the Project is shown in Annex 1,

5.03      M4ost of the above direct costs are based on tender prices already
received. Allowances for contingencies and escalation amount to about 6%
of total direct costs which should be adequate.
5.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$5 million equivalent is the amount
recuired to complete the Authority's financin2 Dlan.  The loan would cover
the total foreign currency cost of the Project. The local currency cost
will be me-t bv the Authority'S own resourrces,
Engineering and Construction
5 .05     The Authority has retained PFOR as consultants for many years.
This firm assisted the Authority in carrying out the projects financed
under previous Blank loans and is .redering the same sevrices for the
present Project, including engineering and construction supervision for
the M"1oni st-at Joion expansion a r.du the transm,ission systvem - ex-e.4ion. Tl
arrangement is satisfactory.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that 'uhe Authority w-ilnl continlue to emip"loy experienced consu.Ltn+vSfo the
Project under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
5.06     On the assumption that the major contracts for the turbo-generator
and the steam gerier-tor will be placed before January 1970, it is expected
that the fourth unit at the Moni generating station will be commissioned by
thi1e ernd Of 1971 to meet the winter peak. All the traismission lUnes will
be completed before that time; work on the substations wiill be finished
before the end of 1972.
Procurement
5.07      With the assistance of the consultants, the Authority has issued
invitations for equipment tenders following the Bank's guidelines for inter-
national competitive bidding. Tenders for the Moni generating station and
transmission lines have been received and are being evaluated. No contract
awards will be made before the loan is signed.
Disbursement
5.08      Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made for the
C.I.F. cost of imported equipment and materials and the actual foreign
currency cost of the consultants' services and are expected to be completed
by the end of 1972. The Closing Date would be June 30, 1973. Should the
Project cost less than estimated, any savings from the loan should be
cancelled.

6. JUSTIFICATION OF PROJECT
Forecast of Energv Sales
6.om      With t3-e assistance of PCRv the Authoritv has made a detailed sales
forecast based on past sales under each tariff schedule. The results are
summarized i An   - 2.9  _ The overnl 1 electrictiy constnmprtion has been estimated
to increase at an average annual rate of 10% for the next five years, slightly
higher thian for the last five years (9.6C) Th i is reasnah1e, considering
the improved political and economic conditions of the country.
6.02      Domestic consumption is expected to rise at an average of 10p partly
because of the 4ncrease in the nuILber of domestic cors,ers and par+'y because
of the increased consumption per consumer as a result of more extensive use of
Pmiectkric h'or,le appliarices .
6.03      The estimate for the increase I-I cons-umpton by cor,mmercial estab-
lishments, at 9.4%, is mainly supported by the booming tourism business as
evidenced by many hotels under construction or committed to be constructed
in the near future.
6.04      A recently completed cement factory is installing additional facili-
ties to double its annual production. One major mining corporation is also
in the process of expansion. A new oil refinery will be established. These
and other definite industrial loads will contribute to the 10.5% expected
rate of increase in the industrial category.
Forecast of Maximum Demand
6.05      From the forecast energy sales, future maximum demands are deter-
mined by estimating percentages of system losses and annual load factor as
shown in Annex 3. The forecast annual growth in maximum demand will average
9.5%. With the recent commissioning of the No. 3 unit at Moni, the total
installed capacity of the system increased to 174 MW with a firm capacity of
1h4 MW. This firm capacity will be barely sufficient to meet the estimated
maximum demand at the end of 1971. To provide some margin it will be neces-
sary to add generating capacity by that time.
Justification of Moni Generating Station Expansion
6.C6      Expansion of the Moni generating station with the 4th 30 Mrl unit
is the most economical means of meeting the load requirements. The only
practical alternative would be the installation of a gas turbine which would
have a somewhat lower canital cost. However, the saving in system operating
costs represents a return on the additional investment for Moni expansion of
the orAer of 19% nnd therefore the Authority's declsion on !-4oni expansion is
justified.



- 13 -
Need for Transmission System Extension
6.07      The proposed construction of the high voltage transmission
lines and substations which are based on the consultants' long-range
plan (paragraph 4.01) are sound.   The new lines are required to maintain
satisfactory voltage levels after the expected load growth and   to pro-
vide reasonable reliability of supply. Some of them are also needed to
replace woodpole lines constructed i5-20 years ago, during the early
stages of development, which are no longer adequate to meet the present
load condition. The expansion of the substations is necessary to supply
the increasing power demand.

amounting to 5% of the requirements would bring the total contribution
from the Authority's own resources to 69%.



7.03      Disbursements totaling ,CO.! million under Bank loan No. 494-CY
and 0C2.1 million under the proposed loan of US$5 million would finance
25% of the requirements. The new loan is assumed to bear interest at the
rate of 7% and to have a term of 20 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace.
The balance of the requirements for the period would be covered by LCO .!5
million disbursed in 1972 from a loan of C1.0 million. The Authority will
need to borrow this amount to finance the further expansion of Moni station
with a 60 MW unit (paragraph 4.02) which is not included in the present
Project.
Future Earnings
7.04      Projected income statements for the five-year period 1969 through
1973 are shown in Annex 5. For the purpose of these projections, costs
other than fuel have been assumed to increase at the same rate as in the
past (9 to 14% per annum). Fuel cost has been assumed to increase by about
5% after the present contract expires in 1970. The projections show that
present tariffs can be maintained. Should higher cost increases take place,
the Authority would probably have to raise its tariffs in order to comply
with the Bank loan agreements (paragraph 3.22). Financial ratios are given
in Annex 7.
7.05      Operating income is expected to increase from LC1.2 million in
1968 to LC2.0 million in 1973.  The operating ratio is exneeted to decline
from 68.3% in 1968 to 66.5% in 1973 mainly because of reduced operation of

in a position to start repaying the principal of the uovernment loans (para-
graph 3.15). The Authority and the Government should agree on terms and
conditions of repayment acceptable to the Bank, taking into acco-unt the dual
objectives of allowing the Government to use these funds while maintaining
an acceptable financial position for the Authority.  An agreement which would
meet these objectives would provide for repayment in equal installments of
principal and interest over a period of not less tnan 25 years, including
five years of grace, with an interest rate approximately equal to the average
cost of 4.88%, and not in excess of 5%. The Bank's loans should enjoy
seniority over the Government loans. Such an agreement would ensure that the
Authority's capital structure would remain sound over the life of tne proposed
loan, as the Government loans would be gradually replaced by retained earn-
ings. The Government loans would be freed for use in other sectors of the
economy.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, it was agreed that the following existing
covenants  will be extended for the life o f the proposed loan:
a.   The Governm.ent and the Borrower will inform the Bank
in time for the Bank to be able to make comments on any
proposed amendments to the Electricity Development Law
or any proposed appointments of chief executive, tech-
nical or f:1nancial officer of the Authority (paragraph
3 .o4);
b.   The Borrower will transmit to the Bank its financial
stlatem,ents, certified b,y an 4ind-Aepen%Aen4W account-an-t
acceptable to the Bank,and the accountantts report not
m,ore tan-11di fouur` r,or.ths after thXe ernd of its fica J.a
(paragraph 3.19);
c.   The Borrower will take all steps necessary to obtain
adjustments in its rates which will provide adequate
revenues to maintain an operating ratio of not more
than 68% and will charge adequate depreciation
(paragraph 3.22); and,
d.   The Borrower will employ qualified consultants
acceptable to the Bank for the Project (paragraph 5.05).
8.02      The Authority also agreed to seek the Bankts consent before in-
curring debt, unless the sum of net operating income and depreciation is
at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service in any future year (paragraph
7.09).
8.03      The Bank agreed to remove the limitation on the repayment of
principal on Government loans (paragraph 3.15) after the Government and the
Authority agree on terms and conditions for the repayment of these loans
acceptable to the Bank. The Bank loans wilJ however, continue to enjoy
seniority over the Government loans (paragraph 7.06).
