The development objectives of the Food Security Project for Ethiopia are to build the resource base of poorer rural
households, increase their employment and incomes, reduce their real costs of food, and improve nutrition levels for their
children under five years of age as well as for pregnant and lactating mothers. There are six project components: 1) funds to
communities/Kebeles--the majority of the project; 2) community-based child growth promotion by providing community funds
and capacity building; 3) capacity building funds to Woredas, Regions, and Federal Ministries for specific, project-related
activities; 4) investments undertaken at the federal and regional levels to study and launch initiatives and policies to lower
transaction costs in food marketing; 5) investments in communications to ensure transparency; and 6) administration of the
flow of funds, and monitoring and evaluation.
