Some lessons\n            learned includes: targeting the poor, vulnerable groups and\n            women can be done effectively in a highly decentralized\n            setting if communities are appropriately mobilized to\n            confirm the status of households; results tend to be better\n            where there is political commitment and where communities\n            have been effectively engaged in decisions regarding program\n            delivery; community determination of interest rates and\n            payback period, while encouraging ownership of revolving\n            fund management, if not well directed can also lead to\n            inappropriate loan products; and while it is possible to\n            provide financial services through many channels, effective\n            and sustainable management of such services requires that\n            they be provided through financial institutions."}, "docdt": "2011-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
