Suralaya; (ii) determine the optimal mining and transport\n            system; (iii) recommend the institutional arrangements and\n            training required for executing the Project and\n            strengthening the various operating entities; and (iv)\n            complete the detailed engineering and procurement\n            documentation for the Project. The engineering loan will\n            resolve the outstanding questions regarding the economic\n            viability of coal substitution and prepare for the\n            implementation of an integrated coal mine - transportation\n            expansion project, which will ensure the delivery of\n            approximately 2.5 million tons of coal per annum from South\n            Sumatera, to a dual-fired (coal/oil) power plant to be\n            located in Java, with a power generation capacity of 750 MW,\n            thus substituting for 9 million barrels of oil per annum. An\n            Indonesian Project Management Group (PMG), assisted by\n            technical and legal specialists, will represent and\n            coordinate the participation of the power, mining and\n            transport operating entities, and will supervise the Project\n            Services Contractor (PSC)."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
