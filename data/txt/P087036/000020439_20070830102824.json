The factor leading to the\n            cancellation of the loan was that prospects for obtaining\n            timely congressional approval of the loan appeared to be\n            remote and the Bank declined a Government proposal to extend\n            the deadline for effectiveness by an additional six months\n            beyond end-2006. Further discussions with the Government did\n            not succeed in remedying the problem, and in March 2007, the\n            Bank management decided to cancel the Loan Agreement. The\n            main lesson learned is that changes in Paraguay's\n            political conditions can critically affect project,\n            effectiveness, implementation and achievement of project objectives."}, "docdt": "2007-08-03T00:00:00Z"}
