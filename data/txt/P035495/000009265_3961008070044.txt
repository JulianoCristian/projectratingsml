MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
ARGENTINE REPUBLIC FOR A SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Argentine Republic for US$152 million to help finance a two-
year project to protect critical social expenditures and improve the efficiency of
programs for the poor and unemployed during the period of economic downturn and
fiscal restraint in 1995 and 1996. The loan will be a single currency (US Dollar) loan
with the standard amortization term, grace period and interest rate for fixed-rate US
dollar single currency loans expected to disburse within 0-3 years.
2.    Background. After four years of rapid economic growth averaging 7.7 percent
annually, Argentina is facing its first serious economic crisis since it implemented the
highly successful Convertibility Plan in 1991. Higher international interest rates and the
Mexico crisis have reduced capital inflows. Between December 1994 and March 1995,
the stock market declined by about 30 percent and banking deposits fell by around 15
percent. Economic growth has slowed considerably, with economic growth in 1995
expected to be flat.
3.   In mid-March of this year, the Government reacted forcefully to the crisis. It
announced the extension to March 31, 1996, of its Extended Fund Facility agreement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and proposed changes in the tax system that are
expected to generate a fiscal surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP (including privatization
proceeds) in 1995. The main measures included a temporary increase in the VAT rate
from 18 to 21 percent, an increase in wage taxes, and a reduction in export subsidies.
4.    At the same time, the federal budget was cut by 3.9 percent, from US$42.9 billion
to US$41.3 billion. Excluding social security, planned federal spending for the social
sectors was reduced by 6.3 percent, from US$8.6 to US$8.1 billion, with education
reduced by 9 percent and health by 4 percent. Social programs targeted to the country's
poor and unemployed (programasfocalizados), which account for about US$3.7 billion in
planned spending for 1995, fared slightly worse. Comparisons with actual spending in
1994 show, however, that the Government remains committed to increasing real
expenditures for the social sectors and especially the poor -- planned 1995 spending
(adjusted for cuts) for all social programs other than social security is 16 percent higher
than last year, and for the poverty-oriented programs it is more than one-third higher.
5.    If the Federal Government makes any additional budget cuts during 1995 or
reduces its expenditures in 1996, however, the reductions could fall heavily on social
expenditures, resulting in serious declines in the coverage and quality of critical services
(for example, supplementary feeding, vaccinations and infectious disease control, public
works employment) for the poor and out-of-work. Unless special measures are adopted,



2
the current economic downturn and reductions in public social expenditures are likely to
have an adverse impact on social conditions in Argentina, as reflected in higher rates of
malnutrition, illness, school drop-out, etc. Unemployment, which increased from 7
percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994 as a consequence of structural changes in the
Argentine economy, has risen to an alarmingly high level of 18 percent of the work force
in recent months. At the same time, funding for unemployment insurance and for related
public works employment and training programs is shrinking. The share of the population
living in poverty, which declined from about 35 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 1993, is
in danger of rising once again during the period of economic austerity that Argentina is
entering. Under these circumstances, it is critical that the Govemment protect and
increase the efficiency of its spending for health, nutrition, education, rural development,
and employment and income support programs which are targeted to the poor.
6.    Government Economic and Social Policy. In the face of the current economic
crisis, the Argentine Government is reinvigorating the adjustment process by passing
legislation capping social security pensions, liberalizing labor laws applicable to small and
medium enterprises, and adopting measures to restructure the financial system by
accelerating the privatization of provincial banks and the consolidation of private banks.
To bolster its adjustment program, the Government in March 1995 sought and obtained
pledges of financial assistance totaling about US$6.2 billion from the IMF, the World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Japanese EXIM Bank.
Combined with US$2.3 billion from the sale of special government bonds and projected
revenues of US$2.4 billion from the privatization of state enterprises, these exceptional
resources should help maintain the integrity of the Convertibility Plan.
7.    In the area of social policy, as stated in its letter to the Bank dated October 10,
1995, the Government is committed to policies that will invest in human capital for a
competitive labor market, create new employment opportunities, and help to reduce
poverty. This will be done by: (a) raising the quality and efficiency of spending for health,
education, employment, and training; (b) improving the targeting of poverty programs and
strengthening the information base for poverty monitoring and program evaluation; and
(c) encouraging the participation of non-governmental and community-based
organizations in social programs, especially those directed to the extreme poor. The
Government's commitment to invest in human capital and reduce poverty is reflected in
the growth of public social expenditures, which rose from 16.4 percent of GDP in the
1984-88 period to 17.3 percent during the first administration of President Carlos Menem
(1989-94), reaching 18.4 percent of GDP in 1994. In the area of labor policy, the
Government has recently enacted new laws on employment contracts, wage taxes, and
workmen's compensation designed to make contracting more flexible and to reduce the
cost of labor. Additional laws related to bankruptcy and to collective labor agreements
have either been sent to the Congress or will be submitted shortly. The Government has
also begun the process of improving its employment programs by closing and
consolidating existing programs and by placing greater emphasis on promoting
employment and training by the private sector.



3
8.    The Government has requested that a portion of the US$2.45 billion in emergency
loans from the World Bank and IDB (US$1.3 billion from the Bank and US$1.15 billion
from the IDB) be directed toward protecting and improving federal social expenditures.
The project described here responds to that request. The IDB has recently approved a
US$450 million adjustment loan that provides balance of payments support in return for
fulfillment of social policy conditionalities related to the maintenance of adequate levels of
public social expenditure, the development of a national food and nutrition policy, and
improvements in specific nutrition programs. IDB and the Bank have worked closely
together in the design of their respective operations, to ensure the complementarity of
policy conditionality and program activities. While the IDB loan aims at protecting social
expenditures in 1995, the World Bank project focuses on raising the efficiency of social
programs over the next 2-3 years. The IDB operation will help to improve spending on
provincial nutrition programs, whereas the proposed World Bank loan will assist
employment and training and rural basic education programs.
9.    Project Objectives. The project's major objectives are to: (a) protect and
increase the internal efficiency of nine ongoing social programs for the poor and
unemployed during 1995 and 1996; (b) increase the overall efficiency of social
expenditures by improving program targeting and implementation, promoting the
participation of civil society, and developing greater transparency and accountability; and,
(c) through a small social fund, test ways to provide more basic social services and
stimulate the economic production of poor households.
10.   Project Description. The proposed project has three main components: (a)
Priority Social and Income Support Programs; (b) Pilot Participatory Social Investment
Fund (Programa Participativo de Inversion Social, FOPAR); and (c) Technical Assistance
for the Improvement of Social Information, Monitoring and Evaluation of Targeted Social
Programs (Sistema de Informaci6n, Evaluaci6n, y Monitoreo de Programas Sociales,
SIEMPRO).
11.   Component A: Priority Social and Income Support Programs (US$366.8
million): Under this component, loan funds will finance a share of the 1995 and 1996
federal budget for selected programs in the areas of education and employment'. These
programs have a total 1995 budget of about US$190 million. They were selected using
the following criteria: (a) effectiveness of targeting the poor; (b) ability to provide
income support to the unemployed; (c) internal program efficiency; and (d) potential
for further rapid improvements in the short run. Loan resources will be used to ensure
that spending for these programs is maintained at its March 1995 level (already
reflecting two earlier rounds of budget cuts). In 1996, spending for these priority
programs will be at least maintained, and possibly increased, above the 1995 amounts.
The programs are: Plan Social Educativo (PSE); Programa Nacional de Pasantias (PRONAPAS);
Programa de Entrenamiento Ocupacional (PRENO/PROAS); and FORESTAR.



4
12.   As part of the project, the Government has agreed to protect the 1995 and 1996
budgets for these programs, plus the budgets of four other critical social programs for
childhood immunization, communicable disease control, nutrition, and small-scale farm
development.2 Altogether, US$300 million in annual spending is involved. To
improve these social programs, project funds will be used to conduct independent
evaluations, develop better internal monitoring and oversight by the Budget Evaluation
Directorate in the Ministry of Economy, and undertake in 1996 a broader review of
public social expenditures. The Ministry of Labor will use project assistance to
reassess and modify its employment generation programs and its unemployment
insurance scheme, improve its employment services (information and counseling), and
design and promote changes in labor policies and associated legislation.
13.   Component B: Pilot Participatory Social Investment Fund - FOPAR
(US$36.7 million): FOPAR is a two-year pilot which will create a transparent and
flexible mechanism for channeling resources directly to communities for poverty reduction
activities. It will also develop and test ways to target the poor, stimulate community
participation in all stages of the project cycle, and improve monitoring and evaluation of
poverty projects. FOPAR will concentrate its activities in the 92 poorest districts located
in Argentina's ten northern provinces.
14.   FOPAR will have two parts. Community-based subprojects (US$25.8 million)
will emphasize strengthening of community organizations and implementation of small-
scale infrastructure. Maximum subproject size will be US$100,000. Typical subprojects
will include strengthening of grass roots organizations, training of community leaders,
construction and rehabilitation of water supply and drainage systems, pedestrian bridges
and sidewalks, health posts, and feeding centers; and extension of credits to micro-
enterprises through revolving funds. Institutional development (US$10.9 million) will
cover capacity-building for the FOPAR central office (SDS) and its provincial
counterparts, including training, technical assistance, and office equipment for subproject
appraisal, supervision, monitoring and evaluation.
15.   Component C: Technical Assistance for the Improvement of Social
Information, Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Programs - SIEMPRO (US$14.4
million): When SDS was created by presidential decree in early 1994, it was charged
with the tasks of assisting the cabinet of ministers in setting national social policy and
coordinating social programs for the poor. To carry out these tasks, SDS has established
SIEMPRO. Project funds will be used to assist SIEMPRO to expand and maintain a
social information data base, in collaboration with government, academic and non-
governmental institutions. A survey of living conditions and access to social programs and
participatory poverty assessments will be carried out. A data bank covering national and
provincial social programs directed to the poor and vulnerable groups will be established.
Improved methodologies for targeting and evaluating social programs will be developed
2 Programa Ampliado de Inmunizaciones; Programa de Control de Chagas; Programa Apoyo Solidario a
los Mayores (ASOMA); and Programa Social Agropecuario (PSA).



5
and disseminated through seminars and workshops to staff of social sector agencies.
Social policy analysis will be carried out to assist the decisions of the social cabinet.
Finally, project funds will be used to establish the SIEMPRO unit in SDS, set up
SIEMPRO in provincial Ministries of Social Action (through a Technical Dissemination
Fund), and prepare a follow-up technical assistance project.
16.   Project Cost and Financing. The proposed project, to be carried out over a 30-
month period, is estimated at US$417.9 million equivalent: US$366.8 million for
Component A, US$36.7 million for Component B, and US$14.4 million for Component
C. Foreign exchange amounts to US$105.4 million or 25 percent of the total.
17.   The proposed Bank loan of US$152 million will finance 36 percent of project
costs. The Government will finance the remaining US$265.9 million equivalent, or 64
percent. Consistent with the objective of protecting existing government social programs
from budget cuts, the Bank share of financing for Component A is 32 percent. Since
Components B and C are for pilot investments in a social fund and in poverty analysis and
program management, the Bank's share of planned spending is correspondingly higher, at
about 70 percent.
18.   The Government of Argentina is eligible for single currency loans under the
expanded SCL program. Including the proposed loan, and US$500 million of previously
approved single currency loans, Argentina will have used 43 to 47 percent of its expected
US$1.4 - US$1.5 billion FY96 program. Argentina opted for the US dollar single
currency loan terms to facilitate improved debt management, and the fixed interest rate to
protect against possible market rate interest rate increases after the loan is fully disbursed.
19.   Project Implementation Arrangements. The Ministry of Economy will
coordinate the implementation of Component A, drawing on the support of program
managers from the Ministries of Education and Labor and from the Secretariat of
Economic Programming in its own ministry. The Ministry is creating a small unit
composed of a project coordinator, a project officer and an administrative assistant to plan
and manage the component. The Ministry will be responsible for the project Special
Account for Component A. The SDS will be responsible for the oversight of the
FOPAR (Component B) and SIEMPRO (Component C), which will have a second Special
Account. FOPAR will be managed centrally, but with strong local involvement in
planning and implementation of subprojects. Institutionally, it will have four tiers: a
national project unit in SDS, headed by a coordinator and assisted by an advisory
committee; a provincial office and council (Consejo Provincial Participativo); local
councils at the municipality level (Consejo Local de Desarrollo Social), composed of local
institutions and beneficiary representatives; and an executive committee at the community
level (Nuicleos de Beneficiarios). SIEMPRO will be managed by a central unit (Unidad
Ejecutora Central) in SDS with four departments (General Coordination, Social
Information and Targeting Department, Evaluation and Monitoring; and Training and
Technology Transfer). SIEMPRO will also have small units in provincial Ministries of
Social Action that would request assistance under a Technical Dissemination Plan.



6
Participation by the provinces in SIEMPRO will be demand-driven, and will require the
signing of Subsidiary Agreements.
20.   Project Sustainability. Component A of the project will not entail incremental
recurrent costs, as the education and employment programs to be financed are already
under implementation. The main purpose of this component, in fact, is to sustain these
ongoing programs during 1995 and 1996, at which time Argentina is expected to have
achieved the economic and fiscal adjustment that will permit the government to continue
financing priority social programs using domestic resources. The only minor exception to
this is in the area of technical assistance for the Ministry of Labor and for the public social
expenditure review. In both cases, the Government has recently created permanent policy
units financed from the regular budget, thus ensuring their sustainability beyond the life of
the project. Incremental recurrent spending in components B and C, amounting to less
than one percent of total project cost, will be easily absorbed by SDS and the provincial
and municipal agencies involved in the social investment fund.
21.   Bank Experience and Lessons Learned. There has been no previous Bank
experience in Argentina with this type of project which finances existing government
social programs for a two year "time-slice" (Component A). A similar operation - the
Mexico Program of Essential Social Services (PROSSE) - was negotiated earlier this
year and is at a very early stage of implementation. Lessons from the Mexico project
are that: (a) it is important to identify up-front social programs that use procurement
and financial accounting practices already acceptable to the Bank, to ensure that
ongoing government expenditures will be eligible for Bank financing; (b) choice of a
limited number of large social programs greatly simplifies implementation; and (c)
social expenditure conditionality should be simple, clearly monitorable, and should
build in some flexibility for adjustments in the "outer" years to be agreed between the
government and the Bank. Each of these lessons has been taken into account in the
proposed project. A major effort has been devoted to reviewing procurement and
accounting practices during pre-appraisal and to verifying their compatibility with Bank
guidelines. To simplify implementation, only five federal government programs
managed by two line agencies will be financed directly with the proposed loan. In the
unlikely event that one of these programs falls out of the project, a list of back-up
programs has been developed to permit substitution. The social expenditure
conditionality includes clear monitorable targets for 1995 and 1996. At the same time,
the Argentine Govemment will have some flexibility in adjusting the intemal
composition of the social budget for next year in order to improve targeting and
efficiency. Such adjustments will be discussed between the Govemment and the Bank
at the appropriate stage in the 1996 and 1997 budget cycle and as part of a review of
public social expenditures.
22.   The World Bank already has considerable experience with the kind of social
investment funds and stand-alone Technical Assistance operations being proposed for
Components B and C of this project.



7
23.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed loan is fully consistent with
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on May 4, 1995, with
the Provincial Bank Privatization Project (Ln. 3878-AR). The strategy focuses on
supporting Argentina's efforts to: (a) consolidate and deepen structural reforms, with
strong support during the current economic crisis; (b) reduce poverty and develop
human resources; and (c) rebuild the country's deteriorated infrastructure base. The
proposed loan, part of the US$1.3 billion emergency package offered by the Bank to
Argentina to reform the banking and health insurance sectors, would support objective
(b) related to poverty reduction and human resource development, by helping to
safeguard the delivery of social services to the poor and those most adversely affected
by the current economic crisis. The World Bank is already involved in the social
sectors in Argentina through a series of recent lending operations3 and a poverty
assessment. The proposed project would build on this prior knowledge and experience.
24.     Key Issues and Actions. Prior to negotiations, the Government: (a)
presented to the Bank a final draft of its Letter of Social Policy, which has now been
signed by the Minister of Economy; (b) provided draft terms of reference and a more
detailed costing for the public social expenditure review; (c) confirmed its figures for
amounts budgeted and spent to date for the social programs to be financed from the
loan and protected as part of the loan conditionality; and (d) presented a sample set of
performance indicators for the protected programs, to be used in the monitoring reports
of the Directorate of Budget Evaluation.
25.    At negotiations, assurances were obtained for Component A that: (a) the
Government will maintain the 1995 budget for the "basket" of protected social
programs at US$300 million; (b) no later than December 15, 1995, the Government
will furnish to the Bank information showing that the 1996 federal budget proposal
contains a set of social programs with similar composition to the 1995 basket and with
a budgeted amount of at least US$300 million; (c) by December 15, 1995 the
Government will agree with the Bank on the specific employment and training
programs to be financed from the Bank loan during 1996; (d) by January 15, 1996, the
Government will hire the project officer in the Ministry of Economy, and by January
31, 1996, will employ the manager in the Ministry of Labor; and (e) the Government
will send to the Bank by December 15, 1995 the terms of reference of a public social
expenditure review, by May 31, 1996 a draft of the report on federal social
3 Approved projects include the Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition Project (Loan No. 3643-AR,
also known as PROMIN), approved on August 3, 1993 in the amount of US$100 million, and the
First Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project (Loan No. 3794-AR),
approved on September 15, 1994 in the amount of US$190 million. Projects under preparation
include the proposed Second Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project
(negotiations held in October 1995, for a proposed loan of US$115 million), the Provincial Health
Sector Development Project (Loan No. 3931-AR, presented to the Board on August 3, 1995, for
US$144 million) and the Higher Education Reform Project (Loan No. 3921, presented to the Board
on July 6, 1995, for US$165 million).

expenditures, and by December 31, 1996 a draft of its review of provincial social
spending.
26.   Assurances were also obtained that FOPAR would submit for the Bank's
review: (a) the first five grant agreements for subprojects, including their approval
reports; and (b) any subproject which does not conform with the eligibility criteria in
the FOPAR Operational Manual. For Component C, assurances were obtained that:
(a) unless agreed with the Bank, SDS would not terminate, amend, or fail to enforce
any provision in the subsidiary agreement with INDEC, and (b) draft terms of
reference and preliminary design of the survey of living conditions and access to social
services would be furnished to the Bank for its review.
27.   Conditions of disbursement will include: (a) for Component A for 1995, the
Minister of Economy will have appointed the project coordinator with qualifications
satisfactory to the Bank; (b) for Component A for 1996, the Government and Bank will
have agreed on the exact composition of the employment programs to be financed from
the Loan; (c) for Components B and C, the FOPAR and SIEMPRO executing units will
have been staffed with managers with qualifications acceptable to the Bank; and (d) for
Component B, the FOPAR operational manual will have been approved by the Bank
and issued.
28.   Program Objective and Poverty Category. The Social Protection Project is a
central part of the program of targeted interventions for Argentina, since it preserves
and improves essential social services for the poor, generates short-term employment
and training for those adversely affected by the economic crisis, and ensures food and
nutrition benefits for the most vulnerable population groups. It thus falls under the
Poverty Reduction category. Targeting to the poor occurs in several ways in the
project. Civil works, books, and teacher training under the Plan Social Educativo are
reserved exclusively for poor communities. Child immunization and Chagas disease
control activities are self-targeted, because only low-income families use public
facilities for vaccinations and Chagas occurs only in sub-standard housing. The
Programa Apoyo Solidario a los Mayores (ASOMA) nutrition program and the
Programa de Asistencia Solidaria and Programa de Entrenamiento Ocupacional
(PROAS/PRENO) employment programs use strict screening devices to complement
the self-targeting that occurs with these programs because of the relatively low social
status associated with their benefits.
29.   Participatory Approach. Proposed improvements in several of the social
programs under Component A will emphasize expanded beneficiary participation. The
action plan for ASOMA requires that recipients of food packages carry out community
service activities; communities benefiting from the Plan Social Educativo must donate
labor and materials for school construction; and in the Programa Social Agropecuario,
special efforts will be made to involve indigenous populations through technical
assistance and representation in decision-making bodies. FOPAR will emphasize
strong beneficiary participation through its community development component, the



9
formation of local councils to oversee subprojects, and the heavy involvement of local
NGOs in the design and implementation of subprojects. Beneficiary consultation
meetings were also carried out during the preparation phase of FOPAR. Further,
beneficiary assessments will be used as a project evaluation tool under SIEMPRO.
30.   Environmental Impact. The project does not present major environmental
risks, and therefore an environmental rating of "C" applies.
31.   Expected Benefits and Risks The proposed project will help to reduce the
social costs associated with Argentina's current economic crisis and related adjustment
program. It will preserve health and nutrition services for millions of Argentines
currently living in poverty or facing unemployment. About 850,000 children and
pregnant women will be vaccinated and over half a million persons protected from
Chagas Disease, and about 170,000 poor persons will receive supplementary feeding.
Nearly two million students will benefit from the Plan Social Educativo. The project
will provide employment opportunities and develop the skills of about 200,000
currently unemployed persons, and will help improve the productive capacity of
thousands of poor rural families. At the same time, the project will assist in building
federal and provincial capacity for social policy analysis and formulation and for
monitoring and evaluating social programs. It will also help generate a new model for
financing grass-roots poverty reduction activities using community participation.
32.   The main risks facing the project are: (a) further budget cuts; and (b) slow
disbursement as a result of lack of local capacity and insufficient coordination between
the Ministry of Economy, SDS and the implementing agencies. The Bank (and IDB)
are working closely with the Ministry of Economy to safeguard the budget of the
targeted social programs. Project conditionality related to public social spending in
1995-96 will reduce this risk. The second risk will be mitigated by concentrating on a
small number of important social programs and by giving priority to implementing
agencies with a demonstrated record of strong program management. Covenants for
appointing the project coordinator and hiring the project officer and sub-coordinator in
the Ministry of Labor will help to ensure that an accountable management team is in
place at the outset of the project. Procurement and disbursement procedures have been
designed to expedite implementation and reimbursement.
