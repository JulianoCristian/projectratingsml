poor and the vulnerable during the period\n            of severe fiscal restraint in 1995 and 1996; 2) assist in\n            providing income support to those who would be adversely\n            affected by the economic measures, especially those who\n            would lose their jobs; and 3) improve the focus and\n            management of social programs by promoting transparency and\n            efficiency, participation of the civil society, and better\n            targeting of social services to the poor. The project will\n            have three major components: 1) priority social and income\n            support programs; 2) pilot participatory social investment\n            fund (FOPAR); and 3) improvement of social information,\n            targeting and monitoring of social programs (SIEMPRO)."}, "docdt": "1995-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
