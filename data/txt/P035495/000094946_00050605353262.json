Regardless of a\n            challenging project design, implementation was successful\n            due to the high commitment, and competence from both the\n            Bank, and the Government staffs. The lessons suggest,\n            overall, the importance of up front institutional\n            relationships, which encourages cooperation, and\n            coordination for implementation arrangements. The highly\n            satisfactory performance of the Participatory Social\n            Investment Fund (FOPAR), was built on a cautious, and\n            conservative approach during the initial phase; through its\n            rigid appraisal process, FOPAR established a trustworthy\n            reputation, effectively guarding it from potential political\n            interference; and, the focus on internal institution\n            building, led to a highly effective management information\n            system, unique in its design, and implementation process. On\n            the other hand, the decentralized approach of the Social\n            Information, Monitoring and Evaluation of Targeted Social\n            Programs (SIEMPRO), yielded high benefits, enabling the\n            provision of technical assistance to the provinces, which\n            proved not only a highly cost effective approach, but\n            reinforced the government policy of decentralizing execution\n            of social programs."}, "docdt": "2000-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
