                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project is making good progress. With less than 15 months remaining to Project closure on December 31, 2014, a number of areas, e.g., Post-PIFRA sustainability study,
                         complete implementation of SAP Upgrade and implementation of Audit Management Information System require close attention. Concerted and coordinated efforts from all
                         stakeholders will ensure the success and sustainability of PIFRA II achievements.
