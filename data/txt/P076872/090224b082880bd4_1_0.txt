                         greater use of country systems for financial management of foreign funded projects, and enhanced capacity for fiscal reporting to help improve the delivery of services. The
                         functionality of core systems has been supplemented by added value initiatives which have led to enhanced service delivery e.g the introduction of a facility to pay pensions by direct

                         Oversight of the use of public monies has improved and there is also increased accountability and transparency in key aspects of public financial management. Audit quality has been
                         enhanced and Performance Audit and Information Systems Audit established. Timely, reliable and accurate reporting of accounts has been facilitated and the audit certification of
                         financial statements is now being finalized within 8 months of the financial year-end. This is a significant improvement from baseline and compares favorably with other countries in
                         South Asia despite the additional rigor of the quality assurance arrangements in place in Pakistan.
