                                        RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.    This Restructuring Paper seeks your approval for an extension in the Closing Date for the
Pakistan: Second Improvement to Financial Reporting and Auditing Project (IDA Credit 4109 &
IDA Credit 4864) from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014. No additional funds are required
to complete Project activities by end of 2014. Overall the project is successfully achieving its
development objectives and PDO level indicators are expected to be met without any further
delay or obstructions.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Background and Rationale for Extension

2.       PIFRA II’s development objectives are to: (a) build capacity to improve accuracy,
comprehensiveness, reliability, and timeliness of financial and fiscal reporting at all levels of government;
(b) improve public financial management, accountability, and transparency; (c) enhance the capacity of
public sector managers to use credible financial information for better and informed decision-making; and
(d) facilitate oversight of the use of public monies, and increase the national and international credibility of
government’s financial statements and assurance processes.

Key Project Data:

                                                 Original
                                                                      Additional Financing
                                                  Project
         Board Approval                        Sep. 06, 2005              Feb. 10, 2011
         Effectiveness Date                    Nov. 8, 2005               Jun. 27, 2011
         Original Closing Date                 Dec. 31, 2010              Jun. 30, 2013
         Revised Closing Date                  June 30, 2013                  N/A
         Original Credit Amount.                US$ 84.0 m                 US$ 24.5 m
         Disbursed (April 30, 2013)             US$ 74.02 m                US$ 10.46 m




4.      The extension is required to:

        (a) provide the extra time required to carry out a SAP software upgrade for the existing Financial
            Accounting and Budgeting System (FABS) financial information system. The SAP upgrade
            is critical to the successful continued operation and development of the Government’s
            financial systems, and thus the sustainability of the project. By not pursuing this software
            upgrade we believe the Government will be placed in the position of operating its mission
            critical FABS with an outdated version of the software which will progressively become
            more expensive to maintain and, within a short period of time, have limited functionality; and




                                                      4
        (b) provide the extra time required to implement an Audit Management Information System
            (AMIS). We believe that the implementation of the AMIS will provide significant benefits in
            improved audit planning and quality assurance processes.

5.       A delay in finalizing the SAP software upgrade contract and delays in procurement and
implementation for a custom-developed AMIS have led to the need for an extension. GoP has now
confirmed its intention to proceed with SAP upgrade and is awaiting the Bank’s approval of the extension
of the closing date to sign the contract. Discussions have also commenced within Government to support
and maintain FABS and related operations going forward to ensure the long term sustainability of the
Government`s financial operations.

6.      Without timely completion of the aforementioned actions, and if the Bank declines to extend the
Closing Date:

        (a) the project is at risk of a downgrade in its development objective rating, which would be an
            unfortunate outcome given the progress that has been achieved under PIFRA thus far.
        (b) the sustainability of Project achievements would be at risk.
        (c) it would send the wrong signal to the GoP the Bank has no more interest in the
            implementation, achievement and sustainability of this national program.


Project Status and the Performance Rating

        7.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains satisfactory and on track as progress
continues to be made in achieving results and meeting key results indicators of the project. Excellent
progress has been made in building capacity for improved reliability, comprehensiveness and
timeliness of financial and fiscal reporting and the capacity to use financial information for more
informed decision-making. Oversight of the use of public monies has improved with higher
quality risk based auditing with increased accountability and transparency in public financial
management. The government financial statements and accompanying audit reports are now
reported to the Parliament within 8 months of the close of the financial year. Underpinning these
achievements, a world class financial management information system (FABS) has been
implemented and is now the core fiscal and financial management system of government. It is
used for managing budgets, making payments (including salaries and pensions) within a sound
internal control environment. It produces financial reports for economic and fiscal management.
In 2010, additional financing was provided to support a smooth transition from the development
phase to full government administration of the systems and help consolidate the Government’s
fiscal and financial management capacity. There have however been substantive delays in completing
critical procurements in relation to SAP upgrade and AMIS, because of which the implementation
progress and procurement performance has been rated Moderately Satisfactory.               There are no
fiduciary/safeguard issues or outstanding ineligible expenditures. There has been no evidence of fraud and
corruption related to this project in the past. Utilization of funds has been examined and there is no
necessity to reallocate the funds amongst categories.

Action Plan

8.      As stated in para 4 above, there are two key activities that require extension in Closing Date and
PIFRA has (a) pending extension of Closing Date, confirmed arrangements for signing of the contract for
upgrade of SAP; and (b) initiated the process for procurement of AMIS. As such PIFRA is well
positioned to commence both the AMIS project and SAP upgrade soon after the project is formally
extended. The revised action plan and procurement plan and related activities which cover the proposed
extension period have been discussed with the client and are satisfactory ( Annex 1). In many cases,

                                                    5
procurement processes have already been initiated and/or critical procurement reviews completed which
should help to ensure there are no further delays.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

9.       Based on the above submissions, we request your approval of an extension of the closing date of
Credit 4109 and Additional Financing Credit 4864 for this Project from June 30, 2013 to December 31,
2014. This would enable ongoing activities to be completed and ensure satisfactory closure of this
Project. Disbursement would be accelerated, with an anticipated US$8 million before June 30, 2013 and
entire total undisbursed amount of USD 26 million to be utilized by December 31, 2014. For clarity, it is
reiterated that this is a no cost extension; and that we expect the PDOs will be fully achieved and the
funds will be fully disbursed by revised closure date of the project.

10.     Upon your approval, the notification of extension will be issued to the Government of Pakistan.
