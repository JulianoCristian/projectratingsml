                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project is making good progress. However, with 9 months remaining to Project closure on December 31, 2014, a number of area require close attention, e.g., Finalization of
                         Post-PIFRA sustainability strategy, completion of implementation of SAP Upgrade and implementation of Audit Management Information System . Concerted and coordinated efforts
                         from all stakeholders will ensure the success and sustainability of PIFRA II achievements.
