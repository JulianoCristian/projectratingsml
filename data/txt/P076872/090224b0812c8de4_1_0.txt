levels. The Project is on track to meet its objectives and its key achievements include the establishment of an accounting, reporting, and audit system that covers core government
entities at the federal, provincial, and district level. In addition, the Project has enabled the timely and reliable reporting of accounts and audit certification of financial statements;
these are now being finalized within 8 months of the financial year-end. However, there still remain some actions related to the operation and maintenance of the Government
Financial Management Information System that will require additional time to implement. Accordingly, the World Bank Board approved two-year extension of the closing date together
with Additional Financing of US$24.5 million to establish stable information technology platforms that can be fully operated by relevant government agencies. The Additional
U    Financing became effective on June 27, 2011.
