F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
PIFRA II development objectives were to (a) build capacity to improve accuracy, comprehensiveness,
reliability, and timeliness of financial and fiscal reporting at all levels of government; (b) improve
public financial management, accountability, and transparency; (c) enhance the capacity of public
sector managers to use credible financial information for better and informed decision-making; and
(d) facilitate oversight of the use of public monies, and increase the national and international
credibility of government’s financial statements and assurance processes.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The project development objectives (PDOs) were not revised. However, there were improvements

                       a Green Book. Quarterly budget execution reports are prepared. Financial information is generated through the
                       system, whereas non -financial information on achievement of targets against allocated budget is collected

                      on the basis available budget. Annual financial statements are also used by PAOs and MOF, for example, as a
                      historical base for budget preparation etc. The comparative data by districts, entity or other such classification could
                      be a huge support to a performance management framework, but such analysis and use of data can only be enhanced
                      by progressively providing further support to the executives and policy makers.

Comments                Achieved. The statistical discrepancies previously termed as, unidentified expenditure are defined as a discrepancy

achievement)            Bank of Pakistan’s estimate of deficit financing. Statistical discrepancy is presented in the Pakistan Fiscal
                        Operations (PFO) tables on the Ministry of Finance (MoF) website. A large value for this entry signifies the
                        weakness in the accounting system and a need for action to address and rectify the problem. Various reforms under
                        PIFRA have significantly contributed to reducing statistical discrepancies. These reforms include, eliminating
                        redundant processes, timely recording of expenditure in appropriate accounts and effective reconciliation of
                        accounts. As a result of these reforms, Statistical Discrepancy has significantly reduced to 0.5% of GDP during first
                        quarter of fiscal year 2014-15 as compared to -1.2% of GDP at commencement of PIFRA II in May 2005. Data to
                        calculate this indicator is collected and collated by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Quarter-wise variations occur
                        because the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) and self-accounting entities do not report their expenditures on time.
                        However, full reconciliation is not technically possible due to delay in recording of expenditure from the entities
                        which are still not captured in FABS on real time basis, such as departmentalized accounts (WAPDA, NHA) and
                        reconciliation delays with EAD.

                       budgetary commitments are recorded with a lag at the same time when bill is recorded. MOF has issued notification

H. Restructuring (if any)
A Level-1 restructuring was done in January 2011 to provide an additional credit equivalent of
US$24.5 million and to extend the original closing date of the project from June 30, 2011, to June 30,
2013. The main objectives of the Additional Financing were to (a) provide essential interim support
for the continued operation and maintenance of the FABS; and the consolidation of the audit function,
including the full development of AMIS; (b) address some continuing issues that were impeding the
full realization of fiscal and financial management outcomes from the IT-based financial management
and auditing systems developed under PIFRA I & II; and (c) build capacity of the MoF, OCGA, and
OAGP to apply the automated information systems to key areas of PFM reform and further integrate
the processes of fiscal policy, budget preparation, and financial management.

Restructuring included revising component activities as well as a refinement of the institutional
implementation arrangements. In addition, the Additional Financing invoked the country financing
parameters for Pakistan by allowing for 100 percent financing of project activities during the extended
life of the project. There was a realignment of the project components and the institutional
arrangements to better address implementation necessities as well as strengthen stakeholder
coordination (see section 1.4). Establishing two separate and distinct component steering committees
– one responsible for audit and the other responsible for FABS – strengthened the institutional
structure of the original PIFRA II. These two committees were responsible for overseeing the project
components’ implementation within their agreed policy framework, reviewing key implementation
strategies, providing strategic high-level directions, and reviewing overall implementation progress.
A Level-2 restructuring was done to extend the closing date of the project from June 30, 2013, to
December 31, 2014. The extension was required to provide the extra time required to carry out a SAP
software upgrade for the existing FABS financial information system.
Third restructuring in December 2014 took place just before project closing; the World Bank
cancelled the unutilized amount of US$10.3 million equivalent from the project and reallocated it to
the Pakistan Program.

ICR Abstract
The Second Improvement to Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA II) satisfactorily
achieved all of its four PDOs. The project has remarkably improved the public financial
management (PFM) landscape of Pakistan by bringing basic financial discipline at all levels of
government with more than 500 government entities and around 7,000 line managers
benefiting from the financial accounting and budgeting system. This has facilitated processing
and recording millions of government transactions in a single database and generating
reconciled information on a virtually real-time basis for tracking poverty expenditures, timely
audits, and informed decision making. The audit cycle has been reduced from 33 to 8 months
for submission to the legislature. Training and professionalization of thousands of staff in
accounting, auditing, and information technology has ensured the sustainability of these
reforms. PIFRA II achievements extend even wider in the context of the political economy and
capacity challenges. However, there continues to be a need for better use of system
functionalities and use of information for decision-making purposes over time as a contribution
to effective public resource management.
Arguably, the choices made at the design stage of PIFRA II were responding to the reform-
space at the time, but there is a need for a greater focus on the clients or users of the new
systems (reform-subjects). For instance, audit reforms should focus more on the role of
Departmental Accounts Committees (DACs) and Public Accounts Committees (PACs).
Similarly, accounting and financial reporting reforms should focus more on how
Ministry/Departments of Finance, Planning institutions, Principal Accounting Officers (PAOs),
Public Procurement Regulatory Authorities (PPRAs), and budget-holders will benefit from
various system functionalities and use information for decision-making. While effective
communication and capacity building are key elements of PFM reforms, the incentives and
mechanisms for coalition building among institutions for joint ownership and sustainability of
change are equally critical. Additionally, linking PFM reforms to strategic goals of effective
PFM can guide the reforms in the direction of results, and at the same time, provide flexibility
to prioritize the specific reform interventions to lift specific impediments to achieving these
goals.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
The development hypothesis underlying both the first and second Project to Improve Financial
Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA I and II) was that financial control, reporting, and audit systems used
by the Government of Pakistan (GoP) would make a substantial contribution to sound PFM, which in
turn impacts on better governance and therefore improves the efficiency and effectiveness of public
expenditure and increases the potential for economic growth and poverty reduction.
Figure 1:




PIFRA I’s key achievements were (a) the separation of accounting and auditing functions by creating
the Office of the Controller General of Accounts (OCGA), through the enactment of two Ordinances;
(b) a road map was developed for better public sector accounting and financial reporting systems
through the adoption of improved accounting principles and standards by the GoP using the New
Accounting Model (NAM); (c) design and implementation of a new budget classification system and
chart of accounts (CoA) conforming to international standards; and (d) the design and
implementation of a system for automation of budgeting, accounting and reporting functions of the
federal and provincial governments and implementation of this system at 30 sites. The project also
strengthened the capacity of the Office of Auditor General (OAG) through the introduction of
enhanced standards, systems, and better trained staff. The testing of the new Financial Audit Manual
included use of computer aided audit techniques (CAATS) software Audit-Command Language for
acquisition of data from the SAP system in the Abbottabad District. The project also financed foreign
degrees and nearly fifty officers were sent abroad to attend various short-term courses on Debt
Management, Government Regulations, Macroeconomic Policy and Management, Foreign Exchange
Management, Budgeting and Financial Management in the Public Sector.

PIFRA II supported widespread replication and roll-out of the systems developed in PIFRA I and
accommodated the different tiers of government by working with other GOP reform efforts such as
introducing devolved local government, introducing a medium-term budget framework (MTBF), and
assisting in deepening the changes in government financial management. These parallel efforts,
which were seen as complementary, were coordinated by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and
supported by the European Commission (EC), Asian Development Bank (ADB), UK Department for
International Development (DfID), and International Monetary Fund (IMF), respectively.

PIFRA II Additional Financing supported the systems and applications upgrades, capacity building
aimed at sustainability of operation of these systems, and enhancing the functionality such as MTBF.
                                                                                                   1
These additional cost and time investment led to the achievement of new and enhanced results’
targets under the Additional Financing. For instance, the original target for audit completion was
enhanced from 12 months to 6 months and FABS support to MTBF was introduced.
This section of the ICR provides a synopsis of overall context, development objectives and project
design. An overview of the project costs and financing is given in the Annex 1, whereas outputs
achieved by components is given in the Annex 2. List of supporting documents on the file is given in
Annex 9 and Annex 11 provides some analysis of successful improvement examples in system
functionality and use, at times beyond the scope of PIFRA II.

1.1 Economic and Financial Reporting Context at Appraisal
At the time of project preparation in 2005, Pakistan’s economic growth had accelerated from an
average of 3.3 percent during 1997-2002 to 6.4 percent in FY2003/04 and 8.4 percent in FY2004/05.
Public debt fell to 61 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in this same time period from almost
90 percent in FY2000/01. Improved fiscal performance and growing fiscal space resulting from
savings on interest expenditures, generous external support, and improved revenue administration
have enabled the Government to exceed targets for education spending.
The Government had recognized that weak governance was at the heart of Pakistan’s poverty and
development challenges and that PFM reform was essential. Actions had been taken to address
critical issues. Government accounting, for example, had been separated from government auditing
by the creation of an Office of the Controller General of Accounts (OCGA) and PIFRA I completed
significant improvements in accounting and auditing framework and piloting of IFMIS.

1.2 Project Development Objectives, Key Indicators (as approved), and Beneficiaries
PIFRA II’s project development objectives (PDOs) included the following: (a) build capacity to
improve accuracy, comprehensiveness, reliability, and timeliness of financial and fiscal reporting at
all levels of government; (b) improve PFM, accountability, and transparency; (c) enhance the
capacity of public sector managers to use credible financial information for better and informed
decision-making; and (d) facilitate oversight of the use of public monies and increase the national and
international credibility of government financial statements and assurance processes.

Key indicators were:
   Implementation and operation of Information Technology (IT)-based budgeting and accounting
    systems, for example, number of sites operational and establishment of a SAP competency center;
   Extent of reconciliation of accounts achieved and progress toward introducing interface with
    State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), and Federal Board of Revenue
    (FBR);
   Adoption of the new accounting model and reduced level of data entry errors;
   Improvement to scope, timeliness, and quality of reporting delivered to end-users;
   Extent to which entity accounts are audited using modern audit practices, and savings are
    identified by the audit; and
   Creation and maintenance of a pool of professionally qualified government accountants and
    auditors capable of developing and sustaining further initiatives.
Revised objectives (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justifications:
The PDOs were not revised. However, there were improvements made in the results framework,
refining the outcomes which were better aligned to the PDO, including new milestones for closer
                                                                                              2
monitoring of implementation progress. Additional financing continued with these refined indicators
and enhanced (and some new) targets as compared to those originally approved justifying additional
investment of time and resources to upgrade system applications and hardware.
Primary beneficiaries of project:
 Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan (OAGP) in terms of capacity building. OAGP staff
   benefited by receiving upgraded training facilities and programs of internationally accepted
   professional standards.
 Office of the Controller General of Accounts. Strengthening of OCGA administrative and
   management powers through capacity building of CGA staff; and recruitment of senior staff with
   qualifications and experience.
 Ministry of Finance at the federal level and Finance Departments at provincial level. Processes
   were improved to enhance efficiency for budget preparation and compilation.
Secondary beneficiaries of the project:
 Ministries, line departments, and agencies at federal and provincial level and districts across the
   country received support in budget preparation and execution.
 Civil servants, pensioners, and government contractors and suppliers who benefit from
   improvements in PFM through enhanced efficiency and transparency in the payment processes.
 Citizens, elected representatives, civil society, and development partners who can access the
   timely budget execution information made public on the MoF website.

1.3 Original and Revised Components (as approved)
The project originally consisted of four components. At the time of the Level 1 restructuring in
January 2011, component activities were revised. Instead of four components under PIFRA I, the
Additional Financing phase comprised three main components aligned with the PIFRA II structure:
Component 1, Financial Accounting and Budgeting System—MoF/CGA; Component 2, Audit; and
Component 3, Project Management. Component 1 under Additional Financing integrated the original
Components 1 and 2 into a holistic component since the MoF/CGA had taken over FABS operations
and maintenance during the Additional Financing period. The revised Component 2 provided
additional resources to further strengthen the external audit function through the establishment of
AMIS initiated under PIFRA II and also allowed the OAGP to fully transition to systems and
performance audit practices. The table 1 below summarizes the original and revised components:

1.5 Other significant changes
The project was restructured three times during implementation:
First restructuring. Level I restructuring was done in January 2011 to provide Additional Financing
of US$24.5 million and also to extend the closing date of the original project from June 30, 2011, to
June 30, 2013. The Additional Financing was aimed at helping finance activities associated with
deepening the reforms that had been successfully established under PIFRA II and also allowed for a
phased transition to substantial incorporation of the system under GOP line agencies.
Second restructuring. Level-2 restructuring of the project was done in May 2013 to extend the
closing date of the project from June 30, 2013, to December 31, 2014. The extension was required to
provide the extra time for SAP software upgrade for the existing financial information system.
Third restructuring. The third restructuring was done in December 2014 before the project closing;
the World Bank cancelled an unutilized amount of US$10.3 million from the project and reallocated
it to the Pakistan Program. The reallocation was done to avoid losing the country’s unutilized
International Development Association (IDA) funds for this operation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
The World Bank has been providing support to the Government of Pakistan for improving financial
accounting and reporting since late 1990s. There was a clear rationale and analytical foundation for
the Bank’s continuous intervention in the PFM reforms through PIFRA II. This section of the ICR
gives an account of key project design and implementation issues.

                                                                                                                      5
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Lessons learned during PIFRA I. The background analysis in the Project Appraisal Document
included key lessons from PIFRA I and an outline for key challenges for reform continuity. Some of
the key lessons from PIFRA I, which influenced the design of PIFRA II, are:
     Stakeholder participation and strong ownership is critical to project success. The project’s
       design should provide for early extensive interactions with a wide range of government
       counterparts at federal, provincial, and lower levels of government. Also, finance and line
       agencies in addition to core accounting and auditing staff across government should be
       included in this participatory process to acquire and maintain solid support and engagement in
       advancing the reform agenda and monitoring the project’s implementation.
     Strong project management is essential for smooth implementation. Having personnel in the
       project directorate with a project-oriented mindset makes a significant difference to the
       quality and timeliness of project outputs. Measures to limit the turnover of such staff, as
       defined above, would make the directorate more effective.
     Experienced management of large-scale IT systems implementation is critical. There is a
       critical need to have a government IT manager in place for the continued success of PIFRA I
       and II. A general manager and Management Information Systems manager had in fact been
       appointed along with the project staffing; the SAP competency center had commenced with
       the initial appointment of 17 staff.

Analytic underpinning. As part of project preparation, sector background was studied, main sector
issues were analyzed in depth, and government strategies to deal with these issues were also
considered. The project design took into account the sector issues as well as government strategies.
Design features. Given the above background knowledge, the project design was kept straight
forward, realistic, and well structured, even though it was complex because of the countrywide scope
of the project. Being a follow-on project, PIFRA II adopted the basic design envisioned by PIFRA I
but extended it to local-level government. The project’s approach was appropriate, both in its IT
aspect and its organizational arrangements. Likewise, the results framework was clear, relevant, and
monitorable. The design focused on the districts where capacity was already sufficient to permit
introducing the new accounting and financial reporting systems (namely, the main cities, where the
bulk of government expenditure occurs) and on the close and continuous interaction with other
donors to avoid gaps and duplication.
Risk-mitigation. Several potential risks and mitigation measures were spelled out in the Project
Appraisal Document. Risks assessed as High were (a) government fails to maintain commitment to
fiscal and budgetary reforms; (b) resistance to financial transparency cannot be overcome; (c) Auditor
General of Pakistan (AGP) and CGA discharge of responsibility for recruitment, staff deployment,
and development of career path does not become effective and clear; (d) the size of the project
overwhelms implementation capacity; and (e) adequate and qualified accounting, auditing, and IT
staff are not hired, trained, and equipped with effective tools and are not retained to maintain and
operate the system. The risks pertaining to government’s commitment and transparency that
materialized during implementation were managed appropriately through IMF and the Bank’s
poverty reduction support credit and development policy lending. However, risks related to discharge
of responsibility between AGP and CGA over staffing and retention of trained staff remained key
challenges throughout the life of the project. Procurement risks were properly identified, and
mitigation mechanisms were designed and incorporated into the project design, including supervision
missions every six months and an increased size of the sample in ex post reviews.


                                                                                                    6
Design shortcomings. Some of the design shortcomings include the following:
      The PDOs were both complex and ambitious. There were four key PDOs and six PDO
       indicators to begin with. Achievement of these objectives in some cases required policy shifts
       putting additional pressure on the implementing agencies. In retrospect, the additional
       financing was a missed opportunity to sharpen and refocus the PDO and results framework.
      The focus of the project remained more toward improving financial accounting, auditing, and
       controls. The element of fiscal management reform was not fully envisaged or captured at the
       time of project design. This resulted in lack of interest and ownership for the project by MoF.
      While PDO focused on “decision-making based on information”, the coverage among results
       indicators to adequately measure this PDO aspect of actual change in the decision-making
       behavior was insufficient.
      The project was housed in OAGP, whereas project activities were largely driven by the
       OCGA. The project was attached to a single institution, which functionally lacked ownership
       or commitment to the objectives of other components.
      The change management activities lacked interactive approach to support beneficiaries and
       clients with new procedures, systems, and reports. There was more emphasis on
       communicating PIFRA II components, activities, and benefits (for awareness-raising) than
       engaging beneficiaries in how it could help them in performing their respective roles more
       effectively. The change management approach did not envisage separate processes using
       audience-oriented vocabulary for each set of stakeholders such as MoF Finance Departments,
       public and departmental accounts committees, Planning Commission, PAOs, PPRAs, and
       budget-holders and building coalitions with these institutions and stakeholders for a joint
       ownership of PFM reforms. Finally, there was no earmarked funding allocated to the change
       management activities. These were combined with other project management activities and
       financed by the counterpart funding. Availability of counterpart funding proved to be a
       significant bottleneck directly affecting the implementation of change management activities.

2.2 Implementation
Overall implementation of the project was sound. Missions were conducted on a regular basis and
there was consistent coordination and follow-up with the Government. The project benefited from
additional financing and the closing date extension (see subsection 1.5). The midterm review was
conducted as per the legal covenant in February 2008 and assessed the progress to date on all project
components, implementation issues, and actions to be taken to ensure successful project completion.
The project was successful in achieving its development objectives (Section 3). This was made
possible by rolling out a well-parameterized, commercially available, off-the-shelf management
information system (SAP) through a sustained implementation process with very a high-level of
government commitment. PIFRA has been a huge PFM reform program and it had its allies and also
there were pockets of resistance to change. This is the very nature of difficult reforms with political
economy considerations. That said, the achievements of the project clearly demonstrate that project
allies (through coalitions built) were able to limit the impact of resistance.
Managing the resistance to change. PIFRA II achievements have not been without challenges. The
entrenched political economy and capacity challenges often appeared as turf issues (protection of
patronage held by the accounts offices as internal control agents) or service issues (given that the
accountants and auditors belong to different cadres). Pilot sites and initial replications met with huge
resistance due to fear of losing one’s job, authority, and/or patronage. Similarly, the project
implementation was affected by long delay in establishing district account offices in Baluchistan. -
Nevertheless, the resistance in accounts and audit offices was handled through a long-drawn process

                                                                                                      7
of change management, communication, and capacity building. Traces of that resistance are still
evident in the accounts offices where it has lost authority of the budget re-appropriation recording
function (now directly managed by the line ministries in the system) but must still do the thankless
job of accounting transactions for civil works. Recent jurisdictional differences between OAGP and
OCGA over the posting transfers of staff also reflect the political economy aspects of PFM.
The following factors have contributed in reducing the impact of the political economy challenges
and sustained the pace of reforms during implementation.
    (a) Sequencing. PFM reforms were sequenced to front-load the neutral interventions (without a
        high political economy impact), which included, for instance, automating existing accounting
        processes with a refined chart of accounts, capacity building, and infrastructure improvement
        for equipment. Significant reforms of the business processes were progressively introduced at
        a later stage.
    (b) Capacity building, PIFRA II effectively built capacity of key resources such as SAP
        Competency Center (CC) and many PAAS staff, audit and accounts officers, and individual
        consultants are now absorbed by OAGP and OCGA. With adequate capacity and a
        dependency to perform government functions such as payroll, the system has a high certainty
        of sustainability.
    (c) Incentives. Incentives such as project allowances were selectively used to co-opt people into
        the reforms process and make them allies to support the implementation or to at least stop
        creating hurdles.
However, change management strategy focused more on the primary system users such as AGPR,
AGs, and DAOs, audit officers, and to some degree MoF Finance Departments and did not
effectively focus on stakeholders such as PACs, PAOs, and DDOs. Citizens, researchers, and media
were the least talked about. Secondly, the change management and communication activities were
supply focused and not sufficiently interactive. This has led to sub-optimal reform ownership beyond
the PIFRA II project implementation units or SAP CCs. Effective change management drove the SAP
roll-out to more than 500 sites, but modest political economy challenges are still questionable with
regard to new procedures and changes.2 Finally, the full-time designated officers at headquarters and
regional offices did not support the communication and change management activities. Due to
staffing and counterpart-funding constraints, change management activities were not effectively
designed and implemented.
Delay in releasing counterpart funding. One of the major issues that impacted performance was
unpredictability in the receipt of counterpart funds. In FY2010-11 this was a recurring pervasive
issue on project performance, which suffered directly. Initially the overall decline in the economic
health of the country led to an across-the-board cut applied to the development portfolio. For PIFRA
II in particular, delay in finalization of the SAP upgrade contract, related requirement for approval of
revised PC1, and then uncertainty about the extension of the project’s closing date by the World Bank
all directly impacted the government decisions regarding allocation of budget and the release of
budgeted funds. Counterpart funds were to cover salaries of staff and operational expenses. Since the
project was directly entered into the national budgeting and accounting system, full allocation and
release of budget was also required for IDA funds since budget checks are an integral control in the



2
  For example, DAOs are not happy about losing the budget entry/re-appropriations function that is now carried out by
MoF Finance Departments. Similarly, DAOs consider endorsement and accounting of assignment account or works
payments as an additional burden and responsibility without any power to scrutinize and control expenditures.
                                                                                                                   8
system. Due to paucity of the counterpart funds, several expenses during the course of the project life
were funded from IDA resources rather than the government contribution as originally planned.
Varying project management styles during the life of the project. While the Government assigned
relatively senior civil service officers to PIFRA II compared to other development projects, there
remained a high turnover (as an issue across-the-board). For instance, from inception in 2005, there
were nine project directors. This lack of continuity and frequent changes in leadership delayed some
of the project activities such as operationalization of the Disaster Recovery Center.
Capacity constraints at the OAGP level. The OAGP lacked the technical capacity to make
independent judgments on complex technical issues related to the AMIS purchase. These issues
included decisions about modified versus off-the-shelf software and over-specified tender documents
that restrained competition. Also, there were internal deliberations and bureaucratic and procedural
delays that hindered procurement of AMIS in PIFRA II. Two attempts to procure AMIS were made
during the Additional Financing period, however both failed due to inadequate market response
spurred by repetitive bidding.
Insufficient incentive for the collaborative tasks. There was a lack of a formalized mechanism to
promote a collaborative work environment among stakeholders. Some outcome indicators went
unaccomplished; the interface between the Economic Affairs Department and Federal Board of
Revenue, though completed, awaited activation due to lack of a coordination mechanism between the
project directorate and counterparts.
Lack of physical presence in the stakeholder location. Unlike SAP and the audit competency center
in the OCGA and OAGP, the project team was not stationed in the MoF. Since the project staff were
not accessible within the Ministry, responsiveness to the queries remained an issue. Vested interests,
which viewed the implementation of the new system as a threat to their position, were able to build a
successful opposition to the new system and cause significant delays in its implementation.
Extension of Financial Accounting and Budgeting System (FABS) to Tehsil/Town Municipal
Administrations (TMAs) was one of the most ambitious deliverables of PIFRA, which were partially
achieved due to several legislative amendments in 2010 onwards. PIFRA Team carried out research
on the basis of four provincial Local Government Ordinances issued in 2001 and their subsequent
amendments for this fourth tier of the government. The aim was to have a uniform solution
conforming to the national accounting standards and procedures. A mini-SAP Solution was
developed in-house for meeting the financial reporting needs of TMAs. A TMA specific new
function cum object based CoA for TMAs, in line with the logic and structure of National CoA,
synchronizing the TMA’s core functions and reporting requirements was also developed. For certain
large TMAs selected across the country, LAN/WAN surveys were done, vendor for installation of
LAN connectivity was selected and hardware was also procured. The home grown solution
named TMA. Functionality was piloted at two TMAs – Chiniot and Rawal Town. The solution was
being rolled out to TMAs in KP where two TMAs were brought on the system, a master trainers’
team was developed, CoA was adopted across the province for budget preparation and WAN
connectivity was provided to eleven TMAs. During the year 2010, all provincial governments came
up with their own draft Local Government Ordinances (LGOs). By the year 2010 two provinces –
Balochistan and Sindh have promulgated these Ordinances while in Punjab and KP these legislations
were approved by the respective bodies during 2012-13. Unlike LGO 2001, the four provincial LGOs
do not provide a common and universal responsibility matrix and reporting line for financial
management which was a limitation to implement further the TMA functionality developed by
PIFRA. To continue with extension of FABS to TMAs, PIFRA had to develop four different models
for the four provinces which was not possible keeping in view the remaining life period of the project


                                                                                                     9
as well as some other critical activities before the project closure. Keeping in view the above, PIFRA
in consultation with CGA decided to discontinue the efforts on this project deliverable.

2.3 M&E Design, Implementation, and Utilization
The M&E design provided for outcome indicators and results indicators for each component to assess
progress in meeting the project implementation targets and objectives. OAGP had adequate methods
for collecting the data for these indicators. At the time of Additional Financing in January 2011,
original indicators were refined to ensure transfer of management skills and ownership to the primary
stakeholders.
During implementation, data was gathered by the Management Information Systems wing and the
M&E cell from monthly progress reports submitted by provincial sub-directorates and the respective
implementing agencies. The implementation data, including achievement of milestones and any
slippages occurring plus an analysis of the implications of the current status for future achievement of
benchmarks, were reported quarterly to the Steering Committee and the World Bank. The Steering
Committee was mandated to oversee implementation within its policy framework and post-
completion activities. Implementation arrangements had requisite built-in flexibility, including re-
prioritization of implementation in select provinces that were in more advanced stages of readiness.
The M&E team carried out qualitative surveys at regular intervals. These surveys were conducted to
identify implementation issues and address them appropriately. Likewise, field visits to the various
DAOs identified difficulties encountered in the printing of the monthly pay-slips for employees due
to paper shortage. Therefore, the FABS team disseminated pay-slips to employees via email. In
addition, data collected was used for decisions with regard to procurement activities and allocation of
supplies to the Accountant Generals and DAOs.

2.4 Environmental Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
PIFRA II was assessed as a category C project during preparation, and therefore environmental
assessment was not required. However, it was later discovered that the project would need to
undertake some construction activities that resulted in a change to category B. Accordingly, an
environmental assessment was undertaken and an environmental management plan (EMP) was
prepared. However, construction activities had already started, and this constituted non-compliance
with the environmental safeguards.
Consequently, the project started implementing the environmental management plan at the
construction sites where the supervision engineers and construction contractors lacked the experience
with EMP compliance, particularly worksite occupational health and safety protocols. The Bank
safeguard team provided supervision support for the entire safeguard compliance. They held periodic
meetings with the project personnel to address key issues and also carried out field visits to determine
the compliance level at the construction sites. The situation gradually improved but, despite the
Bank’s intervention, complete compliance was never achieved. Another challenge was lack of
appropriate clauses and scope of work pertaining to environmental management in the contract of
both the supervision engineers and contractors.
The project complied with fiduciary covenants during implementation. Internal control arrangements
were in place, and adequate financial management system and records were maintained. In addition,
procurement oversight during supervision was satisfactory. Fiduciary issues and problems were
identified early on and remedial action were taken. In PIFRA II, off-the-shelf procurement of IT
systems, servers, civil works, and SAP upgrade were among major activities that took a lot of time
after the project launch. Advance procurement actions could have been very useful to avoid wastage

                                                                                                     10
of considerable time at the project launch. Similarly, criteria for acceptance of assets and the policies
and procedures for inventory management was developed after substantial procurements had already
been made. Preparing and verifying the complete asset register was therefore a considerable effort.
2.5 Post-Completion Operation and Next Phase
Detailed sustainability strategies were prepared in 2012 for FABS and the auditing components and
agreed on with the World Bank. Transition plans were subsequently finalized. These transition
arrangements for continuing future operations appear to be adequate as demonstrated by the
following measures adopted by the Government.
(a) Transitional arrangements
Institutional arrangements. Appropriate institutional arrangements are in place for the continuity of
the reform process. A SAP Competency Center has been set up under OCGA and provides
operational and maintenance services along with the end-user support.
M&E arrangements. M&E arrangements are institutionalized in OAGP and OCGA. M&E records
pertaining to the project are transferred to the relevant parts of the government following
mainstreaming of PIFRA II. The quality assurance cell in OCGA ensures that performance continues
to be assessed and improved. A multi-tiered M&E process exists in the OAGP, which includes an
Internal Compliance Unit in each Field Audit Office and two Quality Assurance/Control Committees
performing under DG Audit Policy to review audit planning, execution, and reporting phases.
Staffing arrangements. MoF has approved the creation of positions for the key consultants, 64 in
OCGA and 17 in OAGP. Currently, a temporary arrangement has been allowed by the MoF to extend
the existing contracts for another year on existing terms and conditions. These positions will be filled
by new hiring on a competitive basis on terms and conditions (including salary packages) as
approved by the Finance Division (Regulation Wing). The OCGA and OAGP will be implementing
these new arrangements for the sustainability of the reforms. A central maintenance team at CGA
Islamabad comprising 10-15 professionals will be providing high-level technical maintenance
support to the system. In addition, five director-level positions are initially planned at each of the
provincial headquarters and AGPR Islamabad to provide maintenance support at these locations.
Each office (provincial as well as federal) is supported by 4-5 SAP-qualified and -experienced
technical experts such as system and network administrator, database administrator, basis expert, and
Financial Information (FI) experts.
Training arrangements. Adequate arrangements are in place for the sustainable delivery of training
courses to support the activities of both OCGA and OAGP. Under the transition plan approved by the
DAGP, training activities pertaining to FABS and audit components have been transferred to Audit
and Accounts Training Institutes (AATIs). Appropriate technical resources are available to continue
the operations after project closure. To provide proper training, additional space, equipment, facilities,
and faculty are made available. A new Audit and Accounts Training Institute (AATI) building has
also been built at Lahore.
Policy arrangements. Reforms are now deeply embedded in the government’s machinery and are
fully institutionalized. Among the examples is the redesign of the syllabus of the Federal Public
Service Commission (Final Passing-out Exam of the Pakistan Audit and Account Services) to include
the new accounting model and chart of accounts and the Financial Audit Manual (FAM). However,
the actual transition did face some challenges. When FABS was handed over by PIFRA II to OCGA,
physical infrastructure at certain sites was in disrepair. Presently, the OCGA is processing
procurement of various such items under PPRA rules, which have lesser flexibility compared to what


                                                                                                      11
was available for procurement under PIFRA II.3 Similarly, certain pending activities from within the
project scope and system improvements are continuing.
(b) Follow-on operation
Building on the past reforms, the Government of Pakistan has expressed interest in follow-up PFM
engagement to promote efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery expenditures by piloting an
approach to strengthen implementation of PFM reforms in sector ministries, provinces, districts, and
service units. It is envisaged that the objective will be accomplished through reforms in the area of
public investment management, MTBF/integrated service delivery reporting, service monitoring, and
effective accountability by strengthening DAC/PAC and other related entities. To address issues
related to improving service delivery and institutional governance, it would be necessary to increase
the reforms scope to include a second generation of PFM reforms for improved economic governance.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
Investment in PFM reforms by the Government of Pakistan has achieved concrete results. The
Government and development partners repeated a PEFA assessment for the federal as well as
provinces. These assessments confirm certain PFM improvements as well as pending shortcomings in
recent years. Substantial progress on transparency through public availability of information is
evident from the good ratings for related indicators in PEFA assessments and the improved score of
58 from 38 in the 2012 Open Budget Survey for Pakistan. 4 Extensive budget documentation is
prepared and published. Annual financial statements and audit report are laid before parliament
within eight months of the end of the fiscal year. In-year reports are uploaded on websites of the
finance departments. Figure 3.1 shows significant improvement in PEFA performance indicators (PI)
average scores from 2009 to 2012 in almost all areas. The one exception in “accounting, recording,
and reporting” can be attributed to non-rating (0 score) of PI-23 on “availability of resource
information at service delivery units” due to the impact of the 18th Constitutional Amendment and
pending issues with IPSAS cash-basis compliance.

3 Novation for on-site support of M/s Siemens through contract modification with SAP Malaysia was not finalized under PIFRA and is
now being pursued afresh with SAP Malyasia at the OCGA. Consultant transition is temporary for one year while new terms of
engagement are being worked out. The challenge of new product development is being met adequately as are post-transition
implementation of the OM Module and Debt Management solution in KP, dashboard of real-time BER for DDOs, PSDP dashboard for
KP, and debt management solution for Sindh.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
Relevance of objectives: Rating: High
The objectives of the project remain highly relevant. They reflect the paramount importance of a
strong governance and accountability. The objectives and the design are consistent with both the
Country Assistance Strategy at approval and the Country Partnership Strategy 2010-2013 – mainly by
improving governance and accountability. They are also timely and appropriate to the needs of the
country. The objectives are fully aligned with the Government’s plan to continue pursuing a
comprehensive strategy to improve public accounting and auditing. The key reform priorities are
identified in the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment.
Relevance of design: Rating: Substantial
The project’s core design and implementation arrangements remain substantially relevant. The
project’s implementation process was also effective and efficient for achieving the project objectives.
Considering these factors, the relevance of design, and implementation is rated Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives ‐ Efficacy
The PIFRA II was successful in achieving its overall objectives. A Substantial rating is based on the
fact that all originally approved targets for the PDO as well as the intermediate outcome indicators
were either achieved or exceeded. Enhanced targets for the PDO indicators approved for as part of
the Additional Financing were also achieved. However, some of the new intermediate outcome
indicators introduced during the implementation, for better progress monitoring, were partially
achieved (except acquisition of AMIS, which was not completed) and the government is working to
complete these pending activities. While achievement of these intermediate outcomes could have
further strengthened the overall achievement of the project, they were not critical for achieving the
PDOs. For example, the AMIS could not be implemented; however, the audit quality and timeliness
improved due to the application of risk-based audit approach, Computer Assisted Audit Techniques,
and improved quality assurance procedures. Similarly, the completion of disaster recovery center was
one of many complementing actions on information systems’ security which range from the routine
information security procedures and back-ups to the information systems audits completed.
In summary, PIFRA II has remarkably improved the PFM landscape of Pakistan, bringing basic
financial discipline to 500 government entities and nearly 7,000 line managers. This has facilitated
processing and recording of millions of government transactions in a single database and generating
and reconciling information on virtually a real-time basis for tracking poverty expenditures, timely
audits, and informed decision-making. Audit cycle has been reduced from 33 to eight months for
submission to the legislature. Training and professionalization of thousands of staff in accounting,
auditing, and IT has ensured the sustainability of these reforms. PIFRA II achievements are broader
in the context of entrenched political economy and capacity challenges.
Basic payroll, pensions, payments, and accounting functionalities on a country-wide roll-out included
Gilgit Baltistan, railways, and externally financed projects. Budget execution reports are periodically
posted on websites. Chart of accounts and business processes are based on solid data-architecture
ensuring the ease of system understanding and effective use by the spending units. Thousands of
workers, receiving both classroom and on-the-job training, resulted in 264 personnel earning
professional certifications. Significant work has been done on the interfacing with SBP/NBP, EAD,
and FBR. Recent innovations for bill tracking, salary slips by emails, and direct credit of pensions
                                                                                                    13
are commendable. This has been an enormous achievement to overcome in a culture of secrecy and
lack of public information.
The PDO was clearly defined and the project activities were closely linked with the achievement of
these objectives. While the PDO has four stated objectives, there is a need to unpack these compound
objectives for the purpose of this review as below:
1. Build capacity to improve accuracy of financial and fiscal reporting at all levels of Government
2. Build capacity to improve comprehensiveness of financial and fiscal reporting at all levels of
    Government
3. Build capacity to improve timeliness of financial and fiscal reporting at all levels of Government
4. Build capacity to improve reliability of financial and fiscal reporting at all levels of Government
5. Improve Public Financial Management
6. Improve accountability
7. Improve transparency
8. Enhance the capacity of public sector managers to use credible financial information for better
    and informed decision making
9. Facilitate oversight of the use of public monies
10. Increase the national and international credibility of Government financial statements and
    assurance processes.
While the project results framework with PDO indicators and intermediary outcome indicators
provide sufficient coverage to measure achievement of the above PDOs, a rearranged presentation of
project’s major outcomes and achievements against each of the unpacked objectives is given in the
table given in Annex 10. The table indicates that out of 10 project objectives, achievement of four
objectives is rated as High and achievement of other six is rated as Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency
A comparative study of IFMIS among countries shows that Pakistan’s investment per user on IFMIS
is in line with its comparators with equivalent or better utilization of features.5 Another study shows
that IFMIS implementation time (2002-2009)6 under PIFRA I and PIFRA II is comparable to the
average period to implement an IFMIS (7.9 years) and that 80 percent of the Bank projects financing
the IFMIS were extended7. On the benefits side, examples shown in Section 3.2 demonstrate that
operational and administrative efficiencies were derived as a result of design choices made and
implementation approaches adopted under the project. The project has improved the financial and
fiscal accountability in Pakistan through the provision of comprehensive, reliable, timely, and
accurate data for informed decision-making.
A credible economic benefit calculation leading to a net present value (NPV) and economic rate of
return (ERR) is not possible for such broad-based PFM reforms as it is difficult to claim attribution to
all downstream benefits while there were many external factors potentially affecting accrual of those
benefits. Nevertheless, it is plausible to state that PIFRA II has made a strong contribution to the
following benefits and the impacts included in Annex 12:

Priorities, Systems Design and Implementation (World Bank, 2014)
6 IFMIS implementation was mainly completed from 2002 to 2009. This excludes the initial period up till 2002 spent on policy and

institutional reforms and post 2009 period especially the Additional Financing which supported the systems and applications upgrades,
capacity building aimed at sustainability of operation of these systems, and enhancing the functionality such as MTBF.

                                                                                                                                 14
   (a) Enhanced fiscal discipline and expedient tracking of poverty expenditures saved billions of
       dollars. Salary related scams (especially ghost workers) were common in Pakistan, which are
       not there anymore after the new systems have been implemented with enhanced requirements
       of the human resource records and direct payment to the recipient’s bank accounts.
   (b) Audit cycle was reduced from 33 to eight months for submission to the legislature after the
       fiscal year-end.
   (c) Audit has become an effective deterrent to fraud and corruptions due to increased timeliness
       and use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques.
   (d) US$1.63 billion recovered due to audit reforms since 2005.
   (e) The strengthened use of single treasury account brought enormous interest savings by
       improved ways and means position.
   (f) Automation created a savings on wage bill for accountants and auditors in the country with no
       increase in the total number of government accountants and auditors during the last decade
       while government budget and expenditure increased three times and the number of
       transactions doubled. Online real-time data availability has also reduced the staff time and
       effort to collect and aggregate data from district offices.
   (g) Enhanced resilience was evidenced by business continuity during crisis and salaries of public
       servants continued without disruption.
   (h) Direct credit schemes for salary and pension payments helped to eliminate queues outside
       NBP in extreme weather and to identify ghost pensioners.
   (i) PIFRA II has led to a significant use of country FM systems for externally financed projects
       with 16 Bank-financed projects and one United States Government project on FABS. The use
       of country FM systems eliminates the need for a new system, additional staff, implementation
       of a project-specific accounting software, and audit by private firms. On one hand, this saves
       cost; on the other hand, it leads to the availability of real-time project information in the
       government system. Finally, enhanced fiduciary reliance on country PFM systems has
       enabled the development partners to significantly increase the use of budget support and
       results-based financing mechanisms to support government-own programs instead of ring-
       fenced investment projects. Auditor General’s auditing of externally financed projects saved
       considerable fees otherwise paid to the private audit firms.
   (j) E-transmittal of salary slips saved millions of dollars on paper, printing, and postage.
   (k) Utmost reliance on SAP information by MoF to make expenditure authorization decisions in
       the capacity of the financial adviser for various ministries.
   (l) Increased assurance due to high quality in-year and year-end government reporting has
       enabled the development partners to enhance the use of budget support and results-based
       funding modalities in Pakistan leading to enhanced aid-effectiveness.
The broad-based positive impact of the project given above benefits is assessed as Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall project outcome rating is satisfactory. The justification for ratings of relevance, results
achievement/efficacy, and efficiency are elaborated in subsections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively. All
ratings were either Substantial (S) or higher, with a High (H) rating for relevance of objectives and
the achievement of four of the ten objectives aforementioned in subsection 3.2.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
PIFRA II led way to several positive impacts in terms of better tracking PRSP expenditures, better
allocations, reducing corruption, grass-root level community engagement etc. These impacts are
captured in Annex 12.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The Government has demonstrated its strong commitment to sustain the achievements of PIFRA II. A
detailed sustainability (exit) strategy was prepared in 2012 for FABS and the auditing components
and agreed on with the World Bank. Transition plans were subsequently finalized.
The well-established FABS operations have successfully transitioned to the institutions. To continue
with system maintenance and smooth operations, the retention of system experts is critical. These
technical experts are essential management of computer servers, SAP-based programming, IT system
audits, quality assurance, and management of wide/local area networks. The MoF has also approved
the creation of the post for key consultants.
FABS has also developed the complete functionality to record commitments. The functionality
requires creating a purchase order before the recording of commitment; payment is allowed only once
the purchase order is created and commitment is recorded. But this control is often not implemented
in accordance with the procedure.
The project could have better utilized the change management strategy. The Change Management
Unit carried out activities as a part of a communication strategy highlighting project deliverables and
results. The strategy focused more on primary stakeholders within the AGP and CGA organizations
and on awareness of reforms instead of strengthening the use of improved systems.
While information and system security procedures are in place, the Disaster Recovery Center was not
functional as planned by the end of the project. The CGA will be able to complete the ongoing work
on the Disaster Recovery Center in a few months.

5. Assessment of World Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Satisfactory
During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all
major relevant technical and institutional, including procurement and financial management. In
addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from earlier projects in the governance sector were
considered and incorporated into the project design. Project preparation was carried out with an
adequate number of specialists who provided the technical skills mix necessary to address sector
concerns and a good project design. The Bank provided adequate human and financial resources to
ensure quality preparation and appraisal work (details in Annex 4). The project was consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy and government priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a
consistently good working relationship with the borrower during preparation and appraisal. Hence,
with some minor shortcomings in project design, as mentioned in Section 2.1, Bank performance at
preparation is rated Satisfactory.


                                                                                                    16
5.2 Bank performance in quality of supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

A Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio was carried out in September 2008 by a Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) panel of reviewers. The panel focused on development effectiveness, and
supervision inputs and processes as Highly Satisfactory; the quality of Bank supervision, and candor
and realism of Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports as Satisfactory; and the quality of
design, quality of implementation and the fiduciary/safeguard aspects as Moderately Satisfactory.
The QAG panel offered the following notes:
     Implementation of PIFRA II by the government has been distinctly better than that of PIFRA
       I (difficulties of which were, however, largely outside the control of the Bank team). Good
       capacity in the implementing agencies, strong overall support by the government (after initial
       hesitancies by certain stakeholders, mainly for turf reasons), and attention to emerging issues
       were strong points.
      The focus on development effectiveness and supervision inputs and processes are the signal
       strengths of PIFRA II. PIFRA II is a rare case of close oversight and supervision in real time,
       over the entire life of the project, by competent and experienced professionals. Moreover, the
       nature of the supervisory relationship was (and remains) unusually collegial. Despite the
       turnover of project management, the Bank team kept itself appraised of every significant
       development and intervened promptly to help resolve emerging issues.
      The over-detailed results framework and the generic ex ante arrangements for monitoring did
       not in practice prove a problem because of the task team location in the field, close interaction
       with project management, and experience and expertise of the main consultants.
      Overall, procurement oversight during supervision has been satisfactory. Procurement issues
       and problems have been identified early on and remedial action attempted.
      The seamless interaction with the PIFRA I team, the intensive engagement of field-based staff,
       and the continuity of participation by experienced and committed consultants has ensured
       high-quality results in an otherwise challenging environment.

The same rigor continued after September 2008 and the Bank’s performance during the
implementation of the project was satisfactory. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated,
and the project was adequately and intensively supervised, and closely monitored (details in Annex 4).
The task team prepared aide-memoires regularly, prepared and alerted the government and the
PIFRA Directorate to problems with project execution, and facilitated remedies in a timely manner in
conformity with Bank procedures. The ISRs realistically rated the performance of the project both in
terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation.
The Bank’s task team played a crucial coordinating and proactive role in suggesting and promoting
solutions, in a mode of partnership with other donors. The team focused on relevant and clear
performance indicators. The task team also monitored safeguard and fiduciary compliances. They
developed continuous dialogue and communication with project staff and were successful in
preventing potential problems from emerging and gathering information on weaknesses in internal
financial controls. For example on the FM side, Bank staff were proactive in supervision efforts,
going beyond the review of FMRs and audit reports. On procurement side, the Bank remained
responsive to the capacity needs of PIFRA II and assisted them in building and retaining a
procurement support structure that best suited the implementation needs.


                                                                                                     17
5.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
With a Satisfactory rating for quality at entry as well as for the quality of supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated as Satisfactory in accordance with Impact Evaluation Group harmonized rating
criteria.
5.4 Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Government had shown its commitment to the objectives of the
project at the time of project preparation. During implementation, there was a high level of ownership
and commitment to the project at all levels of executive management in OCGA; however, other key
stakeholders, including the Planning Commission, Economic Affairs Division, FBR, and the MoF
ownership level for the project varied due to lack of communication channels and project-funds
managed by them. Senior government officials worked closely with the Bank’s project team on a
continual basis, and cooperated fully with the task team. Appropriate levels of review and approval
were usually in place. Financial accountability and follow-up was observed. Expenditures were duly
authorized before they were incurred. And documentation was maintained properly for periodic
review. By and large, borrower commitment was good at federal and provincial level with the
exception of Balochistan province, which had been affected by factors beyond the jurisdiction of the
project. While there were some factors that impacted performance including the unpredictability in
the receipt of counterpart funds and turnover of senior managers as mentioned in Section 2.2, there
impact was marginal. Considering all the aspects, overall government performance is rated
Satisfactory.

5.5 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

General execution and implementation. In the beginning, performance of the OAGP was
Satisfactory. Key milestones such as risk-based auditing and geographic dispersion of FABS
were achieved all over the country. These achievements greatly contributed toward the project’s
success. However, OAGP performance deteriorated toward the end of the project, but the project
activities had achieved a momentum of their own. As mentioned earlier, the project had nine project
directors in nine years, with four project directors in the last two years but continuity of the rest of the
project management team ensured continuity of policies and activities’ momentum. In more recent
years, the project did suffer somewhat due to political economy issues, particularly because of
jurisdictional differences between OCGA and OAGP over HR issues, but again the negative impact
was marginal given the enormous project achievements.

Financial management. While the risk of using funds for unintended purposes remained Moderate,
the FM performance of the project declined in the last two years of the project from Satisfactory to
the closing rating of Moderately Satisfactory. To safeguard the assets procured under the project, a
Policies and Procedures Manual for Procurement and Inventory Management of Assets was issued.
Acceptable audit reports for the project were received on a timely basis. Since the project was based
in the country’s supreme audit institution, private sector auditors were engaged. However, delays
were often observed in receipt of quarterly financial reports.


                                                                                                         18
Procurement. Procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the project followed the
procurement guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. A fully dedicated
Director General (DG) Procurement, supported by a Director Procurement and consultant, formed the
procurement unit for PIFRA II. However, the primary support was drawn from the consulting staff
and that of an associated engineering cadre. While PIFRA II recognized and acted on need to
strengthen procurement support system, less attention was paid on having a commensurate contract
administration capability. This entailed some delays in implementation of goods and works contracts.

Overall performance of OAGP was Satisfactory during implementation.

5.6 Justification of rating for overall borrower performance

Rating: Satisfactory

With a Satisfactory rating for government performance and a Satisfactory rating for implementing
agencies’ performance, overall borrower performance is also rated as Satisfactory in accordance with
Impact Evaluation Group’s harmonized rating criteria.

6. Lessons Learned

The sections looks at lessons learned from the project design, implementation, safeguards, and
fiduciary aspects.

6.1 Design
      Since the implementation rationale for PIFRA projects was to achieve proper and better
       management of public resources, it is important to frame such projects as public resource
       management projects rather than as accounting projects.
      In any PFM reforms, the MoF has the central role, but PIFRA II was implemented by OAGP.
       This may have been the right approach at the time of project design, but it created issues and
       rifts during project implementation. For future PFM programs, the federal and provincial
       ministries of finance should be given the leadership role without compromising the presence
       of OCGA and OAGP. In addition, the World Bank should not remain indifferent to the
       possibility of institutional frictions within the government during the design and
       implementation of reforms. A lot more effort needs to be put in for identifying the potential
       pockets of resistance to these reforms, and dialogue initiated with all parties to best manage
       that resistance upfront.
      In future projects, significant attention should be given to communication and change
       management components. The project remained focused on processes and systems
       development; only toward the end was some attention given to service delivery to the clients.
       The benefits of PIFRA II are not accruing fully to ministries, departments, and autonomous
       institutions as yet. In its design, the PIFRA II did not adequately address the low FM capacity
       at line ministries. Similarly, the audit component design did not have focus on the role of the
       Public Account Committee (PAC), which is the premier accountability forum. The PAC
       involvement would have enabled alignment of the legislature expectations with project
       outputs. In future projects, the focus needs to be on clients and beneficiaries that will also
       improve political ownership of reforms. An effective change management component should
       support the institutional collaboration and intended behavior change. PIFRA II relied on civil
       servants for the communication and change management activities and the performance was

                                                                                                   19
       less than satisfactory, nevertheless, there were some successful examples of change. Annex 11
       captures a few such case studies to analyze the demand-driven change process for systems
       improvement and use of information for decision making.
      When multiple donors are interested in project success, joint implementation arrangements
       should exist from the beginning to increase momentum toward effective implementation.
      Reliance on counterpart funds for critical activities such as change management can affect the
       implementation.

6.2 Implementation
      Stakeholders should be the primary drivers of project objectives. Stakeholder participation
       and strong ownership are critical to project success. Investments on PIFRA-type projects can
       be capitalized optimally by having a robust technical support structure to support the user
       community. In addition, PIFRA’s support organization has to work as a service organization
       within the government structure; therefore, it is important to strengthen the service delivery
       mindset. Moreover, this organization should be governed through key stakeholders such as
       the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and provincial governments etc.
      Recognizing the importance of technical support for the sustainability and success of a project
       as such as PIFRA II, the Government should create a career path for technical staff and
       recognize them as an integral part of civil service. In addition, motivational strategy should be
       defined particularly in the situation where multiple ministries, agencies and departments are
       involved in the reform process.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1 Borrower/implementing agencies
Elaborate comments on ICR, received from the Economic Affairs Division, Finance Division, Office
of the Auditor General and Office of the Controller General of Accounts, are fully acknowledged.
These comments confirmed the ICR conclusions and ratings. AGP confirmed the ratings assigned to
all outcome indicators and provided revised numbers of trainings conducted under PIFRA II, which
were accordingly incorporated in the final ICR. CGA confirmed ratings assigned to all indicators
except the one related to SAP support to MTBF and suggested that the target was partially achieved.
The ICR team retained the rating assigned as the complete rollout of MTBF to all ministries and
related reforms were not within the scope of PIFRA II and should be taken up as part of the next
phase of PFM reforms.

The ICR team also recognizes the fact that EAD and FD are eager to delve into the human resource
and governance issues building on the earlier PFM systems reforms and enhance the use of system
for decision making and improving service delivery. PIFRA II has provided a solid foundation for the
next generation of these reforms.

Annex 11. Case Studies on Successful PFM Changes under PIFRA II
How did change happen? Analysis shows that demand-driven changes were triggered when an external influence met with internal capacity
desire to change. After this triggering, the internal change agents had to reach out to other relevant institutions for building a coalition for
change and push through a regulatory reform to enable change implementation. Finally, the implementation of change itself had its own
dynamics with often a spread-out population benefiting or implementing that change. The case studies showed that while there is some reform
space to promote such changes or improvements, these changes actually took years to get to some level of success given the lack of adequate
incentives and suitable enablers to harness such changes.

Annex 12. PIFRA II Contribution to Poverty Reducing Outcomes
(a) Poverty Impacts
Timely and reliable Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) reporting, facilitating expenditure
tracking of sectors, and improved audit of service delivery were incorporated as one of the project
outcome indicators for PIFRA II Additional Financing. FABS supported the compilation of PRSP
reports by providing reliable data. PRSP reporting also facilitated audits resulting in poverty reduction
programs now being subject to performance audits. Improved reliability of data combined with
assurance of effectiveness of spending is progressively enhancing the credibility of poverty reduction
efforts. In addition, FABS data also facilitates Public Expenditure Reviews (PER). The PER objective is
to analyze the overall budgetary, fiscal, and financial management system of the national/subnational
government and to assess the adequacy and efficiency of expenditure for social services.
Strengthened PFM systems introduced under PIFRA II ensured that money would be used for the
intended purposes in line with the public policy objective. Consequently, services would be delivered
more efficiently and economically, which in turn should support both effective employment of national
resources and faster progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. While there are many other
factors at play, the results of PFM improvements will contribute to increasing access to social services
and reducing poverty through growth-led as well as targeted programs. Furthermore, strengthened PFM
institutions and systems would encourage transparency and accountability in budget execution.
Accountability, in turn, reduces corruption and creates merit-based incentives for accelerated and
effective delivery of services. In addition, transparent financial reporting, which leads to informed
decision-making, economic viability, and credibility of the state, provides a conducive environment to
attract direct and indirect private investment. Consequently, investment-led economic growth will take
poverty reduction forward.

(b) Gender aspects and social development
Because of the project, pensions are now directly credited to the pensioners’ bank accounts. This has
resulted in improved service delivery and reducing corruption as well as providing a convenient facility
for women who do not wish to go out to collect their pension amounts. The project was also
instrumental in identifying ghost pensioners, which led to government savings of millions of rupees.
(c) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project resulted in substantial institutional development impact in the following areas (more details
are in subsection 3.2):
      The single biggest institutional reform undertaken under PIFRA II was the separation of
       accounts and audits. This reform not only removed the obvious conflict of interest between
       accounts and their audits, but also established the institution of CGA to manage all accounting
       activity in Pakistan. The impact of this institutional reform in terms of strengthening the PFM
       system is significant.
      As a result of PIFRA II, many government officials were able to receive local and foreign
       training. This resulted in enhanced skill sets and the potential of more acceptance for future
       reforms. The officials of the CGA and AGP are better informed of international good practice



                                                                                                      57
       approaches and would be willing to steer institutional changes within their departments. The
       quality of financial reporting and audit has also improved because of the personnel training.
      A quality management framework for public sector audit was developed and implemented under
       PIFRA II. The framework prescribes quality controls to be applied at all audit stages. At the end
       of the audit process, an independent review is carried out improving the quality of the audit
       process and reports.
      CISA was established within AGP to provide training and on-the-job support in the area of
       information systems audit. The CISA has trained more than 100 auditors in information system
       audits and will continue to support AGP in this emerging area.
      PIFRA II has become the prime resource of trained professionals for PFM reforms in Pakistan.
       Almost all PFM projects in Pakistan today are being led by professionals who were first exposed
       to PFM reforms through PIFRA II. These professionals are engaged in PFM reforms at different
       levels and are aware of the centrality of PIFRA II.
(d) Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
Some other positive, yet unintended, outcomes listed below:
      The introduction of school-based budgeting in Sindh province allowed allocation and availability
       of resources to primary service delivery units. FABS was the only possibility to work with the
       thousands of schools in the system.
      Although a phased approach for roll-over of critical reforms was not envisaged at the project
       design stage, the program adopted a phased implementation approach, beginning with pilot sites,
       followed by roll-out and replication sites. The pilot and roll-out sites were identified and
       implemented during PIFRA I, which set the stage for PIFRA II and replication sites across the
       budget execution centers. Unlike many PFM reform programs aimed at achieving critical
       reforms at one go but too little effect, the phased approach in PIFRA II had contributed to the
       successful implementation of SAP.
      There have been some jurisdiction differences between the AGP and CGA over discharge of
       responsibility for recruitment, staff deployment, and development of career path due to
       separation of audit and accounts functions, but overall these led to strengthening of the CGA
       office.
