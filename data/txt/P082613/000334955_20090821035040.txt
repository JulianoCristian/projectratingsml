1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal
1. Approximately 25 million people were living with HIV in Africa in 2003 with three million
new infections and 2.2 million deaths from AIDS in that year alone. Treatment coverage in Sub-
Saharan Africa remained negligible even though the use of highly active antiretroviral drugs
(ARVs) was reducing mortality in the medium term in high-income countries by as much as 80
percent and despite simpler drug regimens and a dramatic reduction of ARV prices. Only 3% of
those in need of this life-saving treatment could obtain it.
2. At the time of TAP preparation, many developing countries were hesitant to begin scaling-up
treatment given concerns with drug adherence and resistance, weak health systems and the long-
term financial sustainability of providing treatment. To encourage greater attention to lack of
access to treatment in Africa, IDA, UNAIDS, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria (GFATM) and major bilateral donors committed to financing of ARV treatment and the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared access to ARVs a global health emergency by
calling for the treatment of 3 million people by 2005 (also known as the 3 by 5 initiative). There
were several compelling reasons to scale up ARV treatment particularly in Africa where the
drastic drop in the annual cost for ARV drugs (from between US$10,000-12,000 per patient in
2000 to as low as US$140 per patient by the end of 2003)1 presented an opportunity to make
wider treatment access possible. In addition, all evidence at the time pointed to enormous global
disparities with spending per person living with HIV in the United States exceeding that in
Africa by a factor of 1,000.
3. Three countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mozambique) agreed to participate in the
Treatment Acceleration Program (TAP) to test different approaches for scaling up existing
treatment initiatives through an action oriented learning process. These countries were selected
based on the existence of promising ongoing treatment activities, differing epidemiological
conditions and being representative of a variety of systems for delivering treatment. Each of the
countries also had a Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP) and Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) that emphasized the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS as a top priority.
4. The first group of MAP projects at the beginning of the century focused on prevention, care
and support but there was a strong political expectation for the World Bank as the leading donor
at that time to include treatment options. The TAP was the Bank's response. The limited
knowledge at that time on how to scale-up treatment programs in resource-constrained settings
underscored the importance of designing a learning-based treatment initiative. The Bank also
concluded that the public good nature of learning from various approaches of scaling up ARV
treatment would be best achieved through an inter-country program linked through a knowledge
sharing platform whilst ensuring the development of global treatment standards for resource-
constrained environments.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
5. The objective of TAP was to pilot treatment systems which ensure that people living with
HIV and AIDS (PLHWA) and their immediate families benefit from care and treatment with
the longer term goal of the TAP to pilot strategies for strengthening each country's capacity to
scale up care and treatment programs expected to be effective, affordable, and equitable.
6. The key components of TAP were to (1) test approaches for scaling-up service delivery for
HIV/AIDS care and treatment; (2) strengthen institutional capacity for HIV/AIDS care and
treatment; and (3) facilitate regional learning from TAP country experiences. TAP would
increase the participating countries' ability to absorb greater resources from other sources for
treatment through improved capacity and knowledge. The key indicators in the PAD are shown
in Table 1.

countries, and for WHO and UNECA. Annex 3 reports the progress on KPIs before and after the
restructuring.

1.3. Revised PDO
8. The project was restructured to emphasize the learning objective for replication and scaling
up treatment at the regional level within the PDO. Learning was always part of the program
design but there was an initial perception by countries that the emphasis was on increasing



                                                        8
service delivery by enrolling patients on anti-retroviral therapy rather than learning about
treatment scale-up through service delivery. Two events accelerated the process of restructuring.
First, the 2nd Regional Advisory Panel (RAP)2 meeting in 2005 demonstrated the diverse views
on the ultimate focus of the program and the lack of consensus about a clear measure of success
or failure for the TAP. Second, the June 2005 QAG "Quality at Entry" assessment report
recommended to the project team to: (i) "focus the [PDO] explicitly to reflect the objective of
providing learning for replication and scaling up treatment at the regional level; and (ii) sharply
reinforce the on-going efforts to establish clear learning agendas and accountabilities."
9. A first order restructuring of the TAP was formally approved on May 23, 2008 by the Board.
This approval formalized the changes that had been initiated shortly after the second RAP
meeting in 2005, the June 2005 QAG review and the subsequent tripartite meeting that reached a
consensus on the learning agenda which would contribute towards the development of an
evidence base for future scale-up of ARVs in the Africa region. The 27 month delay from the
initiation of the restructuring process to formal approval by the Board can be traced to: (i)
reaching consensus and buy-in on the learning agenda from the national government grant
recipients; (ii) allaying fears that the new learning agenda would shift project resource
allocations away from supporting anti-retroviral treatment; (iii) coordinating and processing five
separate requests for restructuring and (iv) the substantial increased in funding for ARV
treatment from the Global Fund and PEPFAR, which diverted the attention of participating
countries away from TAP.
10. The revised PDO was to contribute to the evidence base which will inform HIV/AIDS
programs on the benefits, risks, risk mitigation and management modalities of anti-retroviral
treatment scale-up. The revised performance indicators focused on the learning agenda which
consisted of eight learning questions including socio-economic impacts of treatment, the
development and spread of ARV drug resistance, determinants of adherence, identification of
ARV treatment beneficiaries and the sustainability of ART (see Annex 6 for more details).
Table 2 shows the revised indicators.

 The RAP was established as a regional knowledge sharing platform for the TAP. Members of the RAP included national
government, NGOs and other private sector implementing agencies, UN agencies and the World Bank.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries
11. The target groups were people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHWA) and their immediate
families, particularly women and children. The program was targeted to the poor by engaging
non-governmental and faith-based organizations working in peri-urban and rural settings.

1.5. Original Components (as approved)
12. Over the implementation period of three years (later extended to four years), the TAP was
expected to support national-level implementing partners in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and
Mozambique, and international facilitating partners WHO and UNECA to implement the
following three components:
  I. Testing approaches for scaling-up service delivery for HIV/AIDS care and treatment
     (combined $38.82 million: Burkina Faso $13.48 million, Ghana $9.86 million and
     Mozambique $15.48 million). The TAP activities comprise: (a) piloting scaling up existing
     care and treatment programs managed by selected implementing partners, and (b) piloting
     efforts to increase the number of patients needing care and treatment. The TAP focused on
     five elements of treatment: Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT); Home-Based Care
     (HBC); Prevention of Opportunistic Infections (OI); Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART); and
     Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT).
 II. Strengthening institutional capacity for HIV/AIDS care and treatment (combined
     $16.51 million: Burkina Faso $4.63 million, Ghana $5.72 million and Mozambique $6.16
     million) to ensure adequate referral mechanisms to support the activities of the
     implementing partners and build overall capacity within the Ministry of Health to scale up
     national HIV/AIDS treatment coverage; and
III. Facilitating regional learning from the TAP countries (combined $6.0 million: WHO
     $4.0 million and UNECA $2.0 million), with WHO providing technical capacity support
     for the Ministries of Health and implementing partners, while UNECA would support
     cross-border learning and dissemination of lessons learned within the African continent.

1.6. Revised Components
13. The components remained the same throughout project implementation. However, the
emphasis shifted from increasing the number of people enrolled for treatment (Component I) to
learning for replication which is an integral part of all three of the original components.

1.7. Other significant changes
14. The Grant's closing date was extended by one year from September 30, 2007 to September
30, 2008. The time extension would: (i) provide the three governments with adequate
implementation time to achieve the revised PDOs; (ii) provide additional time for the research
and learning aspects to reach a higher level of completion and provide concrete evidence for
future HIV treatment programming; and (iii) allow grant recipients to prepare themselves for the
period after the closing date when alternative financing sources would be required to sustain the
treatment for enrolled and new patients.
15. The Grant proceeds were reallocated for the three countries and for WHO to be aligned with
the revised PDOs at restructuring. The reallocations are shown in Annex 5. Allocation for


                                               10
Goods and Drugs in the three countries increased to ensure achieving key service delivery targets.
Funding for regional learning was not increased as additional resources had already been
mobilized in close collaboration with the Development Economics Research Group (DECRG)
through the Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) for conducting household, facility
and behavioral sentinel surveys.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
16. MAP operations were in place in all participating countries and the project period coincided
with unprecedented decreases in the ARV drug prices internationally, less toxic drug regimens
and strong calls for IDA from the global community to accelerate ARV access, particularly in
Africa. The timing of the project was therefore appropriate. Time elapsed between the concept
review on 3/25/2003 and Appraisal on 4/12/2004 was 13 months. Negotiations took place in
May 2004 and the Board approved the project on June 17, 2004. The Grant was declared
effective five months later, in November 2004.
17. The relatively short time for preparing and appraising a regional project is remarkable given
the number and range of partners involved; balancing scaling up treatment with learning; and the
fact that `learning' was understood differently by different partners. Considerable time was
spent building partnerships with government, non-governmental and faith-based organizations as
well as the private sector. Facilitating public-private partnerships proved to be a challenge.
18. The project faced continuous tension between the project's treatment coverage goals for the
three countries and the broader "learning" agenda from which the three countries and others
could learn how to scale up treatment effectively within the context of resource-constrained
African health systems. These debates were not resolved satisfactorily and a clear definition of
the operational research agenda was not achieved during project preparation. The World Bank
hosted a tripartite meeting with UNECA and WHO in June 2005 to reach consensus on the
learning aspects which would contribute towards the development of an evidence base3 for future
scale-up of ARV in the Africa region. These learning objectives (as seen in Annex 6) were
subsequently shared and discussed with the three participating countries and eventually led to the
restructuring of the PDO emphasizing the learning agenda.
19. The project design grouped five projects (with individual Development Grant Agreements)
under one program. Individual projects were believed to increase recipient ownership but it was
also anticipated that this would cause problems in project processing (e.g. project effectiveness),
consistency in reporting, and budget allocation (in particular with supervision and ICR budgets
being treated as one country project). TAP was the Africa region's second regional project
(following the Abidjan-Lagos HIV/AIDS Transport Corridor project) and was prepared prior to
the establishment of the Regional Integration Unit of the Africa Region (AFCRI) and therefore
did not benefit from processing guidelines for regional programs. Nonetheless, the project


3
  At the time ARV treatment at a larger scale was relatively new in Africa and subject to rapid changes and improved insights in clinical and
management practices. In addition, while the benefits in terms of improving the length and quality of life were well established,
other benefits and risks were not well researched or documented. The evidence base for decisions on how best to scale up
treatment would keep governments abreast of the latest developments in clinical and health sector management, risk management
and provide practical options to achieve greatest benefits.


                                                                    11
processed five Development Grant Agreements (DGAs) within a one year period. Two
alternatives to funding (using available MAP resources and limiting TAP to funding ARV
treatment) were considered in the PAD but found sub-optimal given limited resources within
existing MAPs and gaps in knowledge related to a public roll-out of treatment.
20. The selection of the countries was based partly on the need for a regional perspective
including countries with a different HIV epidemiology, two sub regions (West and Southern
Africa) and using three different implementation models engaging non-state actors. Burkina
Faso delivered treatment through local NGOs and organizations representing PLHWAs,
Mozambique through international FBOs, and Ghana through the private sector. There was a
deliberate attempt to choose diverse country settings (Anglophone, Lusophone and Francophone
countries) which would not only provide opportunities for cross-fertilization but also potentially
yield results applicable to Africa as a whole. WHO was brought in to provide technical
assistance to TAP countries to strengthen their capacity to provide ARV treatment through the
Regional Clinical Coordination Committee (RCCC) while UNECA facilitated regional
knowledge sharing forums (through the Regional Advisory Panels or RAPs) to disseminate the
lessons and implementation tools among participating countries and other African countries
involved in treatment.
21. The lessons learned from health projects in Africa were well understood and the PAD listed
the key issues, i.e., weak health systems, limited human resources, drug availability, weaknesses
in patient management and tracking, issues of inclusion and gender, and financial sustainability.
22. The project preparation period did not allow a detailed institutional analysis of each
implementing partner beyond a basic organizational profile, and financial management and
procurement assessments. The respective roles of the WB, WHO and UNECA were clearly
stipulated in the project document but collaboration mechanisms among them were not
articulated at project design. The assumption within the PAD was that collaboration issues
would be addressed by the RAP during implementation.
23. The QAG review of June 2005 raised specific concerns on the project design because of : (i)
a disconnect between the objective of learning as opposed to the treatment PDO and project
inputs; (ii) the weak framework for measuring failure/success; and (iii) unclear responsibilities
on formulating and managing the research agenda.
24. The project risk was rated as substantial on concerns about unequal access to treatment, poor
patient adherence to the ARV regimen, drug procurement delays, increased drug resistance and
weaknesses in the health systems. Strategies to mitigate these risks, drawn from health sector
projects in Africa, were in place and were judged reasonable. However, the project risk should
have been rated as high, given the innovative nature of the project interventions, complex
treatment programs putting an additional burden on already weak health systems, and
uncertainties on the long term financial sustainability of ARV treatment.

2.2. Implementation
25. Implementation and disbursement in the three countries were slow during the first year
caused by a number of converging factors: (i) a short preparation period for a complex operation;
(ii) delays in recruiting, training and accrediting implementing sites to deliver ARV treatment;
(iii) insufficient understanding by grant recipients, particularly Ghana, of the Bank's fiduciary
procedures; (iv) some confusion on the effectiveness conditions for the WHO grant regarding


                                               12
aligning their fiduciary systems to meet the Bank's reporting requirements; and (v) delays at
UNECA in establishing a unit with dedicated staff to develop a UNECA/TAP work plan. As
shown in Annex 2 (tables 1-5) and Annex 3, key performance indicators of the program have
been substantially achieved, though at varying degrees in each country.
26. Regarding the learning agenda, which was facilitated by DECRG with funds from BNPP, the
program exceeded targets on all planned research. Three longitudinal household surveys were
initiated in all participating countries with three rounds of data collection completed in Ghana,
two in Mozambique and one in Burkina Faso. Two health facility surveys were conducted in
Burkina Faso and two in Mozambique during the course of the project. Other research included
two behavioral sentinel surveys, three public-private partnership evaluations, and three studies
on the social determinants of ARVs (see Annex 2 for more information).
27. At the national level, all countries rapidly increased Counseling and Testing services and
exceed their targets, particularly Burkina Faso which increased its numbers by almost 12-fold
from the baseline. The figures presented in the Table 3 below represent national
achievements and are not specifically attributed to TAP 4 . On ARV treatment coverage,
Mozambique exceeded its target from 1% of those who need treatment to 23%. However, Ghana
and Burkina Faso did not achieve their targets, possibly because they over-estimated the
treatment take-up rates much like many other countries in Africa. Some of the factors hindering
progress include weak and fragmented health systems that are not sufficiently decentralized,
poor integration of health services, poor access to HIV testing and counseling services, pervasive
stigma and discrimination5. Despite these challenges, participating countries made significant
progress in increasing treatment coverage with Burkina Faso increasing treatment coverage from
3% to 36% and Ghana from 1% to 24% in four years.
28. Another indicator which all countries fell short of achieving was the number of mothers who
receive PMTCT treatment. This result is not surprising given that the coverage of antiretroviral
medicines to HIV-positive pregnant women for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in
low-and middle-income countries remains low to this day, with only 9% accessing treatment in
2004 to approximately 33% in 2007. This low coverage can be attributed to lack of PMTCT
services for pregnant women; existing services do not reach women in need; the fear of
discrimination if a women is found to be HIV positive and lack of disclosure to mid-wives/health
workers due to confidentiality concerns6. This issue was addressed at a RAP meeting where the
option of opt-out testing, which proved to be highly successful at increasing the number of
women accessing PMTCT services in Botswana, was gradually introduced into participating
TAP countries.

  Note that only Burkina Faso monitored and reported TAP specific data. Ghana and Mozambique chose not to report on TAP specific data but
preferred to report national achievements based on the principles of the Three Ones and Paris Declaration. Therefore, IDA attribution to VCT is
not possible to measure in Ghana and Mozambique.

29. In terms of attribution of results to TAP, Mozambique and Ghana used their national
monitoring systems, while Burkina Faso routinely disaggregated data collection specifically for
TAP. As such, Burkina Faso was able to attribute coverage of national services particularly to
the TAP- approximately 21% of VCT coverage and 33% of ARV coverage were due to TAP
(See Annex 2 for more details). Though Ghana did not disaggregate TAP's contribution towards
its national achievement, the country estimates that TAP sites contributed about 8% of the total
number of people on ART treatment, and 5.4% of the total number of people utilizing VCT and
4.5% of the total number of women under the PMTCT program receiving neviripine as at
September 2008. Data for Mozambique were not disaggregated by the contributions made by
TAP to the overall national performance though the numbers of people accessing VCT, PMTCT
and ARV treatment increased steadily through the life of the program.
30. The learning agenda performed well and most planned research at the end of the project was
completed (Annex 2 and Annex 3). Three longitudinal household surveys were initiated in all
participating countries with three rounds of data collection completed in Ghana, two in
Mozambique and one in Burkina Faso. Two health facility surveys were conducted in Burkina
Faso and two in Mozambique during the course of the project. Other research included two
behavioral sentinel surveys, three public-private partnership evaluations, and three studies on the
social determinants of ARVs.
31. The RAP meetings facilitated learning among and within the three countries. This novel
feature enabled the health officials and the implementing partners to review progress, discuss
challenges, learn from each other's experiences and make recommendations to enhance project
implementation. The RAPs were a major step forward in multi-country and multi-stakeholder
expert engagement and dialogue. Evaluating such a strategy does not fit an outcome indicator-
based project, but some process changes indicate that the RAP process led to improved practices
relevant to the overall DO and to global learning objectives. Examples of process changes
include: (i) patient tracking cards in use in Mozambique were replicated by Burkina Faso (ii)
discussions on drug resistance led to all three countries initiating monitoring of potential drug
resistance and to funding a baseline survey of drug resistance in Ghana; (iii) discussions on the
low uptake of PMTCT services led to the gradual adoption of an opt-out strategy for HIV testing


                                                        14
and in addition, a WHO proposal for an opt-out HIV testing strategy was recommended for the
control of the dual TB-HIV infection throughout the Africa region; (iv) policy discussions
(although no clear solutions) on sustainable long-term financing of ARVs and (v) .
32. The project team recognized that the complexities of the project demanded a strong field
presence and assigned the country-level responsibilities (with budget) to the task team leaders of
the MAPs/health projects in the respective countries. The field teams addressed the RAP
recommendations in each annual review.
33. Disbursement over the course of the project for the five DGAs (see Annex 1 for details)
combined was slow during the first six quarters but then increased rapidly with the allocated
amount close to being fully disbursed.

                          Table 4. Amounts disbursed by year (in US$ million)

                           Year                    2005         2006          2007    2008
                    Amount disbursed                9.14        9.78          19.33   11.79

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
34. The original M&E arrangements in the PAD, indicated that TAP would integrate HIV/AIDS
treatment within existing national M&E systems. This approach was in line with UNAIDS'
`three ones' principle7. As a result, no M&E manual was developed for TAP that was common
for the three countries and data reporting formats were not harmonized. Mozambique and Ghana
considered the TAP as one of many partners in a joint programmatic framework and did not
disaggregate contributions specific to TAP or other partners such as GFATM. In contrast,
Burkina Faso separated contributions from various partners on a project-by-project basis and
reported on TAP-specific outputs.
35. The choice of indicators for service delivery and learning were appropriate and directly
related to the PDO. Reporting formats for indicators used across the three countries were not
consistent, and a few performance indicators were not reported on. Efforts to minimize the
variation in indicators that was expected across a variety of settings and with five different
DGAs and to enhance the overall M&E were not effective, mainly because the Bank chose to use
the country monitoring frameworks in line with the Paris Declaration and the Three Ones
principle. The M&E indicators for regional learning (Component III) in the original project
were to be generated from the RAP and the Regional Clinical Coordination Sub-Committee
(RCCC) which WHO and UNECA were to disseminate the recommendations. The restructuring
developed indicators for the learning objectives consisting chiefly of completion of surveys or
specific studies. Outcomes of the learning objective such as changes in practice by various
countries or uptake of the study results are not yet available. It is too soon to judge the impact of
the studies and surveys given the short time frame of the project and the fact that several of the
studies are still ongoing.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
36. Financial Management (FM) arrangements varied by country and used the experiences of
existing MAP and other health sector projects. Sub-grant agreements were in place between the
respective Ministries of Health and implementing partners in country and the Bank verified that
each of the partners had acceptable accounting practices. External audits of each DGA were
conducted annually. Audits were on time except MOH of Mozambique that submitted its report
for FY05 31 months late. The review of the audit report indicated deficiencies in internal
controls related to the fixed assets register not being updated and the lack of implementation of
accounting software. The WHO grant agreement was retroactively extended after the grant
closed in order to process a late withdrawal submission, which was a result of the introduction of
a Global Monitoring System throughout the WHO which affected the processing of financial
reports from its country offices.
37. Procurement arrangements for TAP drew upon existing MAP or health sector projects. A
project operational manual was prepared and its review was a condition for grant effectiveness.
There were no procurement compliance issues.
38. Safeguard Compliance: The disposal of medical waste triggered the environmental
safeguard. At preparation, both Burkina Faso and Mozambique had completed medical waste
management plans through ongoing MAP projects. Ghana had medical waste management
guidelines approved by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency under the Ghana Health II
Project. There are no reports or assessments to measure progress of the implementation of the
said waster management guidelines.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
39. Identifying alternative financing sources to sustain treatment of patients on ARV and
allowing the research and learning aspects to reach a higher level of completion were two main
reasons for extending the closing date by one year. Patients enrolled through the TAP will
continue to receive treatment with funding from the GFTAM, PEPFAR and others. ARV
treatment coverage will continue with Global Fund contributions to Burkina Faso of $46 million,
Ghana of $162 million and Mozambique of $144 million.
40. IDA FY10 pipeline includes the following; (1) Regional Disease Capacity Development
Project, which will capacity building for HIV/AIDS Programs and; (2) Regional Laboratory
Strengthening Project, which will further strengthen the capacity of the health system to deliver
results on HIV/AIDS.
41. The learning agenda may have longer term benefits. DECRG, with several Bank staff and
some Western university partners, produced peer-reviewed papers on the surveys. DECRG
facilitated week long data analysis workshops for Burkina Faso and Ghana to strengthen the
capacity of local researchers to conduct such analyses and intends to continue its research
relationship to produce joint analysis and publications. The benefits from the RAP mechanism
are reflected in other existing activities that will continue beyond the life of the project include:
(i) Formation of a "Learning Group" by UNECA, which has organized electronic dissemination
and shares newsletters; (ii) formation of inter-agency collaboration between the African Union,
UNECA, WHO, and all the Regional Economic Communities to coordinate and harmonize
HIV/AIDS policies and decisions of African Heads of State. Two meetings have already been
held and a third one is scheduled for Tanzania in October 2009.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
42. The project relevance is rated Substantial because: (i) it addressed the key issue (which
continues to be relevant) of expanding and sustaining ARV treatment in resource-constrained
environments in an effective manner. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs reached only 31% of
the estimated global need in low- and middle-income countries in 2007 even though available
antiretroviral drug regimens markedly improve the health and longevity of HIV-positive patients;
(ii) project objectives were consistent with the CASs of all three countries; (iii) the design of the
project was appropriate at the time of preparation and it facilitated learning in vastly different
resource-constrained settings with potential applications of lessons learned to the region; and (iv)
the project built upon existing capacities of NGOs and the private sector to expand national ART
coverage and is therefore, highly relevant. Project objectives sought to learn from piloting
treatment systems and replicating implementation lessons from one country in others and
disseminate the scaling up of treatment and care using appropriate treatment regimens, training
providers, monitoring adherence and drug resistance and integrating systems.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Achievements of Original Project Development Objectives
43. The overall achievement of the original PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. There are
four main reasons for this rating. First, the project exceeded in two out of four service delivery
indicators (number of persons accessing VCT services and the number of HIV positive persons
accessing prophylaxis for opportunistic infections) and results varied amongst countries for the
remaining two indicators (mother-infant pairs accessing PMTCT services and proportion of
eligible PLWHA on ART and for the reasons mentioned in section 2.2.. From inception of the
project, the number of people utilizing VCT services increased 12 fold in Burkina Faso, 37-fold
in Ghana and 5-fold in Mozambique. Also, since the start of the TAP, the percentage of number
of people on anti-retroviral treatment increased more than 25-fold in Ghana and Mozambique,
and more than 12-fold in Burkina Faso. Substantial additional financing was obtained from
GAFTM, PEPFAR and other donors ($334 million) for continued financing of ART scale up in
the countries.
44. Second, qualitative evidence of regional learning was observed at country level during field
visits organized in preparation of three Regional Advisory Panel (RAP) meetings, and through
communications between the country participants and institutions. Formal learning took place
through the RAP meetings by identifying a thematic topic for the meetings and integrating
various aspects throughout the discussions. Identified themes have included capacity building,
drug resistance monitoring, service integration (Mozambique, Ghana), TB-HIV collaborative
activities and management of Multi-Drug-Resistant and eXtensively-Drug Resistant (MDR and
XDR)-TB, PMTCT integration and scale-up, pediatric antiretroviral treatment, adherence
support strategies, and approaches to sustain Public-Private-Partnerships (Burkina Faso). Formal
learning began in 2005, through analytical work and sentinel surveys being conducted in all three
countries in collaboration with DECRG that respond to some of the learning agenda questions.
45. Third, three PDO indicators measuring strengthening institutional capacity were included in
the original results framework. These indicators measured approval of treatment policies,


                                                 17
reviewing and approving treatment performance, and implementing scaling up plans for
infrastructure, human resource development and logistics management. The narrative in Annex
2 reports that all three countries received technical assistance to enhance their capacity to
manage programs, including public-private partnership approaches. WHO as the lead agency for
providing technical assistance facilitated the recruitment of: an M&E officer to assist the MOH
in Burkina Faso; a program manager and three regional focal points for M&E in Ghana; and ten
data collection and analysis staff at provincial and district levels in Mozambique. All TAP
interventions at the completion of the project were integrated into respective national HIV
programs.
46. Fourth and finally, the key shortcomings of the original PDO are weak project design,
inadequate attention to the challenges of regional learning, support for M&E and difficulties in
monitoring IDA attribution to the national programs.

Achievements of Revised Project Development Objectives
47. The restructured project focused its key PDO to contribute to the evidence base which will
inform HIV/AIDS programs on the benefits, risks, risk mitigation and management modalities
of ARV scale up.
48. This PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The reasons for these ratings can be grouped by
the achievement of the revised KPIs. First, the restructured project indicators were reorganized
into 6 learning indicators and 4 service delivery indicators. As stated above, the two of the four
service delivery indicators were achieved. While national M&E systems improved slightly, it
still fell short of reporting data on time in a standardized manner which made country
comparisons a challenge.
49. The six learning indicators are mostly defined and reported in Annex 3. The planned surveys
(household surveys, facility surveys and behavioral sentinel surveys) and studies (e.g. adherence
to drugs) were initiated with several rounds of data collection completed. Several peer reviewed
scientific publications have been produced, and a dissemination strategy is in place (see Annex
2). Moreover, the learning objective contributed to better understanding by the programs of
specific priorities and plans for the future, including new applications to GFATM and other
sources of funding. On the other hand, the choice of indicators for the learning agenda reflects
only research outputs and not specific uptake of research results, which is the core indicator for
success of any learning agenda. At the same time it is questionable to what degree a project
spanning three years, could have addressed both rigorous research initiatives as well as the
uptake of the results. Further, several of the longitudinal household surveys are still ongoing,
financed through DECRG, in order to accurately measure the socio-economic impacts of
treatment on households.

3.3. Efficiency
50. Efficiency of the project is rated Modest. No formal economic or efficiency analysis was
done to determine if the approaches adopted by the project were efficient and whether more
people could be put on treatment. Since the project was supporting the overall national ARV
Program in conjunction with the Government and other partners, it is difficult to attribute
observed benefits to the project alone. However, ongoing evaluation studies by DECRG shows
that TAP has reduced mortality among HIV/AIDS patients in Mozambique. Evidence shows the


                                               18
proportion of deaths per year in HIV households reduced from 3% in 2005 to just over 2% in
2006 while deaths per year in non-HIV households increased from 1.2% to 1.3% over the same
period8. Evidence from Burkina Faso show that compared to others patients, HIV/AIDS patients
seem to receive more attention by healthcare providers: they wait less and they receive higher
quality care from the TAP.

52. Data has been collected to assess the effectiveness of the scaling-up ART in TAP countries
though the analysis is not yet been finalized. However, research in developing countries tends to
support the fact that ARV therapy dramatically reduces morbidity and mortality among HIV-
infected individuals 9 . For example; (1) HIV patients in Haiti experienced weight gain and
improved functional capacity within one year of initiation of ARVs10; (2) The median survival
time after developing AIDS rose to 58 month with ARV treatment in Brazil11; (3) A longitudinal
study in Mombasa (Kenya) of clients on ARV treatment found that perceived health improved,
reported incidence of illness and use of health service declined, and labor force participation
increased within 12 months of initiating therapy12; (4) Another recent study in Kenya shows that
provision of ARV treatment leads to a significant increase in the labor supply of AIDS patients.
This increase occurs very soon after the initiation of ARV therapy: within six months, there is a
20 percent increase in the likelihood of participating in the labor force and a 35 percent increase

in hours worked. 13 and 14; and (5) The roll-out of antiretroviral treatment also led to a decline of
about 50% in adult AIDS deaths in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, over a period of five years15.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
53. Measuring achievement of the PDOs, as per ICR guidelines, is to be judged weighted for the
duration of original and revised indicators. Thus, both are discussed in sequence. The final
achievement is weighted 60% for the original indicators and 40% for the restructured indicators.
Restructuring started at month 31 after the second RAP meeting in 2005 and the QAG review in
June 2005. The Board formally approved the restructuring after 48 months of the 52 month
project but restructuring had been already underway for 17 months. Therefore for all practical
purposes the project is considered to have been restructured at month 31 of 52 months (i.e. 60%).
54. Access by the target populations in all three countries to VCT, PMTCT, prophylaxis for OIs,
home-based care and ARV services increased substantially. However, there were substantial
weaknesses in consistent reporting of the coverage indicators. There were also gaps in
attributing increases in coverage to TAP versus other support (contribution), but this is not an
uncommon problem in development. Despite these caveats, indicators increased as anticipated
by the original project goals. Similarly, the project learning agenda objectives were met in the
way of specific surveys and specific studies completed.
55. The overall rating for the original PDO is Moderately Satisfactory based on: (i) all targets
were exceeded (except for one KPI); (ii) project activities were fully integrated into national
treatment programs and (ii) significant learning was achieved across and within countries and
UN partners. However, the rating is moderately satisfactory because (i) the original PDO was
unclearly focused and framework for measuring success (as noted in section 2.1) was not
developed and agreed among the partners/countries at preparation; (ii) delays with
implementation at commencement; and (iii) lack of a clear learning agenda.
56. The overall rating for the restructured PDO is Moderately Satisfactory based on the fact that
all restructured objectives exceeded the targets by project closing (see Annex 3). However, the
rating is MS given the difficulty of attributing performance in service delivery indicators
specifically to TAP and short time frame for the research findings from the surveys to filter into
policy development process in the countries.


3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
57. Gender was monitored chiefly by examining the percent of females under ART, which was
consistently higher than the percent of males under ART. No specific poverty study was done.

However, research conducted by DECRG indicates that; (1) the scaling-up of antiretroviral
treatment reduced mortality among HIV/AIDS patients; (2) access to pediatric ARV appears
limited. This might be due to the fact that parents and family do not identify weak or sick
children as suffering from HIV/AIDS; (3) HIV/AIDS related deaths are associated with higher
health expenditures, the sale of assets for health care and affect income generation and
agriculture; (4) looking at indexes of physical health and mental health, HIV/AIDS patients are
doing worse in physical health than their family members and than individuals from households
not affected by HIV/AIDS. However, looking at mental health measures, it was found that
HIV/AIDS patients are doing worse than both unaffected individuals and their own family
members. Compared to other patients, HIV/AIDS patients seem to receive more attention: they
wait less and they receive higher quality care. (Annex 2 provides more details on research by
DECRG and UNECA).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
58. Institutional changes occurred at varying degrees. Ghana reported a substantial increase in
the number of ARV centers from 4 at the start of the project to 92 in 2007. Similarly, the
number of ARV sites in Mozambique increased from 32 in 2005 to 211 in 2007 and in Burkina
Faso from 44 in 2005 to 77 in 2007. Intermediate outcomes listed at the beginning of the
restructuring (Annex 3) include, inter alia, having functioning national treatment committees;
implementing procurement of works, goods and services; patient monitoring and tracking
systems functioning in all project-supported sites; and engaging NGOs and private sector
partners in managing treatment activities. The KPIs at the end of the project (Annex 3) do not
include indicators for reporting on institutional strengthening. WHO as the lead agency provided
technical assistance to all three countries to adopt treatment guidelines and facilitated the
recruitment of an M&E officer to assist the MOH in Burkina Faso; a program manager and three
regional focal points for M&E in Ghana; and ten data collection and analysis staff at provincial
and district levels in Mozambique. MOHs in the respective countries continue to revise their
treatment guidelines based on evolving evidence that was in part generated by the TAP. The
RAP will be institutionalized through UNECA after completion of TAP.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
59. The sustainability of ARVs in African context was appropriately identified as high risk in the
project restructuring document. Future sources of funding like PEPFAR and future rounds of the
Global Fund mean that additional funds should be available to sustain part of the ongoing need
for ARVs. It is also likely that the TAP experience and others may contribute to efficiencies in
delivery of ARVs. However, given the current global economic crisis, it remains uncertain if
ARV coverage can be sustained at high enough levels for the epidemic to run its natural course,
and for incidence of new infections to decline over time. This may well depend not on treatment
but on coverage of prevention activities or newer technologies (such as microbicides) and
expanded coverage of targeted interventions. In this context, the risks to development outcomes
should be seen as high.

Risk Rating: High

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1. Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
60. Global pressures on the Bank were considerable to deliver a major project for ARV treatment
in Africa early in 2004. While the amount of consultation and broad support for the program
was laudable, there was insufficient time at preparation to conduct in-depth institutional analyses
of implementing partners and to prepare a clear learning agenda and balance scaling up treatment
and learning and to reach agreement on the meaning of `learning' by the different partners. The
QAG review assessed quality at entry as unsatisfactory overall and specifically rated strategic
relevance and approach, technical, financial and economic aspects, and implementation
arrangements as unsatisfactory. Only fiduciary aspects were rated satisfactory.

Rating: Unsatisfactory


(b) Quality of Supervision
61. The Bank task team faced the challenges of implementing a complex project with multiple
implementing partners and handled these challenges reasonably well. The program utilized the
country based MAP project TTLs to monitor progress within each country, which proved to be
highly effective. Financial management was satisfactory as the field teams were responsive to
changes in the local FM context. The RAP was an innovative and evidence-driven designed
feature to help solve some specific technical and managerial challenges. The supervision team
responded to the recommendation of the QAG assessment to focus the development objective on
learning for replication by developing the learning agenda in collaboration with UNECA and
WHO soon after the assessment. The response was a restructuring of the project without
changing the targets. The formal restructuring process was only approved by the Board 17
months after the restructuring had been initiated and only four months before project closing. A
number of factors can be cited for explaining the delay in Board approval and some factors were
outside the control of the task team. A further weakness was the inability of the supervision team
to establish a more effective M&E reporting system through the life of the project.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
62. Overall, the project faced significant challenges during the design phase, with the caveats
noted above about attribution to IDA support and the inadequate M&E indicators. The learning
agenda and the RAPs were a novel attempt to guide specific program issues to improve the
delivery of ART services.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2 Grant Recipient Performance


                                                22
(a) Government Performance
63. Performance of the three countries was moderately satisfactory. Political levels were
reasonably engaged as evidenced by the willingness to work with and delegate to NGOs in
managing selected districts, in managing the sub-contracted NGOs and the private sector
implementing partners for selected districts. Several service delivery components fell short of
their targets but each country was able to attract additional financing from the GFATM and other
development partners for ARV treatment. M&E was a weak point and insufficient data were
collected and provided. Burkina Faso did not provide baseline data for several KPIs. Project
effectiveness took five months after Board approval for delays in approving and signing the
DGAs (except for Mozambique). Fiduciary compliance in general was satisfactory with the
exception of Mozambique that incurred almost a three year delay in the submission of an annual
external audit report.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) UN Agency Performance
64. The performance of WHO and UNECA as grant a recipient was moderately unsatisfactory.
Delays were incurred to adapt the different financial management and reporting systems,
especially WHO, which was in the process of changing its financial management system.
UNECA had some implementation delays due to staff realignment and the relocation of TAP to
the Human and Social Development Section (UNECA subsequently appointed a task manager to
implement the TAP). WHO provided the required technical support at country level to the
satisfaction of the countries but fell short in their responsibility for having a robust M&E system
by aligning indicators across the three countries.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory


(c) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
65. The ministries of health in all three countries reported overall a satisfactory performance by
the Implementing Partners that were contracted under the TAP. Implementing partners
comprised non-governmental and faith-based organizations, and private and public sectors. All
partners supported made impressive strides in scaling-up health service delivery of PMTCT,
VCT, OIs and ART for the target populations in their respective countries. Details on
implementing partners results can be found in the RAP reports16.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
66. The project service indicators were largely met and the learning agenda deliverables were
also largely met. While overall country performance was moderately satisfactory, WHO and
UNECA inputs were moderately unsatisfactory and implementing partners performance
satisfactory.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


6. Lessons Learned
   Sub-regional HIV/AIDS projects require a project design that clearly defines the roles and
   responsibilities of the multiple participating national and regional institutions. Multiple
   stakeholders generate diverse views, approaches and understandings that need to be
   addressed during project preparation or immediately after the project becomes effective.
   Government ownership and leadership is a core requirement for successful institutional
   arrangements and therefore establishing the institutional framework for program
   implementation is an essential step during the preparation phase. Regional projects take more
   time to reach agreements on institutional arrangements, including funds allocation.
   Public-private approaches and partnerships with non-state actors have shown to be useful to
   quickly scale-up Anti-Retroviral Treatment Programs. Long term partnerships however are
   only viable with assurances of continued financing whether domestic or external.
   Sharing information is important to the success of regional programs as it fosters regional
   learning. The Regional Advisory Panels proved to be an important mechanism for those
   purposes and could be relevant for other programs in health in Africa and beyond. RAPs
   facilitated learning and served a useful forum for exchanging knowledge and experience and
   especially fostering a south-south exchange.
   Monitoring and evaluating sub-regional or regional programs require integrating M&E into
   country-level M&E systems. Technical assistance to that end can be provided by the RAPs
   and by international agencies (WHO in the present case). Patients tend to present
   themselves later rather than earlier during the course of HIV infection and public information
   initiatives are needed to make HIV infected people present themselves earlier. A
   communication strategy that addresses stigma and other reasons for accessing services late
   should be an integral part of a treatment program. . Treatment protocols need to be adjusted
   and kept up to date using the results from monitoring drug resistance to ARVs as well as
   anti-TB and anti-malaria drugs.
   Strengthening health systems through accrediting service providers to ensure continuous
   quality improvement is useful however accreditation needs to be repeated at regular intervals
   to achieve its objective of enhancing quality. Committing to specific numbers to be achieved
   in a changing epidemic can lead to failure in achieving the target values. The estimated
   numbers of people needing treatment will vary as the epidemic matures, more data sources
   are used and different estimation methods are used.
   Fiduciary processes and reporting for UN agencies need to be clarified during project
   preparation.

               Component 2: Strengthening institutional capacity for HIV/AIDS care and treatment
         TAP provided the opportunity to strengthen the available capacities and build new ones.
                 All three countries received technical assistance to enhance their capacity to manage
         programs, including public-private partnership approaches. The activities and support were
         carried out in accordance with each country's needs. WHO as the lead agency providing
         technical assistance facilitated the recruitment of: an M&E officer to assist the MOH in Burkina
         Faso; a program manager and three regional focal points for M&E in Ghana; and 10 data
         collection and analysis staff at provincial and district levels in Mozambique.
                 Detailed performance indicator data indicate that testing approaches, capacity building
         and regional learning activities financed through the TAP have had significant impact on
         improving access to and strengthening of HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities in the
         three countries.
                 All TAP interventions at the completion of the project have been integrated into their
         respective national HIV program.
                In Burkina Faso TAP financed the development of a national training plan for treatment
         with WHO technical support. The WHO assisted the MOH in in-service training and
         supervision of NGO HIV/AIDS treatment programs. WHO provided technical support and
         supervision at the treatment sites to ensure the quality and standardization of first and second line


                                                                      31
drug regimes used and the protocols followed by all health facilities within the country. Twelve
sites were selected for HIVDR sampling using protocol for HIVDR surveillance. Six training
sessions were organized by the national reference laboratory in collaboration with foreign
laboratories accredited by the WHO for genotyping. Laboratory equipment was procured.
        Ghana. With technical support from 3 WHO officers Ghana was able to strengthen
public-private collaboration, and build human and logistical capacity to deliver care and
treatment across sites. Capacity building of the IPs to provide comprehensive care was facilitated
through training of service providers, provision of logistics, linkages with public sector facilities
to assess gaps in care, and monitoring and evaluation of activities. HIV/AIDS management
training was provided to 480 healthcare workers. TAP funds were used to procure ARV for
regional medical GHS facilities and other sites to access as needed. Exit interview were
conducted to assess provision of care. The establishment of a Technical Working Group (TWG)
provided the NACP Program Manager with support on matters related to treatment and care
including accreditation and monitoring of prospective and operating ARV sites; training of
health workers in ART/OI management; technical backstopping to sites earmarked for
accreditation and all accredited sites; and to provide relevant material based on local and non-
local clinical experiences and research including the revision of national guidelines.
Accreditation teams were set up to assess sites readiness to offer ART. Activities were monitored
via quarterly meetings coordinated by the NACP providing a forum for Ips and other relevant
stakeholders to share information. Eighty peer educators were trained in ART/OI management
with 30 peer educators participating in ongoing workshops at the time of ICR drafting. PEF's
advocacy work with private sector institutions toward the adoption of HIV/AIDS work place
policies was further strengthened as a result of the TAP. Sensitization workshops were offered
to employees through work place programs and media outreach. Local NGOs engaged in
outreach programs with schools, churches, mosques and youth groups. The creation of referral
networks, through the organization of inter-site meetings, was also enhanced.
        Mozambique. WHO provided assistance in updating and adaptation of guidelines and
protocols; national standards, criteria and assessment tools; quality assurance systems for drug
procurement and testing; national monitoring and evaluation framework; management and
education of PLHIV; and system for clinical monitoring of ART. The development of
information systems to deliver improved statistical results under TAP contributed to institutional
strengthening by providing a practical and reliable data base for project monitoring. More than
500,000 young people have benefited from Geracao Biz ­ "Busy Generation" ­ increasing
awareness of sexual and reproductive health issues and to encourage the adoption of safe,
gender-sensitive sexual behavior.


        Component 3: Facilitating Regional Learning from TAP Country Experiences

The Regional Advisory Panel was a critical instrument to fostering a regional learning agenda.
UNECA was charged with providing support through a small Secretariat and organized seven
RAP meetings.
        RAP established a regional clinical coordination sub-committee (RCCC) to work with the
International Treatment Coalition (ITAC) and WHO to maintain regular review of treatment
regimens and protocols as lessons from country treatment programs were gathered and shared at


                                                 32
the regional level. The RCCC was comprised of clinical experts recognized for their work in
HIV/AIDS treatment, to enable African countries to share experiences, to review clinical results,
and to recommend policy reforms in participating countries.
          RAP meetings were held biannually at various locales throughout Eastern and Western
Africa.
       Seven RAP meetings were held to facilitate the exchange of country experiences.
UNECA developed a website (www.uneca.org/tap) to serve as a repository of information and
documents posting information on TAP, RAP meetings/reports, list of presentations, reports of
joint missions.

Operational research
UNECA: commissioned the following research activities, organized their peer-review,
publication and dissemination:
 a) Emerging Political and Economic Context of HIV/AIDS Policies and Programs (The paper
    looks at the changing global political and economic context for HIV/AIDS and what it
    means for funding, policy and programs in sub-Saharan Africa)
 b) The socio-cultural environments of Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Africa and the
    significance for a generalized HIV epidemic (Since HIV prevalence in this group is usually
    more than 20 times higher in some African countries than in the general population, and
    because many MSMs are also married to unsuspecting women, this study looks at the case
    of Kenya as part of its focus on prevention).
 c) Traditional cultural practices, gender, HIV and AIDS in Africa: the case of Nigeria,
    Tanzania and Uganda (Using three case studies, we look at the specific social and cultural
    factors, specific to Africa, and which contribute to spread of HIV).


                                                     35
 d) Survey of the socio-economic and health determinants of ARV treatment in Burkina Faso
    (The study seeks to understand/analyze the socio-economic determinants of adherence to
    treatment in Burkina Faso).
 e) An evaluation of PPP in TAP in Burkina Faso (The study looks at how PPP can accelerate
    HIV treatment in Burkina Faso).
 f) Social and economic determinants of adherence in TAP in Mozambique (The study seeks
    to understand/analyze the socio-economic determinants of adherence to treatment in
    Mozambique).
 g) PPP in TAP in Mozambique (The study looks at how PPP can accelerate HIV treatment in
    Mozambique).
 h) ARV treatment acceleration in Ghana: Evaluation of the Public and Private Partnerships
    (The study seeks to understand/analyze the socio-economic determinants of adherence to
    treatment in Ghana).
 i) Socio-economic determinants of adherence to ARV treatment in Ghana. (The study seeks
    to understand/analyze the socio-economic determinants of adherence to treatment in
    Ghana).
 j) Treatment and prevention among older people in Africa (Older people in Africa are not on
    most priority list in terms of HIV prevention, treatment, and support strategies. This study
    seeks a better understanding of their needs and makes suggestions.)
 k) Prevention strategies among HIV positives in Africa: a case study of Botswana (The study
    aims to develop strategies which can protect HIV positive people from being infected with
    a new strain)
DECRG: The World Bank (through DECRG) in partnership with the TAP countries has
conducted a number of health facility and longitudinal surveys in Burkina Faso, Ghana and
Mozambique. Some of these studies and key lessons are highlighted below:
   a) Measuring the impact of treatment on the welfare of patients and family members.
      Over and above the total number of lives saved and improved health outcomes, this study
      measures the impact of ARV treatment on labor supply of the patient and other family
      members, the schooling and nutrition of children within the household and other welfare
      indicators.
   b) What are the effects of ARV on HIV transmission and prevention?

             c) What are the determinants of treatment success? This study will assess whether and
                how patient care-seeking behavior and treatment adherence or the quantity and quality of
                ARV services have an effect on the success of the ARV treatment program.
             d) How to encourage cost-effectiveness and capacity building to reinforce the
                sustainability of ARV delivery and adherence?
     In order to answer these questions, data is being collected over time from biomedical records,
     household surveys (HIV patients and general population) as well as health facility and surveys.
     In some countries, experimental interventions will be evaluated such as:
                Rwanda: performance-based contracting for HIV/AIDS services in health facilities
                South Africa: food supplement and community health workers for supporting adherence
                to treatment.
                Kenya: reminders by text messages for improving adherence.

     Other dissemination activities: DECRG invited a team of 2 researchers from Burkina Faso
     (Institut de Recherches en Sciences de la Santé) for a one-week data analysis workshop in
     Washington DC in May 2008. Results from that joint analysis have been presented at the
     International AIDS Conference in Mexico in August 2008. The IRSS also presented results of
     the study at an international conference in Burkina Faso. Similarly, 3 researchers from the
     Health Research Unit at the Ministry of Health in Ghana were invited by DECRG for a one-week
     data analysis workshop in Washington DC in September 2008. The results of that analysis were
     presented at an international workshop in Cape Town in March 2009. In both cases, DECRG
     intend to continue the research relationship with the researchers from Burkina Faso and Ghana
     beyond the life of the TAP. Those relationships will continue to produce joint analysis and
     publications.

   Please note that only Burkina Faso monitored and reported TAP specific data. Ghana and Mozambique chose not to report on TAP specific data but preferred to report national achievements based
on the principles of the Three Ones and Paris Declaration. Therefore, IDA attribution to VCT is not possible to measure in Ghana and Mozambique.

         Annex 6: Questions for the TAP Learning Agenda
1. Full socio-economic benefit of treatment for patients and their household:
        number of life years saved for patient;
        Costs to households (direct and indirect) of treatment
           provision/availability;
        Impact on household economics ­ income and savings (either through
           additional payment for treatment or increased ability to be
           productive/unproductive);
        Impact on labor force participation of patient and household members
           (reduced absenteeism); and
        Children's wellbeing (education, health, psychosocial, etc.) as result of
           parent not dying.

2. What is the impact of availability of treatment on prevention in HIV positive and
   negative people?
       Changes in knowledge and attitude towards C&T and ART
       Willingness to be tested and VCT uptake?
       Impact on stigmatization?

       Impact on HIV transmission and prevalence? Discordant couples?

3. How to avoid the development and spread of resistance?
      Utilization of effective/efficient methods of measuring resistance at
         national level?
      Determinants of resistance to treatment? Biological, behavioral and health
         systems? (health workers being trained to use 1st line regimens,
         possibilities of drug stock-outs).
      Timeliness of detection.

4. Adherence
       Adherence tracking systems?
       What are the determinants of adherence?
       What are the best models to promote/encourage adherence?
       What is the level of involvement of the community? and benefits and at
         what costs?

5. How are ART beneficiaries identified? How to encourage timely uptake?
      Who gets recruited and why? How is it practiced and how do we monitor
         recruitment choices?
      Are pro-active recruitments drives practiced to maximize the social
         impact/benefits e.g. parents, mothers, youth?
      If so, what are the additional benefits, and how are they realized?
      What is the impact of cost-recovery on patient uptake and adherence?
