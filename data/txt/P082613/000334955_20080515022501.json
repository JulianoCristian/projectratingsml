There are three\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is testing approaches for scaling-up service\n            delivery for HIV/AIDS care and treatment. These service\n            delivery approaches would be tested through implementing\n            partners identified at country level, who have demonstrated\n            success at providing HIV/AIDS care and treatment on a small\n            scale. Specifically, the implementing partners include\n            associations of people living with HIV/AIDS in Burkina Faso,\n            international Non-government organizations (NGOs) in\n            Mozambique, and private sector clinics and organizations in\n            Ghana. The second component of the project is strengthening\n            institutional capacity for HIV/AIDS care and treatment to\n            ensure adequate referral mechanisms to support the\n            activities of the implementing partners and build overall\n            capacity within the Ministry of Health to scale up national\n            HIV/AIDS treatment coverage. The third and the final\n            component of the project is facilitating regional learning\n            from the TAP countries, with World Health Organization (WHO)\n            providing technical capacity support for the Ministries of\n            Health and implementing partners, while United Nations\n            Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) would support\n            cross-border learning and dissemination of lessons learned\n            within the African continent."}, "docdt": "2008-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
