Some lessons learned\n            included: sub-regional HIV/AIDS projects require a project\n            design that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities\n            of the multiple participating national and regional\n            institutions. Multiple stakeholders generate diverse views,\n            approaches and understandings that need to be addressed\n            during project preparation or immediately after the project\n            becomes effective. Government ownership and leadership is a\n            core requirement for successful institutional arrangements\n            and therefore establishing the institutional framework for\n            program implementation is an essential step during the\n            preparation phase. Regional projects take more time to reach\n            agreements on institutional arrangements, including funds\n            allocation. Public-private approaches and partnerships with\n            non-state actors have shown to be useful to quickly scale-up\n            anti-retroviral treatment programs. Long term partnerships\n            however are only viable with assurances of continued\n            financing whether domestic or external. Sharing information\n            is important to the success of regional programs as it\n            fosters regional learning. The regional advisory\n            (RAP's) panels proved to be an important mechanism for\n            those purposes and could be relevant for other programs in\n            health in Africa and beyond. RAPs facilitated learning and\n            served a useful forum for exchanging knowledge and\n            experience and especially fostering a south-south exchange.\n            Fiduciary processes and reporting for United Nation (UN)\n            agencies need to be clarified during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2009-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
