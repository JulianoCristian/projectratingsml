objectives of the Irrigation\n            and Drainage Improvement Project are to: 1) promote\n            sustainable irrigated agricultural production through\n            irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, improved water\n            management, and better operation and maintenance; 2)\n            introduce improved agricultural practices and farmers'\n            information services; and 3) strengthen irrigation and\n            environmental agencies. The project will include the\n            following components: 1) rehabilitation of irrigation and\n            drainage systems; 2) promotion of agricultural development\n            on privatized farms including pilots for farmers'\n            participatory training and information services as well as\n            farm restructuring; and 3) institution building comprising:\n            (a) support for the project implementation unit; (b)\n            strengthening of environmental capacity; and (c) study of\n            the feasibility of privatizing irrigation management for a\n            typical canal command area."}, "docdt": "1996-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
