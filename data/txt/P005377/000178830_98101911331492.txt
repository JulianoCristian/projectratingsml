APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MOROCCO
CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture provides about 25% of Morocco's GDP and employs about
half of the labor force. Agricultural exports account for about 25% of total
exports. The main objectives of the Government during the Third Plan (1973-
77) are to improve the trade balance of agricultural products, to raise farm
incomes and to improve distribution of the growth of wealth through the
Agrarian Reform Program and through a better balance of Government support
to farmers. The main obstacles have been the lack of qualified technical
personnel and the relatively limited scope of the Agrarian Reform Program.
The Project would support these objectives and would attempt to reduce these
obstacles.
ii.       Agricultural credit is provided by the Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA).  Credit to medium/large-sized farmers, farmers' associations,
Cooperatives and companies is provided by CNCA Headquarters (HQ) and by the
24 Caisses Regionales de Credit Agricole (CRCAs); credit to small/medium-
sized farmers is provided by the 86 Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole
(CLCAs). CNCA is well-managed and is a very effective and independent credit
institution.
iii.      Bank/IDA involvement in Agricultural Credit in Morocco started
with the First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 433-MOR for US$10 million,
effective in February 1966 and fully disbursed by September 1969) whose
performance was not without problems; the main impact of the Project was the
resulting improvement in CNCA's management and operations. The Second Agri-
cultural Credit Project (Loan/Credit 861/338 for US$34 million, effective in
February 1973 and fully disbursed by May 1976) financed CNCA lending for
1973-76 to medium and large farmers for investments on grain farms, citrus
plantations, winter vegetable farms and livestock farms and marketing facili-
ties. Project implementation started slowly, due to delays in effectiveness
and unavailability of IDA funds and remained behind schedule until the summer
of 1975. The impact of the Second Project on CNCA was overall positive,
especially on the institutional side.
iv.       This report appraises a Third Agricultural Credit Project for which
a Bank Loan to CNCA of US$35 million equivalent is proposed. The Project
would support a two-and-a-half year lending program for on-farm development
of small, medium and large farmers and of Cooperatives and farmers' asso-
ciations. The Third Project would not only aim at increasing agricultural
production and at further expanding CNCA's capability, like the first two



- ii -
Projects, but it would also contribute to the improvement of the income of
small farmers and to the strengthening of Cooperatives and associations in
support of the Agrarian Reform Program. Of the estimated 350,000 subborrowers,
40% (140,000 farmers) would be below the absolute poverty level of US$1050 per
family and 34% (120,000 farmers) would never have had access to credit before.
The Project would also include some technical assistance to CNCA and to the
Souss-Massa land development agency.
v.        The total cost of the Third Agricultural Credit Project is esti-
mated at about US$315.3 million equivalent, of which 34.4% would be in foreign
exchange.  Financing of investments would come from the following sources:
Subborrowers' contributions (28.7%), Government grants (3.3%), CNCA own funds
(47.1%), IBRD Loan (11.1%) and a loan from the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development for US$31 million equivalent (9.8%). The Bank Loan
would refinance only loans to small/medium-sized farmers, Cooperatives and
farmers' associations, while the Arab Fund loan would refinance only loans
to medium/large-sized farmers. Together the Bank and the Arab Fund loans
would meet the financial gap of CNCA until August 1979.
vi.       Existing CNCA lending procedures and norms are generally adequate
but would be improved by modifying lending provisions to Cooperatives in order
to provide them with a sounder financial structure. Medium-term interest
rates would be increased from 6.5% to about 7.7% p.a. for CLCA borrowers and
from 7% to 8.5% p.a. for Cooperatives and associations. Interest rates for
HQ/CRCA borrowers at 8.5% p.a. are in line with interest rates in other
sectors of the economy, and are positive in real terms; thus they would be
maintained.  All interest rates would be reviewed annually on the basis of
forecast income and expenses so that HQ/CRCA operations would be profitable
and that the loss of the CLCAs (paid by an operating subsidy from the Govern-
ment) would be kept within reasonable limits. CNCA would set up an adequate
monitoring and evaluation system.
vii.      The financial rates of return of subprojects would range between
14% and 25%. The overall economic rate of return would be 29%. Substantial
employment benefits (at least 40,000 man years) would be generated and
farmers' access to credit would be improved. With assurances obtained from
CNCA and the Moroccan Government during negotiations, the Project would be
suitable for an IBRD Loan to CNCA to US$35 million for 13 years including a
grace period of three years.



APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MOROCCO
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Morocco and the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole
(CNCA) have requested a Bank Loan to help finance agricultural credit for
investménts by small, medium and large individual farmers, Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives, farmers' associations for mechanization and regional land
development agencies and provincial offices of the Ministry of Agriculture
(for farmers under their supervision) for the period between January 1977 and
August 1979. The Project would also include some technical assistance to
CNCA and to the land development agency for the Souss-Massa region (ORMVASM).
The Project would also be financed by a loan from the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development. The Borrower for the Bank Loan would be CNCA. CNCA
is already the Borrower under the First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan
433-MOR), and under the Second Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 338-MOR
and Loan 861-MOR).
1.02      The total Project cost would be $315.3 million with a foreign ex-
change cost estimated at $108.5 million. The requested Loan of $35 million
would cover part of the financing gap of CNCA during the period under consid-
eration.  The balance of the Project cost would be financed by subborrowers'
contributions, CNCA's own funds and Government grants (almost exclusively for
Cooperatives and farmers' associations) and by the Arab Fund loan.
1.03      The Project was entirely prepared by CNCA staff and was appraised
in May-June 1976 by Messrs. M. Lenot, J. Duester and R. Ingram (Bank) and
Mr. J. Marinet (Consultant). Mr. S. Khorana checked tables and calculations;
Mrs. E. Bolenge-Bongeli was secretary to the mission in Washington.
Il. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR (Annex 1) 1/
A. Description and Performance
General
2.01      Morocco has a total land area of 506,000 km2 2/, 7.6 million ha of
which are cultivable. Nearly 10 million people out of 15 million (65%) live
1/   More detailed information will be available in the Morocco Agricultural
Sector Survey currently under preparation.

in rural areas. Agriculture contributes about 25% of GDP. About half of
the labor force is employed in agriculture. Agricultural exports account
for about 25% of total exports.
2.02      Most of the cultivated land lies west of the Atlas and Rif moun-
tains. The climate is Mediterranean in the North, but aridity increases to-
wards the South, becoming desert-like in the Southeast and the extreme South.
Rainfed lands are equally distributed between higher rainfall areas (above
350 mm) and lower rainfall areas (below 350 mm). Irrigable land represents
about 12% of all cultivable land. Rainfed land produces mainly grain, le-
gumes and oil seeds, plus olive trees and vineyards; in the lower rainfall
areas, only grain is grown. Most of the industrial crops, forage crops,
vegetable crops and citrus plantations are grown under irrigation. Livestock
production represents about one-third of the total agricultural production.
Most of the livestock herd (4 million cattle, 15 million sheep) is raised
extensively on 22 million hectares of grazing lands.
Development Objectives
2.03      The long-term growth rate of agriculture has been moderate but has
somewhat increased during the period of the Second Development Plan (1968-72)
mainly because of irrigation expansion, increased use of fertilizers and
other inputs, increased production of high value crops and favorable climatic
conditions. Under the Third Plan (1973-77), agriculture (especially irrigated
agriculture) continues to receive the highest priority with an emphasis toward
more productive investments in irrigated and rainfed agriculture and livestock
improvements. A better allocation of resources in favor of the rainfed sector
should be achieved.
2.04      The main objectives of the Third Plan are to improve the trade bal-
ance of agricultural products, to raise farm income through irrigation and
improvement of productivity in rainfed agriculture and livestock raising, and
to improve distribution of the growth of wealth through land reform and a
better balance of Government support to farmers. Such targets require some
consolidation of land holdings, more technicians in the agricultural sector,
development of agricultural research, extension and agricultural credit,
coherent pricing policies, improvement of marketing and better terms of trade
for the agricultural sector. Inasmuch as possible, the Moroccan credit system
is geared to these objectives by meeting the credit demand as generated by
incentives and priorities assigned by the Government agricultural policies,
and the Project would thus support them. The Sector Survey recognizes the
general soundness of Morocco's agricultural policies.
Institutions
2.05      Development of agriculture is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA) which carries out its task through
the Regional Agricultural Land Development Agencies (ORMVAs) in irrigated
perimeters and through its Provincial Offices (SPs) in rainfed regions. All
farmers on irrigated perimeters are under the supervision of the ORMVAs and
have to follow prescribed cropping patterns. Extension centers (CTs and



- 3 -
CMVs) are under the ORMVAs and the SPs and provide inputs and mechanization
services to farmers in addition to extension.  ORMVAs and SPs are also in
charge of comprehensive crop programs for sugar beet, sugar cane, sunflower,
hybrid corn and cotton where they provide all inputs, mechanization services,
extension and credit to individual farmers, and purchase their outputs.
2.06      Although much progress has been accomplished so far, agricultural
education is a constraint to agricultural development: the agricultural
schools cannot graduate enough qualified personnel for both the public and the
private sectors.  Extension services also suffer from a lack of qualified
personnel. Credit is provided mainly by CNCA, but also by local money-lenders
(for those who cannot have access to institutional credit) and by commercial
banks (usually only for very large farmers). Farmers' associations for
mechanization help provide mechanization services to smaller farmers through
joint ownership of tractors. The link between extension and credit needs to
be strengthened through a build up of qualified extension staff. The system
of centralized marketing for a few commodities functions reasonably well, but
the impact of subsidies paid for most inputs and outputs as well as their
distribution among subsectors and classes remain to be assessed. The existing
investment code seems to provide adequate incentives for a reasonably well-
balanced agricultural investment pattern.
Land Distribution and Farmers' Income
2.07      Land distribution is unequal and skewed but there are practically
no latifundia. The small size and fragmentation of holdings is a major
obstacle to the improvement of productivity. Most of the cultivable land is
privately owned and farmed by the owner, but 15% of total arable land is under
collective ownership, whose improvement is difficult.
2.08      About 35% of the farms are recorded as not marketing any output:
they can be assumed to be at the subsistence level, not generating cash and
probably among those not having access to credit. The absolute poverty level
can be estimated at US$1050 per family. The actual income of farmers is
always very difficult to estimate but the Moroccan tax authorities have
devised a fiscal income, which is a notional income based on constant para-
meters measuring the productive capacity of the farm. 1/ This fiscal income
is lower than the real farm income--about 40% of the real farm income for
smaller farmers and much less for larger farmers.
2.09      Agrarian Reform.  A modest Agrarian Reform Program has been carried
out through the redistribution of 270,000 ha out of the 610,000 ha confis-
cated from foreign settlers since 1956. The Third Plan calls for the redis-
tribution of 400,000 ha by the end of 1977. Beneficiaries are landless farm
workers or subsistence smallholders, coming from the poorest rural groups.
The 18,000 beneficiaries are organized in 532 Cooperatives. The organiza-
tion of the Cooperatives needs to be revised, their size enlarged and their
autonomy strengthened to put them on a sounder financial basis. The Agrarian
1/   Detailed description of fiscal income in Annex 1, para. 22.



-4-
Reform Program has been given high priority by the Government, but its overall
impact on rural poverty has been very small; by the end of 1977, 4%--at most--
of all landless workers, sharecroppers and subsistence level farmers will have
received land under the Program.
B. Previous Bank Projects in the Agricultural Sector
2.10      Bank Group lending for agriculture in Morocco began in 1965 and to
date 8 Projects have been undertaken and supported by $202 million in Bank/IDA
funds ($24 million of which in IDA credits). They include four large irriga-
tion Projects: Sidi Slimane (FY65, completed), Sebou I (FY70), Sebou II
(FY74) and Doukkala (FY76); a groundwater Project in the Souss (FY75); a
rainfed agriculture development Project in the Meknes region (FY75); and two
completed Agricultural Credit Projects (FY66 and FY73) (see Chapter IV).
Difficulties arose with respect to the First Agricultural Credit Project in
1968 (see para 4.01) and to the Sebou I Project in the early 1970s (slow
progress in land distribution) but since that time, the performance under the
agricultural Projects has improved substantially and has been satisfactory.
The emphasis on irrigation Projects reflects the Government's priority, and
the relative difficulty in identifying and preparing viable Projects to serve
rainfed agriculture and especially collective lands; the rainfed agriculture
development Project in the Meknes region provides assistance in trying to
overcome these difficulties.
III. CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE (CNCA) (Annex 2)
A. Background, Organization and Personnel
3.01      CNCA was created in 1962 to provide agricultural credit to individ-
ual farmers and companies engaged in agricultural production, marketing and,
to some extent, processing. CNCA is practically the only institutional source
of agricultural credit in Morocco. It is an autonomous Government-owned
institution. The decrees establishing CNCA are not always fully consistent
with its actual practices (especially with respect to the organization of the
CLCAs) and the Government has agreed to revise them accordingly.
3.02      Organization of the CNCA Headquarters office in Rabat is satisfac-
tory. There are two types of CNCA branch offices: the 24 Caisses Regionales
de Credit Agricole (CRCAs) which lend to medium/large-sized farmers and the 86
Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole (CLCAs) which lend to small/medium-sized
farmers. They are both grouped in five regional zones headed by regional
directors, to whom much decision-making power has been decentralized.



- 5 -
3.03      Total staff number about 1,350, having doubled in number since
1971. 28% of the staff are at Headquarters, 40% with CRCAs and 32% with
CLCAs; almost 30% of the staff have a higher level education. CNCA staff is
well qualified and generally devoted to CNCA. The size of the staff will need
to expand significantly over the coming years to handle the projected lending
volume. Recent salary increases have made CNCA compensation system competitive
with banks and other institutions; this should help prevent CNCA from losing
staff to the private sector or to other Government agencies. Newly graduated
agricultural staff are assigned directly to CNCA by MARA each year. Training
has been quite successful in the past, given the available financial means and
personnel resources, but it should now be streamlined and intensified (para
6.02).
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
CLCAs
3.04      The CLCAs make loans to small/medium-sized farmers with a fiscal
income (para 2.08) between DH 100 and DH 3,000 (actual farm income $60 -
$1,750). The total number of potential CLCA clients is above 1 million, of
which about 160,000 are actually borrowing from the CLCAs; about 50% of these
loans go to farmers below poverty level. The farmer's indebtedness to the
CLCA is limited as a function of his fiscal income; as a result, until
September 1976, only about half of the investment cost was financed by a
medium-term loan on the average (para 6.04).
3.05      Financial charges on CLCA loans are not computed as interest rates
pro rata temporis but a fïxed fee (usually 4%) is charged at the time of dis-
bursement and on each October 1 on the amount of the loan outstanding. Each
loan is also charged an initial fee of 2% when disbursed, to feed a guarantee
fund to cover non-repayment losses; however, the amount available in this fund
is much too high compared to the non-repayment risk. The equivalent short-term
rates range between 10% and 16% p.a., and the equivalent average medium-term
rate is about 6.5% p.a.; because of the initial fee, rates on medium-term
loans (2 to 5 years) are distorted in favor of longer term loans ranging from
8.7% p.a. on a two year loan to 6% p.a. on a five year loan (para 6.08).
3.06      Appraisal of CLCA loans is based on a desk review; although this
tends to result in somewhat rapid appraisal, the lending risk is kept low
thanks to the existence of a limit on indebtedness. The productivity of the
CLCA staff is very high, thus allowing a high lending volume (the norm being
500 loans per operational man-year). The CLCAs have been quite successful in
attempting to reach an optimum balance between the need for adequate invest-
ment appraisal and the difficulties of reaching large numbers of small/medium-
sized farmers with limited institutional resources. The recovery system is
very efficient, due to effective management and strong Government support
(para 3.10); the recovery rates are excellent for such an institution (85%
to 90% on dues and 80% to 85% on overdues).



-6-
HQ and CRCAs
3.07      The CRCAs make loans to medium/large-stzed farmers with a fiscal
income above DH 3,000, to farmers' associations for mechanization (para 2.06)
and to some Cooperatives. The Headquarters lend to Cooperatives and companies
including ORMVAs and SPs (para 2.05), and to very large farmers. Lending
procedures are more flexible and lending norms are higher for better, older
clients of the CRCAs (and better farmers as well) than for new clients or
farmers not considered modern or efficient. CNCA also finances State and
private agricultural companies for production and marketing of agricultural
companies. Most of the processing industry however is financed by commercial
banks and development finance companies.
3.08      The provision of credit to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives is governed
by specific norms: credit finances 100% of investment costs, but a percentage
of short-term needs that decreases from 100% in the first year of creation of
the Cooperative to 0% in the sixth year. This system, while taking into
account the financial weakness of the Cooperatives, is economically irrational
and ineffective, resulting in a decrease in the use of inputs when short-term
credit is no more available to finance them (para 6.06). Loans to Agrarian
Reform Cooperatives are guaranteed by the Government.
3.09      Interest rates, which were most recently increased in September
1975, range from 6% to 8.5% p.a. for short-term credit for production (4.75%
and 5.5% p.a. for marketing) and rates on medium-term loans are 7% p.a. for
Cooperatives and associations and 8.5% p.a. for individual farmers. Appraisal
of loans is quite thorough and adequate; loan approval is decentralized at
the CRCA level, except for some very large loans, and is usually speedy and
flexible. As in the case of the CLCAs, the efforts to reach an optimum
balance between the desired thoroughness of appraisal and the objective of
reaching large numbers of farmers with institutional resources larger than
the CLCAs but nevertheless limited, have resulted in flexible procedures for
loan appraisal and approval.
3.10      Rates of recovery are slightly below those of the CLCAs but are
still satisfactory approaching 80% on dues and 65% on overdues. The recovery
system is efficient as far as individual farmers, farmers' associations and
Cooperatives are concerned, but there have been difficulties with companies,
ORMVAs and some very large farmers. The same legal instruments can be used
for recovering CNCA debt as for recovering State debt; this contributes
significantly to CNCA's good repayment performance and the Government has
undertaken that the decree granting this privilege to CNCA will remain in
force.



C. Sources and Uses of Funds
Resources
3.11      CNCA's equity funds total DH 266 million and include CNCA's capital
proper (DR 136 million), the CLCA's General Fund (DR 93 million) and Guaran-
tee Fund (DH 10 million) and the General Reserve (DH 27 million). The IDA
Credit for the Second Agricultural Credit Project (338-MOR) and a loan from
Iran, both lent to the Government of Morocco, have been made available to CNCA
as equity. The equity capital is Government-owned and not dividend-bearing.
Deposits have increased more than five times since 1971 and amount to DH 137
million (Annex 2, para 46); mobilization of additional deposits is one of the
most important tasks of CNCA, which has launched active publicity campaigns
and devised special savings schemes in order to overcome the constraints
hampering its efforts at attracting more deposits.
3.12      CNCA can have recourse to cash advances from the Central Bank
and from another State bank.  Its long-term borrowings have been from IBRD
(Chapter IV), from the German aid agency Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau and
from the City of Agadir. It has also made two bond issues of DH 30 million
each. Resources presently available to CNCA amount to about DH 770 million;
their weighted average cost is 2.16%.
Operations
3.13       CNCA has only negligible equity participations (DH 1 million).
Total CNCA lending in 1974/75 amounted to DR 711 million broken down as
follows:
(DH million)

CLCAs                                        13              73            86
HQ/CRCA individual farmers                  158              80           238

Projections for future lending operations, made on the basis of past trends
and of Government priorities in the agricultural sector, form the basis for
the Project cost computation.



-8-
D. Financial Position
3.14      The profitability of HQ/CRCA operations has been adequate, except
for an operating loss in 1973/74, and is expected to remain satisfactory.
Income and expenses as percentages of average assets are as follows (1975/76):
HQ/CRCA       CLCA         Total
Operating income                      8.3%        6.1%          7.8%
Government subsidy to CLCA             -           1.9%         0.4%
Total income                    8.3%         8.0%          8.2%
Financial expenses                    2.9%        0.2%          2.3%
Administrative expenses               3.9%         7.7%         4.7%
Depreciation and provisions           0.9%         0.1%         0.8%
Total expenses                   7.7%        8.0%          7.8%
Net income                      0.6%          -            0.4%
Because of the higher administrative costs of lending to small farmers and of
lower lending rates, and despite lower financial costs and higher staff pro-
ductivity, the CLCAs have always had operating losses, which have grown sig-
nificantly over time, especially with the increase in lending of the last
few years. Relatively low interest rates are used as a means of subsidizing
the agricultural sector, and especially the smaller farmers. This may intro-
duce some economic distortions through choices of capital intensive technology.
Some adjustments are necessary (Chapter VI) but overall, in the context of the
general structure of interest rates in the country and of the revision of
interest rates taking place in Morocco from time to time, CNCA interest rates
for its HQ/CRCA operations can be deemed satisfactory as long as they provide
CNCA with an adequate income, while interest rates for CLCA lending should be
regularly increased to decrease dependence from Government through its subsidy.
3.15      CNCA financial structure is satisfactory and is expected to remain
so in the future. CNCA's risk is both economic and institutional. In eco-
nomic terms, all of CNCA assets are with individuals or companies active in
the agricultural sector (including marketing and processing of agricultural
commodities). Because of this strong unisectoral exposure, output fluctuations
(bad harvests) could significantly increase CNCA's risk. However, CNCA has
been successful in keeping this risk to a minimum, as demonstrated by its re-
covery rates. In institutional terms CNCA is financially dependent upon the
Government, which owns 100% of its equity, and provides an operating subsidy
for the CLCAs. CNCA has nevertheless managed to remain operationally very
independent in the past, 1/ but in the future a stronger financial position
will probably be necessary for CNCA to maintain its autonomy, especially with
1/   Except for a few very specific loans for which adequate guarantees
were provided by the Government.

respect to the CLCAs. The Project would assist in this respect by ensuring
increases in lending rates when necessary to improve CNCA income earning
position and to limit the Government's operating subsidy to the CLCAs (paras
6.09 and 6.12). This would help to achieve a proper equilibrium between
CNCA's financial autonomy and its role as a Government agency, implementing
credit programs in line with the Government's agricultural policies.
3.16      Overall, CNCA has grown to become a very good agricultural credit
institution, and a very efficient one in lending to small farmers on an in-
dividual basis, while obtaining excellent recoveries and keeping costs within
reasonable limits. Its next challenge will be to further expand its lending
to small farmers within the same cost limits: it probably will need to ex-
periment with new mechanisms for delivering credit, for example, group credit.
IV. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS (Annex 3)
A. First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 433-MOR)
4.01      The $10 million Loan financed the CNCA lending program for the
period 1966-69.  It included lending for on-farm development of medium and
large farms and lending for farm equipment and machinery of a State company
in charge of managing land confiscated from foreign settlers. The overall
performance of the Project was not without problems and the Loan was sus-
pended and part of it cancelled, as a result of a breach of covenants on
separation of the CLCA accounts by CNCA and the Moroccan Government. The
combination of CNCA's relative weakness at the time in terms of staffing and
financing and of the Government's heavy interference in CNCA operations
caused the First Project's performance to be not only rather disappointing,
but also a source of considerable controversy within the Bank.
4.02      This Project was evaluated by the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment in 1973-74; 1/ its report acknowledges that the analysis was biased by
the severe droughts experienced by Morocco during this period and that its
results could be misleading and need to be very carefully interpreted. It
points out to a low return on mechanization investments because of the
droughts; it recognizes however that tractors are the only means to break
the ground in years of drought and that the alternative for the farmer is
therefore between getting some crop, or getting no crop at all. The OED
assumption of a drought every five years seems unjustified by historical
data, which points out to a drought every ten years rather. Present analysis
1/   OED Report:  Agricultural Credit Programs, Background Paper No. 4.  The
conclusions of the general OED Report (Agricultural Credit Programs,
Report no. 1357, issued November 18, 1976) are discussed in para. 7.08.



- 10 -
(Appendix 1.1 and Annex 4, models 5 and 6) shows adequate returns on mecha-
nization investments, using conservative average yields, based on a conserva-
tive pattern of good and bad crop years. The OED report also points out
to the complementarity between tractor use and new cultural practices (new
varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.): modern cultural practices, without
proper land preparation through use of a tractor, would not reap adequate
benefits, and thus benefits have to be entirely attributed to the tractor,
whose use will almost always imply new cultural practices. Overall economic
results appear to be inconclusive (the OED "guess" of an economic rate of
return of 5% appears pessimistic) but the main impact of the Project was
clearly the improvement in CNCA's management and operations.
B. Second Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 861-MOR, Credit 338-MOR>
Project Description
4.03      The Loan/Credit of $34 million was made to finance CNCA lending for
1973-76 to medium and large farmers (HQ and CRCA clients) for investments in
grain farm equipment, citrus plantation development, winter vegetable produc-
tion, dairy farm development, beef cattle and sheep farms, and marketing
facilities. The Project cost was estimated at $69.4 million and the Loan/
Credit was to cover the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The objectives
of the Project were to encourage investment in and modernization of the agri-
cultural sector through loans to 8,000 farms ranging from 5 to 50 ha of irri-
gated land and from 15 to 200 ha of rainfed to land; to generate employment
for about 18,000 persons; and to reduce imports of grain, milk and meat and
increase exports of citrus and vegetables. After lengthy discussions and
negotiations, it was agreed that an interest rate of 8% was to be charged by
CNCA on subloans except for subloans to the "lower income" farmers (fiscal
income between DH 3,000 and DH 6,000), who would still be charged 6.5%;
however, subloans at 6.5% should not exceed 20% of the total Project lending.
The CLCA clients (fiscal income below DH 3,000) were excluded from the Project.
Project Implementation and Realization
4.04      Due ta difficulties in pre-negotiations and negotiations, temporary
unavailability of IDA funds and delays by CNCA in submitting effectiveness
documents, the Loan/Credit became effective in February 1973, while the ap-
praisal work had been completed by early 1971. Delays in disbursements, due
to CNCA difficulties in assembling the necessary disbursement documentation,
to computer hardware difficulties and to the ceiling on subloans at 6.5%,
occurred until the summer of 1975. Higher interest rates on all CNCA loans
were introduced in September 1975, thus stepping up disbursements. The
Loan/Credit was fully disbursed in May 1976 as initially forecast. Subloans
to individual farmers and associations submitted for refinancing amounted to
about 77% of the total amount of medium-term loans extended by CNCA to indi-
vidual farmers and associations through HQ and CRCAs only for the period
between September 1972 and April 1976 (including some loans not eligible
for refinancing under the Project).



- il -
4.05      The demand for equipment on grain farms turned out to be lower than
expected and only 85% of the funds ($18 million) allocated to this component
were actually disbursed. Only 60% of the original estimate ($11.5 million)
for citrus plantations and vegetable cultivation was disbursed in this cate-
gory, essentially because of the curtailment of new citrus plantations; in May
1975, $4.5 million were reallocated from the citrus and vegetable category to
the livestock category. Demand for funds from the livestock development cate-
gory was the strongest as a result of the Government incentives for livestock
investments that were intended to correct the permanent shortage of milk and
meat. In May 1975, $5 million were reallocated to this category; total dis-
bursements amounted to more than three times the original estimate of $3.5
million. The marketing facilities component was by far the least successful;
its allocation ($1 million) was cut in half in May 1975 and total disburse-
ments amounted to 68% of the original estimate.
Beneficiaries
4.06      Overall about 17,000 farmers were reached with an average loan
amount per farmer of DH 12,000 versus a forecast of 8,000 farmers with an
average loan of DH 28,000. 98% of the Loan/Credit was disbursed for individ-
ual farmers. Only 20% of the funds went to "lower income" farmers which had
to pay only 6.5% interest while during the same period about 35% of HQ/CRCA
disbursements were made to this category. Thus the Project helped finance
mostly large farmers. A few Cooperatives and a State company, SODEA, vere
also financed under the Project.
Institutional Performance
4.07      The Bank was concerned about CNCA institutional development and in-
sisted on four covenants regarding the separation of accounts of the CLCAs and
of the Government operations, the strengthening of CNCA capital, the audit of
CNCA and an adequate profitability of CNCA. The first three covenants were
met (the IDA Credit was given to CNCA as equity capital). To improve CNCA
profitability, interest rates were increased on September 1, 1975, but re-
serves accumulating from net income have not yet been able to reach 15% of
equity capital as sought, since equity capital has more than doubled since
1971.
4.08      CNCA has over the past few years grown to become an efficient and
sophisticated agricultural credit institution. To the extent that the Bank
supported this growth by its financing and its supervision, the institutional
impact of the Second Project can certainly be considered beneficial. In re-
trospect, however, it seems that the impact of the Project could have been
even more beneficial if the Bank had not at the outset excluded the CLCAs
from its financing, if it had been more flexible on the interest rate issue
(thus not excluding from its financing a large number of the smaller CRCA
clients) and if it had not insisted at first upon unecessarily complicated
disbursement procedures.

Economic Performance
4.09      Although it has been difficult to obtain accurate data on the impact
of the Project upon production, it seems that the economic performance of the
Project was acceptable. This lack of data clearly underlines the need for a
monitoring system to be established (para. 6.15). The overall performance and
impact of the Second Loan can nevertheless be considered positive, especially
on the institutional side.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
5.01      The previous two Agricultural Credit Projects were aimed principally
at increasing agricultural production through mechanization and modernization
of medium and large farms and at strengthening CNCA. The Third Project would
also aim at increasing agricultural production to meet Morocco's rising demand
in line with the Plan's objectives and at further expanding CNCA's capability
as an agricultural credit institution; but it would contribute as well to the
improvement of the income of small farmers borrowing through the CLCAs (eli-
gible for the first time for Bank financing) and to the strengthening of
Cooperatives and associations in support of the Agrarian Reform Program.
B. Description
5.02      The Project would finance most of CNCA medium and long-term lending
for agricultural investments (for which representative farm models have been
prepared in Annex 4) and would consist of eight parts:
(A)  Medium-term lending to individual small/medium-sized farmers
borrowing through the CLCAs for on-farm investments;
(B) Medium and long-term lending to individual medium/large-sized
farmers borrowing through CNCA headquarters and the CRCAs for
on-farm investments;
(C) Medium-term lending to regional land development agencies and
provincial offices of the Ministry of Agriculture for invest-
ments undertaken by farmers under their supervision for com-
prehensive crop programs;
(D) Medium and long-term lending to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives
for their own on-farm investments and those of their members;



- 13 -
(E)  Medium-term lending to farmers' associations of small farmers
for agricultural machinery;
(F) Monitoring fellowships for CNCA for establishing a monitoring
and evaluation system;
(G)  Consultants' services to CNCA for studies on banking development
and staff training, and provision of audio visual equipment for
training;
(H) An applied research program in vegetable cultivation by the land
development agency for the Souss-Massa region (ORMVASM).
5.03      The first five components would cover CNCA loan commitments for the
period January 1977-August 1979. Loans for non-productive purposes (such as
land purchase) would be excluded. State companies would be excluded from the
Project because of the likelihood of distribution of their land holdings and
of CNCA's lack of autonomy in its decision to finance their investments. Pri-
vate companies would also be excluded from the Project because the future of
the agricultural production companies is legally uncertain and the processing
companies normally have other sources of finance. The Project would include
the rest (about 80%) of the CNCA medium- and long-term lending program.
Individual Small/Medium-sized Farmers - Part A
5.04      This category would finance individual farmers who are CLCA bor-
rowers, i.e., those with a fiscal income between DH 100 and DH 3,000 (real
farm income $60 - $1,750).  It would include grain and mixed farming, dairy
and fattening farms and some plantations and vegetable growing.  Investments
would consist mainly of cattle, sheep, stables, draft animals and small
equipment, wells and pumps, and land improvement. Investments in tractors
and combine harvesters would not be financed under this category since
farmers receive mechanization service from the Government extension centers
or from custom operators. They can also form farmers' associations to pur-
chase machinery (Part F). Almost half (47.2%) of the Project cost ($148.8
million) would be in this category.
Individual Medium/Large-sized Farmers - Part B
5.05      This category would finance individual farmers who are clients of
the CRCAs or of the CNCA Headquarters, i.e., those with a fiscal income above
DH 3,000 (real farm income above $1,750). It would include grain farms, dairy
and fattening farms, vegetable producers, plantations and mixed farming.  In-
vestments would consist mainly of tractors, combine harvesters, trucks, cattle
and sheep, stables, plantations, draft animals and small equipment, wells and
pumps, land improvement and some chicken breeding, beekeeping, alfalfa estab-
lishment and processing equipment. It would not include loans for housing,
land purchase and the like. About 37.3% of the Project cost ($117.7 million)
would be in this category.



- 14 -
Regional Land Development Agencies & Provincial Offices - Part C
5.06      These agencies are in charge of managing large irrigation systems
(Offices Regionaux de Mise en Valeur Agricole--ORMVAs) or they are the pro-
vincial offices of the Ministry of Agriculture for rainfed land (Services
Provinciaux-- SPs). Most credit provided under the comprehensive industrial
crop programs (para 2.05) is short-term credit, but some crops such as sugar
cane and alfalfa also require medium-term credit which will be provided under
this category. The ORMVAs and SPs would pass on the credit to the individual
farmers for the creation and initial maintenance of sugar cane plantations
and for establishment of alfalfa fields. About 3.6% of the Project cost
($11.4 million) would be in this category.
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives - Part D
5.07      This category would include all the Agrarian Reform Cooperatives
(para 2.09). These investments would be carried out by the Cooperatives
themselves (tractors, combines and related machinery, trucks) or individually
by the members borrowing through their Cooperatives (cattle and sheep, stables,
plantations, draft animals and small equipment). Loans for housing and sub-
sistence loans would not be included. About 10.3% of the Project cost ($32.6
million) would be in this category.
Farmers' Associations - Part E
5.08      This category would include all farmers' associations for mechaniza-
tion; their members are small/medium-sized farmers not individually eligible
for tractors (because of the small size of each of their farms), thus invest-
ing collectively in one tractor. Investments would consist only of tractors
and implements and a few combine harvesters. About 1.1% of Project ($3.5
million) would be in this category.
Monitoring Fellowships for CNCA - Part F
5.09      This category would provide funds ($50,000) for assistance to CNCA
in setting up a farm monitoring system (as described in para 6.15) in the
form of fellowships for CNCA staff to visit agricultural institutions with
efficient monitoring systems in other countries. If necessary, it would also
finance the employment of a monitoring consultant.
Consultants' Services to CNCA - Part G
5.10      This category would provide funds ($0.7 million in foreign exchange)
to CNCA for employing consultants to assist CNCA management in setting up and
implementing a banking development program (with emphasis on deposits collec-
tion) and a staff training program; funds would also be provided for the
purchase of audio visual equipment. Terms of reference and consultants'
selection would be approved jointly by the Arab Fund and the Bank.



- 15 -
ORMVASM Applied Research Program - Part H
5.11      This category would finance the foreign exchange cost ($300,000)
of an applied research program with international and Moroccan experts in
vegetable cultivation in the Massa irrigation system (Annex 9), including the
cost of some research equipment. This applied research program is part of the
preparation process of an agricultural development project under consideration
by the Bank. Its objectives are thus limited to this narrow purpose. Terns
of reference and the selection of consultants have already been approved by
the Bank.
C. Cost Estimates (Annex 5)
5.12      The Project cost estimates are based on current prices of the
respective investments. Total Project cost is estimated at DH 1,355.8 million
($315.3 million) of which approximately 34.4% or $108.5 million would be in
foreign exchange.  These estimates are summarized in the following table.

5.14      CNCA would be the Borrower of the Bank Loan.  The Loan would be for
a period of 13 years including a 3-year grace period, and would bear an 8.7%
interest rate. The Loan maturity and grace period are based on projections of
lending operations and subborrowers' repayments (Annex 6). The Government
would carry the foreign exchange risk as was done under the previous Projects
under satisfactory procedures. The Bank Loan would finance only the Project
components aimed at small/medium-sized farmers, i.e, the individual CLCA
borrowers and the Cooperatives and associations. The Arab Fund loan of KD 9
million for 15 years with 5 years grace period at 6% interest would finance
the Project components aimed at medium/large-sized farmers either directly
or through the ORMVAs and SPs. Together the Bank and Arab Fund loans would
meet the financial gap of CNCA. CNCA would thus finance almost 40% of the
foreign exchange cost of the Project from its own resources; this would be
essentially indirect foreign exchange and would not present any difficulties
for CNCA, which has provided about half of the foreign exchange cost for in-
vestments it financed during the period 1971-75. Subborrowers would finance
29% of the Project cost as their own contributions. The Government would
provide small investment grants almost exclusively to Cooperatives and asso-
ciations; these grants would amount to only 3% of the total Project Cost.
They are considered reasonable and would not introduce any serious distortion
in the investment pattern.  In addition, the Bank Loan would finance the cost
of the monitoring fellowships for CNCA and the foreign exchange cost of the
applied research program for ORMVASM, while the Arab Fund loan would finance
the foreign exchange cost of the consultants' services to CNCA.

E. Procurement
5.15      The range of goods to be financed under the Project is varied and
would not be suitable for bulk procurement; contracts vould be far too small
to warrant competitive bidding advertised internationally. Foreign suppliers
of machinery are well represented in Morocco, necessary service facilities
are available, competition is keen and prices are competitive. Subborrowers
would therefore purchase agricultural equipment of their choice through
existing local channels. Dairy farm development would require procurement
of incalf heifers, most of which would come from Government or private farms.
However, should more than 75 heifers be imported under any sub-loan, quota-
tions from suppliers from at least three countries would be sought. Experts
and researchers (60 man-months) required under the applied research program
for ORMVASM have been selected according to the Bank guidelines for contract-
ing consultants' services. Goods and consultants' services financed by the
Arab Fund loan would be awarded under the Arab Fund procurement rules.
F. Disbursement (Annex 7)
5.16      The Project commitment period is for two and one-half years (January
1977 - August 1979) and CNCA's disbursements to subborrowers would be in ac-
cordance with the phasing of individual subproject development. The Bank Loan
would be disbursed in about 3 years. The Bank would reimburse CNCA against
certified statements of expenditures for 27.5% of subloans disbursed under
Parts A, D and E. However not more than $5.6 million would be disbursed from
the Bank Loan for subloans under these three parts, as long as the changes
in financial charges and lending policies mentioned in Chapter VI have not
been implemented; these changes would take place not later than September 1,
1977. Documentation for the statements of expenditures would not be sent to
the Bank but would be retained by CNCA for review by supervision missions.
The Bank would also reimburse CNCA, against full documentation, for 100% of
the expenses under Part F. The Bank would reimburse CNCA, against full
documentation, for 100% of the foreign exchange cost under Part H, and CNCA
would in turn relend these funds to ORMVASM under a formal lending agreement
at terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Retroactive financing to
November 22, 1976, up to $100,000 would be allowed under Part H to ensure an
early start for the research program. Funds remaining in any category at the
end of the Project could be reallocated to other categories if necessary for
use under Project activities. Parts B, C and G would be financed by the Arab
Fund.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization & Management
6.01      CNCA would be the Borrower and carry out the Project.  The Ministry
of Agriculture would assist CNCA as required. Assistance by the Ministries



- 19 -
of Finance and the Interior and by the Central Bank may also be provided if
required.   Part A of the Project would be carried out by the CLCAs, Parts B
and E essentially by the CRCAs and to a small extent by Headquarters; Part D
would be executed essentially by Headquarters with some decentralization to
the CRCAs and Part C by Headquarters through the ORMVAs and the SPs. Parts F
and G would be carried out by CNCA and Part H by ORMVASM.
6.02      The Government and CNCA have undertaken to maintain the competitive-
ness of the compensation system of CNCA staff with other comparable institu-
tions, including commercial banks; this should allow CNCA to recruit and retain
the additional well qualified staff it needs for the future expansion of its
operations. The Government has also undertaken to assign to CNCA an adequate
number of newly graduated agricultural staff. The Arab Fund will negotiate
with CNCA terms of reference for consultants to assist CNCA in two aspects of
its operations: banking development (including measures to increase deposits
collection) and training (including possibly the creation of a Training
Institute for Agricultural Credit). These terms of reference would be subject
to Bank approval.
B. Lending Policies & Procedures
Lending Procedures
6.03      Existing lending procedures of CNCA are generally adequate.  Speci-
fic changes would be needed for loans to Cooperatives. Existing satisfactory
procedures would be maintained and the changes in policies, procedures and
financial charges outlined below would be implemented by CNCA at the latest on
September 1, 1977, the beginning of its fiscal year and the start of the crop
year.
6.04      CLCA Borrowers.  The appraisal of CLCA subprojects will be improved
and upgraded to the CRCA level only gradually through a significant increase
in the number of agricultural staff assigned to the CLCAs. The financing
ratio (annual principal repayment to fiscal income 1/) increased in September
1976 from 35% to 50%; it can be estimated that, as a result, CLCA borrowers
have now 70% of their investment cost financed by credit, like all other CNCA
borrowers. Since the fiscal income parameters are constant (para. 2.08) the
financing ratio would be reviewed periodically in view of the price increases
for investment goods and of the resources available to the CLCAs.
6.05      Cooperatives.  The present appraisal procedures by CNCA of Coopera-
tives' investment projects would be decentralized to the CRCA level to the
extent feasible so that an adequate appraisal could be made by the CRCA staff
in direct relationship with the Cooperatives for which it is responsible.
6.06      To correct the present deficiencies in the provision of credit to
Cooperatives (para 3.08) the following schedule would be adopted:
1/   See Annex 2, para 42.



- 20 -
_____--------------Years---------------------
age of the Cooperative        1       2        3       4        5       6 & older
percent of financing of
- short term inputs        100%     80%      ----------- norm ----------------
- new investments          100%    100%      100%   100%     80%      norm
- replacements             --------------------- norm -----------------------
The norm is defined as the financing norm (usually 70% of cost) that would
apply to an individual farmer in the same location for the same activity or
investment at the same time, according to the lending regulations. In 1977/78
about half of the Cooperatives and associations would be 6 years old or older.
6.07      Individual HQ/CRCA Borrowers, Regional Land Development Agencies
and Provincial Offices, and Associations: The lending procedures applying
to these categories of borrowers are adequate. All lending regulations are
revised every year to take into account price increases and policy orienta-
tions. Significant changes in these lending regulations (such as a lengthen-
ing of maturities on subloans) would need the concurrence of the Bank.
Financial Charges
6.08      CLCAs.  The present system of financial charges on CLCA loans (para
3.05) is attractive because of its simplicity and low operating cost and should
therefore be maintained. However, the present bias against medium-term loans
with shorter terms for which charges are higher would be corrected by intro-
ducing differentiated fees. The average charge for medium-term loans would
also be increased from about 6.5% p.a. to about 7.7% p.a. 1/ Short-term
rates would be at least equal to medium-term rates. The amount available in
the CLCA Guarantee Fund being too high compared to the risk of non-repayment,
it would not be necessary any more to pay the initial fee into the Guarantee
Fund; both the initial fee and the annual fee would be paid to income. Pro-
visions for the Guarantee Fund would have to be made from income each year
as required.
6.09      In the future the fee levels would be reviewed annually on the basis
of CLCA's income forecasts with a view towards gradually phasing out the
Government operating subsidy to the CLCAs. The CLCAs would not be able to
operate in a financially viable way in the near future, but as a first step,
during the disbursement period of this Loan, the forecast income should be
equal to at least 77% of the forecast expenses, thus limiting the forecast
Government subsidy to 23% maximum of the forecast expenses. 2/ When the
1/   This reference rate being the average rate (including penalty interest
and administrative fees) on all CNCA operations (excluding CLCAs) for
the year 1975/76.
2/   These ratios being those actually attained in the year 1975/76.



- 21 -
Government subsidy would be forecast to exceed these ceilings, the CLCA fees
would be increased to prevent this occurrence. This is likely to happen in
the fiscal year 1979/80. The actual Government subsidy would cover in any
case the actual loss of the CLCAs.
6.10      Cooperatives & Associations.  Medium-term loans to Cooperatives and
associations now bear a rate of 7% p.a. This rate would be increased to the
rate applied to individual borrowers, i.e., 8.5% p.a. However, since members
of newly-created Cooperatives and associations are just making the transition
from the traditional to the modern sector, this increase should be gradual:
-----------------Years--------------------
Age of Cooperative or association   1          2      3       4      5   6 & older
Minimum interest rate p.a. on
medium-term loans                  7.0%    7.0%   7.0%   7.0%   8.0%  8.5%
6.11      Regional Land Development Agencies and Provincial Offices.  Loans
to ORMVAs and SPs bear a rate of 8% p.a. These rates are satisfactory and
would be maintained. The loans made by the ORMVAs and SPs to the individual
farmers, if short-term, are charged a flat 5% commission, regardless of
duration and, if medium-term, bear a rate of 8.5% p.a.
6.12      HQ/CRCA Rates.  The present basic interest rate of 8.5% p.a. for
medium-term loans to individual farmers is adequate. It is in line with
interest rates charged in other sectors of the economy, it is higher than the
forecast inflation rate of about 7% p.a. over the life of the Project and it
allows CNCA to cover costs and make a reasonable profit. It would therefore
be currently maintained. All HQ/CRCA rates would be reviewed annually on the
basis of income forecasts and would be adjusted as needed to ensure continued
profitable operation of CNCA. With its current rates CNCA is likely to be
profitable up to 1982.
Short-Term Credit
6.13      CNCA would ensure that subborrowers under the Project would have
access to short-term credit on appropriate terms for input financing.
Financial Covenants
6.14      As safeguards, CNCA would respect two financial covenants:  (a) that
medium- and long-term debt (including deposits of over 12 months) would not
exceed 4 times equity, and (b) that current assets would be at least 120% of
current liabilities. According to financial projections, no problems in meet-
ing these covenants are foreseen.
C. Monitoring & Evaluation (Annex 8)
6.15      Not only should the internal and external reporting system of CNCA
be improved, but CNCA should also set up a monitoring and evaluation system



- 22 -
as described in Annex 8 to measure on a selective basis the effects and the
impact of its lending. This would allow CNCA management to use this informa-
tion as a feedback into its own policies, especially for the annual revision
of lending policies. It would also serve as an on-going evaluation of the
performance of the Project and its conclusions would be discussed with the
Govenment who would use them as an input into its agricultural policy. A
draft proposal would be submitted to the Bank by March 1, 1977 and the system
should be implemented by September 1, 1977. Part F of the Project would
provide funds for fellowships for CNCA staff to visit agricultural institu-
tions in other countries with efficient monitoring systems. If it proves to
be necessary, employment of a monitoring consultant would also be financed by
the Loan under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
D. Accounts & Audit
6.16      CNCA has a satisfactory accounting organization and management in-
formation system. Audit arrangements under the Second Project were satisfac-
tory. CNCA would continue to have its accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and to send the auditors' annual report to the Bank
within five months of the end of its fiscal year.
VII. BENEFITS & JUSTIFICATIONS
A. Production & Marketing
7.01      Investments under the Project (together with other concomitant in-
vestments, such as irrigation expansion) are expected to generate the following
production at full development (about Year 10 of the Project): (quantities in
thousands of tons)
% of Future                               % of Future
Total Moroccan                            Total Moroccan
Quantity   Production                     Quantity    Production
Grain             440         12           Olives              1
Pulses             50         il           Grapes              1           -
Cotton             25         90           Vegetables        150          20
Sunflower          20         90           Cow's milk        380          50
Sugar beet      2,000         90           Sheep's milk       17         50
Sugar cane        450         90           Beef               15          20
Citrus             20          2           Mutton             12          20
This production would be worth about DH 1.5 billion in current prices.



- 23 -
7.02      Since the Project would cover practically all of Morocco's agricul-
tural credit, the problems of marketing the production under the Project will
be those facing Moroccan agriculture in general. To a large extent the in-
creased production will imply reduced imports especially for grain, oil seeds,
sugar, meat and milk. About half of the vegetable production would be ex-
ported; Morocco has a strong competitive advantage on the European market and
is developing exports to countries other than France under the recent market-
ing treaty with the EEC. Citrus production may be somewhat more difficult
to export, but the incremental production under the Project would represent
only 2% of total production; the same would be true of olives and grapes.
Meat production would essentially be for the domestic market, where consump-
tion patterns are changing significantly toward a better diet as a result of
the rise in incomes.
B. Financial Benefits (Annex 4)
7.03      The financial results for representative farm models under the Proj-
ect are given in Annex 4. The calculations are based on Moroccan prices for
the spring of 1976 for both inputs and outputs. The financial rates of re-
turn for the models vary between 14% and 25%. The sensitivity analysis yields
the following results: if investment costs were raised by 10%, the financial
rates of return would vary between 12% and 24%; an increase in operating ex-
penses of 10% would result in financial rates of returu between 7% and 24%;
and if revenues were to drop by 10%, the rates would range from 4% to 22%.
Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out for some models with respect
to a reduction in the income from milk, a lower rental rate of a combine
harvester, delays in reaching full development for a citrus plantation and a
reduction of the income from exported vegetables. These rates of return show
that the proposed investments under the Project would be financially attrac-
tive to sub-borrowers.
C. Economic Benefits (Annex 10)
Employment
7.04      The Project would generate substantial employment benefits.  An es-
timated 20,000 man years of additional family labor would be generated mostly
because of livestock investments. Similarly, about 10,000 man-years of tem-
porary labor and 10,000 permanent jobs for agricultural workers would be
created.  The average investment cost per man-year would therefore be about
DH 26,800 (US$6,200) in constant prices. However, some investments such as
tractors and combine harvesters would reduce employment on a per unit basis,
but tractors would increase indirect employment and combine harvesters would
be justified because of seasonal shortage of labor at harvest time (Appendix
1.1). These investments appear therefore justified economically. Sizeable
employment opportunities generated through the additional investments, the
additional input use and the increased production via backward and forward
linkages have not been quantified.

Beneficiaries
7.05      The number of CNCA borrowers is estimated to increase as follows
under the Project:
Pre-Project /1    (1/1/77)        End-Project /2      (8/31/79)

/3   Only 4% of the 100,000 to 125,000 farmers borrowing short-term are
expected to apply for medium term loans.
/4   Double counting eliminated.
About 350,000 farmers would borrow under the Project and thus improve their
productivity and their income significantly.  About 140,000 farmers (40% of
total) would be below the absolute poverty level (US$1050 per family equivalent
to DH 1350 fiscal income 1/): 50% of the CLCA clients, 50% of the Cooperative
members and practically all the association members. About 120,000 farmers
(34% of total), mostly CLCA clients and new Cooperative members, would never
have had access to credit before.
7.06      By the completion of the Project (August 1979), credit would reach
about 24% of CLCA potential clients instead of the present 15%, 67% of HQ/
CRCA potential clients instead of 58% now, and practically all the members
of Cooperatives and associations and all the farmers borrowing through com-
prehensive industrial crop programs. Credit would reach about 41% of all
eligible farmers (i.e. those with a fiscal income above DH 100) or 20% of all
Moroccan farmers. Credit coverage would be lower for farmers in the lower
income strata:  less than 3% of the farmers having a fiscal income between DH
100 and DH 300 (CLCA clients) would have access to credit, and only about 15%
1/   Taking into account the fact that about 25% of family income is not
earned on the farm.



- 25 -
of those in the range DH 300 to DH 800. The farmers having a fiscal income
below DH 100 (i.e. 1 ha or less of poor rainfed land or two cows), the land-
less farmers and most of the farmers on collective land, would practically
not have any access to credit. For those farmers at subsistence level, num-
bering between 850,000 and 1,000,000 in total, agricultural credit may not be
the proper answer to their needs: its provision is costly and it implies an
integration into the financial and economic circuit, that these farmers are
not yet able to achieve. Specially designed rural development projects would
probably be better adapted to their needs.
Project Benefits and Risks
7.07      The economy is expected to realize a return of 29% from total Proj-
ect investments (Annex 10). A sensitivity analysis was applied to test the
Project against changes in investment costs, operating expenses and produc-
tion results. By increasing investment costs and operating expenses alter-
natively by 10%, the rate of return of the whole Project would drop to 25%
and 15%, respectively. By decreasing the value of the benefits by 10%, the
overall return would drop to 11%.
7.08      Several risks could affect the outcome of this Project.  They are
discussed in the context of the conclusions and recommendations of the OED
Report on Agricultural Credit Programs 1/. First, as in any agricultural
project, the major risk would be the occurrence of severe adverse climatic
conditions, namely droughts, that would affect drastically the yields of
farmers borrowing under the Project and thus reduce the economic justification
of their investments. Historical pattern tends to show that a severe drought
will occur once in a decade in Morocco, that the period 1968-1973 was unusual
in this respect, and that the occurrence of a drought one year out of five
should not be implied. Yield assumptions in the farm models are averages for
farmers likely to borrow; they are based on a detrimental historical pattern
of good and bad years and are very conservative. The relatively low (but
still acceptable) rate of return of the Project in case of decreased benefits
is due to this conservative assumption; such an unfavorable outcome is not
very likely. Second, there is the risk of a drastic change in the national
agricultural policies of the Moroccan Government, such as, for example,
radical changes in the system of prices and subsidies that would render
investments under the Project economically unviable. On the basis of the
conclusions of the recent sectoral survey, such a radical change is very
unlikely because of the Government's present policy to streamline the subsi-
dies system and to eliminate incentives for investments that would not be
economically justified. Third, the economic justification of the investments
under the Project is based on the existing availability to the farmers of a
technical package, in addition to credit, and especially of extension service.
The assumptions on technological change under the Project are conservative,
being based on presently applied techniques and inputs and on the rather
average quality of this extension service (CNCA staff being however the main
1/   Report no. 1357 issued November 18, 1976.



- 26 -
source of technical advice on livestock matters, at least to HQ/CRCA clients).
The extension service needs to be strengthened, and such an improvement would
result in faster technological change, and thus higher output than assumed.
Should the quality of the extension service deteriorate from its present
condition, the economic justification of the Project may suffer. However,
such a deterioration is very unlikely in view of the past and present trends
of improvement of the extension service. Fourth, CNCA is a financially viable
institution, thanks in part to the financial support it receives from the
Government. It is therefore financially quite dependent (but operationally
very independent) of the Government. Termination of this Government support
is totally unlikely, but the Government may require CNCA to undertake costly
programs, such as a very fast imprudent expansion of its CLCA network.  While
this is not entirely impossible, CNCA financial viability would be safeguarded
by the covenants requiring it to raise its financial charges accordingly
(paras. 6.09 and 6.12). This risk is therefore limited. Fifth, actual
farmers' preferences may differ from those assumed now and the outlook of the
Project would therefore change. The overall increase in production under the
Project would be more the result of an intensification of farm operations,
than of an expansion, for which there is limited scope in Morocco, and this is
unlikely to change. Some substitution of Project funds for other funds would
undoubtedly occur, reducing somewhat the incremental impact of the Project; an
overall substitution rate of 10% to 20% would appear more reasonable and more
in line with general data available (Annex 5, Table 1) than the rate of 25% to
50% reported by OED for the first Project. All these risks appear therefore
rather limited and would not affect significantly the viability of the Project.
The Project would be "promotional" and introduce some improvement in farm tech-
nology with respect to only some of the subborrowers, namely the Cooperatives
and associations' members, the farmers borrowing through ORMVAs and SPs and
most of the CLCA clients; it would not achieve such objectives as far as the
HQ/CRCA clients are concerned.
7.09      The Project would further result in non-quantifiable institutional
benefits to both agriculture in general and CNCA in particular:
(a) The Project would support institutional building within CNCA;
it would also provide funds for technical assistance to CNCA,
thus helping to improve substantially CNCA performance as an
agricultural credit institution.
(b)  The Project would contribute to the strengthening of Coop-
eratives and associations by helping to set them on a sounder
financial basis.
(c)  The Project would provide funds for applied horticultural
research in the Massa region and thus help support the
development of production in this irrigation system.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACRED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      To ensure successful Project implementation, the following major
assurances were obtained during negotiations:
(a) CNCA would maintain a competitive compensation system and
the Government would provide CNCA with sufficient qualified
agricultural staff (para 6.02);
(b)  CNCA would introduce new lending policies and procedures
and new financial charges, as outlined in paras 6.03 to
6.12; and
(c) CNCA would set up a monitoring and evaluation system to
measure the impact of the Project (para. 6.15).
8.02      A special condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank Loan would
be that the new lending policies and procedures and the new financial charges
be approved by the Administrative Council of CNCA.
8.03      The Project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$35 million
equivalent to CNCA for a term of 13 years with three years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MOROCCO
The Agricultural Sector 1/
A. General Description & Performance
General
1.        Morocco has a total land area of 50 million ha. 2/  Cultivable land
in Morocco during the 1970-75 period totaled 7,635,000 hectares, of which
5,285,000 hectares were sown; 1,780,000 ha were fallow and 565,000 ha were
fruit tree plantations. Winter crops, mainly wheat, barley, broad beans and
sugar beet, represent 82% of the sown lands, while summercrops account for
only 18%. Rainfed lands are equally distributed between high rainfall areas
of more than 350 mm of rain per year and low rainfall areas of less than 350
mm of rain per year. In the low rainfed areas, only grain is grown, mainly
barley and a small amount of pulses. Fallow varies from one year to the
next, becoming larger when the rainy season starts late.
2.        The modern sector, including the State farms (SODEA, SOGETA, etc.)
accounts for about 1.5 million ha (20%) of which 900,000 ha are sown lands,
200,000 ha are plantations and 400,000 ha are fallow. The traditional sector,
covering most of the farmers, accounts for 6 million ha, of which 4 million ha
are sown lands, 400,000 ha are plantations and 1.6 million ha are left fallow.
3.        Most of the cultivated lands are west of the Atlas and Rif mountains.
The climate resembles the Mediterranean type in the North. Aridity increases
towards the South, becoming desert-like with only oasis-type agriculture east
of the Atlas mountains and in the extreme south. Out of 7.6 million cultiva-
ble hectares, irrigable lands represent about 12%; most of the industrial
crops, forage crops, vegetable crops and citrus plantations are grown under
irrigation which provides almost all exports of agricultural products. Rain-
fed land, 88% of the cultivable land, mainly produces grains, legumes, and oil
seeds plus olive trees and vineyards. Livestock is mainly cattle, sheep and
goats; intensive livestock raising is the exception, mainly for milk and meat

Survey.

production near the consumer centers.  However, its development during recent
years has been increasing.
4.        Agriculture contributes between 25% and 30% of the Gross Domestic
Product depending upon the year's results: 2/3 from crops and 1/3 from live-
stock. Value added accounts for 75% to 80% of production. Agricultural ex-
ports (including processed products) accounted for about 50% of exports until
1973; due to the increase in phosphate prices, this proportion decreased to
about 22% of total exports.  Imports of agricultural products account for
about 25% of total imports.  The trade balance in agricultural products was
positive until 1973 (1.5-1.9 coverage'depending upon the years) but was nega-
tive in 1974 (0.73 coverage) and 1975 (0.5 coverage).  Total investment in
agriculture is unknown but planned investment by the central Government (in-
cluding regional development projects) accounts for 20.6% of total investment
(6% of total being for hydraulic works); actual central Government expendi-
tures amounted to 29% of total for 1973 and 1974. The growth rate for agri-
culture is lower than for the overall economy, essentially because of the low
grain yields in the traditional sector.
5.        In 1971 (last census) 9.8 million people out of 15.2 million
Moroccans (65%) lived in rural areas; the growth rate of the rural population
was 1.6%, compared to the national average of 2.4%. 47% of the rural popula-
tion was 15 years and younger.
6.        The rural labor force amounted to 2.6 million (65% of total) of
which 5% were officially unemployed (9% at the national level). Almost 2 mil-
lion people were employed in agriculture (55% of total employed) including
670,000 as family help. They were divided among the following activities.

7.        More detail on production and trade is available in the Agricultural
Sector Survey (see also Table 1).
Comprehensive Crop Programs
8.        Sugar beet, sugar cane, cotton and sunflower belong to the compre-
hensive crop programs.  The Regional Land Development Agencies (ORMVAs) for
irrigated perimeters and, to a smaller extent, the Provincial Offices of the



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Ministry of Agriculture (SPs) for rainfed land (or land irrigated from wells)
are responsible for managing these programs. They provide seeds, fertilizers,
extension, mechanization services to the farmers who have to follow technical
directives from the extension agent, especially in respect to their cropping
pattern. All production has to be sold to the processing plants at a guaran-
teed support price. Hybrid corn production on irrigated lands is also under
such a program.  Alfalfa and, in the Souss-Massa region, early tomatoes and
other vegetables are also covered by similar programs (but their prices are
not guaranteed). Short-term loans for these crops are provided by CNCA,
through ORMVAs and SPs, which are responsible for recoveries by deduction from
the payments to farmers for their production.  In a few cases (establishment
of sugar cane and alfalfa plantations), medium-term loans are also provided by
CNCA in the same manner.
Development Objectives
9.        The major objective of the 1973-77 plan is to sustain a real GDP
growth of 7.5% per year. This would be accomplished mainly through a fast
rise in exports and a large increase in investments. The main objectives for
agriculture are:
(1) to increase locally-consumed agricultural production in
order to reduce imports of agricultural products;
(2) to increase the per capita revenue for rural population
by increasing the speed with which irrigated lands al-
ready equipped are put under irrigation and
(3) to speed up rainfed agriculture and livestock development.
Such targets require a strong emphasis on agrarian reform, more technicians
in the agricultural sector, development of agricultural research, extension
and agricultural credit, improvement of marketing both for local markets and
for export and higher prices for agricultural products.
10.       In March 1974, the King expressed strong criticism of the Ministry
of Agriculture for having increased the irrigated areas by only 20,000 ha per
year, and he assigned a new target of 45,000 irrigated hectares per year with-
out modifying the emphasis on assistance to rainfed farming and livestock
raising. As a result, a Department of Infrastructure was created in August
1974 in the Ministry of Agriculture to be responsible for the progress of
irrigation projects. In November 1974, the King decided upon the adoption of
a sugar plan and of several measures to increase oil seed production, so as to
reduce imports of these two commodities. In order to implement the policy
directives outlined by the King, the 1975 finance law greatly increased the
budget appropriation for agriculture, bringing total appropriations under the
plan from DH 2.23 to DH 3.57 billion; at the same time, the budget appropria-
tion for the Department of Hydraulics in the Ministry of Public Works was in-
creased from DH 0.60 to DH 1.48 billion.  Another Government measure designed



ANNEX 1
Page 4
to encourage agricultural production was an increase in farmgate prices. The
Agricultural Sector Survey provides a detailed analysis of the conditions for
further agricultural development.
Organization
11.       Government activity in the agricultural sector is the primary respon-
sibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MARA). There are
also several state-owned companies responsible for agricultural and livestock
production. One of the most difficult problems is the lack of qualified
agricultural technicians and engineers; a large-scale training program is
underway.
Extension
12.       The technical centers responsible for agricultural development and
extension work are the "Centres de Travaux" (CT) in the rainfed areas (Bour
lands) and "Centres de Mise en Valeur" (CMV) in the irrigated perimeters. The
CTs are regrouped in each Province under the Provincial Office (Services Pro-
vinciaux-SP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and the CMVs are in each irrigated
perimeter under the Agricultural Land Development Agency (Office Regional de
Mise en Valeur Agricole-ORMVA). There are 78 CTs covering 20.1 million ha
(258,000 ha on the average, but ranging from 24,900 ha near Taza to 2.5 mil-
lion ha near Figuig) and about 180 CMVs covering 500,000 irrigated hectares
(2,780 ha average) plus a small amount of rainfed land. As irrigated land
is more intensely cultivated and given a higher priority, CMV staff is pro-
portionally more important than CT staff. The higher density of staff in
CMVs compared to CTs is also due to a greater work load in the CMVs because
of the comprehensive crop programs (sugar beet, sugar cane, cotton, sunflower
and hybrid corn) (see para 8); most of these crops are grown under irriga-
tion.
13.       Agents of the CTs and CMVs, in addition to their work under the
comprehensive crop programs, are responsible for extension work, sale of
selected seeds and fertilizers, sale of small equipment, and provision of
subsidies. They also provide mechanization services. These different opera-
tions represent an important aspect in the role of the extension agents; they
lead to closer contact with the farmers, a pre-requisite to extension work.
Selected seeds could represent a large contribution to agricultural develop-
ment, mainly for wheat and barley production (75% of cultivated land) but
their impact on production has not yet been perceived. During the last five
years, CTs and CMVs have been developed and equipped and a real improvement
has been achieved due to closer contacts with the farmers. More centers and
more equipment are necessary, both on irrigated and on rainfed lands, to in-
crease extension impact on agricultural production; in the same manner,
stronger action for selected seeds is needed in order to have a real effect
on Moroccan production.

Farmers' Associations for Mechanization
14.       Farms too small to justify ownership of a tractor may obtain mech-
anization services from extension centers, from custom operators or from
large farmers. Since 1968, they may also form pre-cooperative groups for
joint ownership and for use of a tractor and its implements (also in a few
cases a combine harvester). 383 such groups had been created by end 1975
with 2,800 members (143 groups with 1,370 members under CMVs and 240 groups
with 1,430 members under CTs) most of them (75%) created before 1971. Only
about 260 of those received credit (an average of DH 31,000 per group) and
about 210 are still in existence. Each group had on the average 7 members
(actually between 4 and 32 members), the average land per farmer being 16.7
ha rainfed and 4 ha irrigated land. The 383 groups had acquired 351 trac-
tors, 254 plows, 346 disk arrows and 19 combine harvesters. The groups are
usually created at the instigation of the extension agents. The groups
receive a subsidy from the Government and a loan from CNCA (72% of cost at 7%
interest rate, versus 70% of cost at 8.5% for individual farmers). Joint
ownership of equipment creates problems in priority of use, and the number of
groups created is relatively low. Despite the reluctances of farmers and the
difficulties in creating such groups, it seems necessary that more emphasis
be given by the Ministry of Agriculture to the creation of new groups and
that more extension agents be assigned to this task. The forecast of 218
groups to be created in 1976 seems highly unrealistic.
Prices & Subsidies
15.       To encourage agricultural production, farmgate prices for the most
important commodities are either fixed or are above a fixed support price.
Prices are revised each year. In 1975-76 the fixed price for sugar beet was
raised from DH 76 to DH 96 per ton, for sugar cane from DH 59 to DH 65 per
ton, and for sunflower seed from DH 90 to DH 130 per quintal.  For fresh milk,
the price was raised from DH 0.67 to DH 0.85 per liter during the peak produc-
tion period from February to July and to DH 0.95 during the low production
period from August to January. Cereal prices were substantially raised; the
fixed price of bread wheat was set at DH 60 per quintal, and the support price
for durum wheat, which can be bought and sold directly, at DH 63 per quintal.
16.       The Government has to spend very largè amounts to maintain low con-
sumer prices (especially wheat, sugar, edible oils and butter) while guarantee-
ing prices high enough to producers. DH 2.1 billion were spent for this pur-
pose in 1975. A significant transfer of resources thus takes place from the
general taxpayer to consumers, i.e., essentially to the urban population. In
view of the unfavorable terms of trade of agriculture vis-a-vis industry. im-
portant subsidies are also paid for inputs, especially fertilizers. Subsi-
dies are paid as well for investments mostly to cooperatives and groups (com-
bine harvesters 20%: tractors, implements and most other agricultural ma-
chinery 30%; small implements 50%; imported cows 20%) and to individual



ANNEX 1
Page 6
farmers (pickup balers, mowing machines, sprayers, seeders 20%; small imple-
ments 50%). Other subsidies are also paid when investments for land conser-
vation, pasture improvement, orchards and others are undertaken, but these
are paid as working capital subsidies. The impact of these subsidies remains
to be assessed as well as their distribution among subsectors and classes.
(see Appendix 1.2).
B. Farmers' Incomes & Agrarian Reform
Land Distribution
17.       Data on farmers' income and land distribution is doubtful and some-
times incoherent. Land distribution is skewed, but there are practically no
latifundia: less than 0.5% of the farms are above 50 ha, accounting for 10%
of the land.

Land Ownership
18.       The Moroccan land tenure system is quite complex. One can dis-
tinguish:
(i) "melk" land: private land. The farmer may have a modern or a
traditional land title.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
(ii)  collective land:  the land belongs to the collectivity as a
whole, but the right to farm the land belongs to individuals
who have a medium-term lease (2 to 5 years). Almost all range
lands are collective lands.
(iii)  "guich" land:  the land belongs to the collectivity as a whole,
but it is given under long-term leases to veterans, former
court servants and the like. Guich land is mostly around the
cities.
(iv)  "habous" land:  the public habous land (waqf) has been given
to a religious charitable institution by an individual and is
rented to farmers. The private habous land will revert to the
religious institution when there are no more male descendents
of the donator; in the meantime, it is farmed by the family.
(v) State land: this is the private land of the State (as opposed
to the land of the collectivity and to the private land of the
King). It includes the land confiscated from foreigners.
(vi)  other lands:  this includes land owned by private companies,
land owned by Moroccan Israelites and others.
Land Tenure
19.       There are essentially three types of farming:
(i)  direct farming by the land owner; this is quasi-compulsory on
irrigated land under the ORMVAs.
(ii)  tenant farming:  a fixed rent is paid by the farmer.  This is
the case essentially on State and public habous land.
(iii)  sharecropping is done in three different ways:
(a)  Khobza:  the absentee landlord forms an association with
one or several sharecroppers to work on his farm; they
share the crop in a proportion fixed in the contract.
The Khobza sharecropper may himself employ a Khammes share-
cropper.
(b)  Khammes:  the landlord provides seeds, fertilizers, water
and sometimes draft animals and implements; the share-
cropper often provides draft animals and implements and
receives one-fifth of the crop. Usually the landlord
farms part of his land himself and gives the rest to a
Khammes.



Page 8
(c) Due to the shortage of labor, the Khammes systern has
evolved into a new system in the case of labor-intensive
activities such as livestock and vegetable cultivation,
whee the sharecropper is a foreman providing his own crew
and receiving one-fourth of the crop.
Employment & Poverty Level
20.       About 1.3 million farms (68%) do not employ any salaried labor, but
only family labor; 92% of these are below 10 ha. About 125,000 farms (6.5%)
employ 190,000 permanent workers (1.5 per farm). 32% of the farms employ
seasonal labor for 80.5 million working days (81% male, 19% female). 676,000
farms (35%) do not market any output; 93% of these are below 10 ha. These
676,000 farms can be assumed to be at the subsistence level, not integrated
into the economic circuit, not generating any cash and probably unable to
have access to credit.
21.       On the basis of the 1970-71 income survey, the absolute poverty
income level in 1975/76 was estimated at $1050 per family.
Fiscal Income
22.       The actual income of farmers is always very difficult to estimate.
In Morocco the tax authorities have devised a fiscal income, which is a no-
tional income computed on the basis of the land, the number of heads of live-
stock and the fruit trees owned by the farmer, and whether land is rainfed or
irrigated, cultivated in a modern or in a traditional way. Norms per hectare,
per head or per tree are applied for each commune on the basis of soils, rain-
fall and climate. Each year the tax authorities make a census of the assets
of each farmer and compute its fiscal income (on the basis of which tax is
paid, see para 24). This income is different from the.real income partially
because some improvements in the farmers' economic conditions are not regis-
tered (e.g., purchase of 2 mules instead of renting them, or chicken breed-
ing), partially because the norms are averages not taking into account a
farmer's productivity (thus encouraging him to be more productive by not tax-
ing him more)--but mostly because the norms are underestimated and have not
been changed since 1963. 1/  This is in line with the policy of not taxing the
agricultural sector too much. It can be estimated that the fiscal income is
about 40% of the real income for the farmers having a fiscal income below DH
3,000. The fiscal income criteria is used by the CLCAs for determining loan
amounts (see Annex 2 para 40).
1/   Also it doesn't take into account non-farm income (about 25% of total
family income for farmers below poverty level).



ANNEX 1

23.       The average fiscal income for all farmers is about DH 1,000.  By
size of holdings, the fiscal income is approximately:
Cultivable Land (ha)                         Average Fiscal Income
0                                             200
0-   5                                          770
5 -  10                                       1,500
10 -  20                                       2,400
20 -  50                                       4,350
50 - 100                                       9,300
above 100                                     31,500
Thus it can be assumed that CLCA clients (below DH 3,000) are farmers with
less than about 15 ha of cultivable land.
24.       The tax rates are very low as a result of the deliberate policy of
not taxing heavily the agricultural sector.

above  DH 120,000                                20%
The highest tax rate on personal income is 36%.  The agricultural tax has
yielded a fairly stable amount varying between DH 63 million (1960, 1968) and
DH 35 million (1966) in eurrent Dirhams (average 1960-1975 DH 47.6 million).
The agricultural tax has declined in relative importance: total direct taxes
increased from DH 242 million in 1960 to DH 2,736 million in 1975; total cen-
tral Government current revenue increased from DH 1,250 million in 1960 to
DH 8,538 million in 1975. The agricultural tax, which accounted for 26% of
direct taxes and 5% of total Government revenue in 1960, had decreased to
1.5% of direct taxes and 0.5% of total Government revenue by 1975.
Agrarian Reform
25.       The Agrarian Reform Program 1/ took shape as a response to the grad-
ual nationalization of land held by foreigners. Its objective is to reverse
the past trend towards increasing fragmentation of holdings through land con-
solidation and to redistribute lands expropriated from previous owners, there-
by encouraging investment for agricultural development. The basic idea of the
1/   See Economic Report 329-MOR (February 7, 1974) pages 68-74 for a more
comprehensive coverage.



ANNEX 1
Page 10
Program is to distribute private State land to landless agricultural workers
or subsistence level smallholders and to organize them in small cooperatives.
26.       At the time of Independence, there were more than 900,000 ha of
mostly prime and technically well-managed agricultural land in the hands of
foreign settlers (627,000 ha "melk" private lands acquired from Moroccan
landowners, 250,000 ha "colonization lands", i.e., former collective land
sold at low prices to French settlers, and 31,000 ha "APJ-SEG" land allo-
cated without charge to French settlers and to a company). After Independ-
ence (1956) foreign owners sold back about 300,000 ha of private "melk" land
to Moroccan farmers until this was regulated in 1963, the purpose of the regu-
lation being to ensure that the private transfer did not exclusively benefit
the well-off Moroccan farmers and to keep a stock of land for later distribu-
tion to poor farmers.  Between 1956 and 1960 the 31,000 ha of "APJ-SEG" land
were recovered and distributed to small farmers (first phase). Between 1963
and 1965, 220,000 ha of "colonization land" were recovered and managed by a
state agricultural company (CGEA) which was to be financed under the First
Agricultural Credit Project; in 1966, this land was turned over to the prov-
incial authorities. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1966 (second phase) provided
for the distribution of this land (and of some "habous" land), which was
finished by 1973 except for plantations which are managed by SODEA. A 1973 law
provided for the recovery of the remainder of the foreign-held land (about
360,000 ha); the bulk of this land was entrusted to SOGETA (which was created
for this purpose), but plantations were given to SODEA. A new land reform law
(1972) provided that this land should be distributed to poor farmers (third
phase).
27.       Out of about 611,300 ha recovered, 267,750 ha have been distributed
(as of early 1976); 69,950 ha are managed by SODEA and 85,000 ha by SOGETA.
The remainder (about 188,600 ha) is either under temporary arrangement with
the Ministry of Agriculture (of which 35,000 ha are rented to Moroccan farmers
and 1,200 ha are rented to the former owners) or with other agencies or com-
panies such as COMAGRI or agricultural schools (about 100,000 ha total). The
5-year plan calls for distribution of 400,000 ha by the end of 1977. About
20% of the land distributed so far is irrigated.
28.       Beneficiaries of the Agrarian Reform must be Moroccans, work as
small farmers or wage-earning farm workers, be less than 45 years old and
natives of the region, or at least 5-year-old residents of the commune in
which beneficiaries are chosen for land distribution; their revenue must be
lower than the revenue of the plot they will receive. Beneficiaries must
surrender any private land they own and abandon their rights on collective
lands; the land they surrender increases the private State lands to be redis-
tributed. Most of the beneficiaries are farm workers or sharecroppers. As
a rule, all beneficiaries come from the poorer stratum of rural society and
are living at subsistence level. Each beneficiary buys his plot on credit
(20 years of which 3 years of grace), the repayment is indexed on the price
of bread wheat (700 to 750 Q per plot). Until the price is fully paid, the



ANNEX 1
Page 11
lot is mortgaged to the benefit of the State. Lots cannot be divided or
sold except to the State. Only one heir can inherit the lot, but he must
compensate other relatives. Plots are sufficient to provide an income of DR
4,000 a year in the beginning; this income should increase to DH 10,000 after
10 years. Plots range from 10 to 25 ha in rainfed land and from 4 to 7 ha in
irrigated land. There have been about 18,000 beneficiaries (14.7 ha average
per beneficiary) so far.
29.       Beneficiaries have to be organized in cooperatives; there were 534
cooperatives existing at end January 1976, or an average of 33.4 members and
500 ha per cooperative. Each cooperative elects a president and an adminis-
trative council; in addition, it receives the assistance of an agricultural
technician, who is its director. Due to lack of staff, there is sometimes
only one director for 3 or 4 cooperatives. The cooperatives are theoretic-
ally in charge of providing inputs (seeds, fertilizer) and mechanization
services (about 480 tractors and 40 harvesters were owned by cooperatives in
September 1975) and selling output; their director provides exension services
to the farmers. In fact, not all cooperatives are well organized; the rela-
tionship between farmers and director is not always very good, and some coop-
eratives are limiting their operations to the provision of mechanization
services. The farmers do the procurement as well as the marketing by them-
selves, individually. The cooperatives, in any case, are not large enough
(even with a target membership of 50) to generate a volume of sales suffi-
cient to defray overhead costs and the directors are paid by the Ministry of
Agriculture. The limit to the size of cooperatives is often due to the
medium-size of the recovered farm which can sustain no more than 35 to 50
families.
30.       Each cooperative is supposed to prepare its own plan outlining its
production and investment needs, both for itself and for its members. These
plans are revised and modified at each level of the Ministry of Agriculture
hierarchy and finally aggregated and presented to CNCA for financing.  The
cooperative members do not have access to credit individually. Short-term
needs are financed by credit at 100% the first year, 80% the second year, 60%
the third, 40% the fourth, 20% the fifth and are not financed thereafter.  In
case of a bad harvest, however, the financing ratio of the previous year is
applied. Medium-term needs are financed at 100%; although it is said that
replacement of equipment will be financed at 50%, this has not occurred yet,
even though the older cooperatives are 10 years old. Investment usually con-
sists of draft animals and small equipment for the members the first or second
year, and of a tractor and its implements for the cooperative the second or
third year. Livestock and other investments are financed in following years.
CNCA appraisal is rather cursory, except in the case of unusual investments
such as a second tractor or a collective stable. This credit system recog-
nizes the total lack of funds of cooperatives and their members during their
first few years of existence, but it is irrational since all the older co-
operatives' own funds are used for their short-term needs and ineffective
since the farmers who no longer have access to short-term credit decrease



ANNEX 1
Page 12
their use of inputs and/or have to borrow from non-institutional channels at
usury rates. All loans are guaranteed by the Agrarian Reform Fund, which is a
Treasury fund consisting of the repayments of land by the beneficiaries (these
repayments are not paid through CNCA, but through the tax system). Many loans
(36% of total) committed at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture are
never disbursed to the cooperatives due to changing needs. Recoveries are
usually good.
31.       The Agrarian Reform Program has been considered a priority in the
Agricultural Sector and it has received a significant amount of resources in
money and in personnel. Its first objective, to abolish foreign ownership of
land, has been accomplished. However, its impact on rural poverty has been
negligible: at the end of 1977, if the plan target is achieved, there will
be at most 40,000 beneficiaries of the Agrarian Reform Program which would
represent at most 4% of the landless workers and sharecroppers and subsis-
tence level (less than 7 ha rainfed) farmers. The distribution of land owner-
ship in Morocco being unequal, the Agrarian Reform Program has made but a
small correction to this unequal distribution. The main result of the Agrarian
Reform land distribution has been to create a rural middle class, whose income
will be relatively high by rural standards and who will owe its status to the
Government. The cooperatives' organization will probably need to be revised,
their size enlarged through mergers, and their autonomy strengthened (coopera-
tives' unions have already been created in two provinces, Fes and Meknes).
Under this Project, their financing system would already be revised.
32.       In the longer run, Morocco will have to envisage stronger measures
to achieve more equal distribution of land, and first of all, some distribu-
tion of private land held by large landowners. Considerable difficulties,
both political and technical, would certainly arise in preparing and imple-
menting a large redistribution program and the Government is very conscious
of those. In the meantime, other measures to improve the distribution of
growth benefits are implemented or planned. They include first those that
are specific to rural areas: improvement of pastures and livestock produc-
tion in the traditional sector, programs for integrated rainfed cropping
(e.g., Meknes Project), promotion of small-scale production of fruits and
vegetables for export and village development work programs.   They also in-
cludes measures benefitting the urban poor since poor rural families migrate
to cities and national measures such as a more progressive system of income
taxation and the introduction of inheritance taxes and land taxes, and in-
creased social services. However, their impact will be relatively limited
and it is likely that, short of redistributing land on a massive scale, the
distributional and poverty problems facing Morocco will ouly be solved grad-
ually in the long run.

The Agricultural Sector
Mechanization and Employment
A. Tractors
Introduction
1.        Traditionally, all farming work was performed by human labor.  Pro-
ductivity and output were factors of the human energy applied to the land.
Then man learned how to apply technology to increase the impact of human
energy, e.g., man and the hoe; invention of the harness allowed the combina-
tion of man and draft animals. Mechanization of Moroccan grain farms dates
back to the 1920s and a substantial number of tractors were imported before
World War II, mainly by European settlers. Extensive dry land grain produc-
tion was possible on large farms, tractors were used to break the heavy soil
and prepare the land in time to take advantage of the relatively short rainy
season. Intensification and diversification of agriculture have broadened
the use of tractors, on both irrigated land and rainfed land under modern
agricultural cultivation. The use of tractors has been spreading from the
modern to the traditional sector, from large to medium and small farms.
2.        A recent rural census indicates that about 31.4% of all farms did
not use draft animals or tractors, but supposedly only human labor (73% of
those farms have no cultivable land and 25% have less than 5 ha cultivable
land); 52% of all farms used draft animals only (78% of those have less than
5 ha cultivable land and 14% have between 5 and 10 ha) and 16.6% of all farms
used tractors and other mechanical equipment (11.4% use only tractors and
5.2% use both tractors and draft animals). The breakdown of farms using me-
chanical equipment in proportion to the total number of farms was as follows:

Tractor Supply and Population
3.        Average annual sales of tractors for five-year periods since 1950
were as follows:
Years                         Average Annual Tractor Sales
1950-54                                  1,217
1955-59                                    880
1960-64                                    525
1965-69                                  1,363
1970-74                                  1,697
The high sales in the 1950-54 period were mainly to European settlers.  After
Independence a public sector mechanization program was launched, involving
replacement of machinery on farms taken over from European settlers by CGEA
(about 500 tractors of which about half were financed under the First Agri-
cultural Credit Project) and purchase of machinery for customs work by the
extension centers, CTs and CMVs (Annex 1, para 12); by 1967, these extension
centers had about 1,000 tractors (15% of total).  Since 1967, the Governnent
has reduced its public sector purchases and sales to private farmers and
private custom operators have risen substantially.
4.        A machinery census was made in 1969/70.  The number of agricultural
tractors in operating condition in 1970 was estimated to be 10,200, 20% of
which were more than 10 years old and 14% 5 to 10 years old. In 1976, the
number of tractors working for agricultural purposes can be derived from the
1970 data, from the number of tractors purchased after 1970 and from the as-
sumption that in 1976, only one out of 6 existing tractors is more than 10
years old, compared to one out of 5 in 1970.

5.        There are many tractor suppliers in Morocco.  Tractors are im-
ported either as such or in parts and then assembled in Morocco. All of the
big international manufacturers are represented in Morocco and tractors are
imported from the U.K., Sweden, the Soviet Union, East and West Germany,
France, Italy, Romania, Spain and possibly other countries. Competition is
active, and prices are thus kept low (prices are under the control of the
Ministry of Agriculture). After sales service is adequate and covers all the
territory in Morocco.
6.        Assuming a tractor is able to work over 80 hectares on the average,
the 18,500 existing tractors will work over 1.5 million ha and the remaining
4 million ha will be prepared with draft animals. In 1974, the draft animals
were:
mules                      764,000 heads
camels                     100,000 heads
donkeys                    876,000 heads
cattle, part of the    4,000,000 heads
horses                     232,000 heads
Mules are the main draft animals in Morocco; assuming a working capacity of
12 ha for each pair of mules and 3/4 of the mules working for land prepara-
tion, 286,500 pairs of mules will prepare 3.4 million ha. The remaining 0.6
million ha are prepared by both camels and donkeys and some cattle used as
draft animals. Horses are used only for transportation and prestige, and not
as draft animals.

Projected Demand
7.        Tractor purchases have been forecast until 1981-82 on the basis of
replacement of existing tractors (and progressive disappearance of tractors
more than 10 years old) and of the need for new tractors for irrigated and
rainfed land. As for the replacement of existing tractors, the life of a
tractor is assumed to be 10 years although it greatly depends upon the driver
and the mechanic's experience; it is also assumed that by 1980, the number of
tractors more than 10 years old should be less than 5%. The number of re-
placement purchases is therefore estimated at:

8.        Of the 10,200 tractors existing in 1970, almost 4,000 were used on
irrigated land.  For each irrigated perimeter a norm of average land per
tractor can be computed ranging from 29 ha in the Gharb, the Loukkos and the
Souss-Massa to 100 ha in the Doukkala and 120 ha in the Haouz, with an aver-
age of 75 ha (excluding the Tafilalet and Ouarzazate perimeters, where no
tractors are used). On the basis of the forecast land to be irrigated, the
need for new tractors can be determined for each irrigated perimeter (exclud-
ing Tafilalet and Ouarzazate):

The decrease in the average land per tractor is due to the relative import-
ance of the three perimeters where use of tractors is the most intensive
(more than 50% of future irrigated land).
9.        On rainfed land, it is more difficult to forecast the number of new
tractors to be purchased; rough estimates are:
Agricultural Year                        Number of Tractors
1975-76                                     200

1977-78                                     240
1978-79                                     265
1979-80                                     285
1980-81                                     210

Total                                  1,640
10.       The total number of tractor purchases for Morrocco is therefore
forecast at:

CNCA will finance about half of these tractors.  Of these, the Project would
finance 2,120 tractors in 1977, 1978 and the first eight months of 1979.
11.       As a result the number of tractors in 1982 would be 26,800 as fol-
lows:

The purchases would have resulted in a significant improvement in the age of
tractors, 58% being 5 years old or less versus 47% in 1976. It can be esti-
mated that at most, 25% of all farms would by then use mechanical equipment.
Effects of Tractor Cultivation: Microeconomic Approach
12.       Farmers have tried to meet their draft power needs by using trac-
tors for several reasons. Draft animals can be used only for a short period
of time but their maintenance costs (fodder) throughout the year are high
and diverted from other productive livestock, while tractors require operat-
ing expenses (fuel, etc.) almost only when operated. The use of tractors
also enables better land preparation, especially if rains are late and
ploughing and cultivation must be undertaken when the soil is dry and hard.
For each crop there is an optimum period for sowing, which is at the end of
November for winter grain crops, the end of April for cotton and September
for berseem; any delay in the sowing period will reduce the expected yields



AJE1`X 1
Appendix 1.1
Page 7
and this factor is one of the main constraints for rainfed areas, which must
await rainfall before they can be ploughed and sown. In 1974-75, the rains
started only on January 5, which reduced wheat and barley production in
large rainfed areas. One of the main advantages of irrigation is to allow
for sowing at the best period.
13.       Aside from timeliness, the quality of land preparation with trac-
tors is superior to that obtained with draft animals and traditional imple-
ments. With animal power alone, large areas cannot be planted at all in
years of drought and late rain. Also, in critical periods, a tractor can be
worked 24 hours per day, thus allowing high flexibility in peak periods while
animals cannot work more than 8 hours per day. To quantify the advantages of
tractor on draft animals for land preparation, experiments would be necessary,
but an increase of 2 to 5 quintals of grain per hectare can be expected. An
even greater increase in yield can be anticipated with advanced technology
using a high fertilization rate and weed, pest and disease controls. Such ad-
vanced technology would be worthwhile only in irrigated lands and good rain-
fed areas such as the Fes and Meknes provinces.
14.       On rainfed land, much of the land currently used for mechanized
grain production would probably revert to extensive grazing of livestock if
tractors were not available. The high risks and low returns inherent in
traditional animal-power cultivation are not likely to keep such land in
cereal production without tractors. On irrigated land, tractors could allow
also for double-cropping, essentially of maize due to timeliness of land pre-
paration. Tractors can also be used for transport. From the farmer's view
point, it is clear that use of a tractor is a preferred alternative to use of
draft animals (see Farm Model 6 Annex 4).
Effects of Tractor Cultivation: Macro-economic Approach
15.       It is clear that all the farmer's benefits of using a tractor are
translated into economic benefits. Higher productivity of land, extension
of cultivated land, shift to higher value crops, higher yields and smaller
weather risks result in higher crop production; the release of fodder normal-
ly used by draft animals results in higher livestock production. The ques-
tion, however, is whether these benefits are balanced by the costs of mechan-
ization and especially what the impact of tractors is on employment.
16.       Direct Employment Impact.  It is clear that the use of tractors
result in higher productivity of labor, thus reducing labor preparation and
seeding when measured on a per unit basis (per ha or per ton of output).
However, the larger area cultivated and the higher yields obtained - thanks
to mechanized cultivation - and the resulting higher output, increase the
direct on-farm labor requirements. Labor is also still required for other
activities. The following table shows the labor requirements in both cases.

17.       Indirect Employment Impact.  Indirect employment is generated in
several ways. First, employment is created in the supply and maintenance of
tractors either in the cities (e.g., assembly workers) or in rural areas
(e.g., mechanics). Second, the increased production will generate additional
work for provision of inputs and for transportation and marketing of output
and through the multiplier effect on overall employment levels. Also, annual
fluctuations of employment levels resulting from the risk of leaving large
areas in fallow in case of drought and late rains will be eliminated. Final-
ly, the additional fodder released from draft animals will increase livestock
production and thus employment in the livestock subsector. It should also be
noted that, if, without tractors, rainfed grain farm land would revert to ex-
tensive grazing land, this would have a significant negative effect on labor.
18.       Labor Supply.  In Morocco as a whole, there is distinct unemploy-
ment in urban areas; but the rural areas are mainly affected by underemploy-
ment while there are severe seasonal labor shortages in agriculture during
seasons of peak agricultural activities, especially harvest and seeding.  So-
cial constraints and the fact that peak demand for labor occur more or less
at the same time in all the grain producing areas have limited possibilities
of large-scale irrigation to meet these demands. As a result, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to find available labor at certain periods and sala-
ries during these periods have increased significantly (see para 30). Mechan-
ization of land preparation and seeding reduces the peak demand for labor for
these operations.
19.       Conclusion.  Unfortunately, the statistical data base of Morocco
is not good enough to allow for a comprehensive study of the issue and most
benefits and costs are difficult to quantify. It is only tentatively that
one can express the conclusion that, in the Moroccan context, tractor mechan-
ization does not have a negative but quite possibly a positive impact upon
employment. However, as an illustration, a small case study has been made

for the area covered by an extension center (CT) near Oued-Zem in rainfed
grainland (see paras 32-35).
Tractor Technology
20.       Tractor technology is generally adequate but could be improved.
Too much emphasis is placed on the offset disk for land preparation; it pro-
vides a quick but superficial land preparation inappropriate to improved
technology. Deep ploughing, at least for row crops such as sugar beet, cot-
ton, maize and sugar cane, would be more profitable.
21.       An excellent agricultural machinery school has been set up in
Bouknadel with bilateral German assistance, graduating 50 technical agents
every year; such a school will progresively improve the competence of me-
chanics working in the Agricultural Sector. The main deficiency is the lack
of experiments for land preparation. Land preparation is poorly done. The
Agricultural Research Department has a central station responsible for better
growing methods (Station Centrale des Ameliorations Culturales); most of the
181 different experiments concern fertilization, best growing period, density
of plantation, etc. Only 8 experiments deal with land preparation It would
be useful to start a practical research program to investigate tillage me-
thods and to design implements suitable for Morocco, but this may prove to be
difficult within the present organization of agricultural research.
B. Harvesting Machinery
Introduction
22.       Mechanical grain harvesting has initially been developed in regions
of dry land farming with low rainfall, low and uncertain yields, large fields
and difficulty in attracting large numbers of workers for short periods. Ex-
amples are found in large, semi-arid areas of the Soviet Union, Australia,
Canada or the US, where nearly all cereals are harvested mechanically. Since
physical conditions are somewhat similar in North Africa, it is not surprising
that grain harvesters, introduced by the former European settlers, have spread
throughout the commercial part of the agricultural sector.
23.       It is assumed that to be economically viable, a harvester needs to
be used on at least 100 ha: there are about 3,600 farmers owning or farming
more than 100 ha of arable land in Morocco. With some allowance for custom
operators, the maximum potential number of harvesters can be estimated at
3,600. Due to the existing land tenure, this number is not likely to change
much in the near future unless the development of custom work expands very
fast.

Combine Supply and Population
24.       Annual sales of combines for the past ten years were as follows:
Year                      Number
1966                         81
1967                         56
1968                        366
1969                        257
1970                        184
1971                        209
1972                        226
1973                        125
1974                        150
1975                        170
1,824
Exceptionally high sales in 1968 are due to the record grain harvest for the
year; similarly, since 1973 was a bad harvest year, the number of purchases
decreased significantly.
Projected Demand
25.       A combine needs to be replaced every 9 or 10 years.  Replacement
purchases, usually made in the spring, would therefore number:
Agricultural Year          Number of Replacement Purchases
(CNCA Fiscal Year)
1975-76                              160
1976-77                              230
1977-78                              250
1978-79                               140
1979-80                               160
1980-81                               190
1981-82                              240
Total                     1,370
26.       On the average, replacement purchases account for 75% to 80% of
all sales. New farms are being equipped with harvesters so that by 1982
about 62% of all eligible farms will use harvesting machinery (compared to
50% in 1975). The first purchases of combine harvesters can be forecast at:

1976-77                           70
1977-78                           70

Total                415
27.       The total number of combine harvester purchases would therefore be:
Agricultural Year              Number of Purchases
(CNCA Fiscal Year)
1975-76                           210
1976-77                           300
1977-78                           320
1978-79                           180
1979-80                           210
1980-81                           245
1981-82                           320
Total               1,785
CNCA would finance between 50% and 70% of these (or a total of 1,085), 285 of
which would be refinanced by the Project during the period 1977-79.
Effects of Mechanical Harvesting
28.       All the combines purchased for replacement would not result in any
displacement of labor. In theory, the already-mechanized farins could revert
to hand harvesting. On such farms, however, it would be impossible to mar-
shal the labor force required to harvest on a timely basis. With traditional
grain harvesting of 100 ha, a farmer who would procure 10 to 12 laborers at
harvest time (he would have no employment for them the rest of the year)
would need 100 work days (115-140 calendar days) to complete the harvest.
Even more work days would be needed in the years to come since harvest will
occur during the fasting month of Ramadan. This would greatly exceed the
period of optimal maturity, and harvest losses through waste, birds, insects
and rodent damage would be excessive. To be able to harvest in two weeks (12
working days), 85 to 100 workers would be needed. Since all grain mature
during the same short period, and because of social constraints preventing
migration from the cities to the country-side, few farmers reverting to hand
harvesting could mobilize sufficient manpower for the harvest season.
29.       In the case of farms purchasing a combine harvester for the first
time (usually farms having rented one before), the free capacity of the



ANNEX 1
Appendix 1.1
Page 12
rental harvester could be used on farms which previously relied upon hand
harvesting. In this case, some displacement of seasonal labor would occur.
It can be estimated that each combine harvester would displace about 3,000
working days (60 people for 50 days).
30.       The shortage of labor in agriculture at peak periods, especially
during harvesting, mentioned above (para 18) has become dramatie over the re-
cent years due to increased migration to the cities or to Europe for want of
better jobs and salaries. While the average agricultural salary for men is
DH 6.5/day, at harvest time such salary increases to DH 25 to 30/day, plus
four meals a day. Migration occurs, especially from the mountainous regions
(where crops mature later) to the central grain region. Due to the shortage
of seasonal labor, not only do prices increase but the seasonal laborers are
able to impose their conditions for food and accommodation. As a result, an
increase in the number of combine harvesters would appear justified in view
of the shortage of labor (see case study below).
31.       The principal advantage of a combine harvester is the reduction of
losses and improvement of quality, as compared to the traditional harvesting
and threshing methods. Harvesting takes place during the high summer heat,
and delayed or slow harvesting results in serious losses. Losses and damage
due to animal trampling are also eliminated. This reduction of losses can be
estimated at 100 kg of grain per hectare as a minimum.
C. Case Study: Oued-Zem
32.       This case study concerns the area covered by the extension center
CT 10.07, located in Boujad near Oued-Zem in the central grain-producing re-
gion of Morocco. Tables 2 and 3 give the basic data concerning the 332,679
ha and the 26,000 farmers in the area. A distinction is made between inten-
sive, semi-intensive and extensive farms. The farm size distribution is as
follows:
Farm Size              Cultivated Land             %
(Ha)
0 -   5 ha                10,798                 7.1
5 -  10 ha                22,312                14.8
10 -  20 ha                42,712                28.3
20 -  50 ha                46,020                30.4
50 - 100 ha                22,000                14.6
above 100 ha                7,330                 4.8
151,172              100.0



ANNEX 1
Appendix 1.1
Page 13
33.       Labor requirements per crop with and without mechanization are
given in Table 1. Livestock necessitates one permanent shepherd per family.
Tractors and combine harvesters are utilized on intensive farms; tractors and
sheaf-binding harvesters are utilized on semi-intensive farms (in addition to
draft animals). Only draft animals are used on extensive farms. The working
capacity of each family is one shepherd and one working man (25 working days/
month) all year round.
34.       Table 4 shows the monthly labor requirements for crop cultivation
(livestock excluded). Since the labor utilization coefficients are average
for one month, additional labor may be necessary for a few days during the
month when the coefficient is above 85%. Thus about 519,000 man days of ad-
ditional labor are needed, almost all on intensive or semi-intensive farms
only. About half of the labor requirement (259,000 man days) may be met by
additional family labor or transfers of labor between farms in the region (it
is only in June that the region as a whole has a deficit of labor). About
260,000 man days would be missing, all of them in July -- 125,000 in inten-
sive farms and 135,000 in semi-intensive farms. This deficit: can be met by
the employment of seasonal labor (10,000 laborers at least) or by the pur-
chase of more combine harvesters. In fact, only about 8,000 laborers were
forecast to be available in early June 1976, and therefore 20 more combine
harvesters would have been needed for a timely harvest.
35.       As for tractors, the shortage of labor in the fall is not large
enough in itself to justify an increase in the number of tractors, since
the number of draft animals is sufficient for cultivation of the land (al-
though barely so in the case of semi-intensive farms); thus more tractors
would not displace seasonal labor, but would increse the underemployment
of farmers in the area.

APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MOROCCO
The Agricultural Sector
Agricultural Marketing
1.        The Moroccan market for agricultural products is representative of
the mixed economy in which it operates. Domestically, it presents a combina-
tion of free market forces and State controls. Generally speaking, the State
will exert control on certain market elements (quality, price, distribution)
for products which are considered of primary importance to the economy
(grains, pulses, milk, meat). Crops whose transformation process require
heavy capital investments will have all their market elements being control-
led by the State. These are the so-called "industrial crops" such as sugar
beet, sugar cane, cotton, sunflower, etc. Controls are exerted through a
variety of Governnent institutions which have generally been set up along
product lines. These agencies will report ultimately to the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Agrarian Reform but are in fact relatively independent. A farmer
can thus find himself dealing simultaneously with several agencies which pre-
sent little cooperation among themselves.  Secondary crops such as fruits and
vegetables are not submitted to much control.
2.        The export markets for most products fall completely under the con-
trol of the Governnent-run Export Trade Company (Office de Commercialisation
et d'Exportation - OCE). This agency carries out product quality controls,
makes shipping arrangements and markets the produce abroad.
Domestic Market
Grains and Pulses
3.        The market for grains and pulses is free but the channels of dis-
tribution are regulated by the Cereals and Pulses Trade Office (ONICL -
Office National Interprofessional des Cereales et Legumineuses). All produc-
tion is sold at the local market to registered wholesalers, retailers, or
flour mills. (Some leakages are nevertheless inevitable.) In the case of
cooperatives, output is sold directly by them--or several growers may form
their independent marketing cooperative and sell directly to the public, pro-
vided they register with ONICL. This Office also regulates inventory levels
of millers, growers, wholesalers and retailers 1/ and it levies a tax on the
1/   Cereals remain one of the Moroccan farmers' favorite hoards.  Five-year-
old stocks of wheat or barley are not uncommon.



ANNEX 1
Appendix 1.2
Page 2
sale of all grains and pulses. ONICL also handles all imports and exports of
grains and pulses.
4.        In recent years, supply has not kept up with demand.  The rapidly
expanding population and the increased needs of a growing livestock herd have
not been met by a parallel increase in the production of wheat and maize.
Morocco is self-sufficient in durum wheat but the fragile equilibrium between
supply and demand is endangered by climatic fluctuations. This situation has
put the price of durum wheat under considerable upward pressure. For maize
and bread wheat, the deficit has been increasing. Although ONICL expects the
country to reach self-sufficiency in maize by 1980 (which would be feasible
only on irrigated land), more than 1 million tons of wheat will have to be
imported by then.
5.        Prices are freely set by the market forces.  The Government never-
theless sets support prices for wheat, barley and maize. Should the market
price fall below these prices, the farmer can sell this produce directly to
the local SCAM office (Societe de Commercialisation Agricole Marocaine--
Moroccan Agricultural Marketing Society). In recent practice, however,
prices for barley, maize and durum wheat have been persistently higher than
the support prices.  Those for bread wheat at harvest time have generally
been lower than support prices. The SCAMS have thus become the main outlet
for the output of bread wheat. Support prices and market prices are shown in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Industrial Crops
6.        Sugar Beet.  Demand for sugar has grown continuously, as have im-
ports. Only 50% of domestic consumption is met by local production. The
market is state-controlled. All output has to be sold to the local sugar re-
fineries at a pre-established price which varies according to the sugar con-
tent of the beet. Each farmer maintains an account with the refinery which
is credited with the proceeds from his sales and debited with the value of
the working capital allowance extended to him (mostly in kind) by the ORMVA
(Office Regional de Mise en Valeur) at the beginning of the year. Repayment
of other outstanding debt connected with this crop which the farmer may have
is also deducted from his account.
7.        Sugar Cane.  The market for sugar cane is organized by the Govern-
ment. All output is sold to the two existing refineries at fixed prices.
The first crop was harvested in 1975 and farmers have been somewhat reluctant
to engage in it due to their lack of familiarity with it, to the difficulty
of timely harvest and to difficult climatic conditions (flooding, frost).



ANNEX 1
Appendix 1.2
Page 3
8.        Cotton.  Cotton production peaked in 1965 and then declined until
the early seventies due to competition from sugar beet, irregular payments
to the farmers for their crops and difficult parasite control. Production
increased again to 27,000 tons in 1973, and then dropped to 17,000 tons in
1974 and 1975 in spite of efforts by the Government to increase production.
The market is totally controlled by COMAPRA (Compagnie Marocaine de Commer-
cialisation des Produits Agricoles - Moroccan Company for Marketing of Agri-
cultural Produce). The Government created this company in 1962 and remains
a majority shareholder. It purchases, transport, stocks, gins and processes
raw cotton. All cotton is sold at a set- price to COMAPRA mills and the
farmer receives the proceeds of his sale less any outstanding debts to ORMVA.
Until recently, the administrative procedure was much slower and late pay-
ments often forced the farmer to sell on the local market at a discount.
Citrus
9.        The market for citrus is free.  Exports, however, make up the
largest share (70%) of citrus plantation and are controlled by OCE (see
para 17). Fruits not meeting export standards are sold on the local market
at relatively low prices. Crops are sold to traders, processors or packing
centers either "on the tree" or by the ton. Some growers have gathered to
operate their own packing stations.
Vegetables
10.       The market for vegetables is free and distribution channels are
patterned in the same manner as are citrus. Exports are handled through
OCE and seconds are sold locally, along with the crops not qualifying for
export due to their variety or their timing (summer tomatoes, e.g.). Seconds
can also be sold to processing plants in the case of tomatoes (concentrate),
carrots, beans and peas (canning). Little data is available on the domestic
marketing of vegetable and citrus as this area is entirely in the hands of
the private sector.
Milk
11.       Milk output has increased substantially over the past three years
due in part to the importation of dairy cows. As a consequence of this in-
crease and in order to promote local production, Government established im-
port controls on dairy products. Supply nevertheless falls short of demand
and imports of 16,000 tons of powdered milk remained necessary in 1975.
12.       In addition to family consumption, there are two major outlets for
milk production: street vendors and pasteurizing plants. These parallel
markets represent approximately 40% and 60% of total marketable output, re-
spectively. Street vendors can either be independent or organized in small



ANNEX 1
Appendix 1.2
Page 4
groups who will collect milk at farms located close to the urban centers.
In addition, eight pasteurizing plants located throughout the country 1/
purchase their milk from market cooperatives or from independent farmers
under contract. Numerous collection centers have been set up by the Govern-
ment where the farmer can bring his milk to be sold and tested for fat con-
tent. This alone has greatly increased the marketable supply of milk.
Processing plants produce pasteurized milk, buttermilk, yogurt, butter and
cheese.
13.       Prices on the "street" market are free.  On the "processed" market,
however, the Government sets the price to be paid the farmer on a monthly
basis.  In order to promote local production and to minimize seasonal fluc-
tuations in output, this price is inflated by a subsidy paid to the process-
ing plants. This subsidy fluctuates between 16% and 36% of the farmgate
price, depending on the month. Producer prices since 1975 have varied from
a low DH 0.80/liter during the high production months of May and June to DH
1.05/ liter in December. The non-subsidized price remains constant at DH
0.67/ liter throughout the year. The production of butter is subsidized as
well.  Plants received between DH 2.03/kg and DH 2.28/kg in 1975, which al-
lowed them to lower their sales price from DH 9.50/kg to approximately DH
7.40/kg. Milk processing plants are presently operating at approximately 55%
capacity and can easily absorb projected increases in milk output.
Meat
14.       Meat remains under strong demand and prices have been rising over
the past few years. Few statistics are available regarding the amount of
meat marketed or its price. Cattle and sheep can be sold either at the local
market, to local municipal slaughterhouses or to the Government-inspected
slaughterhouses located in Casablanca and Rabat. In 1974, wholesale meat
prices in Casablanca averaged DH 4/kg for beef, DH 5.50/kg for mutton (live
weight). In 1976, data collected from interviews allowed to estimate live
weight prices of beef and mutton at approximately DH 5.50/kg and DH 7/kg,
respectively.
Export Market
15.       Moroccan agricultural exports amounted to DH 2,168 million in 1974
versus DH 2,923 million imports. Agricultural exports were mostly made up of
citrus (32%), fresh tomatoes (15%), olive oil (12%) and other vegetables (16%).
The coverage ratio of exports to imports has been steadily declining from 1.8
in 1969 to 1.5 in 1972 and 0.55 in 1974 due to the world price increases for
most imported food products (bread wheat, sugar, milk, seed oils, etc.) which
were not met by similar increases in the prices of Moroccan exports.

16.       As much as 40% of all agricultural exports in 1974 were purchased
by France. Italy, which is Morocco's second largest customer for agricultural
produce, followed with only 11% of exports. Altogether, 68% of Moroccan agri-
cultural exports went to the EEC. In order to de-emphasize it:s dependency on
the French market, Morocco has persistently been seeking preferential treat-
ment with the EEC as a whole. Its first agreement with the Common Market was
signed in 1969 and a second agreement was concluded in January 1976. Morocco
still enjoys a privileged treatment with France for products such as tomatoes,
potatoes and citrus juices. The uniform EEC scheme will nevertheless replace
this privileged treatment by 1979. According to this scheme, which will
shortly go into effect with other EEC countries, Morocco has been granted
tariff concessions on potatoes, tomatoes, fresh beans and peas, grapefruit
and grapes among other commodities. Import duties on oranges vary between
0.8% and 4% depending on the season (see Table 3). Most dried pulses can be
imported into the EEC duty-free and duties on winter vegetables range from
4.4% on tomatoes to 9.1% on artichokes. Minimum import prices (EEC reference
prices) apply to most important products such as oranges, tomatoes, wine and
citrus juices.
17.       OCE is responsible for exporting most agricultural products, such as
citrus and vegetables. It purchases citrus at a fixed price directly from the
farmer. It then has it tested for quality and size and either returns, rejects
to the grower or sells them for him at the local market. Export quality fruit
is crated at the packing station and shipped. OCE is responsible for all ex-
port procedures as well as for selling the fruit on the foreign market.
18.       For vegetables, OCE acts as the farmer's export agent.  The grower
brings his produce to the nearest packing station where it is tested and
packed. These stations can be either cooperatively owned by the growers or
privately owned by third parties. Each station has a permanent OCE employee
who is responsible for quality control. The vegetables are sold abroad under
the brand name of the packing station. OCE sets up an account for the grower
which is debited with the packing charges paid by OCE to the station on his
behalf (at nationwide rates set by OCE).  The farmer is responsbile for bring-
ing his packed produce to the OCE office at the nearest port where shipping
arrangements are made for him. His account is further debited with the ship-
ping charges and remains overdrawn until the shipload is sold on the foreign
market.  This form of credit is extended to OCE to promote exports.  The
farmer receives payment at the going price received for the complete ship-
load on average one month after having delivered his products to OCE. Unlike
citrus, where OCE purchases the fruit directly, transfer of property for
vegetables takes place at the foreign port between the buyer and the farmer,
with OCE acting as his agent.
19.       Although some farmers, particularly large citrus growers, would
prefer to let private enterprise take over to allow for a more aggressive ex-
ploration of export markets, it seems that OCE has performed relatively well.
It has been able to establish valuable contacts with buyers through its for-
eign offices and has ensured a consistent quality for Moroccan exports while
at the same time simplifying administrative procedures for the producers.

A. Background & Organization
Background
1.        Between 1956, the year in which Morocco gained independence, and
1962, the year of the establishment of CNCA, agricultural credit to larger
farmers and companies was provided by commercial banks and Government insti-
tutions. Credit to farmers with a taxable income of up to DH 1,400 was made
available through provident and agricultural credit societies (SOCAP) 1/.
Another significant but unknown portion of agricultural credit was extended
by moneylenders and merchants.
2.        In order to stop the decline in agricultural lending which had oc-
curred in 1960 and 1961, the Government established a new credit system with
CNCA and its branch offices, the Caisses Regionales de Credit Agricole (CRCAs).
In this system, the CRCAs handled the credit needs of the larger farmers and
the companies, and the Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole (CLCAs) and the
SOCAPs provided credit to the small farmers. Previous agricultural credit
institutions were dissolved and their assets were (and are still) managed by
CNCA. Although the legal basis for the establishment of the CLCAs was al-
ready formed in 1961, the first CLCAs were only set up in 1967. With a grow-
ing number of CLCA offices throughout the country, the SOCAPs were dissolved
beginning in 1972-73, and the former SOCAP clients were taken over by newly-
formed CLCAs. This phase of transition was terminated in 1975.
Constitution & Objectives
3.        CNCA and its regional branch offices, the CRCAs, were established
by Royal Decree No. 1-60-106 of December 4, 1961. This same decree plus
Decree No. 2-61-607 declared the foundation of CLCAs as autonomous credit
institutions.
4.        The objectives of CNCA are to promote agriculture in Morocco by
making available credit for agricultural inputs, investments and marketing
1/   Societes de Credit Agricole et de Prevoyance.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
to individuals, farmers' groups, cooperatives and companies. In pursuance
of these objectives, CNCA annually prepares and implements arn agricultural
credit program on a country-wide basis. This program has to be approved by
the Administrative Council of CNCA and finally by both the Minister of Agri-
culture and the Minister of Finance. In order to achieve these objectives,
CNCA was set up as a public institution with its own legal entity, finan-
cial autonomy and under the administrative responsibility of the Minister of
Agriculture. Consequently, the Minister of Agriculture is ttLe Chairman of
the Administrative Council, the policy-making body of CNCA, which combines
in itself the authorities and responsibilities that would be executed by both
the General Assembly and the Board of Directors in a private enterprise.
There are 21 additional members in the Administrative Council: four from the
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform or institutions related to it,
three designated by the Ministry of Finance, two designated by the Minister
of the Interior, one representative of the Bank of Morocco and eleven farmer
representatives from various provinces of the country. The General Manager
of CNCA participates in all meetings of the Administrative Cauncil but has
no voting power. The list of all members of the Administrative Council is
set out in Table 1. According to the Decree, the Administrative Council has
to meet once annually for an ordinary meeting and can be convened for extra-
ordinary meetings upon request of its Chairman, or one-third of its members
or the General Manager. It is responsible for the general organization and
the functioning of all agricultural credit institutions. At the annual meet-
ings its main tasks are:
-    approving the annual program for agricultural credit for the
entire country;
-    approving the lending regulations for the various categories
of credit and credit beneficiaries;
-    accepting the annual financial statements of CNCA as prepared
by the Management Committee and submitted to the Minister of
Finance for approval;
-    charging the Management Committee with the appraisal and ap-
proval of loans within the framework of the annual credit pro-
gram and the lending regulatins;
-    authorizing the General Manager to borrow funds;
-    elaborating personnel regulations within the limitations of
those in effect for public institutions;
-    approving the financial statements of CLCA and determining
its lending regulations;
-    delegating specific authorities and powers to the Management
Committee.

5.        CNCA's Management Committee is composed of eight members with the
General Manager as its Chairman. Other members are representatives of the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the In-
terior and the Central Bank of Morocco. The meetings of the Management Com-
mittee are convened by the Chairman or three of its members whenever the
necessity arises. It has permanent authority to appraise and approve loans
within the norms and regulations set up by the Administrative Council.
6.        The Bank of Morocco as the central bank has representatives with
voting power in the Administrative Council and in the Management Committee of
CNCA. But the Bank of Morocco has no means of direct intervention into CNCA's
operations other than through these members of CNCA's policy-making bodies.
CNCA also has a large degree of independence in determining its interest rate
structure. Its interest rates are determined by its Administrative Council
and not by the "Comite du Credit et du Marche Financier", as is the case for
the other commercial banks and financial institutions of the country.
7.        The General Manager of CNCA is the Chief Executive and its official
representative to the Government, to all public and private institutions and
to other third parties. He is appointed and dismissed by Royal Decree, upon
joint proposal of the Ministers of Agriculture and Finance. He is responsi-
ble for the functioning of all CNCA operations and is empowered to appoint
the CNCA personnel with the exception of the financial comptroller, who is
nominated by the Minister of Finance. The financial comptroller is responsi-
ble for controlling CNCA's financial activities and making certain-that they
are executed within the framework of the pertinent laws and decisions of the
Administrative Council.
8.        As previously pointed out, the above-cited decrees are the`legal
basis for the formation of the CLCAs. When they were finally established in
1967, however, this was not done on the basis of mutuality as envisaged in
the Decree.  The reason was that the idea of credit cooperatives was not yet
sufficiently developed in the country. The notion of extending credit to
members of credit cooperatives was substituted by a mechanism under which
credit was extended to farmers categorized in accordance with their fiscal
income.
9.        Because the principle of mutuality as set out in the Decree has
been abandoned, most of the articles in Decree No. 1-60-106 (referring to the
CLCAs) and also of the Decree No. 2-61-607 (with its annex setting out sample
by-laws of a CLCA) have no bearing on the activities and legal status of the
CLCAs as they are today. There are also a number of articles in Decree No.
1-60-106 referring to CNCA and its branch offices, which do not seem to be
consistent with the actual lending activities as they are performed at pres-
ent. Some striking discrepancies are listed below:



ANNEX 2
Page 4
Article 7 indicates that CNCA's Administrative Council is to
have 11 members, who are at the same time members of CLCAs
set up as credit cooperatives or members of SOCAPs. This is
no longer possible since the CLCAs were never established as
credit cooperatives and the SOCAPs have been dissolved;
Article 14 indicates that one of the CRCAs' objectives is
that of extending credit to CLCAs or to agricultural. com-
panies and groups. This principle is no longer followed be-
cause the CLCAs have their own funds for lending operations,
and credits to companies, farmers' groups and cooperatives
are extended by CNCA Headquarters and the CRCAS;
Article 32 states that penalty interest because of late payments,
normal interest and surcharges are not to exceed 10% per annum.
This is no longer in line with reality.
10.       Although the deviations between the stipulations of the two decrees
and the actual lending policy of CNCA are silently accepted and legal diffi-
culties have not yet arisen, they should be amended in order to bring them
into compliance with the credit policies followed by the Government and
CNCA.
Organization
11.       The Headquarters of CNCA are at Rabat with a General Manager and
his Deputy as chief executives. There are four departments headed by a de-
partment director and five divisions headed by a division head--all directly
subordinated to the General Manager and his Deputy (the organigram of CNCA
is in Table 2). The decision to have some divisions report directly to the
General Manager and his Deputy without subordinating them to a department
head has been made to retain flexibility for future changes in organization.
12.       The Credit Department at Headquarters is concerned with loans to
individuals only if they exceed certain limits, as set out in the loan regula-
tions, and with the appraisal and preparation for approval by the loan commit-
tee of all collective loans. After approval, the collective loans are par-
tially disbursed and supervised by the CRCAs. A further important task of
the Credit Department is the permanent supervision of the loan regulations
and the preparation of amendments to the loan regulations for approval by the
Administrative Council of CNCA.
13.       In the foreseeable future, it may be advisable to include the Divi-
sion for Juridical Affairs and Legal Proceedings in the Credit Department and
to merge the Division for Administrative Services with the Purchasing Division



ANNEX 2
Page 5
in a new department which could be named Personnel, Administration & Purchas-
ing Department. The Computer Services could either retain its present status
or be attached to the Personnel, Administration and Purchasing Department and
the CLCA Division should be redesigned into a staff division for liaison with
branch offices through zone directors.
14.       All accounting work for the loan accounts is done in the Computer
Services Division on a Honeywell-Bull computer, which replaced an older model
in 1972-73. After initial difficulties which resulted in big delays in data
processing and accounting work, the computer is now operating satisfactorily
and has sufficient capacity to digest CNCA's projected increase in lending
activities for the next few years. It may however be desirable to modify the
computer programming to some extent--with a view to obtain more detailed in-
formation on loan recoveries (see para. 95). The Division for Juridical
Affairs and Legal Proceedings is responsible for the supervision of loan
recovery and of all legal proceedings. No attorneys are as yet included in
the division staff, although CNCA management has recently decided to add some
legal personnel to the division. All CLCA branches until the end of fiscal
year 1974/75 were under the sole supervision of the CLCA Division. Since the
beginning of 1975/76 however, a system of regionalization has been created
which places the CLCA branches under the supervision of a zone director for
the CLCAs, who in turn has to report to a regional director. That leaves the
CLCA Division in Headquarters with the task of coordinating CLCA activities
with the credit policies pursued by Headquarters.
15.       Up to fiscal year 1974-75, the organization of CNCA's lending opera-
tions was such that the CRCA and CLCA branches had only very limited authority
in loan approval, which made the whole system rather inflexible with respect
to servicing the specific needs of CNCA's borrowers. It was therefore decided
by the CNCA management:
-    to implement a new policy of regionalization of credit in
order to better adapt credit availability to local needs and
conditions;
-    to delegate more authority in loan approval and in resolution
of problems to the local level;
-    to streamline administrative procedures in order to ensure
more rapid and efficient distribution of credit;
-    to adjust the financing limits under the various credit
categories in order to bring them in better relation to
the present and future project costs; and
-    to review client classification criteria on the basis of
production efficiency, innovativeness and credit standing.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
16.       On the organizational level, five regional zones were created follow-
ing cultivation, climatic and geographical characteristics. Each of these
zones comprises three to eight CRCA branch offices and between three and six
CLCA zones'(a total of 23 CLCA zones) which in turn combine three to six
CLCAs (a total of 86 CLCA branch offices). Each of the five zones has a re-
gional director who is responsible for the CRCAs and CLCAs operating in his
area. He is the superior in direct line of the CRCA directors and the CLCA
zone directors in his region. Whenever he visits a CRCA branch office, he
is an ex-officio member of all Internal Credit Committees newly-established
in the CRCAs. Through his participation in committee meetings, the regional
director upgrades the committee's authority in loan approval (see also para.
57). The regional directors have been appointed at the beginning of fi-
nancial year 1975/76 but at this point in time it is too early to arrive at
a judgment whether the objectives of the change in organizational set-up will
be achieved.
17.       CRCA offices are organized in three sections under a director who
has a deputy director if justified by the business activities of the CRCA.
With secretarial services and non-professional personnel, a CRCA office
normally holds 25 to 30 staff and is equipped with two vehicles, one of them
jeep-type which are used mainly for on-farm appraisal and on-farm supervision
(organigram, see Table 3).
18.       The CLCA offices are manned with one director and usually four to
eight agents. There is no clear distinction between the three services as
in the CRCAs because loans to CLCA clients are made under criteria of fiscal
revenue only, with desk appraisal and loan supervision at random. CLCA agents
have to be familiar with all activities normally carried out by the CLCAs,
which requires a polyvalent training tailored to the specific needs. About
half of all CLCA offices have cashier services. It is planned, however, to
increase their number in order to get away from the time-consuming postal
money remittance by CNCA Headquarters to CLCA clients. Two CLCA branch of-
fices are equipped with full-fledged banking services and also their number
will be gradually increased.
19.       At present, the network of CNCA branch offices comprises 24 CRCAs
and 86 CLCAs (see map). Three CRCAs are to be created within the next two
years whereas it is planned to open eight CLCA offices in financial year
1976-77, seven in 1977-78 and another seven in 1978-79.
B. Personnel and Training
Personnel
20.       The staff of CNCA developed from 659 on August 31, 1971 to 1,351 on
March 30, 1976, which is an increase of 105% in 4-1/2 years. This substantial
increase is reflected in the following table:

Total                     665      1,030     1,169      1,307       1,351
A breakdown of personnel by posts is given in Table 4.
21.       Technical staff, agronomists with university degrees and graduates
of the Moroccan agricultural high schools, are assigned to CNCA by MARA with-
out CNCA being heard about the number of graduates assigned or the selection
among the graduates available. Since the number of university and agricul-
tural high school graduates in any one year is far below the number required
by the various governmental institutions, including CNCA and the Agrarian
Reform Cooperatives, there is an acute shortage of technical personn`el, es-
pecially in CNCA's branch offices. Normally, not more than one third of the
technical personnel requested by CNCA is actually assigned by MARA and an
improvement of the situation could be reached by a systematical long-term
planning of requirements in this field, worked out by MARA and agreed to by
all parties concerned.
22.       The Department for General Research and Professional Training is
responsible for the selection of all other staff to be employed by CNCA, by
staging entrance examinations. Usually, the principle followed is that
branch personnel are selected in the area of the future duty station in
order to by-pass the reluctance of staff to be assigned for work in regions
other than their home region. Senior positions in middle and higher manage-
ment are normally filled by personnel from within CNCA after examination under
the responsibility of the Department for General Research and Professional
Training.
23.       The remuneration system of CNCA is based on personnel regulations
inherited in 1962 from a Government entity which is no longer in existence.
Up to a date as recent as 1975 CNCA employees had a slight salary advantage
over Government officials but were placed at a serious disadvantage when
compared with other semi-autonomous Government organizations like SODEA and
SOGETA. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the private banking
sector, with which CNCA has to compete in the personnel market for personnel



ANNEJ 2
Page 8
other than agricultural personnel appeared to pay on the average 50% more than
CNCA. This lead to a heavy fluctuation of CNCA personnel and it frequently
happened that staff, after having been trained by and become valuable staff
members of CNCA, changed to banks in the private sectors where more lucrative
jobs were offered.
24.       In financial year 1975/76 the remuneration system was adjusted
upwards, making it competitive with that of the banking sector. Thus CNCA's
position in the personnel market has been considerably strengthened with a
view to the high personnel needs in the years ahead (the CLCAs alone have a
projected need of 382 additional staff in the next six years).
Training
25.       In 1970, CNCA started to develop its own training programs and had
two employees take permanent care of its training needs. Following the recog-
nition by CNCA Management of the importance of increased efforts to train the
fast growing staff on all levels, a separate Department for General Research
and Professional Training was established, which, at the end of the financial
year 1974/75, had reached a strength of 19 professional staff. This Depart-
ment undertook an assessment of the training needs categorized as follows:
-    training needed to cover deficiencies in professional know-
ledge in day-to-day activities performed by the selected
staff;
-    training needed to cover deficiencies in professional know-
ledge with respect to the tasks of other CNCA personiel work-
ing in related activities;
-    acquisition of new professional abilities and skills.
26.       Simultaneously, a number of Headquarter department directors and
CRCA branch directors were asked which specific professional skills of their
department or branch staff they would like to see developed. On the basis of
the findings of this assessment a training strategy was evolved which com-
prised training programs directed toward specific subjects and training pro-
grams of a more general nature for all professional categories and for some
non-professional categories of CNCA staff.
27.       Following this well-conceived strategy approved by the CNCA manage-
ment training courses were begun in 1972 with the aim of updating the staff's
professional knowledge. This was done in the form of correspondence courses,
seminars, on-the-job training and exterior-training courses. Among the topics
covered were banking and agricultural credit, laws relevant to CNCA opera-
tions, general agriculture, accounting, marketing, etc.
28.       The correspondence courses were given to all branch personnel in-
cluding directors and their assistants. They were supplemented by two to
four day seminars. At the end of two years, the courses were followed by an



ANNEX 2
Page 9
examination which formed the basis for promotion. Although the training by
correspondence courses proved to be very successful, it undoubtedly has the
disadvantage of extending over too long a period. Intensive training efforts
of the seminar type would very likely have a positive effect on the training
efficiency.
29.       For newly-employed staff of CNCA various forms of training were de-
signed. University graduates employed as management interns receive a train-
ing of six months duration consisting of two days weekly classroom training
and three days weekly on-the-job training in all departments of Headquarters
and various branch offices. All newly-recruited branch agents and agricultural
staff participated in a basic training of four days duration to acquaint them
with the tasks to be fulfilled.
30.       Training abroad was offered to two or three staff annually in middle
management positions at the "Centre d'Etudes Financieres, Economiques et
Bancaires" in Paris, for a duration of 11 months.  Up to now, five CNCA em-
ployees have participated in EDI courses which are in high esteem. A third
training possibility is offered by "Cassa di Risparmio delle Province
Lombarde" in Italy. The effect of this training however must appear to be
dubious because the total training period is nine months, of which only three
months are spent learning the Italian language.
31.       In several two-week periods, the CNCA instructors had the oppor-
tunity to participate in day-to-day banking activities in order to familiar-
ize themselves with the practical aspects of the topics they would teach or
in order to get acquainted with new subjects like the practical use of CNCA's
computer, pedagogical problems and new developments, etc. The cost of train-
ing has risen from DH 153,000 in seven months of 1972/73 to DH 347,000 in
1973/74.
32.       In general, it must be recognized that the training program started
in 1972 was extremely successful, given the available financial means and
personnel resources. Now it should be taken into account, however, that in
view of the very rapidly growing personnel needs of CNCA, the training efforts
need to be intensified. This could be done by strengthening the present sys-
tem through the allocation of a higher budget to allow for the recruitment of
more instructors and the acquisition of more training material. While in the
immediate future such strengthening of existing training facilities seems to
be the only possible way, for the long run the alternative solution of estab-
lishing a separate training institute should deserve urgent consideration.
A training institute would have a number of advantages over the present system
of training some of which are listed below:
-    training could be done in an intensive way as classroom type
training, which would shorten the periods now involved in
correspondence courses, yet the training would go much more
in-depth than the correspondence courses followed by 2 to 4
day seminars;



ANNEX 2
Page 10
a number of subjects which together would give a CNCA staff
member the necessary professional skills to perform his duties
could be taught at the same time;
the institute could better accommodate various levels of train-
ing depending on the varying educational background of its
students at entrance;
-    the training would be given to all new professional staff of
CNCA before they would be assigned to their new posts which
would waive the requirement of releasing staff from their
duties for training purposes which always is problematic
due to the heavy workload of CNCA personnel.
It is therefore recommended to assess the needs and possibilities in the
training sector through the preparation of a study that would examine in
detail the feasibility and usefulness of setting up a separate training in-
stitute for agricultural credit. The study would be undertaken by the CNCA
staff with the assistance of experts in professional training and agricul-
tural credit and banking. The foreign exchange component for the study
would be financed under the Arab Fund Loan. Tentative terms of reference
for the first phase of the training component are set out in Table 5.
C. Financial Resources
Equity Capital
33.       The consolidated audited balance sheets for the period August 31,
1971 to August 31, 1975 and an unofficial balance sheet for the first eight
months of the financial year 1975-76 and the audited consolidated income
statements broken down in income statements for CNCA/CRCA and CLCA for the
same period are set out in Tables 6 and 7. Since CNCA is a State-owned
company, no dividends are paid and profits are retained to strengthen the
equity base and to generate more funds for lending operations. The equity
capital of CNCA over the last four years has developed from DH 50 million
to DH 135.9 million, an increase of 171%. The increase is due to a transfer
of DH 44 million from the general fund, i.e., the equity of CLCA, to the
CNCA capital and to a transfer of DH 37.8 million and DH 4.1 million, res-
pectively, from IDA Credit No. 338 in 1973/74 and 1974/75.  At the same time
the CLCA general fund increased by approximately 68% from DH 55.7 million to
DH 93.3 million. After a modest increase by DH 5 million in 1971/72, DH 19.7
million of managed funds from organizations under liquidation were included
in the CLCA capital in 1972-73, but at the same time DH 44 million were trans-
ferred from the general fund of CLCA to the capital of CNCA, leading to a de-
crease of CLCA general fund to DH 36.4 million. At the beginning of 1975/76
it was decided by the Government that an amount of DH 56.9 million, which
the Governnent had received as a loan from the Iranian Government and passed



ANNEX 2
Page 11
on to CNCA, would be converted into a grant to CNCA. This transaction is
already shown in the balance sheet for 1974-75. A further portion of this
grant in the amount of DH 62.4 million has already been received by CLCA in-
creasing the equity capital without guarantee fund to DR 163.3 million. A
last amount of DH 3.9 million is expected in FY76-77. The guarantee fund
of CLCA that was established to cover the lending risks has increased from
DH 2 million to DH 7.6 million. Up to the present time, from each loan
which CLCA disburses, 2% is retained and added to the guarantee fund, thus
leaving it without any relation to the actual amounts of bad debts or amounts
overdue and accumulating more funds than would be necessary under this cate-
gory.
Net Income and General Reserve
34.       The net income of CNCA achieved in any one year is transferred the
following year to the general reserve, which grew from DH 12.8 million in
1970-71 by 107% to DH 26.6 million in 1975-76. The ratio of general reserve
to the combined equity capital of CNCA and CLCA however developed from 11.9%
in 1970-71 to a peak of 17.7% in 1972-73 and decreased due to the increase in
capital to 10.7% in 1974-75. Loan Agreement No. 861-MOR in Section 5.10 has
a covenant that CNCA shall take all necessary steps to increase and thereafter
to maintain its general reserves at an amount not less than 15% of its capital.
Since this covenant does not appear to be very efficient, it will be replaced
by a debt/equity ratio covenant, which would limit the long-term borrowings of
CNCA to four times the capital funds including accumulated reserves, guarantee
fund and profits. At the same time another covenant would be introduced which
would safeguard that current assets at all times would be 20% higher than
current liabilities including cash advances from BDM and CDG and short-term
deposits.
Deposits
35.       Deposits have developed from DH 25.8 million to DH 137.4 million.
While the absolute increase in amount as such is significant, it must be in-
dicated that there are few very large depositors, mainly State-owned com-
panies. If these depositors would withdraw their deposits, this would result
in a sharp reduction of deposits. Interest rates on deposits are 1.5% on
sight deposits, a privilege held only by CNCA in Morocco, and between 2% and
6.5% for term deposits deposited for periods ranging from 1-24 months. CNCA
has calculated an average interest payable on deposits of 1.9%. This rate
has also been adopted for the projections in this report.  It is generally
felt that the mobilization of deposits is one of the most important tasks
of CNCA in the future.  In recognition of this necessity, the CNCA manage-
ment has launched publicity campaigns to encourage deposits and to make
farmers increasingly familiar with the credit facilities offered by CNCA,
which may make them also more inclined to make use of the deposit system.



ANNEX 2
Page 12
Special savings schemes have been devised for small deposits and experi-
ments with a mobile cashier service, operating at a number of markets
throughout the week, has led to encouraging results. There are however
serious constraints hampering the deposit mobilization:
-    CNCA has no staff exclusively working for the implementation
and promotion of savings schemes;
-    the premises and buildings of CNCA's branch offices, the
CRCAs and CLCAs, frequently do not have the appearance that
would attract depositors;
-    competition from commercial banks is strong.  (The advantage
of CNCA paying interest on sight deposits is compensated in
other ways by the commercial banks).
the mentality of farmers in Morocco is not directed towards
putting their savings in bank accounts; they would rather buy
livestock which normally gives them a better return than any
bank in Morocco can offer.
The Arab Fund would undertake to finance technical assistance for the devel-
opment and improvement of CNCA's banking services with special emphasis on
mobilization of deposits.
Bank Advances
36.       CNCA has recourse to cash advances from the Bank of Morocco at an
interest rate of 3% and from the Caisse de Depots et de Gestion (CDG) at 6%.
These cash advances are called discount facilities because in the past years
for each loan maturity of loans extended by CNCA, bills of exchange were
prepared although these were never handed over to the Central Bank and the
CDG but were held ready for inspection in CNCA Headquarters. The procedure
of issuing bills of exchange has been stopped and CNCA can obtain cash ad-
vances if and when needed up to a ceiling of DH 150 million from the Central
Bank of Morocco and DH 30 million from CDG. For amounts exceeding these
ceilings, higher interest rates have to be paid. Cash advances shown in the
balance sheets do not reflect the average amounts taken up during the years
because the liquidity position at the end of the financial year is usually
good due to the inflow of loan recoveries after the harvests.
Borrowings
37.       Two Bank loans were made available to CNCA, Loan No. 433-MOR in
the amount of US$10 million was disbursed between November 1965 and September
1969 and Loan No. 861-MOR, in the amount of US$24 million, was disbursed bet-
ween July 1973 and June 1976. Repayment of Loan 433-MOR started in March
1970 and at August 31, 1975 the unpaid portion of the Loan amounted to DH
29.7 million to be repaid until March 1982. Repayments under 'Loan 861-MOR



ANNEX 2
Page 13
have started in August 1976 and will continue until February 1987. At August
31, 1975, the Loan was shown in the balance sheet with an amount of DH 54.7
million. Additionally, DH- 45.9 million have been disbursed until June 1976.
Both IBRD loans are guaranteed by the Moroccan Government, which also bears
the foreign exchange risk. The loans were made to CNCA to finance medium-
and long-term lending operations. Bank Loan No. 433-MOR bears interest of
5.5% per annum and Loan No. 861-MOR bears interest of 7.25% per annum.
38.       Other long-term borrowings of CNCA were a bond issue of January
1973 at an interest rate of 6.25% per annum and another bond issue of May
20, 1974 at the same interest rate of DR 30 million each. The total unpaid
balance of both bond issues at August 31, 1975 was DH 54 million. The re-
payment has to be made with DH 4 million annually. A loan from the City of
Agadir had an unpaid balance of only DH 13,000 at August 31, 1975.
39.       The CLCAs have received a long-term loan from Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau in Germany in the amount of DM 10 million in January 1973, at
an annual interest rate of 2%. Repayment will start in June 1983 and the
last payment will be made in June 2003. On August 31, 1975 the Loan was
shown in the balance sheet in the amount of DH 16.4 million. Managed funds
in the amount of DH 39.9 million are available to CNCA at no cost for spe-
cific credit operations determined by the Government. The funds originate
from former banks and credit companies under liquidation, which are the Caisse
Centrale de Credit et de Prevoyance, the Caisse Federale, the Caisse Regionale
d'Epargne et de Credit and the Societes de Credit Agricole et de Prevoyance.

the projected cost of funds.
D. Lending Policies and Procedures
I. CLCAs
Lending Policies
40.       The CLCAs make loans to small farmers with a minimum fiscal income
of DH 100 and a maximum fiscal income of DH 3,000, which corresponds to an
estimated actual farm income of DH 250 and DH 7,500 or US$58 and US$1,744
respectively. (For details regarding the fiscal income principle, see Annex 1,
paras 22-24). In 1967, when the first Caisse Locale was established, the
upper limit was DH 4,000 and the lower limit DH 1,400; clients below this
limit were served by the SOCAPs. In 1970, new limits were fixed with a mini-
mum of DR 800 and a maximum of DH 3,000. In the FY 72-73, an integration of
the SOCAP customers was done by regions and has been terminated in the FY 75-
76, when the last SOCAPs were dissolved. Each farmer gets a tax certificate
each year by which his taxable income is determined. Coming from a public



ANNEX 2
Page 14
enterprise, the CLCA agents have access to the tax offices and prepare lists
with all potential CLCA clients, i.e., farmers with a fiscal income of DH
100 - DH 3,000 which are updated every year. These lists are kept with the
CLCA offices and are consulted in each case loan applications are processed.
The integration of the SOCAPs in the financial year 1972-73 added 46,774 po-
tential clients, in 1973-74 161,938 clients, in 1974-75 394,706 clients and
in 1975-76 an estimated number of 360,000 clients. The total number of poten-
tial CLCA clients in the year 1975/76 is 1,023,134, of which an estimated num-
ber of 170,000 or 16.6% are customers of the CLCAs by having a loan outstand-
ing at any one time of the fiscal year. Plans are being discussed to combine
CRCA and CLCA offices in the southern area of Morocco and to extend loans
to customers in that area in accordance with uniform lending norms.
41.       Since for 1976 the poverty level of an agricultural family is esti-
mated to be DH 4,500 or US$1,050, about half of all credits made available to
CLCA customers are extended to farmers below the poverty level as the follow-
ing table demonstrates:
Number of Credit Files at March 31, 1976
Percentage
Short-term  Medium-term    Total    of Total
Up to DH 1,400 fiscal
income corresponding
to approximately
DH 3,500 actual farm
income or DH 4,500
actual total income           17,749        81,777       99,526       54%
Over DH 1,400 fiscal
income                        12,179        72,056       84,235       46%
Total                          29,928       153,833      183,761      100%
The details are in Table 9 to this annex.  From this table it also can be
derived that the number of loans extended to farmers in the fiscal income
range up to DH 300 is insignificant. The very poorest farmers, i.e., those
with a fiscal income of below DH 100 are not reached at all by institutional-
ized credit.
42.       As already pointed out the eligibility of farmers for CLCA credit
depends upon their fiscal income which must not be lower than DH 100 and not
higher than DH 3,000. The number and amount of loans that can be allocated
to one farmer is also in relation to his fiscal income. It is limited to
one short-term loan of DH 150 for farmers with a fiscal income of DH 100 to
DH 150.  Farmers with a fiscal income of DH 151 to DH 300 can get one short-
term loan in the amount of maximum 100% of their fiscal income. Farmers who



ANNEX 2
Page 15
have a fiscal income of DH 301 to DH 3,000 can either get two short term
loans, or one short-term loan and two medium-term loans--all outstanding
simultaneously at any one time. The amount for each individual loan is
determined in loan regulations, revised for the fiscal year 1976/77, for
short-term loans normally as a fixed amount per hectare and for medium-term
loans as a percentage of the investment cost. However, the actual limitation
on the loan amounts is that the maximum amount for each short-term loan must
not exceed 50% of the farmer's fiscal income. For medium-term loans the
limitation is connected to the repayment capacity to the effect that the
annuity in principal for each loan must not exceed 50% of his fiscal income,
so that a farmer with two medium-term and one short-term loan outstanding
would have a repayment obligation in loan principal of 150% of his fiscal
income plus interest. (The lending norms in condensed form are set out in
Table 11.)
43.       This limitation in indebtedness leads to the fact that approximately
70% of investment costs are actually financed by medium-term loans instead of
the 80% that would be allowed for financing in accordance with the norms
mentioned in the previous paragraph.
Interest Rates
44.       Interest rates on CLCA loans are not computed pro rata temporis but
as a charge of 4% at the date of the loan execution regardless of the term of
the loan, and another 4% on each October 1. An exception are short-term harvest
loans, where the charge is 2% instead of 4%. In addition a one-time charge
of 2% is raised on all loans at the time of disbursement to feed a guarantee
fund established to cover credit losses.  This guarantee fund has been set up
in lieu of provisions for bad debts and at August 31, 1975 had accumulated to
DH 7.6 million, more than enough to cover all inherent risks. The system of
firm percentage charges had been chosen for the sake of simplicity in calcu-
lation and bookkeeping, but it has the effect that the equivalent interest
rates calculated pro rata temporis are approximately 9.8% for short-term
loans for cereals, 13.6% for short-term production loans for other crops,
13.1% for short-term loans for sheep and cattle-fattening and 15.7% for short-
term harvest loans. For medium-term loans the highest rate pro rata temporis
of approximately 8.7% would be on loans with two-year duration. The interest
rate would then decrease to 7.2% on three-year loans, 6.5% on four-year loans
and 6% on five-year loans--resulting in a weighted average of approximately
6.5% pro rata temporis for all medium-term loans, a distortion which cer-
tainly will have to be corrected. The fixed charges of 4% (2% for harvest
loans) as well as the 2% guarantee fund charge have been in effect for many
years and were not increased on September 1, 1975 when interest rates for
individual customers of the CRCAs and Headquarters were increased. The CLCAs
do not charge penalty interest for late payment but raise fees for legal pro-
ceedings which are debited to the account of the client only after the pay-
ment has been received.

Appraisal, Approval & Supervision
45.       CNCA management has chosen a loan appraisal system for CLCA eus-
tomers that is based on a desk review of the applicant's eligibility, which
automatically includes his repayment capacity, and of the purpose of the loan.
This system is used since 1967 and has been justified with the following
reasons:
-    Because of the limited indebtedness of the borrowers, as
fixed by the loan regulations, the lending risk is kept
at a minimum;
-    the pre-set categories of lending further reduce the lend-
ing risk;
-    technical staff for field appraisals is limited and not
even sufficient for the CRCAs;
-    the high number of loans to be processed excludes field
appraisal.
These reasons are valid and an alteration of this system, though desirable
at the earliest possible time, will not be possible during the project
period.
46.       The loan approval for a CLCA lôan is done by a local credit com-
mittee (see Table 15) which is convened once per week by its chairman. Its
decisions have to be taken unanimously.
47.       As collateral for all-CLCA loans, a personal guarantee is requested
which can be given by another farmer usually possessing a farm of similar
size, a merchant or a Government official. Disbursement takes place in one
lump sum in the CLCA office if cashier's services are available. If that is
not the case, the disbursement will be made either in the next CRCA office
or by postal money order.
Recoveries
48.       Loans or loan installments are usually due after the harvest and
collection is done by the recovery agents of the CLCAs on the various markets
in the area. More than half of the debtors are paying in person in the CLCA
offices and a significant percentage of debtors for medium-term loans repay
prematurely in order to be eligible for another loan. The recovery rates of
the CLCAs have been extremely good as Table 10 shows. On principal and in-
terest fallen due during the year 1974-75, 85.5% have been recovered (89.2%
the year before) and for principal and interest overdue at the beginning of
the same period, the recovery rate was 79% (83.6% the year before). The
recovery system as such is most efficient, due to effective management and
the support by the Government authorities. In fact claims of CNCA are di-
rectly executable just as Government taxes (see para 60).



ANNEX 2
Page 17
Il.  CRCA & Headquarters
Lending Policies
49.       The regional offices of CNCA (the CRCAs) lend to individual farmers
with a fiscal income of more than DH 3,000 and to farmers' associations for
mechanization whereas Headquarters are responsible for lending to cooperatives
and companies and for individual loans if they exceed certain limits laid down
in the loan regulations. Among the collective loans extended by Headquarters
are loans to the ORMVAs for comprehensive industrial crops programs (short-term)
and for the establishment of plantations (long-term), loans to Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives for production inputs and investments, loans to State companies
(these loans are implemented and supervised by CRCAs) for production inputs,
for investments and to finance marketing of cereals and cotton.
50.       Along with the creation of the DRCAs (see paras.  15 and 16), a
classification of CRCA clients has been introduced on September 1, 1975 by
which all clients who have received loans already since a minimum period of
two years, who cultivate their land in accordance with modern techniques, who
have used the credit allocated to them in a satisfactory manner and who have
fulfilled their repayment obligation would be classified into the Category A.
Category B would be new loan applicants or other individuals who do not ful-
f ill the requirements as indicated for Category A. The categorizing of clients
has started in order to simplify administrative procedures but has not been
terminated yet in all CRCAs. Preliminary estimates show that approximately
10% of all CRCA clients would form Category A.
51.       The CRCAs' lending norms are laid down in loan regulations which
are normally revised when the need arises. These norms vary slightly between
the five regions but cover in general 70% of production cost for short-term
loans and 70% of investment cost for medium-term loans. (For details see
Table 13). The main features covered by the last revision of the norms in
September 1975 were a general upward adjustment, the inclusion of financing
for locally-bred cattle (which has caused already in the first months of
financial year 1975/ 76 a big increase in disbursement of loans for livestock
breeding and fattening) and an increase in duration of medium-term loans, a
feature which is considered to be very attractive by the farmers.
52.       Lending norms for Category A customers are slightly higher than
those for Category B customers. Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, however, which
under the agrarian reform program are treated with first priority in the
agricultural sector, have different lending norms. Whereas individual medium-
term loans are disbursed in the amount of 70% of investment costs, Agrarian
Reform Cooperatives are eligible to 100% financing for the first set of equip-
ment but according to Government regulations ought to get only 50% financing
for any replacement, a regulation which is not strictly adhered to. Short-
term financing is allocated in the first year after creation to cover 100%
of the needs, in the second year 80%, the third year 60%, the fourth year



ANNEX 2
Page 18
40%, the fifth year 20% and from the sixth year onwards no short-term credits
are granted at all. The execution of this rule can be postponed if the coop-
erative is in financial difficulty because of a bad harvest or other reasons.
The consequence of this rather irrational system is that the own funds of the
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives are increasingly tied up for ehort-term agricul-
tural inputs. There is also the jeopardy that the use of fertilizers and
plant protection agents is decreased or that the necessary funds are borrowed
from local merchants or moneylenders at usury rates.  The declining financing
rate for farm investments for replacements would have a similar effect, neces-
sary replacements being postponed and old equipment being continuously used at
uneconomically high repair and operating costs. The whole system of financing
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives as it stands now seems to be inefficient and
would be revised with effect from September 1, 1977 (see para. 91).
Interest Rates
53.       Upon CNCA's proposal, interest rates for loans extended by Headquar-
ters and CRCA were increased as of September 1, 1975 (see Table 14). The new
interest rates approved by the Government in 1975 are partially the result of
the prompting by the Bank both at the national level, in discussions with
Bank economic missions, in negotiations on specific projects and through
the study on interest rates undertaken by the Bank of Morocco under the
auspices of the IMF and the Bank, and at the agricultural credit level. A1-
though not all the proposals regarding rate increases were approved, the
alterations must be considered as a first step in the right direction. The
interest rate structure for medium-term'credits has been simplified at the
same time and only two rates have emerged>' 7%'for cooperatives and farmers'
associations and 8.5% for'all'other borrowers. Short-term production loans
for grain and pulses with the exclusion of rice bear an interest rate of 6% as
before, but short-term loans for comprehensive industrial crops programs have
been increased to 8% and are passed on to the farmers at 8.5%, and production
loans for vegetables, citrus, livestock fattening and rice have been increased
to 8.5%. Interest rates for marketing of grain and cotton remain unchanged at
4.75% and 5.5% respectively.
Appraisal, Approval and Supervision
54.       Upon receipt of a loan application, the section head of the loan
section of the CRCA decides whether or not a field appraisal would have to be
made. In accordance with the revised loan regulations, field appraisals are
no longer compulsory for medium-term loans requested by customers of Cate-
gory A. For customers of Category B field appraisals are compulsory for
certain types of investment. These are establishment of plantations, con-
structions, cattle fattening, chicken breeding, and irrigation projects.
For other medium-term loan applications, the decision on the necessity of
a field appraisal is at the discretion of the section head. For the first
time in financial year 1975/76, the CRCAs are also appraising loans for
farmers' associations for mechanization which was done before at Headquarters.
Loan appraisals for Agrarian Reform Cooperatives are done by the credit



ANNEX 2
Page 19
department of Headquarters. During field appraisal and subsequent to the
appraisal a number of forms are filled, which if properly executed would give
all information necessary to arrive at a proper and well-founded decision on
the eligibility of the applicant, the viability of the project for which the
credit is destined and the creditworthiness and repayment capacity of the
applicant. The calculation of farm income and operating costs should be based
on yields obtained and operating charges incurred after the benefits of the
loan under appraisal would have fully materialized. But in fact the calcula-
tions are often based on operating costs and farm income without the benefits
of the credit, a comparison of net income with and without the credit is
not made at all, and incremental returns are not calculated.
55.       Appraisal of loan applications which because of their size are
beyond the approval capacity of the CRCAs or appraisals of loan requests for
companies are supposed to be done in the same manner as those for other cus-
tomers executed by the CRCAs. For cooperatives however all individual loan
requests are incorporated into a regional lending program, which is then
forwarded to MARA and very often revised upwards or downwards in the Ministry
in accordance with the priorities set for the achievement of certain agricul-<
tural targets.  The summarized requests are discussed with CNCA Headquarters
and an appraisal is done only in the case where financing for non-standard
investments is requested. Similarly, loans for public enterprises like SODEA
and SOGETA are requested through MARA, guaranteed by the Government and
therefore often not properly appraised.
56.       It is up to the director of a CRCA or the credit department of
Headquarters to determine which collateral should be requested. Under the
Moroccan law, quite a number of collaterals are available to choose from,
50 that normally lack of security is not a reason for loan rejection as in
some other developing countries. For medium-term loans, the types of colla-
teral most widely-used in Morocco are the mortgatge, the guarantee secured
by a mortgage, the joint and several guarantee, the undertaking to grant a
mortgage and the attachment of tractor registration cards. For short-term
loans chattel mortgages, crop liens, and personal guarantees are requested.
It is emphasized in the loan regulations however that the best guarantee is
a good appraisal and a close supervision of the loan after disbursement.
57.       On the CRCA level two bodies are available for loan approval.
(See Table 15.) The Internal Credit Committee has been newly-created in
financial year 1975-76 in order to simplify procedures and reviews approxi-
mately 25% of the loans which up to financial year 1975-76 had to be referred
for decision to the normal Credit Committee, which meets less frequently.
58.       Loan requests which cannot be decided by the Internal Credit Com-
mittee have to be passed to the Credit Committee which can approve short-term
loans up to DH 60,000 (in some regions up to DH 100,000), and medium-term
loans without limitation on the individual loan. There is a general limita-
tion, however, that the total loan portfolio for one client must not exceed
DH 150,000 (in some regions DH 200,000). Loan requests exceeding these



ANNEX 2
Page 20
limitations have to be forwarded to the Credit Department of Headquarters for
reference to the Management Committee of CNCA. Decisions taken in the daily
meetings of the Internal Credit Committee of the CRCAs are final up to amounts
of DH 30,000. Loan approvals between DH 30,000 and 60,000 are final only if
the regional director was present in the meeting and has supported the loan.
If he was not present and for loan approvals exceeding DH 60,000 the addi-
tional approval of the Credit Department of Headquarters is necessary.
59.       Loan disbursements are made to suppliers whenever possible or
otherwise in cash at the CRCA offices. On the CRCA and Headquarters level,
contrary to CLCA disbursements, loan disbursements normally are considerably
lower than loan approvals. In the financial year 1974-75, the disbursements
of both Headquarters and CRCA represented only 77% of the loan commmitments.
This phenomenon has a number of reasons:
-    Short-term credit ceilings for cooperatives have been set
too high and the credit allocations cannot be utilized;
-    difficulties in the supply of inputs or machinery on the
side of the supplier;
-    difficulties with loan/security;
-    change of opinion on the side of the borrower;
-    difficulties in obtaining-the necessary cash contribution
on the side ofUthe borrower, etc.
Recoveries
60.       Recoveries on the level of the Headquarters and CRCAs are not as
good as on the level of the CLCAs but still very satisfactory for a credit
institution in a developing country with such large numbers of outstanding
loans. As already pointed out in para 48, the Government authorities extend
their full support to CNCA in matters of loan collection. This support has
the legal basis in Decree No. 11-92 of August 21, 1935 as amended to its
present version in 1970, which determines the modalities of legal proceedings
in the collection of direct taxes, tax-like fees, income from State-owned land
and other financial claims recovered by tax collectors. Included are financial
claims by public enterprises, which give CNCA the invaluable advantage that in
case of default all its financial claims are directly executable without re-
course to time-consuming court proceedings. The decree prescribes in detail
the writ of execution, the imprisonment for debts, the distress of property,
foreclosure of mortgages and the sale of seized property. Since this decree,
together with an effective management, forms the basis for CNCA's better than
average recovery rates, no amendments would be incorporated in the decree
which would materially affect the capability of CNCA's loan collection,
without prior consultation of the Bank.



ANNEX 2
Page 21
61.       In financial year 1974-75 collections on amounts falling due were
79.5% and on amounts overdue 64.6%. The corresponding figures in the year
before were 78.3% and 63%. Provisions for bad debts have accumulated over
the years to an amount of DH 9.9 million at the end of financial year 1974-
75, representing approximately 9.2% of the amounts overdue, or 85.2% of
the amount of DH 11.7 million which must be considered as bad debts. (See
Table 22.)
62.       Penalty interest of 2% is charged by Headquarters and CRCAs on all
amounts overdue after a period of default of two months. These charges
together with charges for legal proceedings are debited to the account of
the defaulter only after collection in order to avoid inflating the amounts
of bad debts in the balance sheet. Penalty interest received in 1974/75
amounted to DH 1.2 million, a very modest amount which is not so much a
result of outstanding penalty interest not being collected but on the
contrary the result of the low rate of amounts falling overdue. Notices
of amounts falling due are sent out by mail to every borrower one month
before a due date.
63.       Legal proceedings are started against individual borrowers very
soon after loan maturities get into default. These take the shape of mere
reminders and in the next step of a "no charge summons" in which the de-
faulter is requested to pay within 30 days and in which also the next legal
steps are announced:
-    Writ of execution
-    Foreclosure of mortgages
-    Distress and sale of property
-    Imprisonment for debts
While writs of execution are served rather frequently with the assistance of
local authorities, it very seldom comes to distress and sale of property, be-
cause the latter is done in the form of an auction and already the public
announcement of such auction in the village of the defaulter with his name
made public too, does serious damage to his reputation and usually is avoided
at all costs. The system of legal proceedings is highly developed and hardly
could be more sophisticated. Despite the efficient system, difficulties some-
times arise when the defaulter is too influential to take legal proceedings
against him. Also quite a few loans of former borrowers of SOCAPs which are
under liquidation seem to be unrecoverable.
64.       When it comes to collective lending, a difference has to be made
between private farmers' associations, cooperatives and companies and State-
owned companies and organizations. In general, repayment of Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives is satisfactory as Table 12 shows. Defaults have occurred on two
occasions and a rescheduling was negotiated for the provinces of Safi and
Sidi-Bennour. Judiciary action is under way against various private companies
which were formerly owned jointly by foreigners and Moroccans. Outstanding
loans from ORMVAs for production of sunflower have been taken over by Govern-
ment and are almost fully repaid. Arrears of COMAGRI, the State-owned company
doing the importing of cattle, were to be settled in summer 1976.

E. Past and Future Lending Operations
Past Lending Operations
65.       A detailed analysis of loans committed over the past four years
is given in Table 16 for individual farmers and in Table 17 for farmers'
associations, cooperatives and companies. Total lending to individuals
has increased by 75% and lending to associations and companies by 105%. The
average increases were as follows:
Short-term      Medium-term       Total
Average Increase Individual Loans
HQ/CRCA                                 19.4            16.1           18.2

CLCA                                                     -             28.5

66.       Although an evaluation of the growth rates does not generally allow
meaningful conclusions, some can be drawn:
For lending operations of HQ/CRCA:
-    Collective lending with an average rate of 24.7% has grown
faster than lending to individuals with an average rate of
18.2%;
-    short-term lending to individuals had approximately the same
average growth rate as short-term collective lending (19.4%
versus 20.4%) although there is an apparent trend to higher
growth rates for short-term loans to groups and companies
caused by high increases in lending to ORMVAs and SPs and
companies.
For lending operations of CLCA:
-    In comparison with HQ/CRCA lending to individuals it can
be said that short-term CLCA lending grew slightly slower
but medium-term CLCA lending much faster.



ANNEX 2
Page 23
short-term lending seems to be erratic in absolute amounts
and apparently there is a trend towards decreasing growth
rates if not even in absolute amounts,
-    medium-term lending shows a strong average growth rate of
30.9%, although the growth was interrupted by a decline in
lending in 1973/74.
67.       In total, lending of CLCA has been growing at a faster average
rate of 28.5% than lending of HQ/CRCA that grew at an average rate of 22.0%.
The biggest portion of all short-term HQ/CRCA lending to individuals over
the past four years were loans for livestock fattening with 48.7% followed
by production loans for cereals with 29.7%. The corresponding figures for
CLCA are in reverse order, short-term production loans for cereals are
in first place with 50.0% followed by loans for livestock fattening with
39.2%. In medium-term of HQ/CRCA lending to individuals, the categories are
more equally divided. The biggest loan category is loans for tractors with
26.5% followed by loans for farm buildings with 18.9% and loans for livestock
breeding with 12.7%.
68.       In medium-term CLCA lending four loan categories deserve to be
mentioned, 35.2% of all loans have been extended for investment in farm
buildings, 21.6% for cattle breeding, 19.2% for draft animals and 15.5%
for wells and minor irrigation schemes. It should be mentioned that loans
for livestock breeding were granted for the first time in 1972/73 where they
represented only 8.1% of total medium-term lending. In 1974/75, however,
they have become the strongest lending category with a share of 38.1%.
69.       Short-term collective lending clearly shows the Government prior-
ities in the agricultural sector: loans for comprehensive industrial crops
programs have the biggest share with 34.4% followed by loans to cooperatives
with 29.6%. Among the cooperatives the heaviest though declining financing
went to SCAM and CMA for grain marketing with 21.6% of all short-term loans.
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives were in second place with 6.6%. If we take a
look at the various crops financed with short-term loans, sugar beets got
the biggest chunk with 31.5% of all short-term financing. 57.4% of all
medium-term financing went to cooperatives, of which the Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives got 45.5%.
70.       A new type of short-term lending in the form of extending a credit
line for cash flow financing of private commercial vegetable production is
being considered.
Future Lending
71.       The projected lending program for the period 1975/76 - 1981/82
(see Annex 5, Tables 2-5) has been worked out as a synthesis of the expe-
rience gained from the CNCA lending activities over the past four years



ANNEX 2
Page 24
and including the first half of 1975/76, the priorities in the agricul-
tural sector set by Government as they are expected to develop and the
preferences and expectations explained by CNCA's management as laid down
in their preparation report.
72.       For CLCA lending the basic assumptions are that the number of
short-term loans would grow by 43.9% in 1975/76 and then by 5% annually,
a slower growth than that expected for medium-term lending with 33.7% in
1975/76 15.5% in 1976/77 and then 10% annually. The reason for the big
increase from 1974/75 to 1975/76 is the integration of the last zone of
SOCAP customers. The figures are based on the actual figures attained until
March 30, 1976. Due to a change in CLCA's loan regulations introduced as of
September 1, 1976, the average loan amount is expected to grow from DH 415 in
1975/76 to DH 600 in 1976/77 for short-term loans and from DH 1,700 to DH
2,450 in the same time for medium-term loans.
73.       These assumptions would lead to expected short-term lending of
DH 17.8 million 1975/76 and DH 34.6 million in 1981/82. The average annual
growth rate between 1975/76 and 1981/82 would be 11.6% and the loan amount
in the last year under consideration of DH 34.6 million woulcl nearly triple
as compared with DR 13.1 million in 1974/75.  Medium-term lending, however,
would grow at a much higher average rate of 17.9% leading to a loan amount of
DH 273.1 million or 268.1% of the amount obtained in 1975/76.
74.       Short-term loans for cereal production would remain the largest
individual lending categeory taking up 70% of all short-term lending
followed by livestock fattening with 24%. In medium-term lending live-
stock breeding in continuation of the trend observed would become the
biggest individual lending category. Also financing of farm buildings and
draft animals would continue to be strong lending categories.
75.       The projections for the HQ/CRCA lending program (see Annex 5,
Tables 2-4) have been made on the basis of projected physical quantities
of land to be cultivated for short-term financing or of investments to be
financed by medium term loans expressed in units of machinery to be pur-
chased (tractors, combines, etc.), ha of land on which plantations are to
be established or heads of cattle to be purchased.   These projections are
set out in Annex 5, Table 1. Under incorporation of various rates of price
increase and using unit prices which are also indicated in Annex 5, Table 1,
the lending program at current prices was calculated.  Short-term lending
is expected to be DH 1 billion in 1981/82 compared with DH 438.9 million in
1974/75, an increase of 128%, somewhat lower than the increase in short-term
CLCA lending.
76.       Medium-term lending is projected to reach DH 435.2 million, 309.7%
of lending in 1974/75.  In the short-term lending of the year 1981/82 of DH
1.001 million, loans for livestock fattening would be included with DH 251.4
million (25.1% of total short-term lending), cereal production with DH 192.8



ANNEX 2
Page 25
million (19.3%) sugar beet production with DH 177.3 million (17.7%) and
marketing loans for grain with DH 563 million (5.6%). A big portion of DH
70.1 million in medium-term loans in 1981/82 is expected to go to tractor
financing, but loans for combine harvesters, imported cattle and farm
buildings would be of similar importance.
77.       Following the experience of the last few years, disbursements for
short-term production loans for comprehensive industrial crops programs are
expected to be 75% of commitments, disbursements for all other production
loans 85%, for marketing loans 70%, for medium-term loans to Agrarian Reform
cooperatives 70%, for medium-term loans to individuals and companies 80% and
for medium-term loans to comprehensive industrial crops programs and pre-
cooperative groups 90% of commitments.
F. Financial Analysis, Projections and Recommendations
78.       Comparative financial ratios of CNCA/CRCA, CLCA and global CNCA
operations as actual ratios for the period 1970/71 - 1974/75 and as projected
ratios for the period 1975/76 - 1981/2 are set out in Table 18. These pro-
jected ratios have been calculated from the figures in the Projected Cash Flow
1975/76 - 1981/82 (Table 19), the Projected Consolidated Income Statement
(Table 20) and the Projected Consolidated Balance sheet (Table 21)--all for
the same period. Equity investments are set out in Table 23.
Relation between Interest Rates, Operating Cost and Operating Income
79.       CLCA experienced an operating loss in all years since 1970-71, which
grew permanently from DH 1.1 million to DH 5.8 million in 1974-75. This in-
crease in losses in the first two years under consideration was below the
proportion of increase in CLCA's loan portfolio but jumped in 1973-74 and
1974-75 to rates (223% and 159%, respectively, of the loss incurred the year
before) that exceeded by far the increase in portfolio (128% and 114%, re-
spectively, of the portfolio of the year before).
80.       The reasons for the losses are the high cost involved in lending
to small farmers, resulting in excessive operating cost and the low interest
rates (see para 44) which generate too low an income to cover the operating
cost. The high cost of CLCA's lending operation is reflected in the com-
parison of the operating cost of the last four years with the loans disbursed
for both HQ/CRCA and CLCA operations as set out below:



ANNEX 2

CLCA                 32,859                  278,656             11.8
HQ/CRCA             106,509                1,482,076              7.2
Grand Total         139,368                1,760,732              7.9
81.       Over the last four years for each DH 1,000 in loans disbursed, CLCA
had to incur operating expenses of DH 118, whereas the expenses for HQ/CRCA
were only DH 72 for DH 1,000 of loans disbursed, 61% of CLCA's figures. And
that despite the fact that CLCA is using a simplified method of desk loan
appraisal without any field appraisal and only sporadic field supervision.
It can therefore not be recommended to change the loan appraisal disburse-
ment and supervision system of CLCA at the present time and to adopt the
system used by Headquarters and the CRCAs because exorbitant increases in
operating cost would be the consequence (see also para 45). All CLCA cost
projections are consequently based on the assumption that such changes
will not be made during the period under consideration.
82.       Relative cost of lending could be lowered by improving the working
efficiency of the staff. Incentives should be given to the staff in the form
of a premium system that would award premiums for targets achieved in im-
proving the ratio between overdues and portfolio at the beginning and the end
of each year. A premium system of that kind would simultaneously take into
consideration improvements in loan disbursements and in recovery rates, the
latter having a big influence on the liquidity position of CNCA. Any improve-
ment in personnel efficiency could then be measured by comparing the amount of
loans outstanding per staff member at various dates.
83.       Absolute personnel cost invariably will have to grow for both Head-
quarters/CRCA and CLCA operations as consequence of the increased recruitment
and of new personnel regulations hopefully introduced in 1976/77. It is
assumed that CLCA personnel costs grow faster than those of Headquarters/CRCA
because CLCA will employ more new staff to man additional branches.
84.       Also in the seven years projected, the cost of CLCA's lending
operations is bound to increase, both in absolute and in relative terms,
because of the increases in personnel cost as mentioned before and the
increase in financial charges as the following table shows:

85.       Because of the increase in personnel cost expected for both CLCA
and CNCA/CRCA operations, the relative cost of lending is expected to grow
slowly. However, there would be a large increase in 1979/80, the year when
additional funds from outside would be necessary to finance the projected
lending operations. After 1979/80 the relative cost of lending would grow
slowly for another two years and then start declining.
86.       The other main factors influencing the net income is the interest
income as a direct consequence of interest rates. As already pointed out
in para 44, interest rates for CLCA lending have not been changed since



ANNEX 2
Page 28
quite some time and Government is subsidizing small farmers through the
interest rates by way of compensating CLCA for the operating losses incurred
in any one year. By the same token, the Government tried to make the small
farmers program more acceptable to CNCA. Despite the fact that Government
has set priorities to assist agriculture in general and small farmers and
cooperatives in particular it must be considered as very questionable
whether subsidized interest rates are as advantageous as they look at first
glance. In the case of CLCA, the average rate for medium-term loans of 6.5%
per annum hardly covers the inflation losses and the result of an unchanged
rate would be that in the future ever-growing amounts of the State budget
would have to be made available. Normally, interest rates which will not
cover administrative costs and bad debts, do not enable an institution to
generate more loanable funds and weaken the entire structure of a credit pro-
gram. They also constrict rural development by discouraging the mobilization
of savings. As a first step to make also the interest rate for CLCA medium-
term lending more realistic and to correct the present bias against short-
term loans agreement has been reached to increase the average rate to approx-
imately 7.65% per annum.
87.       A higher increase would at present not be advisable because there
should be a slight difference in rates between CLCA and HQ/CRCA customers,
and their rates for loans to individuals cannot be augmented due to the fact
that interest for loans from commercial banks for other sectors of the eco-
nomy are between 8 and 10% per annum, and any further increase in HQ/CRCA
lending rates would damage their competitiveness.
88.       The repercussions on CLCA's projected income would be that losses
would also occur in the following years. In relation to the operating cost,
however, the losses to be compensated by Government, would decrease from
44.5% in 1974/75 to 22.6% in 1976/77 and 17.9% or 21% respectively in 1977/78
and in 1978/79. Only in 1979/80 would they start to grow again. Further
interest rate increases would become necessary if the ratio of losses to
operating cost would exceed 23%.
89.       Interest rates charged by HQ/CRCA since September 1, 1975 allow
CNCA to cover costs and to make a small profit. The rate of 8.5% for medium-
term loans to individuals should be maintained. The rate for medium-term
lending to cooperatives and farmers' associations, which at present is 7%,
would be increased to 8.5% because cooperative members at least after a few
years of operation are usually in a better financial situation than individual
farmers. However, since members of newly-created cooperatives, who were
previously landless farm workers or subsistence smallholders, have no means
for self-financing, the interest rate during the first four years of operation
of cooperatives would remain at 7%, in the fifth year it would be increased to
8% and only in the sixth year would it reach 8.5%. Interest rates for short-
term lending should not be increased at this point.

Lending Norms
91.       Lending norms for Headquarters and CRCA lending operations are ade-
quate but together with CLCA lending norms would be reviewed periodically
in order to incorporate necessary changes.  Lending norms for cooperatives (see
para 52) would be revised to the effect that cooperatives would have access
to short-term finance for agricultural inputs, also after the sixth year of
their establishment. In order to take due consideration of the total lack of
funds of the cooperative during their first years of existence, during their
first year 100% of their short-term needs would be financed.  This ratio would
decline to 80% in their second year of existence. From the third year onwards,
the financing ratio would be in line with the norm laid down in the lending
regulations. For medium-term loans to finance investments, a difference in
financing ratios would be made between initial investments and replacements.
Initial investments would be financed at a ratio of 100% during the first
four years of existence, the ratio would go down to 80% in the fifth year and
from the sixth year onwards the norm would prevail. Replacements would always
be financed at the norm ratio.
92.       The appraisal system for cooperatives as described in para 55 seems
to be adequate for cooperatives in their first years of existence, because
in this period they are very closely supervised by MARA and they normally
make standard investments only. Gradually, however, the appraisal would be
delegated the to the staff of the CRCAs so that the credit needs of each
cooperative could be individually assessed and appraised. Also the approval
of cooperative loans would be delegated to the CRCA Loan Committee. Such a
new procedure in loan appraisal and approval would simplify and shorten the
adminstrative process involved and may have the effect of increasing the loan
disbursement/commitment percentage, which at present, due to the inaccurate
appraisal with a rate of 70%, is very low.
Overdue Loans, Bad Debts and Provisions
93.       Table 22 shows principal and interest overdue at April 30, 1976
and gives a breakdown from which periods the overdue amounts originate.
Only less than half of all amounts overdue on April 30, 1976 are overdue



ANNEX 2
Page 30
for more than twenty months whereas the balance is overdue for more than two
and less than twenty months. For CLCA, the corresponding figures are 16.2%
and 83.8%, respectively, resulting in a much better picture.. The same table
undertakes an attempt to calculate that portion of all overdue amounts of
CNCA Headquarters and CRCA lending that is actually considered bad debts.
The basis for these calculations was the amounts of provision and the under-
lying principle that for amounts overdue between 15 and 26 months provisions
of 50%, for amounts overdue between 27 and 38 months provisions of 75% and
for amounts overdue more than 39 months, provisions of 100% should be made.
This principle is adopted for all CRCA individual customers whereas provi-
sions for customers of HQ are made on a case by case basis. As soon as a
loan is 100% provided for, interest calculation is ceased in order to avoid
undue inflation of accounts receivable. The ratio of provisions to overdue
amounts decreased from 28.6% in 1972-73 to 9.6% the year after and 9.2% in
1974-75, a ratio which must be considered as satisfactory. In the projec-
tions, the ratio of provisions to amounts overdue for CNCA/CRCA operations
has always been kept at 10%.
94.       At the end of 1974/75, CLCA's guarantee fund had reached the
amount of DH 7.6 million, which in sharp contrast to the percentages men-
tioned above for CNCA/CRCA operations covers 61.5% of the amounts overdue
at the end of the year.  It\has been agreed that no further amounts would be
transferred to the guarantea fund and that all future initia:L fees collected
from CLCA customers would be considered as interest income, until such time
when the guarantee fund would be lower than 10% of the amoun!:s overdue. At
that time provisions for bad debts would have to be made following the same
principles now adopted by CNCA/CRCA.
Accounting Principles and Audits
95.       CNCA loan accounting system is computerized and works satisfac-
torily. It would, however, be desirable to review the computer programming
to arrive at a more detailed breakdowrn of loan portfolio accounts to the
extent that a general distinction between collections on interest and on
principal should be made and that the loans and interest amouints would be
classified by year of origin, by due date, by beneficiary and by source of
financing under special consideration of IBRD or IDA financing. Such
modification would enable CNCA to subdivide the portfolio into overdue
and not yet due loans. For overdues the evolution of the balance would
be followed by year of origin year after year until arrears would be
fully repaid or transferred to the bad debt account or finally written
off.  For loans not yet due the breakdown of loans by maturity date would
give CNCA management valuable information for forecasting caslh flows.
96.       Since the financial year 1971/72, audits are undertaken by an
independent company. Initially, the audit reports were finalized too late
after close of financial year to be of any value and did not rnake any recom-
mendations with respect to accounting principles and internal controls. The
finalization dates of the reports have now greatly improved and recommenda-
tions to CNCA management are made in separate letters. It is recommended



ANNEX 2
Page 31
that CNCA for future balance sheets should also adopt the system of breaking
down assets in current and non-current assets and liabilities in current and
non-current liabilities in order to make their own balance sheet more easily
comparable to the balance sheet evolved by the auditors. It is also recom-
mended that CNCA consider writing off bad debts a certain number of years
after they have been fully provided for, and if no repayment can be expected.
Financial Gap
97.       As the cash flow in Table 19 shows, the proposed IBRD loan together
with the proposed loan of the Arab Fund, would cover all finance requirements
until and ineluding 1978/79.  From 1978/79 onwards additional funds would be
required for both HQ/CRCA and CLCA operations which have been considered in
the projected income statement with an interest charge of 10% per annum. Over
the last four years, the cost of funds has been between 2 and 3% for CNCA and
slightly lower for CLCA. They are expected to increase to approximately 4.4%
for CNCA and approximately 5.1% for CLCA in financial year 1981/82 (see Table 8).

Terms of Reference for Study on CNCA Training Needs
1.        Evaluate the existing CNCA staff training program.
2.        Identify  the requirements within CNCA for the following types of
training for different levels of staff:
(a)    for junior staff:  procedures of credit administration and
bookkeeping; basic agricultural recommendations related to
inputs for which credit is provided;
(b)    for intermediate staff:  farm evaluation and credit admin-
istration for loans to medium income farmers, and
(c)    for senior staff:  banking procedures.
In addition, identify and define training requirements of senior and
intermediate staff in management, supervision and training skills.
3.        Examine the existing training facilities within Morocco in the
field of banking and agricultural credit (particularly the Banking Institute
at the University, and the Rural Development and Extension Training Center,
and National School of Agriculture at Meknes), and determine whether a
separate institution will be necessary to provide the training required
by CNCA or whether facilities could be added to an existing institution.
4.        Make recommendations on the following points for an expanded
CNCA training program:
(a)    nature of training to be offered:  length and content of
courses for different levels of staff; entrance requirements,
and student numbers;
(b)    requirement for new teaching staff and training necessary
for them;
(c)    facilities required, siting and cost;
(d)    administration of training facilities and organization
of training within CNCA.
5.        The training system must permit close liaison with on-going in-field,
in-service training, and must allow staff to be released for central training
course. Make recommendations on how these are to be achieved.

Representative Farm Models
A. Assumptions and Model Descriptions
Assumptions
1.        The purpose of the preparation and analysis of representative farm
models is to illustrate the impact that the Project is expected to have on
its beneficiaries. The models estimate the income received by farmers at the
present time, project the changes in income likely to occur as a result of
Project investments, quantify the benefits that will result from the Project
and demonstrate the financial incentive to farmers to invest under the Project.
2.        The large number of beneficiaries and wide range of conditions under
which they operate have necessitated a number of simplifications in the prepara-
tion and analysis of farm models:
(i) Only the major crops grown have been included in the models;
(ii) Standard input and product prices have been used, although
some variation occurs in practice as a result of locational
factors;
(iii) Farmers have been assumed to have no long-term indebtedness
at the present time; although such an assumption is probably
not correct, it does not affect the estimate of incremental
benefits from the Project;
(iv)  Family labor has not been costed and family consumption
has not been included as income, but both have been quanti-
fied separately.
The Models
3.        Model 1:  Well Drilling and Pump.  This is a small 6 ha farm in a
rainfed area. The farmer grows hard wheat, barley and maize in an area whose
average rainfall is around 320 mm (e.g., Safi or Essaouira).  Yields are low.
The farmer also owns a cow (providing milk for family consumption) and 50
sheep, grazing on collective lands and fed with straw in the winter and
during dry periods.  The investment (well and pump) would allow the farmer
to grow potatoes on part of the land devoted to maize. The investment is
authorized by the Technical Services of the Ministry of Agriculture to prevent
overpumping. In case of a dry well the farmer must repay the loan, unless
he took a special insurance coverage. As a second stage, the farmer may
introduce early vegetables once his cultivation methods have improved.  The
farmer is a CLCA client (Part A of the Project).



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.         Model 2:  Two Draft Animals and Basic Agricultural Implements.
This is a small 8 ha farm in the grain-producing zone of Morocco (e.g.,
Berrechid) with no possibility of irrigation. One fourth of the surface
is left fallow and grain (hard wheat, barley and maize) is grown - the
rest; the farmer rents plow, harrow and draft animals for land preparation.
The farmer also owns four cows (milk is sold at springtime when production
exceeds the family consumption) and 80 sheep (young male sheep are sold).
They are fed on fallow and on collective land, with the resulting risk of
feed limitation. The investment (2 mules, a plow and a harrow) allows for
all the land to be cultivated. The resulting availability of straw and
stubbles will help eliminate the feeding risk by allowing the building of
feed reserves. The farmer may be a CLCA borrower or a member of a newly-
created Agrarian Reform Cooperative (Part A or D of the Project). Both
assumptions will be tested in the cash flow analysis.
5.         Model 3:  Two In-Calf Heifers and a Stable.  This is a small 13
ha rainfed grain farm (e.g., near Oued-Zem). Grain (hard wheat, barley
and maize) are grown with low yields due to poor climatic conditions (425 mm)
and lack of fertilizers. Land is prepared by the farmer with his own draft
animals and implements. Except for the two mules there is no livestock. The
investment (two crossbred in-calf heifers and construction of a stable for the
two cows and their calves) will also result in cultivation of one ha of vetch
oats which will receive adequate rain (barley is used to supplement vetch
oats). Enough feed will be available for the crossbred cattle. The farmer
is a CLCA client or a member of a 6-year old Agrarian Reform Cooperative (Part
A or D of the Project). Both assumptions will be tested in the cash flow
analysis.
6.         Model 4:  Four In-Calf Heifers and a Stable.  This is a medium 66 ha
rainfed farm (e.g., in the Tadla).  Hard wheat, barley and small broad beans
are the main crops; sugar beet (under a comprehensive crop program) and
bersim are grown on irrigated land. The farmer owns a tractor and rents a
combine harvester; he initially owns two cows. The investment (four in-calf
Frisian heifers and a stable) allows for an increase of the herd. At Year Il
the herd would number 29 cows and heifers and 18 calves. Male calves will
be sold when one-year old, female calves will increase the herd and old cows
will be sold after the sixth calving. Artificial insemination will be pro-
vided free of charge by the livestock technicians of the Ministry of Agri-
culture. Twelve hectares will be irrigated, half sugar beet, half bersim,
with a second crop of maize forage on 3 ha. Forage produced by the farm
cover the needs of the herd until Year 10. The farmer is a CRCA client (Part
B of the Project) but also borrows from the ORMVA (or the SP) for his short-
term needs for sugar beet (comprehensive crop program).
7.         Model 5:  Combine Harvester.  This is a large 120 ha rainfed farm
growing grain and pulses (e.g., near Settat). Land preparation and transport
are done by tractor, but harvest is done by hand, necessitating a great number
of seasonal workers which are not always available. The investment (combine
harvester) will eliminate the problem of seasonal labor recruitment; it will
also reduce harvest losses and thus improve yields by one quint:al per hectare.
Once the harvest is completed on the farm, harvest custom work will be done on
other farms, thus supplementing the farm's income. The farmer is a CRCA client
(Part B of the Project).



ANNEX 4
Page 3
8.        Model 6:  Tractor and Land Preparation Equipment.  This is a medium
60 ha rainfed farm in an area where average rainfall is 350 mm per year, e.g.,
near Oued-Zem. The farmer grows wheat and peas in a two-year crop rotation;
land preparation is done with five pairs of mules. The investment (a wheel
tractor, a 3-disk plow and an offset disk) will allow better land preparation.
An improved variety of wheat will be grown, fertilizers and herbicides will
be used, resulting in better yields with the same cropping pattern, while they
would have been much less efficient if the land had not been prepared with a
tractor. The tractor is also used for custom work on other farms, thus
supplementing the farm's income.  The farmer is a CRCA client (Part B of the
Project).
9.        Model 7:  Plantation and Maintenance of Citrus Orchard.  This is a
medium 25 ha irrigated farm in the Tadla plain.  In addition to 4 ha of citrus,
the farmer grows soft wheat, small broad beans, alfalfa (sold outside) and
sugar beet (under a comprehensive crop program). Some of the land is left
fallow.  He owns a tractor and rents a combine harvester.  Yields are good.
The investment (citrus plantation ) will allow the farmer to increase
citrus production from 4 to 10 ha by eliminating the area left fallow.  He
will double his alfalfa acreage (2 ha to 4 ha) to be able to trade alfalfa
against manure with livestock breeders, using the manure for the citrus trees.
Full production will be reached after 12 years. The farmer is a CRCA client
(Part B of the Project).
10.       Model 8:  Well Drilling and Pump.  This is a small 4 ha rainfed
farm near Casablanca.  The farmer grows hard wheat and chick peas with aver-
age yields.  He has been a CLCA client.  He also works part-time in a neigh-
boring, large early vegetable production farm. The investment (well drilling
and purchase of a pump), authorized by the Technical Services of the Ministry
of Agriculture, will allow the farmer to switch from rainfed crops to early
vegetable production, partially for export and partially for the Casablanca
market. In case of a dry well, the farmer must repay the loan, unless he took
a special insurance coverage. A three-year cropping pattern will allow a 150%
cropping intensity, wheat and forage crops being associated with early tomato
and potato production. In the first stage, forage production will be sold to
other farmers; in a second stage, the farmer would buy for himself some dairy
cattle. The farmer will become a CRCA client (Part B of the Project).

When it is included as part of the income, the net farm income would become:

For purposes of comparison, per capita GNP in Morocco in 1975 prices is esti-
mated at US$470 in 1975 and is forecast to increase to US$520 in 1980 and about
US$560 in 1985. A number of observations can be made on the basis of the
analysis presented in the tables attached to this Annex. The more interesting
or salient points are briefly discussed in the following paragraph.
14.       Fiscal Income.  The fiscal income of the farms is as follows:
Model                            Fiscal Income (DH)
Without    With        % Increment

It clearly bears little relation to the actual net income.

15.       Farm Size.  The farm income per cultivated ha is as follows:

The large farms (Models 4, 5 and 6) are clearly less intensive than smaller
farms (Models 1, 2) and especially less intensive than irrigated farms (Models
7 and 8 post project). The correlation between farm size and income is low
for farms where most of the income is derived from livestock.

/1   Including family consumption.
The decrease in farm income per ha in the case of Model 2 is due not only
to a decrease in relative intensity with the cultivation of fallow land but
also to the relative importance of the income from livestock.
16.       Return to Labor.  Family labor has not been costed.  Only the
smaller farms use family labor. The large grain farms (Models 4 and 5) are
not family farms but are run by absentee landlords under a tenancy or share-
cropping system.

8                    42        300           614
The family labor requirements would increase in all cases but Model 6 (tractor
purchase).  The return to labor (farm income per day of family labor) would
therefore be:

8                      18.50               46.93
This compares with a standard salary of DH 6.5/day. The farms would there-
fore be profitable even if family labor was costed.
17.       Permanent Labor and Seasonal Labor.  The hired labor needed by
the farmer would be as follows:

Model 5 (combine harvester) shows the seasonality of labor requirements (see
Appendix 1.1).

are CRCA clients.
Subsidies are paid at the time of the investment onLy in the case
of Model 2.

These rates are average for the various short-term loans that the farmer may
receive.  The short-term loans are assumed to be outstanding 8 months on the
average.
Financial Rates of Return

ANNEX 5
APPRAISAL OF
A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MOROCCO
CNCA Future Lending Program and Project Cost
1.        The attached tables show the forecast CNCA lending program until
1981-82. On the basis of the existing policy objectives for the Moroccan
agricultural sector and taking into account past experience, the agricultural
investments likely to take place have been forecast for the country as a whole.
The areas to be cultivated and the resulting short-term production needs have
also been estimated. Only a portion of these investments and production
needs is likely to be financed by CNCA, and the lending program has been com-
puted accordingly. In some cases where this approach was not feasible (such
as in the case of the CLCAs), future loans have been forecast only on the
basis of past trends.
2.        Table 1 gives the basic assumptions regarding the physical invest-
ments to be financed by CNCA (Headquarters and CRCAs). Tables 2, 3, and 4
show the resulting lending program for HQ and CRCAs. Table 5 shows the lend-
ing program for the CLCAs. These forecast loan commitments have been used to
arrive at the forecast financial statements of CNCA (Annex 2, Tables 19 to 21).
3.        To define the Project itself as part of this lending program, one
has to consider only the period of January 1, 1977 to August 31, 1979, to ex-
clude loans for non-productive purposes and loans to companies, to discount
for those loans that are committed but never disbursed and to eliminate some
loans that would not be re-eligible for refinancing for procurement and other
reasons. The subborrower's contributions and Governnent grants have to be
added to loan amounts to arrive at Project costs. Table 6 is a detailed Proj-
ect Cost table and Table 7 is a detailed Project Financing table. Physical
contingencies average 5%. Price contingencies have been computed on the basis
of the forecast price increases in Table 1 for each type of investment; they
average 15.4% for the local cost and 29.6% for the foreign exchange cost, or
19.9% for total cost.

A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT

Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole
Monitoring and Evaluation
A. Introduction
1.        In order to be able to assess the progress being made in the imple-
mentation of the Project it is essential that a simple monitoring and evalua-
tion system be set up by CNCA, preferably with some guidance and support from
the Bank. The purpose of a monitoring system is basically to provide project
management with timely information regarding the effectiveness with which
project inputs are utilized and project outputs produced. This flow of in-
formation being generated by the actual implementation of the Project in turn
allows management to take all necessary steps to correct the course of the
Project underway and ensure both its effective realization and the attainment
of its objectives. Furthermore, monitoring systems also allow for an on-going
evaluation of the impact of the Project insofar as they provide management with
the basic data necessary to draw conclusions to the extent to which benefic-
iaries have been affected by the Project.
2.        It should be understood that a monitoring system carries the data
collection effort one step beyond the traditional reporting function. While
reporting remains essentially an inventory of Project inputs and outputs, the
monitoring system allows for a more global approach as it relates the data
gathered at the reporting level to the overall objectives of the Project.
Both functions--reporting and monitoring--are equally important for adequate
project management. A brief description of the efforts presently being car-
ried out on both levels is followed by a few suggestions as to how these can
further be developed into an effective monitoring system.
3.        Indeed, the quality of the preparation report submitted by CNCA for
this Project and the issues it dealt with as well as the existing supervisory
surveys imply that this institution has now reached a level of sophistication
at which it can easily put such a monitoring system into effect. Moreover,
CNCA management is acutely aware of its usefulness as a tool for improving
its own internal operations. In order for this system to be most beneficial
it is essential that CNCA be allowed to design its own, taking into consider-
ation its manpower, organizational and budgetary constraints as well as the
local idiosyncracies. Above all, the monitoring system should at all times
be kept simple, easy to operate and cost efficient. Its chief purpose is
indeed to provide the minimum information needed for effective project
management.

B. Reporting
Existing Data Gathering
4.        At present, three types of data collection efforts are carried out
on a systematic basis: a brief overview of the farm by the loan agent when
the customer applies for the loan, a survey of Agrarian Reform Cooperatives
and the-summarized quarterly reports submitted by CNCA to the Bank.
Income Statement at Sub-project Appraisal
5.        These statements are completed by the loan agent according to
answers submitted by the future borrower (in practice, however, agents often
supply most of the information themselves). Their purpose is to assess the
future income stream of the borrower and his expected cropping pattern for the
first year of repayment. The forms are basically well-constructed and provide
information on acreages, prices, yields, temporary labor requirements, fer-
tilizer and seed expenses for each crop as well as the income and expenses
generated by cattle farming and activities not related to the farm.
6.        These surveys are both complete and detailed and when aggregated,
they would provide most of the information required for an adequate evaluation
process. In practice, however, their usefulness is unfortunately limited,
due to several factors. In-depth questioning is seldom performed due to
time constraints and to the embarrassment they reportedly create among both
interviewer and interviewee. Furthermore, the data submitted by the farmer
is often erroneous or misleading. Consequently, regional data on yields and
prices end up being applied in lieu of actual data obtained at the farm.
Agrarian Reform Cooperative Survey
7.        Cooperatives are not surveyed at appraisal by CNCA. All information
pertaining to their creditworthiness is transmitted to CNCA by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Agrarian Reform. To remedy this situation, CNCA set up an
evaluation questionnaire covering all financial information of interest to
CNCA. Past and future cropping patterns are described and all expenses are
recorded. A physical inventory is made of all existing equipment. Lastly,
a qualitative assessment is to be made by the surveyor of the overall manage-
ment of the cooperative, its organizational performance, its accounting system
and any particular problems that this cooperative may be having, be it in-
ternally or with respect to CNCA. A similar, although more simplified, survey
also covers pre-cooperative mechanization groups. So far, only a few such
surveys on cooperatives and pre-cooperative groups have been conducted in a
limited number of regions.
Quarterly Bank Reports
8.        Under the terms of the Second Loan Agreement, CNCA submitted summary
reports to the Bank on a quarterly basis. In general, they were received by
the Bank with several months' delay. The typical format included an overview



ANNEX 8
Page 3
of the latest developments in Moroccan agriculture (climatic conditions, Gov-
ernment decisions, etc.), a brief report on changes in personnel (new training
programs, new recruits, etc.) and lastly, a breakdown of loan applications,
approvals and rejections by interest rate and investment category (I through IV)
during the previous quarter. Loans were given both in amounts and in numbers.
Suggestions for Improving the Reporting System on Input Data
9.        While the basic structure of the system is complete and well-designed,
it seems that with limited additional effort more data on project inputs could
be obtained within CNCA, which would facilitate project management.
10.       At present, CNCA only keeps a record of the number of loans approved
by investment item. Gross calculations are needed to deduce the approximate
number of beneficiaries and the number of items financed. It is important
that CNCA set up a data collection system, with the help of its computer
facilities to keep an on-going tally of the following items:
Number of Beneficiaries. Although CNCA does not know how
many customers are being served, it keeps no record of the
number of individuals that have benefitted from medium-
term CNCA credit under particular loan categories (such as
citrus plantations, dairy farm development, etc.). Such
a count would help assess the number of farmers having
actually been served by the Project. At present, any cus-
tomer receiving a loan who did not already have an out-
standing loan (be it short-term or medium-term) is consid-
ered to be a "new" customer. In addition, no breakdown is
made by investment category and the number of loans is only
an inaccurate estimate of the number of beneficiaries. A
breakdown of beneficiaries by income (fiscal and/or actual)
should also be established.
Number of Items Financed. For each investment category, a
tally should ideally be kept of each item financed so as to
measure more accurately the output under the Loan. This is
only possible at present for loans which cover one single
item (tractors or combine harvesters) as the number of loans
equals the number of items financed. However, the number of
cows purchased, hectares destoned, cleared or irrigated,
citrus trees planted, stables built--to mention but a few--
remains unknown. Little extra effort would be required from
each regional and local office to maintain a count of the
number of items financed as this information appears on
every loan application.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
Number of loans and total amounts by investment item are
presently recorded solely in terms of commitments. This
figure could be useful for monitoring purposes if it were
submitted on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, as it
would allow for a closer following of the progress of the
Project. For reporting purposes, however, these figures
would best be recorded in terms of actual disbursements.
Although both figures tend to coincide in the longer run,
it is of greater value for evaluating the impact of the
Loan to obtain data of what has actually been accomplished
under the Project.
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives should be subjected to the same
detailed information-gathering process as individual applicants.
Unlike what took place under the previous Project where all
investments to such entities were lumped together under a
single heading, lending to cooperatives should be broken down
by investment item and by cooperative income. Items financed
for cooperatives and pre-cooperative mechanization groups
should be counted in the same way as those for individual
farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture holds considerable
information on the operational aspects of the cooperatives
and it is suggested that CNCA work in closer contact with
the Ministry in order to maintain itself updated on both
input and output data.
New Quarterly Reports
il.       The information described above can easily be collected at both
local and regional levels and forwarded to CNCA Headquarters for consolida-
tion. It is indeed readily available on file. The permanent collection
effort would no doubt be smaller than trying to reconstruct most input data
on an ex-post basis after the completion of the Project. It is therefore
suggested that the existing format of the quarterly reports be expanded to
include a table showing the number of loans approved and their total amounts,
the number of items financed (in hectares or in units) and the number of
beneficiaries by income. This information should be broken down by invest-
ment item ("code objet") as well as by investment category and by interest
rate. A regional breakdown should be available but is probably not necessary
on a quarterly basis.
Output Data
12.       More thorough information on the actual output of the Project can
easily be collected by loan agents while performing their subproject appraisal
survey. As far as possible, these agents should be made to understand the
importance of their task and the relevance of the income statement as both a
tool for appraising a subproject and a source of information for evaluating



ANNEX 8
Page 5
the overall impact of the Loan. Additional training, or at least some sensi-
tivization of the agents to the importance of this task, should take place.
This would no doubt contribute to tracing the quality of the statements as
they are presently constructed and make them a more reliable and valuable tool
for CNCA itself. Furthermore, the total credit needs of a customer could thus
be more readily assessed as the income statement would give a global picture
of the farm rather than merely limit itself to being a justification for a
particular loan application. Indeed, in many cases, the farmer will only
submit the minimum data required to secure a particular loan--thereby allowing
CNCA to catch but a partial glimpse of his operation.
13.       Farmer incomes are obtained when the customer applies for a Loan.
His fiscal income is submitted and his real income is assessed by means of the
income statement at appraisal. No records are held, however, of a distribution
of loan beneficiaries by income bracket (be it fiscal or real). It is sug-
gested that such information be systematically collected and kept on file so
as to build, on a yearly basis, the CLCA-CRCA customer distribution curve by
income level. Such a distribution, when compared with the distribution of the
population as a whole (both by number of customers and by the loan amount they
represent) would enable CNCA to steer its lending program into reflecting more
accurately its objectives. The lending program would thus become overall a more
sensitive tool for carrying out its policies.
14.       In order to improve the accuracy of the real income figures, it is
important that loan agents also obtain the following data:
Actual yields. Whenever possible, the regional averages applied
to the farm income statements should be replaced by actual yields
in order to take into account the peculiarities of each farm. By
discounting climatic conditions, a clearer vision could be ob-
tained of the impact of increased mechanization or improved
technology on farm productivity.
Cropping patterns. Cropping pattern plans for the following
season are seldom applied in practice. A record of actual
patterns for the past seasons would facilitate the assessment
of a farmer's effective past income (as opposed to his expected
future income which is the only figure presently obtained).
Departures from previous plans should be briefly explained.
15.       To facilitate the cost-benefit analysis of the Project on an ex-post
basis, it is essential that price series of both inputs and outputs be main-
tained to date. Farmgate prices for most agricultural products (grains, citrus,
milk, meat, wool, live cattle, etc.) should be collected for each region of
Morocco yearly either from the Ministry of Agriculture, the specialized agen-
cies (OCE, ONICL, etc.) or the regional CNCA offices themselves. This same
process should apply to input prices as well (fertilizers, fuel, seeds, equip-
ment, livestock, labor, etc.). Most of these prices are readily available



ANNEX 8
Page 6
from either Government publications or from the loan applications themselves.
A systematic yearly collection would eliminate the difficulties of having to
construct these price series several years later upon completion of the
Project.
16.       Reports.  CNCA should submit to the Bank on a yearly basis the above-
mentioned customer income distribution patterns, along with regional informa-
tion on yields for all major crops and prices of inputs and outputs.
C. Monitoring and Evaluation
Existing Experimental System: In-depth Farm Surveys
17.       Recognizing that the deficiencies of the subproject appraisal surveys
prevented them from obtaining any relevant information on the impact of their
operations, and in order to better assess the seasonal financial needs of
their customers, CNCA Headquarters launched an in-depth survey of a limited
sample of farmers to be conducted in eight regions of the country. So far,
sixty farmers have been interviewed in four regions (Casablanca, Agadir, El
Jadida and Khouribga). The coastal regions involved in export crops (vege-
tables and citrus) were the first to be surveyed as the task on these farms
was considerably facilitated by the existence of accounts with OCE. Thus
far, only customers with long-standing CNCA accounts have been visited as it
was felt that only they would be sufficiently understanding and receptive to
an in-depth survey of their financial position. The sample wcls sufficiently
scattered within a given area so as to prevent any communication between
farmers and previous preparation on their side. It is expected that this
survey will have been extended to the eight chosen regions by the end of 1976.
No plans for any further expansion to other regions have yet been drawn out.
18.       Typically, a farmer is visited by two surveyors from CNCA Head-
quarters who will spend two full days on the farm questioning him and recon-
structing his accounts.  Most farmers not producing for export do not even
carry rudimentary accounts so no written testimony of revenues and expenses
is generally available. The surveyors are accompanied by a driver from the
local CNCA office to lead them to the farm. No loan agent is present and
it is made clear to the interviewee that this survey is totally unrelated
to his CNCA account and that no information provided will be used in
connection with his account.
19.       First, a detailed inventory of the farm is made which includes
cropping patterns, livestock and equipment, insurance costs, taxes, family
consumption and manpower needs; loans outstanding from other banks and
their interest rates and due dates are also recorded. In addition, a sheet
is filled out for each crop, indicating the expenses incurred and the data
for every type of work related to that crop. Six types of questionnaires
are available to meet the requirements of each crop (grains and pulses,



ANNEX 8
Page 7
vegetables, industrial crops, fodder crops, new plantations and plantation
maintenance). A similar questionnaire is completed for animal production,
comprising monthly feeding expenses, veterinary care, transportation ex-
penses, labor and stable-litter expenses. Proceeds from sales of milk,
calves, fattened calves and cull cows are also registered on a monthly basis.
A monthly income statement for the farm as a whole can thus be constructed
from these questionnaires. A cash flow statement is also drawn up to show
the monthly fluctuations in the farmer's cash position. This will allow
CNCA to evaluate what the monthly needs of its customers are so as to
release their working capital credits on a monthly basis, thereby preventing
them from depositing their CNCA loans in other banks.
Recommendations for a Monitoring and Evaluation System
20.       It is recognized that relatively little information is readily
available at the farm level, since few farmers maintain accounts. An in-
ventory of existing assets could be made but it would only give a stock
concept of a farmer's income.  This further happens to be the only concept
presently expected from him. Indeed, the agricultural income tax is based
exclusively on a stock concept, as opposed to a flow concept. Consequently,
no accounts are required of a farmer by the tax collector. Admittedly, an
on-going evaluation of the Project's impact on the income flow of its bene-
ficiaries would require a costly and over-sophisticated system which CNCA
is not ready to operate at present. Yearly in-depth surveys of all customers
to establish their stream of income is indeed an impossible task at this
point.
21.       It is recommended, however, that the survey described above be
systematically applied on a yearly basis to a larger sample which would be
representative of the CNCA customer pool in terms of income (stock and flow),
agricultural activity and regional distribution. A sample size of approxi-
mately 200 farmers may prove adequate--divided between 100 CRCA and 100 CLCA
customers. Each interviewee would be surveyed at least three times under the
Project and such a sequence should allow for a relevant analysis of the im-
pact of the loan.
22.       The present format of the interview should be altered to reflect
its changing purpose. More than being a tool for evaluating a farmer's cash
flow, it should identify any observable changes in a farmer's income pattern
and isolate the factors causing these changes. To this effect, a certain
number of standard indicators are available which should be closely monitored:
-    Productivity.  Variations in yields should be followed and
their causes identified (climatic conditions, increased use
of inputs such as water, machinery and fertilizers, improved
seed and soil quality, better timing of sowing and harvesting,
etc.



ANNEX 8
Page 8
Total output variations, when not attributable to changes
in yields should also be investigated (cropping patterns,
for example).
Income variations should be thoroughly assessed. Factors
altering revenue patterns (prices, volume and quality of
output) and expense patterns (maintenance, labor, taxes,
etc.) should be identified.
Employment effects can be assessed in terms of net variations
in manpower needs (such as extra man/days absorbed or re-
leased). As far as possible, variations in the structure of
manpower needs should also be identified (new seasonal pat-
terns or new skilled/unskilled mix).
-    Indirect benefits not immediately quantifiable should also
be assessed when possible: increased mechanization of
neighboring lands due to imitation effects, changes in con-
sumption habits or lifestyle patterns, etc.
These data should be made available to the farmers so that they can benefit
from the feedback of information.
Reporting Requirements
23.       The findings of the monitoring and evaluation survey should be
reported on an annual basis. This report should include a brief analysis
along the following lines:
(i) Extent to which the chosen sample survey is in fact a
reliable yardstick of the progress of the Project;
(ii) Whether anticipated results are indeed observed;
(iii) Relating actual results to project inputs;
(iv)  Examination of whether Project objectives and cost
figures require any modifications.
It should be stressed at this point that effective monitoring of a project
partly depends on the timeliness of the reports. Information is to be re-
ceived sufficiently early to allow for corrective measures to be implemented.
Delays such as those experienced under the Second Project would defeat the
purpose of a monitoring system. At Project completion, information gathered
through this evaluation system should be compiled into a completion report
that will give Project management a more global overview of the impact of
the Loan.



ANNEX 8
Page 9
D. Organization, Staffing and Bank Assistance
24.        In view of the work already being performed by CNCA and described
above, it seems that this institution is conceptually ready for the imple-
mentation of a simple but effective monitoring system. Only budgetary and
organizational constraints remain to be dealt with.
25.        It is recommended that the ultimate responsibility for the monitor-
ing and evaluation systems be delegated to the Credit Department (Direction
du Credit) at CNCA Headquarters, as this department is presently in charge
of data collection regarding the impact of CNCA activities. CNCA will design
its own system and submit a draft proposal to the Bank during negotiations of
the Third Project. This proposal should indicate a clear understanding of the
conceptual framework underlying the system and should include a methodology
for selecting the target group, a suggested format for interviews, a list of
key indicators to be monitored and the way in which they will be monitored and
a timetable for carrying out the survey and presenting the conclusions.
26.       While the design of the system and the responsibility for carrying
it out lie with CNCA Headquarters, the actual execution may be jointly per-
formed by Headquarters and by CRCA offices. The 100 CRCA surveys can be
carried out at the regional level without unduly overburdening the regional
offices. Four man/days are required per survey. An average of four surveys
per CRCA would have to be carried out--involving a total of 16 man days per
CRCA. This would include travel time which would remain relatively limited
due to the short distances involved. The other 100 CLCA surveys would have
to be conducted at least initially by a team of surveyors from Headquarters.
CLCA offices are not ready to provide the staff necessary for such extensive
field work. This team of two would travel throughout the country and conduct
the surveys on the individual farmers and on the cooperatives as well. They
would be trained by and report to the head of the Credit Department. They
would also be in charge of processing the results and of drawing conclusions
and recommendations. At a second stage, CLCA offices should be able to perform
their own monitoring work. A schedule for complete regionalization of the
monitoring and evaluation should be drafted.
27.        By being exposed to other agricultural credit institutions with
effective monitoring systems, the CNCA Credit Department would no doubt
develop the ability to design its own monitoring system and handle any
organizational or staffing problems which may arise. The Bank can obviously
play a key role both in facilitating this exposure and in financing the addi-
tional expense of setting up such a system. Arrangements will be made to
offer CNCA representatives the opportunity to visit one or several similar
institutions abroad that are running successful monitoring systems from which
lessons can be drawn that will benefit CNCA. In addition, the Bank will try
to provide for a monitoring specialist to accompany the first supervision
mission and counsel CNCA regarding the early implementation steps. Funding
for additional expenses associated wtth operating the monitoring system (such
as training, foreign travel, possibly use of an expatriate consultanc) will be
provided under Category F of the Loan.

A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MOROCCO
Research Program in Vegetable Cultivation (Massa Irrigated Perimeter)
A sprinkler irrigation system covering 18,000 ha in the Massa area
south of Agadir was completed during 1974. The climate in the area is suit-
able for early vegetable production; the soil is sandy calcarious. Farmers
have been settled in the area and are starting production with irrigation.
However thus far only tomatoes (less than 200 ha) have been grown on a com-
mercial scale in rotation with alfalfa and wheat. Problems with packaging
and marketing the tomato production have also been encountered and are likely
to increase if no corrective measures are taken. Thus the Governnent of
Morocco has asked the Bank to finance an integrated vegetable marketing proj-
ect in the Massa, whose preparation is under way. Financing of the prepara-
tion study (undertaken by consultants) is provided by the Bank under Loan
1201 (Doukkala Irrigation). To overcome the lack of applied agricultural re-
search under Massa's conditions, the Bank has recommended urgent initiation
of a crash applied research program to identify suitable vegetable varieties
and establish sound production data for projecting future volumes. The re-
search program is undertaken as a joint Moroccan/foreign research institute
effort. The estimated cost of this program is $350,000 (of which about
$300,000 in foreign exchange). Funds are also included to purchase research
equipment for this study. The Terms of Reference are attached. Several
international research organizations were invited to submit proposals. A
research team from the University of Arizona was selected. The program
started in late 1976 and will continue for a duration of two years.

Terms of Reference
INTRODUCTION
1.        Morocco has already developed an established export market of fresh
vegetables in Europe, mainly to France. Early production is of great import-
ance in fulfilling market demand at certain periods and maintaining a posi-
tion in the export market. A preliminary export market analysis of Moroccan
early vegetables shows that European markets could absorb increasing quanti-
ties of high quality vegetables supplied at the right time (December-March).
Market promotion and testing in EEC markets (other than France) should be ex-
plored with supplying sufficient quantities of the suitable quality vege-
tables consumed in these markets.
2.        Production seems to be the limiting factor.  The quantities and
kinds of vegetables supplied at the right time are insufficient to satisfy
existing export demand and to create potential new markets. In order to ex-
pand production of high quality early vegetables for export, Morocco has dev-
eloped the Massa sprinkler irrigation scheme, south of Agadir, covering an
area of 18,300 ha which will be completed by mid-1976.
3.        The choice of the location is a logical one due to its climatic
advantages over other regions. However, to achieve the envisaged targets for
early production of vegetables, several constraints have to be overcome
through coordination at each level from production to marketing.
4.        The project crop production plan for the region was based on re-
sults and experimentation carried out in other areas and extrapolated to
Massa's conditions. Because of the unique soil conditions (sandy calcarious
with a pH of 8.2-8.8), the sprinkler irrigation system and a multitude of
other production factors particular to the area, there is now an extremely
urgent need to carry out experiments to develop and adopt specific produc-
tion techniques within the Massa area. This could be attained by a crash
applied research program which should make substantial use of application
of research information already available from extensive research efforts in
university-based institutions in other countries with conditions similar to
those in the Massa region. It is of paramount importance to start the sug-
gested applied research program as early as possible in order to have a



ANNEX 9

Page 2
realistic basis for crop planning, to feed the extension service and ulti-
mately the farmers with practical solutions to their production problems,
and provide preliminary results to the consultants carrying out the feas-
ibility study.
MANPOWER NEEDS
5.        A technical assistance program is needed for an initial two-year
period starting as early as possible in order to develop experimnents during
1976-1977 growing season. Manpower needs, fields of specialization and tasks
are as follows:

Time:       A total of 6 months with 2 months initially followed by
regular visits (4 man months) during the 2 year pro-
gram period.
Experience: Horticultural and/or field crops research, organization,
and management of agricultural research.
Responsibilities:
1.  Prepare inventory of horticultural and agronomic
information relevant to Massa region.
2.  Identify a detailed (applied research) program
with priorities in view of Massa's conditions.
3.  Outline a technical assistance program acceptable
to the Moroccan Government and the Bank.

Moroccan Counterpart: Director of ORMVASM (Mr. Lamtiri)
II.   Position:   Horticulturist
Time:       24 months
Experience: Vegetable crops specialist in semi-arid areas with ex-
tensive experience in carrying applied research work
for the production of early vegetables under field
conditions and protected cultivation.



ANNEX 9
Appendix 9.1
Page 3
Responsibilities:
1.  Selection of new crops and early varieties of
vegetables crops for the export market. Multi-
purpose use for export, local and processing
should be kept in mind.
2.  Soil amendments:  Use of manure as it is now ap-
plied is of doubtful value and added tremendous
cost to production. Use of cover crops should
be studied.
3.  Kinds, ratios, time, and methods of fertilizer
applications not only N-P-K elements but micro-
elements too (no work has been done in Morocco
on microelements).
4.  Use of fertilizers through sprinkler irrigation
system and water requirements studies in relation
to climate, soil and other cultural practices.
Experimentation with drip irrigation techniques
under Massa's conditions.
5.  Pesticide trials of approved dosages in export
countries (all vegetable pests exist in Morocco).
6.  Cultural studies to assure earliness of prime
quality and large percentage of exportable yield
under Massa conditions, i.e. use of plastic
mulches. Economy of these cultural practices is
the key for its application.
7.  Studies on harvesting methods and post harvest
physiology of produce from the field to the market.
8.  Application of technology in plastic house produc-
tion of vegetables under desert areas. Growing of
vegetables in the Massa in plastic tunnels has to
be adjusted to climatic conditions in the Massa.
Many factors are involved, among which are:
(a) Selection of structure and plastic (Ultra-
violet impregnated resins).
(b) Climatic factors in the plastic house for
different crops, e.g. adequate ventilation,
carbon dioxide not less than 300 ppm, no
high relative humidity, not too much solar
radiation, supplemental head for cucumbers
at night during cold nights.



ANNEX 9
Appendix 9.1

(c)  Cultural practices, i.e. pruning, tying,
pollination (melons, peppers), balance be-
tween vegetative growth, flower production,
fruit setting and normal fruit growth.
(d)  Management of water, use of drip irrigation,
fertilizer, pesticide needs. Reliable
monitoring of climate, water and fertilizers
using hydrothermographs, water meters and
known fertilizer formulas from research re-
sults and not from guessing or extrapolation
of field studies.
9. Soil, plants, water, nematology, entomology, plant
pathology, etc., laboratory supportive work for
accurate diagnosis of problems and providing timely
solutions.
10.  Most important is coordination of production
(farmers' fields), extension and research to grow
a high value exportable product.
Moroccan Counterpart:  Horticulturist, ORMVASM (Mr. Hassan Al-Attir).
III.   Position:   Agronomist
Time:       24 months.
Experience: Wheat and alfalfa are envisaged to occupy two-thirds of
the cultivated project area and are being growa in rota-
tion with vegetable crops. Yield improvement for these
crops will contribute tremendously to the realization of
increased economic benefits from the project. The agro-
nomist should have an extensive background in field
crops research and mainly with cereals and alfalfa.
Coordination of the studies with the Horticulturist is
essential, especially in irrigation and fertilization.
Responsibilities: The Agronomist's applied research program will
concentrate on the following areas:
1.   Fertilizers:  kinds, ratios, formulas, etc.
2.   Studying crop water requirements and use of fertil-
izers through sprinkler irrigation.
3.   Use of cover crops to improve soil texture.



ANNEX 9
Appendix 9.1
Page 5
4.   Investigation of economic means for raising crop
productivity and introduction of other forage
crops.
5.   Pest control.
Moroccan Counterpart: To be assigned.
RESEARCH FACILITIES
6.        Two experiment stations exist in the area; one is in Ait Amira, out-
side the Massa perimeter and under ORMVASM supervision. The second in Milk
Zhar, is in the Toussoussous section of the Massa region and under the super-
vision of Direction de la Recherche Agricole (DRA). Research work for the
Massa region should be concentrated in Milk Zhar since it is in the midst
of the region and representative of its growing conditions. An arrangement
should be worked out under which the station would have an adequate budget
for execution of the proposed research program, and under which the Direc-
tor of ORMVASM would be able to control the station's activities under the
program. Leaf analysis equipment at ORMVASM's laboratory in Ait Milloul
should be upgraded and complemented in accordance with the program's team
needs. DRA staff and plant pathology facilities at Ait Milloul are good.
Efforts between DRA and program staff should be coordinated with scientists
of the Institut Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan Il.
7.        Close exchange of information between program staff and the con-
sulting firm undertaking the feasibility study for project preparation is
very important to ensure formulation of a viable project.
8.        Terms of reference for the study along the lines of paragraphs 1-7
above were sent to university-based research organizations, asking them to sub-
mit proposals for the technical assistance program. Evaluation of proposals
was based on the qualifications of proposed expertise and the University's
research work on the production problems mentioned above. The University of
Arizona was selected.

Economic Analysis
Production
1.        Investment under the Project is expected to generate the following
incremental production at full development.
Quantity       Percentage of Total Production
('OOOT)                         %
Grain                            400                         12
Pulses                            50                         il
Cotton                            25                         90
Sunflower                         20                         90
Sugar beet                     2,000                         90
Sugar cane                       450                         90
Citrus                            20                          2
Olives                             1                          -
Grapes                             1                          -
Vegetables                       150                         20
Cow's milk                       380                         50
Sheep's milk                     176                         50
Beef                              15                         20
Mutton                            12                         25
The incremental production would be worth about DH 1.5 billion in current
prices.
2.        Most of the increase in grain and pulses output will be due to land
improvement (destoning and clearing of 38,500 ha) and to the purchase of draft
animals and small equipment which will allow for cultivation of about 500,000
ha; the rest of the increase will be due to tractor civilization on 42,000 ha
and to combine harvesting on 100,000 ha. The incremental production of irri-
gated industrial crops (cotton, sunflower, sugar beet and sugar cane) on about
140,000 ha will be due to the investment in tractors--without which cultiva-
tion of this land would not be possible--and to the investment in sugar cane
plantations. This overstates somewhat the benefits of the investments in
tractors since the cost of the large irrigation systems being a sunk cost is
not counted as an investment cost; however, the financial cost of water is
included as an operating cost. Investment in wells and pumps are assumed



ANNEX 10
Page 2
to result mainly in increased vegetable production. Livestock production
is given at year 10 of the Project while fruit production is given at full
maturity of the plantation. Other production includes manure, wool, other
fruits, chicken, eggs, honey and fodder. Benefits from investments in trucks,
pick-ups, stores and other buildings and in processing equipment (5.7% of
total project cost) have not been quantified per se but have been taken into
account under the pricing assumptions (maintenance of constant prices). The
benefits of mechanization investments are further discussed in Appendix
1.1.
Economic Rate of Return
3.        The calculation of the economic rate of return of the Project is
based on the following assumptions:
(a) Output Prices. The Bank's commodity world price projections
(June 1976) have been used where available. The prices of
livestock products have been projected to develop according
to the world price for beef. For other commodities, export
and import prices from and into Morocco have been used as
world prices when feasible. The remaining products have
been priced at prevailing farmgate prices.
(b) Input Prices. Investment items have been priced net of import
duties and taxes, with a correction for subsidies (and without
price contingencies). Prices of fertilizers, fuel and other
chemicals have been projected on the basis of the Bank's
world price estimates. Other inputs have been valued at
farmgate prices, adjusted by taxes and subsidies where
applicable.
(c) Labor. Family labor has been valued at the minimum guaranteed
wage of DH 6.5/day. Hired labor being seasonal in nature has
been valued at a higher opportunity cost estimated at DH 10/day.
(d) Foreign Exchange. No foreign exchange shadow pricing has been
made, since it is estimated that the financial exchange rate
approximates the real rate clcsely enough to prevent undesirable
investment patterns under the Project.
4.        Based on these assumptions the Project's benefits and costs have
been calculated as shown in the attached table. The Project's economic rate
of return would be about 29%. The sensitivity analysis shows the following
results:
Investment costs        + 10%      25%
Operating costs         + 10%      15%
Benefits                - 10%      11%



ANNEX 10
Page 3
5.        The relatively low (but still acceptable) rate of return of the
Project in the case of decreased benefits is due to the conservative assump-
tions made with respect to bad climnatic conditions and thus to low output.
It is estimated that such an unfavorable pattern is not very likely. Other
Project risks, in terms of agricultural policy and of CNCA's institutional
performance, are discussed in paras. 3.15 and 7.08 of the main text.
6.        The economic rate of return indicates that the Project would result
in substantial gains to the economy.
