REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) with the guarantee of the
Kingdom of Morocco for the equivalent of US$35 million, to help finance CNCA's
medium- and long-term credit program. The loan would have a term of 13 years,
including three years of grace, with interest at 8.70 percent per year.
Parallel financing is expected for the program by the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development (Arab Fund) through a Kuwaiti Dinar 9 million (equiv-
alent to US$31 million) loan to the Government of Morocco.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Morocco" (1021-MIOR, dated January 26, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on February 13, 1976. An updating economic mission visited Morocco
in June 1976, and the following is based on this mission's findings.
3.        During the 1968-72 Plan, Morocco succeeded in accelerating the
growth of its economy and in improving the situation of its external payments.
Aided substantially by good crops following favorable weather in three years
out of five, real GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent per annum during the five-
year period. Reflecting the sustained rise in exports during the Plan period
and a slower growth of imports in 1971 and 1972, the balance of payments showed
a surplus from 1969 onward. These results represented a definite improvement
over those of the preceding decade, during which the rate of real GDP growth
had barely exceeded that of population growth, and the balance of payments
had been a source of constant concern. These achievements were accompanied
by an increase in private consumption averaging about 2 percent per capita
in real terms during the five-year period.
4.        From 1967 to 1970, the main growth determinants had been exports,
tourism and investment, all of which rose substantially; in addition sizeable
stocks were accumulated following the exceptionally good harvest in 1968.
By contrast, in 1971-72, exports and tourism together with current govern-
ment spending were the major factors to sustain economic growth. During
these last two years of the Plan, the investment of public and semi-public
enterprises declined, largely because the state-owned phosphate company
(OCP) had completed its expansion program. Government investment stagnated
after 1968. Private investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the face
of political developments in 1971 and 1972 and in the expectation of new
measures to encourage investment and exports. At the end of the 1968-72

Plan period, there was therefore an urgent need to revive public and private
investment. Particularly in the public sector, absorptive capacity needed to
be increased by appropriate changes in staffing and organization.
5.        Following a long period of very slow growth in private consumption,
social problems had to be tackled. Over the 1969-71 period, there had been
a slow but perceptible decline in real per capita consumption for about one-
third of the rural population. Wealth and income differences between cities
and villages, among regions, and between rich and poor tended to widen.      Un-
employment remained high, in 1971 averaging 9 percent of the country's labor
force, and ranging between 12 and 16 percent in large urban centers.
6.        Recognizing these difficulties and problems, the Government began
in 1971 to revise its development policies, paying increasing attention to
social objectives. The changed orientations were reflected in the 1973-77
Plan which aims at (1) GDP growth of 7.5 percent per annum in real terms from
1973 to 1977, mainly through a sharp increase in public and private investment
and a strategy geared strongly toward increasing exports; and (2) an improve-
ment in the distribution of growth benefits among the different social groups
and the various regions, in order to achieve greater equity and at the same
time increase domestic demand. This improvement was to be brought about
through a modest program of distributing colon lands to poor farmers, more
emphasis on the development of rainfed agriculture, "Moroccanization" of some
industrial and commercial enterprises, a price and wage policy designed to
enable the poorest segments of the population to satisfy their essential
needs, an ambitious program of low-cost housing, various measures to improve
the lot of the rural poor, and increased emphasis on the development of
poorest regions.
7.        In 1974 and 1975, Morocco benefitted from a large increase in the
average export price of phosphate, its main export product, which provided
substantial additional resources compared to the Plan's expectation. The
Government decided to step up investment spending for the years 1975-77,
and the allocations for investment by the public and semi-public sectors
were increased substantially in the 1975 and 1976 Budget Laws. Part of the
additional allocations were to cover investment cost increases, and a larger
part to launch expanded or new investment programs.
Recent Economic Performance
8.        During the first three years of the 1973-77 Plan period, Morocco's
overall economic performance improved substantially as compared to the past.
Gross fixed investment rose sharply and reached 24 percent of GDP in 1975 or
twice the 1972 level; investments in the public and semi-public sectors con-
tributed strongly to this increase and there was also a good response on the
part of private investors to the new incentives introduced in 1973. Indus-
trial growth accelerated to an average annual rate of 11.5 percent for the
first three years of the Plan compared to 6 percent in 1968-72, in large
part because of the vigorous expansion of construction in response to rising
investment demand. At the same time, increased emphasis was put on achieving
the social objectives of the 1973-77 Plan with the implementation of an



accelerated low-cost housing, program, expanded investments in social sectors
in small cities, and a program of small-scale investments in disfavored
regions. In the face of import price rises, especially for wheat, sugar and
edible oil, the Government also raised significantly price subsidies for these
essential foodstuffs and adjusted upward legal minimum wages in agriculture
and industry with a view to protecting the purchasing power of low-income
groups.
9.        Some weaknesses appeared, however, during this period.    After the
five-fold increase in phosphate exports receipts between 1973 and 1974, which
had led the Government to revise upward the Plan's allocations for 1975-77,
expectations of further increases in financial resources did not materialize
in 1975. Due to weakening external demand, phosphate exports decreased to
13.1 million tons, from 18.7 million tons in 1974, and prices began to drop
sharply in the second half of 1975, restraining correspondingly the country's
real capacity to save and to import. Unfavorable weather resulted in poor
crops in 1973 and in 1975 and to meet domestic demand, food imports were
increased substantially. In constant prices, value added by the mining and
agricultural sectors returned in 1975 to levels slightly below those of 1972
despite the fast growth of other industry and services and this held back real
GDP growth to about 4 percent per year in 1973-75. As a result largely of
the disappointing performance of phosphate exports in 1975, Morocco's internal
and external finances came under pressure. The Treasury's accounts showed in
1975 an overall deficit twice the 1974 level due mainly to sharply rising
capital spending and insufficient growth in budgetary savings. This contri-
buted to inflationary pressure domestically; the cost of living index rose by
nearly 8 percent in 1975. The current account of the balance of payments,
which had shown a surplus of $105 million in 1973 and $237 million in 1974,
registered a deficit of $546 million in 1975.
10.       In 1976, GDP growth has been accelerating, thanks partly to a good
cereal harvest (48 percent larger than the previous year's) and a gradual re-
covery of phosphate sales abroad, and partly to the continued growth momentum
in manufacturing, construction and services. The expansionary investment
policies of 1973-75 have continued, and the 1976 Budget Law raised further
the allocations for investments in the public and semi-public sectors. Sev-
eral measures were, however, taken to curb the growth of consumption demand,
including some restraint in current budgetary spending, the successful place-
ment last summer of a DH 1 billion ($230 million) bond issue among the
Moroccan public, and the introduction of credit restraints. Nevertheless, for
the full year, imports are expected to register another sizeable increase, not
matched by the recovery of export receipts, and according to preliminary es-
timates made in mid-1976 the economy's resource gap may reach an estimated
$1.1 billion (it was $1.0 billion in 1975). A significant factor in this
outcome is the importation of military equipment. There may however be
little change in the country's net foreign assets, as the resource gap would
be largely covered by large increases in worker's remittances from abroad, and
in net external capital inflows. Regarding the latter, Morocco has drawn on
IMF facilities for a total amount of $165 million in early 1976, and it has
considerably stepped up borrowings from Arab and commercial sources (see
Attachment 1, page 3).



- 4 -
11.       For 1977, the trends in consumption demand, particularly for
imported consumer goods, will probably have to be curbed further, and
investment in the public and semi-public sectors may have to be stabilized,
in order to keep developments in the internal and external financial situa-
tion under firm control. The Government is expected to introduce measures
to restrain domestic demand in this manner, probably on the occasion of the
1977 Budget Law. While 1977 would, with such measures, be a year of re-
trenchment by comparison with policies during the first four years of the
1973-77 Plan, tentative Bank estimates (Attachment 1, page 2) indicate that
the overall performance of the economy would be satisfactory for the Plan
period as a whole. These estimates show that a rapid growth (between 16 and
17 percent a year) of investment would have been achieved, exceeding the
original Plan targets for 1973-77. They also show relatively good gains in
GDP (about 6 percent a year) and consumption (close to 3 percent a year per
capita), despite the rather disappointing developments in real terms for the
phosphate and agricultural sectors. Finally, national savings would have
financed a larger share of 1973-77 investments than anticipated originally.
A detailed performance review of the economy during 1973-77 will be undertaken
by the Bank late next year, in conjunction with an assessment of Morocco's
next five-year Plan (1978-82).
Development Prospects
12.       The Plan revisions that were introduced on the occasion of the 1975
and 1976 Budget Laws, have maintained or strengthened the investment programs
designed to achieve the original economic and social objectives of the 1973-77
Plan. They have, in addition, greatly increased allocations for regional
development, for low-cost housing, and especially for the launching of three
industrial investment programs to be implemented over the next decade. These
programs are a one-million ton steel mill and related infrastructure at Nador,
a series of sugar mills and related irrigation development and several chemical
and petrochemical export units based partly on phosphate. Thus, the Plan
revisions will have an important spill-over effect on the next 1978-82 Plan.
13.       The general thrust of the Plan revisions seems justified.    Indeed,
the achievement of initial (especially social) Plan objectives is eminently
desirable. Similarly, Morocco's economy has developed to a stage where some
basic industries may find a justified place. The country in particular
possesses an obvious comparative advantage in the processing of phosphates,
which would tend to stabilize export earnings. Similarly, it can produce at
competitive cost the sugar which it would otherwise import. However, the Plan
revisions raise several issues of importance for Morocco's long-term develop-
ment strategy and prospects.
14.       The investment level is now very close to the country's absorptive
capacity, following the noted increases in 1973-76. Although training efforts
have been stepped up, it is likely that shortages of skilled and experienced
manpower will continue to be a problem for some years to come. While for
large industrial and infrastructure projects, Morocco can use foreign services



extensively, this is costly and would not be a suitable solution to meeting
the needs of smaller investments on a large scale. Further investments in
steel and chemical industries will generate comparatively little employment
opportunities for unskilled workers.
15.       In addition, financial constraints may in future again restrain
Morocco's overall development efforts. While there is scope for increasing
phosphate exports in the medium term, prospects are that the real price of
phosphate will remain at best stable. Since phosphate export receipts are a
major factor for Morocco's real capacity to save and import, such capacity
would be restrained. Further, taking into account the objective and policies
to improve consumption levels of low-income groups, national savings may be
expected to be restrained on this account also. Thus, in spite of likely
efforts to increase budgetary savings and import substitution (particularly
food), foreign exchange and national savings are likely to be constraints
on investment during the next Plan period.
16.       For the 1978-82 Plan period, absorptive capacity and especially re-
source availability therefore call for caution. Bank projections which are
preliminary since the Government has not yet fixed the 1978-82 Plan's objec-
tives and strategy indicate that gross fixed investment could only grow
slowly in view of these constraints. Given the planned move into heavy in-
dustries, investment possibilities in other sectors would by necessity be
limited. Assuming a real investment growth rate of about 4 percent per year
and export growth of about 8 percent, which seems feasible in view of market
prospects and export capacity, a GDP growth rate averaging about 6.5 percent
yearly during the 1978-82 period would be likely. Despite implementation of
policies to restrain consumer goods imports and likely import substitution,
Morocco would experience a sizeable resource gap, and need relatively large
inflows of external capital to cover it and to service accumulated debt.
External borrowing requirements on a commitment basis are tentatively pro-
jected to average $1,250 million per year in 1978-82, about half of which
would be met by official multilateral and bilateral sources and the rest by
commercial sources. Morocco has successfully increased external borrowings in
1974-76; loan commitments have risen to $550 million in 1974, $860 million in
1975 and an estimated $1.5 billion in 1976. Morocco should, therefore, be
able to mobilize the amounts projected for 1978-82.
17.       External debt and debt service would increase as a result of pro-
jected borrowings. Debt outstanding and disbursed, which was $1.0 billion at
the end of 1974 and an estimated $1.5 billion (19 percent of GDP), at the end
of 1975 would rise to a projected $6.4 billion (or 30 percent of GDP) by the
end of 1982. Similarly, debt service payments would rise from the low 8.3
percent of exports in 1975 to a maximum of about 20 percent in 1982. Adding
workers' remittances to exports, the debt service ratio was less than 7 per-
cent in 1975 and would rise to 17 percent in 1982. These projected levels
for debt and debt service would be high, but still within Morocco's debt
carrying capacity, especially when considering the country's improved eco-
nomic and social policies and its long-term export prospects, not only in



phosphate rock and related products, but also in agricultural and industrial
commodities for the European market. Beyond 1982, the relative burden of debt
would probably tend to decline gradually as the economy's external resource
gap would tend to diminish. Therefore Morocco is considered creditworthy for
Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
18.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 28 projects, financing
a total of $669.5 million (net of cancellations), of which $454.5 million has
been lent since the beginning of FY73. IDA credits, totalling $50.0 million,
have been made available for five projects. A Third Window loan for $25 mil-
lion for the third education project was approved in March 1976. IFC invest-
ments have amounted to $4.2 million. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of November 30, 1976, and
notes on the execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases, delays
have been caused by management or procurement difficulties, and in 1974 cost
overruns have increased due to the upsurge in investment activity in Morocco
and the acceleration of inflation. However, performance in project execution
has considerably improved during the last two years.
19.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the industrial and
agricultural sectors, which together have accounted for 59 percent of total
net commitments; the balance is accounted for by utilities (19 percent),
tourism (10 percent), roads (6 percent) and education (6 percent). Apart from
the transfer of resources to Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted
to 5.5 percent of totaf fixed investment in 1970-74), the main objectives of
lending were to foster and strengthen development institutions, provide tech-
nical assistance, particularly for project preparation, and increase produc-
tive capacity, particularly in order to improve the balance of payments.
20.       While these objectives remain, emphasis is also being given to
supporting the Government's development effort in income distribution. An
increasing share of Bank Group lending will be devoted to projects directly
or indirectly developing the productive capacity of the lowest urban and rural
income groups.
21.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development,
credit and, through a first operation in FY75, the improvement of the produc-
tivity of rainfed farming. While continued lending for irrigation is envisaged,
greater emphasis will be given to supporting the improvement of rainfed farm-
ing, and lending will in general be focussed on support to small farmers. A
second irrigation project in the Doukkala region is being appraised. Projects
for livestock/rural development in the rainfed zones in northern Morocco, for
developing production of fruits and vegetables on small holdings and for
promoting integrated rural development in selected regions of Morocco are
being prepared.



22.       Projects in industry and tourism have as key objectives increased
foreign exchange earnings or savings and the improvement of sectoral policies.
Continued lending for industry and tourism through two DFC's (Banque Nationale
pour le Developpement Economique-BNDE and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier-CIH)
will be proposed. A project for the construction of a large cement plant in
the less developed Northeast is envisaged. Proposals for industrial lending,
including one for a steel mill in northeast Morocco, are under consideration.
23.       A slum upgrading project in Rabat is being prepared, which should
contribute to devising means to solving the problem of rapid growth of slum
areas. A substantial social services component and an employment generation
program are envisaged.
24.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.
Twio IDA credits have been made to develop secondary education and teacher
training and to improve technical and vocational training. A third project,
with emphasis on improving facilities in rural areas, was recently approved
by the Executive Directors. A fourth project with emphasis on technical
and vocational training is under preparation.
25.       A consultative group for Morocco was formed in April 1967 under the
chairmanship of the Bank. It includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Kuwait, Spain, the U.K., the U.S., UNDP, OECD/DAC, the African Develop-
ment Bank and the European Investment Bank. The lagt meeting of the Group
took place on lMarch 28 and 29, 1974. Loan commitments from multilateral and
bilateral official sources to MIorocco rose from $92 million in 1973 to $425
million in 1974 and $538 million in 1975. In addition Mlorocco received grants
totalling $40 million in 1973 and $42 million in 1974. The major sources of
aid were France, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the U.S., Germany and the Bank Group.
26.       At the end of 1975, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's outstanding
and disbursed external public debt was estimated at 18 percent. The share of
the Bank Group in debt service was 12 percent in 1974 and an estimated 20 per-
cent in 1975. By 1982 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding and in debt
service are expected to decrease to about 13 percent and 8 percent respectively,
on the basis of the assumptions made for total external borrowings for the
1976-82 period (paragraph 17).
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
27.       Agriculture is the most important economic activity in Mforocco.
An average of six million ha are presently cultivated, of which about half a
million ha are perennially irrigated. Mlain agricultural products are cereals,
pulses, vegetables, citrus, sugarbeets, olives and oilseeds. About 55 percent
of the labor force is employed in agriculture and two thirds of the population
live in rural areas. Until the recent rise in phosphate prices, the sector



- 8 -
contributed about one third of GDP and accounted for over half of merchandise
exports. Poor performance of the agricultural sector in the decade after
Independence contributed to general economic stagnation, while in the years
1967-72 more rapid growth of agriculture - partly because previous large
investments in the modern sector began to bear fruit - was accompanied by
overall expansion. Despite past development of irrigation, performance of
the sector is very sensitive to the substantial variations in annual rainfall
which affect much of the country. In 1972/3 and again in 1974/5, inadequate
rainfall seriously affected crop production and overall growth performance,
despite rapid extension in mining and manufacture.
28.       Until recently, the Government's intervention in the agricultural
sector concentrated on the expansion of irrigated farming. During the Second
Five-Year Plan, 26 percent of total Government development expenditure was
devoted to dams and irrigated farming. Under the Third Five-Year Plan, this
share is planned to decline to about 14 percent. Greater attention is being
given to improvement of rainfed agriculture, livestock production, training,
improvement of the extension service, credit to small farmers, research and
marketing. Farmgate prices were sharply increased in December 1973, and
again in November 1974, to encourage the production of cereals, sugar, edible
oil seeds and dairy products.
29.       In many parts of the country, the small size and fragmentation of
holdings, and complex traditional tenure systems, frequently involving joint
ownership, have been major obstacles to improving agricultural productivity.
The Government has taken various measures to overcome these problems, and to
encourage the adoption of modern cultivation methods, particularly on lands
with high production po^tential. First, under legislation introduced in 1962,
the Government has successfully started a program of land consolidation;
during the Second Five-Year Plan, 1968-72, 80,000 farmers have benefited.
Secondly, the Government has acquired 610,000 ha of land, previously held by
foreigners, for distribution to the rural poor, both small farmers and land-
less. Under a law of 1966 (amended in December 1972) the Government is
distributing this and other state-owned land to Moroccan farmers meeting
competence, poverty, age and character criteria. Recipients are obliged to
renounce all other rights to land and to join a Government-sponsored coopera-
tive. Some 270,000 ha were distributed, and the Plan target is to distribute
400,000 ha by end 1977. Thirdly, the Agricultural Investment Code enacted in
1969 gave powers to the Government to organize agricultural development in
irrigated areas. The Code provides for transformation of some tribal land
into individually held freehold plots, prevents excessive fragmentation of
holdings, and obliges farmers to follow an approved cropping pattern in
exchange for various subsidies.
30.       The legislation as a whole has been carefully designed to ensure
that changes in the tenure system, particularly the transfer of foreign-owned
farms to small MIoroccan farmers, do not lead to declines in productivity.
Implementation, however, is complex and slow due to the limits of the Govern-
ment's administrative capacity. So far the land reform program has touched
only a very small proportion of poor farmers (about 2 percent), and this



- 9 -
proportion will rise to only about 4 percent with the implementation of the
1973-77 program. Moreover, its impact has been concentrated in the irrigated
areas. Further land distribution offers only limited scope for improving
rural ircome distribution as the amount of land that could be redistributed
is relatively small. Farms of more than 50 ha number 6,500 and represent
10 percent of cultivable land. On the other hand 960,000 farmers own farms
less than 5 ha and a further 650,000 own collective lands which together
represent 41 percent of cultivable land. Despite the paucity of reliable
information it can be estimated that a substantial proportion of the rural
population is under the poverty level of about $200 per capita or $1,050 per
family.
31.       Government activity in the agricultural sector in Morocco is the
primary responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform
(MARA). The Ministry's activities are concentrated in the central Director-
ates of Agricultural Development and of Equipment, in provincial services
which serve rainfed areas (SPs), and in largely autonomous regional devel-
opment offices (ORMVAs) for irrigated areas. There are also three public
institutions with country wide responsibilities in the sector: CNCA, the
Cereals and Pulses Trade Office (ONICL) and the Export and Trade Company
(OCE). Two state-owned companies are responsible for managing the land
acquired by the Government from foreigners, prior to its eventual distri-
bution under the land reform program; the Farm Development Corporation (SODEA),
established in 1972, is primarily responsible for managing plantations while
the Agricultural Land Management Corporation (SOGETA), established in 1973 is
primarily responsible for managing annual crop land acquired from foreign
owners in March 1973.
Agricultural Credit
32.       In 1962, the Government established a new agricultural credit system
under which CNCA provides short-term advances as well as medium- and long-
term credit to individual farmers, land reform cooperatives and agricultural
companies. It also operates the Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole (CLCAs),
which provide seasonal and medium term credit to smaller farmers under sim-
plified procedures. In 1976, 230,000 farmers obtained credit from CNCA.
33.       The Bank's first Agriculural Credit Loan in Morocco (Loan 433-MOR),
in an amount of $10 million, was signed in 1966. It was for a three-year
agricultural development project, with a total cost of about $26 million,
covering medium- and long-term loans to farmers and companies for machinery,
equipment processing and storage facilities, to help improve agricultural
productivity. Part A of the project consisted of on-farm development and
Part B of equipment loans for Centrale de Gestion des Exploitations Agri-
coles (CGEA), an agency established for managing land taken over from for-
eign settlers. Initial progress on the project was disappointing. On-farm
investment loans lagged behind schedule, mainly because of CNCA's shortage
of qualified personnel; moreover, CNCA had to account for CLCAs operations
without exerting control over their policies and subsequent deficits in-
curred. Part B was used satisfactorily until CGEA was dissolved and its



- 10 -
assets transferred to provincial authorities which led to cancellation of
the balance of $0.2 million. In February 1968 the Bank suspended withdrawals
under Part A until CLCAs' accounts were separated from CNCA's accounts,
lending programs revised, and staff strengthened; disbursements under Part A
resumed in September 1968, and were completed in September 1969. The project
was part of a review of Bank/IDA financed agricultural credit programs under-
taken by the Operations Evaluation Department in 1973-74 in five borrowing
countries (Report No. 1357 of November 18, 1976); while returns on mechaniza-
tion investments appear to have been on the low side, no definitive conclu-
sions on the overall economic results of the project could be drawn in view of
the erratic climatic conditions that prevailed during the period under consid-
eration. On the other hand, improvement of CNCA's management and operations
was considered to be the project's main accomplishment.
34.       The Second Agricultural Credit Loan in Morocco (Loan/Credit 861/
338-MOR) in an amount of US$34 million was signed in 1972. It was to finance
CNCA's lending for 1973-76 to medium and large farmers for investments at a
total cost of US$69.4 million in grain farm equipment, citrus plantation
development, winter vegetable production, dairy farm development, beef cattle
and sheep farms, and marketing facilities. Because of the Bank's concern for
CNCA's financial viability, the CLCAs were excluded from the Project and CNCA
was to increase its interest rate from 6.5 percent to 8 percent except for
subloans to farmers with taxable incomes of less than DH 6,000 (actual incomes
of less than $3,500) for which up to one fith of the Loan/Credit amount was
reserved. This part of the Loan/Credit was quickly disbursed but delays in
disbursements occured until 1975 for the remaining part due to availability of
credit to smaller farmers at lower interest rate outside the Bank Project and
technical difficulties in assembling the disbursement documentation. Moreover,
livestock development tinder the project was more successful than expected and
additional funds were allocated to it in May 1975; higher interest rates on
all CNCA loans were introduced in September 1975. As a result of these
measures, the pace of disbursements increased and the Loan/Credit was fully
disbursed in May 1976 as initially forecast.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The proposed Third Agricultural Credit Project would cover most of
CNCA's program for medium- and long-term lending from January 1977 through
August 1979.   It would also include related technical assistance.    The project
was prepared by CNCA staff and was appraised by a Bank mission in May-June
1976. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in November
1976. CNCA was represented by its General Manager, Mr. Kadiri, and the
Guarantor by Mr. Belkoura of the Prime Minister's Office. An appraisal report
of the third Agricultural Credit Project (No. 1308-MIOR), dated December 15,
1976, is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project summary is attached
as Annex III.



Organization, Staff and Procedures
36.       CNCA, the only institutional source of agricultural credit in
Morocco, is an autonomous Government-owned company whose Board of Directors
is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and is comprised of 21 members rep-
resenting the Government (9), the Central Bank (1) and farmer organizations
(11). A Management Committee of eight members is responsible for day-to-day
management under the overall direction of the Board. The Committee is chaired
by the General Manager of CNCA and its members include representatives of the
ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Interior, and the Central Bank. CNCA's
credit policies have evolved since its inception in 1962 and are no longer
fully consistent with the regulations under which it was originally estab-
lished. The Government has agreed to revise these regulations, a task which
is expected to take two to three years (Section 3.07, Guarantee Agreement).
37.       Loans to companies, cooperatives and very large farmers are handled
at CNCA's headquarters, while loans to farmers other than very large ones, as
well as to farmers' associations for mechanization and some cooperatives are
processed by CNCA's regional and local branches. These branches include 24
Caisses Regionales de Credit Agricole (CRCAs), which lend to medium and large
farmers and farmers' associations, and 86 Caisses Locales de Credit Agricole
(CLCAs), which lend to smaller farmers whose taxable income is between DH 100
and DH 3,000 (actual income of $60-$1,750). These branches are grouped in
five regional zones headed by regional directors, to whom decision making
power has been delegated.
38.       Since 1971, CNCA's staff doubled to 1350, almost 30 percent of which
received higher education. CNCA's staff is well qualified and devoted. In
order to avoid losing staff to the private sector and better-paying public
sector companies, in July 1976, CNCA increased staff salaries and benefits.
During negotiations it was agreed that, with the assistance of Government,
CNCA would maintain a competitive compensation system (Section 4.04, Loan
Agreement). Traditionally, CNCA obtains part of its junior professional staff
by way of secondment from the Ministry of Agriculture, and it was agreed that
the Government would continue to assign a sufficient member of such staff to
CNCA in accordance with CNCA's needs (Section 3.06, Guarantee Agreement).
Also, CNCA's in-service training which has been successful despite limited
financial means and personnel resources would be streamlined and intensified.
To this end, CNCA would appoint a training consultant, with Arab Fund financ-
ing (see paras 48 and 50 below) and under terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, to help develop an expanded training program including the creation
of a possible agricultural training institute.
39.       CNCA's appraisal procedures strike a balance between the need for
a detailed review of proposed investments and the objective of reaching an
increasing number of farmers with limited resources; appraisal of CLCA loans
is somewhat cursory, based only on a desk review, but the lending risk is low
because of a legal limit on borrowers' indebtedness which is defined in rela-
tion to taxable income. Appraisal of other CNCA loans, with the exception
of loans to companies, is adequate; loan approval is usually fast.



- 12 -
40.       Arrears on CNCA's loans are low due to effective management and the
privilege granted to CNCA according to which it can avail itself of the same
legal instruments that are available to the State for its claims. As of
April 30, 1976, amounts of principal and interest overdue for more than eight
and twenty months represented about 8 and 3.5 percent of CNCA's total portfolio
respectively. Under the proposed project the decree governing CNCA recoveries
would remain in force (Section 7.01, Loan Agreement).
Operations and Financial Position
41.       Total CNCA lending in fiscal year 1975 (September 1, 1974 - August
31, 1975) amounted to DH 711 million, which represented a 85 percent increase
over 1972. Of this total lending, DH 497 million was for short term credit
and DH 214 million for medium and long term credit. Loans to individual
farmers represented slightly less than half of the total, the balance rep-
resenting loans to associations, cooperatives and companies.
42.       CNCA's resources doubled over the last four years to an estimated
DH 770 million at the end of August 1976; their weighted average cost re-
mained by and large constant and was estimated at 2.16 petcent for fiscal year
1976. Since CNCA is a Government-owned company no dividends are paid and
profits are retained to strengthen the equity base. As a result of this and
of the transfer to CNCA's equity of the proceeds of the IDA credit for the
Second Agricultural Credit Project (338-MOR) and of a loan from Iran, both
lent to the Government of Morocco, CNCA's consolidated equity and reserves
increased from DH 131 million to OH 333 miiiioh duting the same period.
CNCA's other long term resources were obtained through botrowings fromi IBRD,
Kreditanstalt fur Wi&de&aufbau and the City of Agadir and through the place-
ment in 1973 and 1914 of tw4o bond issues of DH 30 million each.   Deposits
received by CNA have increased more than five times' sinfce 1972 and were
estimated at DH 152 million at end August 1976; despite these commefidable
results, mobilization of additional deposits should be iiitefisified and become
more systematic.   Some technical assistance is proposed under the project for
this purpose (paragraph 50). For its cash requirements CNCA can take recourse,
up to a ceiling, to advances from the Central Bank of Morocco and from Caisse
de Depots et de Gestion (CDG), a public sector financial institution.
43.       CNCA financial structure is expected to remain satisfactory in
future. Its debt/equity ratio was 0.55:1 at end August 1975 and is projected
to increase slightly over 2:1 at end August 1982, i.e. well below the cove-
nanted ratio of 4:1 under the Second Project. This ratio would be miaintained
under the proposed project (Section 5.05, Loan Agreement). However, the
general reserves covenant in force under the Second Project, requiring CNCA to
build reserves from profits up to 15 percent of its equity capital by 1976, is
no longer needed in view of CNCA's strong equity base.    The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities remained above 1.3:1 ovet the past four years.
It is expected to remain satisfactory in the future. CNCA has agreed to
maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2:1 (Section 5.09, Loan Agreement).



- 13 -
44.       Except for an operating loss in fiscal year 1974, CNCA's profitabil-
ity - without taking into account CLCA operations - has been adequate and is
expected to improve in the coming years. Profits to equity would increase
from an estimated 1.9 percent in fiscal year 1976 to 11.6 percent in fiscal
year 1982. Because of higher administrative costs of lending to small farmers
and lower lending rates imposed by the Government as a means of assisting
small farmers, the CLCAs traditionally have incurred losses, which grew sig-
nificantly over time, especially with the increase in lending over the last
few years. These losses, covered by a Government subsidy, were equivalent to
44.5 percent of CLCAs' operating costs in fiscal year 1975. Over the past
three years CLCAs' administrative costs averaged 10 percent of loans committed.
The corresponding figure for all of CNCA's operations was 4 percent. Despite
Government ownership and operating subsidies to cover losses incurred by
CLCAs, CNCA established its operational independence. However, a stronger
income earning position would be desirable to maintain its autonomy. To this
end, under the proposed project, CNCA's interest rate structure would be
reviewed each year and adjusted as necessary on the basis of CNCA's income
forecasts with a view towards gradually phasing out the Government subsidy on
CLCAs' operations. While this cannot be achieved in the immediate future and
as long as CLCAs continue steeply expanding credit to poorer farmers, as a
transitional measure, assurances were obtained from the Government and CNCA
that a ceiling on the level of the Government's annual subsidy would apply
(see para. 54 below).
Project Description
45.       The previous two Agricultural Credit Projects were aimed principally
at increasing agricultural production through mechanization and modernization
of medium and large farms and at strengthening CNCA. The Third Project would
also aim at increasing agricultural production to meet Morocco's rising demand
in line with the Plan's objectives and at further expanding CNCA's capability
as a sound agricultural credit institution. However, in addition it would
contribute to raising the incomes of small farmers borrowing from the CLCAs
and of previous landless farmworkers organized in cooperatives.
46.       The proposed Project would cover most of CNCA's program for medium
and long term lending from January 1977 through August 1979 and would include
related technical assistance. It does not include CNCA's lending to State
and private companies. Total expected investment amounts to about US$315
million of which 27 percent would be for livestock development, 22 percent
for tractors and other machinery, 19 percent for farm buildings, 16 percent
for draft animals and related equipment, 8 percent for small irrigation
equipment and 6 percent for plantations. A detailed list of items covered
under the project is provided in Annex III.



- 14 -
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
47.       Of total project cost, including contingencies, estimated at US$315
million, US$109 million (34.5 percent) would be in foreign exchange. Detailed
cost estimates are provided in Annex III.
48.       Assurances were obtained from the Government that it would provide
the necessary funds to complete the financing plan under arrangements satis-
factory to the Bank (Section 2.02, Guarantee Agreement). Parallel financing
is expected for the project by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Develop-
ment (Arab Fund) through a loan to the Government of Morocco. Negotiations
for this loan are expected to take place at end January 1977. The Arab Fund
is considering a loan of up to Kuwaiti Dinar 9 million (equivalent to US$31
million), the likely terms of which are 15 years, including 5 years grace,
and interest at 6 percent per annum.
49.       The detailed financing plan is shown in Annex III.    The proposed
Bank loan of US$35 million would finance 11.1 percent of the total project
cost. Percentages of project financing by other sources would be as follows:
Arab Fund, 9.8 percent; CNCA's own funds, 47.1 percent; sub-borrowers, 28.7
percent; and Government grants (subsidies for investments by cooperatives)
and budgetary allocations, 3.3 percent.
50.       The proposed Bank loan would be made to CNCA and would be for a
period of 13 years, including a three-year grace period. The Government would
carry the foreign exchange risk, as in previous projects. The proposed Bank
loan would finance only the project components aimed at small/medium-sized
farmers, either direct`Vy or through cooperatives and farmers' associations.
These project components would represent respectively 47 and 12 percent of
total project cost excluding technical assistance. The Arab Fund loan would
finance the projects components aimed at medium and large-sized farmers either
directly or through ORMVA and SPs. These project components would represent
respectively 37 and 4 percent of total project cost excluding technical
assistance. Together the Bank and Arab Fund loans would about meet CNCA's
projected financial gap. CNCA would finance almost 40 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of the project from its own resources; this would be essentially
indirect foreign exchange and would not present difficulties for CNCA. In
addition, the Bank loan would finance the cost of the technical assistance
program for establishing a monitoring system and the foreign exchange cost of
the applied research program for preparing a fruit and vegetable project for
possible Bank financing, while the Arab Fund loan would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the technical assistance program for attracting deposit and
staff training.
Project implementation
51.       CNCA would be the borrower and carry out the project except for the
implementation of the applied research program which would be carried out by
ORMIVASM; funds for this part of the project would be onlent by CNCA to ORMVASM.



- 15 -
Lending policies and interest rates
52.       CNCA's existing lending policies are satisfactory.    Loans to
individual farmers usually finance 70 percent of investment cost which is
adequate. This percentage would be maintained (Section 4.01, Loan Agreement).
Lending rules governing credit to cooperatives would be modified. Under the
present system, CNCA finances 100 percent of investment costs and a percentage
of short-term needs that decreases from 100 percent in the first year of
creation of the cooperative to zero percent in the sixth year. While well
established cooperatives do not need 100 percent loan financing of investment,
the cut-off of short term credit induces a decrease in the use of inputs by
cooperative members. On the other hand, members of newly created coopera-
tives, who were previously landless farmworkers or subsistance small holders,
have no means of self-financing, and full loan financing of new investment
would be necessary for cooperatives in their first four years of operation.
Thereafter the percentage of financing should decrease to reach the level
applicable for loans to individual farmers (70 percent) in the sixth year
of operation. The same level would apply to medium-term loans extended to
finance replacement investments and to short-term loans extended to coopera-
tives in their third year of operation (Section 2, Schedule 4, Loan Agreement).
53.       The present interest rate of 8.5 percent for medium term loans to
individual farmers borrowing from CNCA headquarters and CRCAs is in line with
interest rates charged in other sectors of the economy; it is higher than the
average inflation rate presently forecast at 7 percent and allows CNCA to
cover cost and make a reasonable profit. Loans to cooperatives and farmer
associations bear a rate of 7 percent. For the reasons stated in para. 52
above, this rate should be maintained for loans extended to newly created
cooperatives and associations during the first four years of operation, but
would be increased to 8.5 percent by the sixth year (Section IB, Schedule 4,
Loan Agreement).
54.       In lieu of interest, CLCAs charge fixed fees at the time of dis-
bursement and at regular intervals thereafter which amount to between 10 and
16 percent for short-term funds and to between 6 and 8.7 percent on medium-
term funds resulting in a weighted average of about 6.5 percent for all
medium-term loans. Because of its simplicity in administration the present
system would be maintained. However, the existing bias against shorter-term
funds would be adjusted by introducing differentiated fees resulting in an
increase of the average charge for medium-term loans to about 7.7 percent.
The proposed change should allow the Government's annual subsidy to decrease
to less than 23 percent of CLCAs' forecast expenses, the level obtained in
fiscal year 1975-76 (see para. 44 above); assurances were obtained that during
implementation of the project CLCAs fees would be periodically reviewed and
adjusted to prevent an increase in the Government subsidy.
55.       Approval by CNCA's Board of the proposed changes in interest rates,
financial charges and lending terms would be a condition of loan effectiveness;
these changes would take effect at the beginning of CNCA's next fiscal year
i.e., September 1, 1977 which coincides with the beginning of the new crop
year (Sections 3.02 and 8.01, Loan Agreement).



- 16 -
Monitoring and Evaluation - Accounts and Audit
56.       Under the proposed project CNCA would establish a monitoring and
evaluation system to measure the effects of its lending on farmers' produc-
tion and incomes. This system would also provide the Government with an
opportunity to assess the impact of its agricultural policy. A draft pro-
posal would be submitted to the Bank by March 1, 1977 and the system would
be implemented by September 1, 1977. Fellowships would be provided under
the proposed project to allow CNCA staff to draw on experience of agricul-
tural credit institutions abroad with operating monitoring systems. If
necessary, employment of an evaluation consultant under terms satisfactory
to the Bank would be financed under the proposed project (Section 4.05, Loan
Agreement).
57.       CNCA's accounting organization and audit system are satisfactoty
and would remain unchanged (Sections 5.01 and 5.02, Loan Agreement).
Procurement
58.       Goods to be financed under the Project would not be suitable for
bulk procurement; contracts would be too small to warrant competitive bidcding
advertised internationally.   Foreign suppliers of machinery are well tepre-
sented in Morocco, necessary service facilities are available, competition
is keen and prices are competitive.   Sub'-borrowers would putchase agricultural
equipment of their choice th-rough existing local channels.   Dairy farm develop-
ment would require procurement of in-calf heifers, most of which would come
from Government or private farms.   However, should miore than 75 heifers be
imported under any sub-7.loan, quotations from sup7ptiers from at Ie'ast three
countries would be sougfit (Section- 3.05, Loan Agreement).  Experts and re-
searchers required under the program of technical assistance to ORMVASM would
be selected accord'ing to the Bank guidelines for contracting consult-ants'
services. Goods and consultants' services financed' by the Arab Fund loan
would be awarded under the Arab Fund procurement rules.
Disbursement
59.       The commitment period for project funds is two years and eight
months (January 1977 - August 1979) and disbursement to sub-borrowers is ex-
pected to be completed rapidly because of the nature of investment financed.
The Bank Loan would be disbursed in about 3 years.    The Bank would reimbur'se
CNCA against certified statements of expenditures for'27.5 percent of loans
disbursed.. Documentation for these statements would not be sent to the Bank,
but would be retained by CNCA- for review by supervision mi§sions. The Bank
would also reimburse CNCA, against full documentation, for 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of fellowship's and consultant-s' services.  Retroactive
financing to November 22, 1976, for about $'100,000 would be allowed to ensure
an early start for the research program.

Project Justification
60.       The Project would expand financial support for both commercial
farmers and small farmers. At least 350,000 farmers would benefit from CNCA's
loans as compared to 230,000 presently. About 40 percent of these farmers
would be below the poverty level.
61.       The Project's overall rate of return to the economy is estimated
at about 29 percent if based on present costs; it would decrease to 25 or 15
percent respectively if investment costs or operating expenses were increased
by 10 percent, and to 11 percent if the value of benefits was decreased by 10
percent. Financial rates of return for illustrative farm models range from 14
to 25 percent.
62.       Agricultural production generated by the Project would be worth
about DH 1.5 billion (US$350 million). To a large extent the increased pro-
duction would help improve Morocco's balance of payments by reducing import
requirements for grain, oil seeds, sugar, meat and milk and by increasing
vegetable exports to European countries.
63.       The Project would create some 40,000 jobs; an estimated 20,000 man
years of additional family labor mostly through livestock investment; about
10,000 permanent jobs and about 10,000 man-years of temporary labor. The
average investment cost per man-year would be DH 26,800 (US$6,200). In-
direct employment generation has not been assessed because of the lack of
statistical data. For the same reasons the effect of farm mechanization on
labor creation cannot be properly assessed; however, various indications show
that the net impact is positive through indirect employment generation.
Project Risk
64.       The major risk of the project which would cover most of agricultural
investments financed by CNCA during the coming two years and eight months
would be the failure to achieve the expected production objectives due to
poor weather conditions, as was the case in 1973 and 1975; however, economic
benefits of the proposed project have been estimated on the basis of conserva-
tive assumptions taking into account a below-average pattern of good and bad
agricultural seasons.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
65.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of
Morocco and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans
for agricultural credit projects.



- 18 -
66.       Features of the draft agreements of special interest are described
in paragraphs 38, 40, 43, 48, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58 and 59. Special condi-
tion of effectiveness is approval by CNCA's board of the proposed changes
in lending policies to cooperatives and farmers' associations and financial
charges on all CLCAs' loans.
67.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
68.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. No. 643 Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project: US$46 million Loan of November
13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
November 30, 1978.
Progress in implementing the project is now satisfactory although
considerable problems were first experienced with management and procurement,
and some procurement difficulties continue. The major project structure,
Idriss ler Dam, is completed and equipment of 13,200 ha out of a total of
35,000 ha is completed. Another 3,850 ha were commissioned in April 1976.
Project execution was delayed in 1975 due to a shortage, now rectified, of
concrete canalettes. Additional infrastructure for the project area, in-
cluding a sugar cane processing factory and flood protection works, are
being provided by Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Cr. No. 266 Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August 18,
1971; Date of Effectiveness: December 10, 1971;
Closing Date: April 30, 1978.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific
sections of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems, and
technical assistance for project administration and school maintenance.
Subsequently, the Association agreed not to finance two Vocational Training
Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an amount
of about US$0.9 million has been transferred to the unallocated category for
future reallocation and/or cancellation. Initial delays occurred in the
appointment of consultant architects, in the recruitment of local personnel
and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit and in procurement.
However, execution is now proceeding satisfactorily. Physical execution of
the project is forecast for completion by the end of 1976, about one year
and a half later than originally planned.
C
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 848 Second Hotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 1, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Commitments and disbursements initially lagged behind expectations,
due to sluggish investment activity in 1973, but the loan is now fully commit-
ted, as against the appraisal estimate of March 1974.
Ln. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: May 2, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977.
The dam which was the major component of the project was inaugurated
in August 1974. All project elements are being completed on schedule except
for the treatment plant and the training school, which are both about six
months behind schedule. The financial position of the Borrower, Office
National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP), is satisfactory. In early 1976 consultants
have completed a tariff study which will assist in improving ONEP's long-term
financial performance. Consultants have recently been engaged to undertake a
management study for ONEP.
Ln. No. 890 Sixth BNDE Project; US$24 million of May 14, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The loan was fully committed by May 1974, about six months earlier
than expected, due to rapid improvement of the investment climate since mid-
1973. Disbursements should be completed by the end of 1976 as scheduled.
Ln. No. 936 P^ower Project; US$25 million of October 5, 1973'; Date of
Effectiveness: January 23, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Physical implementation of the project is practically complete.
Savings amounting to about US$4.0 million are being applied to consultant
services for feasibility studies, preliminary design and preparation of bid
documents for 5 hydro stations required to alleviate Morocco's dependency on
imported oil. Although electricity rates were sharply increased on January 1,
1976, ONE's rate of return has not yet reached the covenanted level because
of even sharper increases in the price of imported inputs.
Ln. No. 955 Second Highway Project; US$29 million of January 11, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: May 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction of the Rabat-Casablanca expressway began in early 1975,
8 months behind schedule and is expected to be completed during the first half
of 1977. Purchase of maintenance equipment and work on the highway improvement
program are proceeding satisfactorily, close to the appraisal cost estimates.
The consultants for the urban traffic and transport study in the towns of
Casablanca and Rabat have submitted the draft final reports. The Government
has recently awarded a contract for technical assistance for the establishment
of a Transport Planning Office in the Ministry of Public Works and consultants
have commenced work in August 1976.

Ln. No. 1017 Phosphoric Acid Project; US$50.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
June 39, 1977.
Progress in project execution is good, although there is likely to
be a minor delay in plant start-up, due to a delay in the civil works component
of the turnkey contract. Personnel recruitment and training is well underway.
Cost overrun is expected to be less than 8 percent, mostly in local currency
and will be financed locally.
Ln. No. 1018 Sebou II Development Project; US$32.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 28, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The sugar cane processing factory was commissioned in June, 1975,
one month later than originally scheduled, but in time to process the 1975
harvest. Construction of the project area roads is on schedule but work on
the flood protection dykes is about nine months behind schedule. The studies
of pollution control and the incidence of bilharzia on the Rharb plain have
not yet been started.
Ln. No. 1061 Seventh BNDE Project; US$30 million of December 30, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
This loan is practically fully committed. Disbursements are roughly
in line with appraisal estimates.
Ln. No. 1123 Souss Groundwater Project; US$18.5 million of June 11, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1975; Closing Date:

its staff appointed, and the project co-ordinating committee has been estab-
lished.
Cr. No. 555 Mleknes Agricultural Development Project; US$14.0 million of
June 11, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: November 14, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
Following initial delay, the project is now getting underway. How-
ever, project management and the coordination of project activities between
the project authority and the central offices of the Ministry of Agriculture
require close monitoring for satisfactory enforcement of land distribution
criteria.

1976; Date of Effectiveness: October 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project intended to develop Agadir into a major tourism area
consists of infrastructure works and public facilities for the development
of a new tourism section on 260 ha on which 7,000 hotel beds and 2,600
housing units are expected to be constructed. The project includes also
regional infrastructure and facilities for the development of Agadir's tour-
ism assets. Lengthy administrative procedures have delayed fulfilment of
special conditions of effectiveness such as the enactment of a development
plan for the project zone and of expropriation decrees. Otherwise project
implementation is progressing satisfactorily.

MOROCCO - THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA)
Guarantor:            The Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:               US$35 million in various currencies
Terms:                Repayment in 13 years, including three years of grace
with interest at 8.70 per year.
Project               The purpose of the project is to assist in increasing
Description:         agricultural production, improving income of small
farmers and further expanding CNCA's capability as a
sound agricultural credit institution. The project
would cover most of CNCA's program for medium- and
long-term lending from January 1977 through August
1979 and would include related technical assistance.
It would consist of eight parts.
(a) medium-term lending program to individual
small-/medium-sized farmers (real farm incomes
between $60-1750) borrowing through the Caisses
Locales de Credit Agricole (CLCAs) for on-farm
investments consisting mainly of cattle, sheep,
stables, draft animals and related equipment, wells
and pumps and land improvement. Investments in
tractors and combine harvesters are excluded from
this category; this category accounts for about
47.2 percent of project cost;
(b) medium- and long-term lending to individual
medium-/large-sized farmers (real farm incomes
above $1750) borrowing through CNCA headquarters
and the Caisses Regionales de Credit Agricole
(CRCAs) for on-farm investments consisting of
the same items as in (a) above with in addition:
agricultural machinery and equipment for chicken
breeding, beekeeping and alfalfa processing; this
category accounts for about 37.3 percent of project
cost;



ANNEX III
Page 2 of 5 pages
(c)  medium-term lending to regional agencies (ORMVAs)
and provincial offices of the Ministry of Agri-
culture borrowing through CNCA headquarters for
investments undertaken by farmers under their
close supervision within the framework of com-
prehensive crop programs. Most credit provided
under such programs is short-term credit, but
crops such as sugar cane and alfalfa also require
medium-term credit which would be provided under
this category; about 3.6 percent of project cost
would be in this category;
(d)   medium- and long-term lending to Agrarian
Reform cooperatives borrowing through CNCA head-
quarters and the CRCAs for on farm investments
to be carried out by the cooperatives (tractors,
combine harvesters and trucks) or individually
by the members borrowing through their coopera-
tives (same investments as in (a) above); this
category accounts for about 10.3 percent of
project cost;
(e)   medium-term lending to associations of small
farmers borrowing through the CRCAs for agri-
cultural machinery (tractors and implements and
a few combine harvesters). Members of these
groups are not individually eligible for farm
mechanization and can get the use of a tractor
through establishing such associations; this
category accounts for about 1.1 percent of
project cost;
(f)   fellowships and a monitoring consultant (6
man-months) to assist CNCA in establishing a
monitoring and evaluation system which would be
designed to provide systematic information on
the effect of credit and other agricultural
policies on production and farmers' income;
(g)   consultant services (64 man-months) and related
equipment to assist CNCA in setting up and estab-
lishing a banking development program, with emphasis
on deposit collection, and a staff training program;
and
(h)   consultant services (60 man-months) and research
equipment to assist the regional development office
of the Souss-Massa (ORMVASM) in developing an
applied research program for an integrated fruit
and vegetable production and marketing project
for possible Bank financing.
