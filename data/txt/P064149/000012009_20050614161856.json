Lessons are conveyed as\n            follows. The need for an exit strategy is stronger in\n            volatile situations, such as that in the Central African\n            Republic (CAR) in early 2000. At the time of preparation and\n            approval, a framework to deal with unstable conditions, and\n            a decision agreement would have permitted an orderly,\n            predictable withdrawal of non-relevant interventions and, of\n            possible replacement with more appropriate instruments. The\n            exit strategy could also have been coordinated with other\n            development partners. The recently introduced LICUS program\n            now provides the framework to transition out of regular\n            programs in an unstable environment. In hindsight, recent\n            best practice in the Bank indicates a move towards the\n            substantive conditions to be, in nature, more appropriate as\n            conditions for negotiations before Board presentation,\n            leaving only effectiveness conditions those which are more\n            procedural, and designed to ensure rapid disbursement."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
