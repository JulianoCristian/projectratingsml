post-conflict\n            context, the Policy Support Project aims at helping the\n            Government of the Central African Republic implement its\n            reform program supported by the recently approved Fiscal\n            Consolidation Credit (FCC), particularly the privatization\n            program; articulate its poverty reduction strategy (PRS);\n            start rebuilding its statistical infrastructure; strengthen\n            the management of the promising mining sector; and further\n            strengthen the technical committee in charge of the reform\n            program. There are five main project components. The first\n            provides technical assistance to implement the privatization\n            and regulation program supported by the FCC. It supports the\n            Privatization Commission, revamps the legal and regulatory\n            framework, privatizes the management of the state-owned\n            electricity company, funds follow-up activities to the\n            privatization of the state petroleum company, and privatizes\n            the state telecommunications company. The second component\n            furnishes technical assistance to help prepare the poverty\n            reduction strategy which includes updating the poverty note\n            as well as diagnostic studies on public health, education,\n            rural transportation, the cotton sector, the livestock\n            sector, forestry, and mining. The third component supports\n            the technical committee for structural adjustment (CTP-PAS).\n            The fourth component supplies technical assistance to start\n            implementing the statistical development plan. The fifth\n            component strengthens the mining ministry."}, "docdt": "2000-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
