of long-term\n            funds to finance such growth, and improve financial\n            intermediation for industrial investment by: (i) assisting\n            in the development of productive industrial, agroindustrial,\n            industrial estate and tourism subprojects, particularly of\n            small and medium-scale enterprises; (ii) continuing the\n            efforts initiated under the First Industrial Credit Project\n            (Loan 1419-PA) to strengthen BNF and expand financial\n            intermediation in support of industry by lending to the\n            commercial banking system and a privately-owned development\n            finance company through FED; (iii) supporting the\n            Government's attempt to foster the regional growth of\n            industry and tourism development in the eastern part of the\n            country through a more effective role of BNF and FED; and\n            the establishment of an industrial estate in Encarnacion;\n            (iv) providing key extension services to small-scale\n            entrepreneurs through the National Vocational Training\n            Service (SNPP); and (v) supporting the Government's\n            actions leading to improvements in the interest rate\n            structure and controls of financial intermediaries."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
