The efficient and\n            effective operation of the regional road and railway links\n            is important to the country\u2019s growth potential. Through the\n            Railways Reforms Project, the previously inefficient and\n            non-profitable state-owned enterprise has been transformed\n            into two more accountable and transparent companies that are\n            increasingly adopting a commercial approach to their\n            operations as they implement new business plans. To deepen\n            the reform process, the World Bank and the government have\n            agreed on a detailed set of actions that are now being\n            implemented.
