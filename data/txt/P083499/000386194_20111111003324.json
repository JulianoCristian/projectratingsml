Project\n            for Macedonia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: planning for slow implementation of\n            institutional reforms. Implementation of complex reforms\n            takes time and the project timeline should have accommodated\n            possible delays with decision making. Maintaining regular\n            policy dialogue is therefore key to success. Combining\n            institutional reform and investments under the same project.\n            Careful consideration should be given whether to combine\n            physical investments with institutional reform of the\n            sector. In many cases, such combination would be prone to\n            significant delays and unsatisfactory implementation due to\n            the fact that institutional reform is a lengthy and\n            politically sensitive process and many factors could\n            influence the pace of reforms. Comprehensive analysis of\n            financial and operating performance is critical for\n            successful monitoring of railways projects. A recommendation\n            for future railway projects would be to pay special\n            attention to consistent interpretation and recording of\n            project indicators, particularly when the team composition changes."}, "docdt": "2011-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
