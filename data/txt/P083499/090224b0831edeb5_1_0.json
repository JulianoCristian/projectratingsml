In essence, the joint effort of the two Macedonian\n            Railways companies, the Ministry of Transport and\n            Communications, and the World Bank team, has turned the\n            previously inefficient, closed, and non-profitable\n            state-owned enterprise into companies that are now more\n            accountable and transparent. And they are increasingly\n            adopting a commercial approach to operations as they\n            implement newly developed business plans. The challenge now\n            facing the government and the railway companies is to\n            safeguard and deepen the reform process. This will require\n            full implementation of the legislative and regulatory\n            framework, and rehabilitation of critical sections of\n            corridor ten. Remaining steps are to increase safety and\n            operating speeds, and for the government to fully compensate\n            rail operators for passenger services they request. These\n            steps are necessary for a financially viable railway system\n            which is an essential element of the Former Yugoslav\n            Republic of Macedonia's economic and social development\n            as a member of the European Union."}, "docdt": "2011-02-16T01:17:02Z"}
