Its\n            operational performance was declining and was unable to pay\n            staff salaries. Railway Reform Project, financed by World\n            Bank, progressively transformed the single Macedonia\n            railways into two new market oriented companies, set up the\n            conditions for use of the railway infrastructure by other\n            operators, and established the regulatory framework for a\n            multiple operator market.
