To achieve these aims,\n            the project supports three main components. The first\n            component rehabilitates fishing port facilities and supports\n            the institutional strengthening of Fishery Management\n            Organizations to improve their management of fishing port\n            facilities, and to promote self-regulation as the key to\n            sustainable marine resource management. To that end, the\n            project recruits national coordiantors and regional\n            promoters, supplies international technical assistance to\n            the FMOs, prepares fishery management plans, develops marine\n            ecotourism, and supports training and demonstration\n            programs. The second component provides support to restock\n            carp in reservoirs, supports the Koran restocking program,\n            and pilots a program to test the aquaculture of new marine\n            and fresh water species such as tilapia and shrimp. The\n            third component finances legal training and assistance for\n            preparing technical documents, provides legal assitance to\n            support the Fisheries Directorate, supports a fisheries\n            management information system, and prepares a business plan\n            for the Fishery Research Institute."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
