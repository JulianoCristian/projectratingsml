designed to address the ecological and environmental issues\n            arising from over-fishing and the use of destructive and\n            unsustainable fishing methods. There are two major project\n            activities that may potentially present risks to the\n            environmental and ecology: a) the larger-scale aquaculture\n            activities for Koran, and high-value marine species; and b)\n            construction works for the rehabilitation of the fishing\n            ports. The construction of the quays at Shengjin and Saranda\n            will entail the loss of both intertidal habitat and bottom\n            habitat. The loss will be kept down to bare minimum with\n            good construction site management. Pollution of the aquatic\n            environment from increased vessel operations may be\n            mitigated by setting up waste reception facilities for each\n            operation separately. Port facilities will be equipped with\n            an oily water separator and suction pump. Special\n            receptacles will be provided inside the same port areas for\n            the disposal of used engine oil that will then be collected\n            by authorized collector for proper disposal. Receptacles\n            will also be provided for hazardous solid wastes. Skips or\n            enclosed dumping enclosures will be provided for the\n            disposal of large objects. Airtight PVC containers will be\n            provided in areas where wet fish wastes will be produced.\n            Refueling of vessels will be done in accordance with\n            internationally accepted standards. Wet wastes and\n            polystyrene foam from single-use fish boxes will be disposed\n            of by receptacles."}, "docdt": "2001-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
