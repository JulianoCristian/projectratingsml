Some lessons\n            learned included: although assessed as a high risk operation\n            at the time of appraisal, due to the conditions prevailing\n            at that time it was also viewed as the appropriate approach\n            to re-establishing control of the fisheries sector and\n            taking first steps toward its sustainable development.\n            Project objectives have been largely achieved, and the risky\n            strategy has proven to be appropriate. Frequent and\n            substantive guidance and support made available by the\n            supervision team was instrumental in capturing the benefits\n            of this approach. The availability and distribution of\n            Government subsidized fuel to fishing vessel owners via the\n            Fisheries Management Organizations (FMOs) provided an\n            economic incentive for vessel owners to become members, and\n            also helped FMOs establish financial self sufficiency. While\n            Government and sector stakeholders have achieved significant\n            progress in establishing the institutional framework for\n            co-management, sustainability of FMOs, their effective\n            operation of port facilities, and implementation of fishery\n            co-management will require continued leadership and\n            strategically targeted support from Government beyond the\n            five year life of the project. This should include provision\n            of joint training for FMO and fisheries inspectorate staff,\n            and collaborative development of operational procedures."}, "docdt": "2008-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
