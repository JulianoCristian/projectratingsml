INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT

INTERNATIONAL DEV3LOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
ISLAIKEC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $16 million to
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to assist in financing the foreign exchange
expenditure of the expansion program of the Telegraph and Telephone Department
of Pakistan (T&T) during the fiscal years 1969 - 1972.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed credit would be the first lending by the Bank Group
for telecommunications in Pakistan. The Government had at various times re-
quested such financing, but in the absence of a study of long-term develop-
ment needs, no basis for lending could be agreed upon. In 1965, however,
consultants, financed by a UNDP grant, were appointed, and they have now
completed their report. Information enabling the Association to appraise
the project (described in more detail in para. 9 - 16) became available in
June 1968.
3.        Negotiations took place in Washington from January 6 - 13, 1969.
The Borrower was represented by Mr. A.R. Bashir, Economic Minister to the
Embassy in Washington, Mr. M.M. Hussain, Director General of T&T, and
Mr. G.M. Sheikh, Assistant Chief Engineer (Coordination).
4.        The Bank has made 26 loans to Pakistan totalling $517 million of
which 17 are fully disbursed. The Association has made 25 credits totalling
$332 million of which 6 are fully disbursed. The following is a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Pakistan presently under dis-
bursement, as of January 31, 1969.

5.        Difficulties in the implementation of a number of projects,
particularly in East Pakistan, have made necessary several revisions
and postponements, but in general, satisfactory progress is now being
made. Approximately $30 million of the undisbursed amount of
$289.1 million is committed. Of the balance approximately $53 million
rermain in the Indus Basin (266-PAK) and the Tarbela (5h8-PAK) Loans.
6.        In the current fiscal year the Second Agricultural Development
Bank Credit amounting to $10 million (117-PAK), General Consultants
Credit amounting to $2 million (136-PAK), and a Fertilizer Project Loan
(5h9-PAK) amounting to $32 million were made. Disbursement of funds in
the early months of these three projects was not contemplated. The Bank
also expects to make an eighth loan to PICIC of $40 million. The second
fertilizer project in the Lahore area, for which a $28 million loan had
been negotiated, will not be proceeded with because the sponsors,
Adamjee/Cyanamid have decided not to go ahead with their project as the
Government has approved the erection of another plant by other sponsors
in a different location in West Pakistan. The second Sui Northern Gas
Pipeline Project for which a loan of $12 million had been negotiated
is consequently being reduced in size to serve one rather than two
fertilizer plants but to provide also for low pressure distribution
in urban areas. A proposed loan of $8 million is expected to be
presented for Executive Directors: consideration in April. The appraisal
of a West Pakistan Railway Project has been completed, and a proposed
loan of $14.5 million is expected to be referred to the Executive
Directors in May. A development credit of about $20 million for a third
Agricultural Development credit is being appraised. A Low Lift Pump
(East Pakistan) Project, about $10 million, is also being appraised
for presentation whenever additional IDA funds become available.
7.        IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling $28
million. The outstanding commitment net of repayments, cancellation
and sales of loans is about $23.4 million. IFC is presently considering
investment applications in the field of engineering and chemical
industries. The IFC operations in Pakistan are proceeding satisfactorily.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
8.        Borrower:               Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Beneficiary:            Telegraph and Telephone Department
of Pakistan (T&T).
Amount:                 Various currencies equivalent to
us $16 million.
Purpose:                To assist in financing the foreign
exchange expenditure required for T&T's
expansion program 1969/1972.
Amortization:           In 50 years with 10 years of grace,
through semi-annual installments
commencing June 15, 1979 and ending
December 15, 2C18, each installment to
and including the installment payable
on December 15, 1988 to be 1/2 of 1%
and each installment thereafter to be
1-1/2%.
Service Charge:         3/4 per cent.
Relending Terms:        The Government of Pakistan will relend
the proceeds of the Credit to T&T for a
term of 24 years including h years of
grace at 6% interest.
PART III -   THE PROJECT
9.        A report entitled "Appraisal of the Expansion Program of the
Telegraph and Telephone Department of Pakistan", No. TO-695a on the proposed
project is attached. At the time of partition, Pakistan's telephone network
was rudimentary with a telephone density of only 0.02 per 100 persons.
Since the Government introduced its series of Five-year plans in 1955, the
number of telephones in service has increased at an average rate of 12.25%
per annum.  Even so, the present telephone density at .143 per 100 is still
one of the lowest in the world. The overall average telephone density in
the world is six per 100. There is a considerable unfilled demand mainly
concentrated in the industrial and business sectors and amounting to some
70,0CO requests for service. As a result of the very low telephone density
the telephone calling rates are extremely high and on the average some eight
local calls are made per day from each telephone which is about three times
the level experienced in the more developed countries.
10.       The program of telephone and telecommunication expansion which is
at present being carried out and of which the project forms part, is con-
tained in the Pakistan Government's Third Five-year Plan covering fiscal
years 1966-70 with a carry forward into the first two years of the Fourth



Five-year Plan period. The Third Five-year Plan provides for the connection
of an additional 160,000 telephones, but due to certain external factors
and the shortage of foreign exchange only 41,000 telephones were installed
during the first three years of the plan. It is now expected that it will
be possible to step up the rate of provision of service and during the
fiscal years 1969-72 add no less than 175,000 telephones to the existing
system, which consisted of 172,000 telephones at the end of fiscal year
1968. Also included in the program are the provision of two satellite
ground stations for communication by satellite between East and Webst Pakistan,
expansion of the trunk network facilities by means of microwave and
auxiliary facilities, extension of the openwire long-distance network, pro-
vision of subscribers' long-distance dialing facilities to the main exchanges,
improvement of high-frequency radio facilities, extension and improvement
of the telegraph and telex networks, an expansion of training facilities and
the reorganization of the Department.
11.       The part of the expansion program, which it is proposed to under-
take with IDA financing, consists of the provision of cables for the
subscribers' distribution network, extension of the openwire long-distance
network, the installation of microwave and coa-xial cable systems, the
improvement of high-frequency radio facilities and the employment of con-
sultants in connection with the reorganization of the Department. The above
specific works are estimated to cost US $41.8 million. The proposed loan of
US $16 million would cover the foreign exchange costs of these works. The
balance of funds required for the program would be proiided from T&T's
own funds generated from its operations supplemented by Uo      5 $)5 million
equivalent of bilateral loans and suppliers' credits. A substantial part of
the supplementary external financing has been arranged. The Credit Aigreement
obligates the Borrower to use its best efforts to obtain the balance.
12.       The Government had originally also applied for funds to finance
the purchase of imported materials for the Telephone Industries of Pakistan,
a Government owned telephone manufacturing company separate from, but
closely associated with,T&T. Consideration of this request has been de-
ferred because the transactions between T&T and the Telephone Industries
of Pakistan were not on a commercial basis and it could not be determined
whether the Telephone Industries' operations were reasonably efficient
and competitive. The Government has indicated its intent to proceed with
a clearer separation of the two entities and to apply for a further credit
to provide, among other things, for the purchase of materials for manufactur-
ing, once this has been completed,
13.       The facilities to be provided in the project are expected to be
brought into operation in successive stages during fiscal years 1970-71-72.
All contracts proposed for Bank financing, other than the employment of
consultants, are to be .awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding.
14.       The T&T Department is qualified to carry out the expansion and
operate the new facilities effectively. The senior staff have extensive
experience in telecommunication operations, and the existing training
facilities are to be extended.    Such organizational weaknesses
as do exist have in the main resulted from the development of



- 7 -
the department within the civil service structure, a sharing of responsi-
bilities, (particularly in financial matters) with other departments, and a
failure to introduce a modern accounting system. The reorganization pro-
posed as part of the project is intended to overcome and eliminate these
weaknesses and to provide the organizational basis for an efficient and
businesslike public utility operation.
15.       Compliance with major covenants - the payment by T&T of debts and
contributions to the Government, the rate of return and the debt limitation
coverage - is contingent on a reorganization of T&T's financial relationship
with the Government and specifically on the operation of a modern accrual
accounting system which will be established with the help of consultants.
Pending the introduction of that system the Association and the Borrower
agreed to leave the present arrangements in force. There would be
little purpose in attempting partial and temporary improvements which would
only complicate the transition. Furthermore, financial results of T&T's
operations in recent years have been satisfactory and are expected to con-
tinue so in the foreseeable future. No change in tariffs is required at this
time.
16.       A detailed examination of the economic aspects of the project
has been undertaken, and a special effort has been made to define the
concepts, criteria and methodology needed to establish an economic rate of
return on a project of this kind. The supplement to the Appraisal report
contains this study, and a digest is given in Annex 18 of the Appraisal
Report. The conclusion is that the rate of return of the proposed invest-
ment would be well over 5O%.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for under Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and a draft resolution are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
18.       The following features of the draft Development Credit Agreement
are of particular interest:
(a) Section 2.02(b) provides that withdrawals and commitments
from the Credit Account may only exceed four million dollars if the
consultants required to be retained by Section 4.02(b) are so retained.
(b) Section 4.Ol(b) provides that the proceeds of the Credit
will be relent to T&T by the Borrower for a period of twenty-four years,
including four years' grace, to bear interest at 6% per annum.
(c) Section 4.07 requires the Borrower to pay its bills to T&T
on a current basis.
(d) Section 6.03 limits the duration of provisions dealing with
the operation and management of the project and with the obligations of
T&T to a period of twenty-four years, which is the period of repayment
of the relending provided in Section 4.Ol(b).

PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.       A Report on the Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Pakistan (AS-136a) was distributed to the Executive Directors cn April 22,
1968. A review of more recent developments is included in the President's
Report for a Second West Pakistan Highway Project (P_651) of November 13,
1968. An economic Mission has just returned from Pakistan. Its report is
expected to be distributed in April.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
