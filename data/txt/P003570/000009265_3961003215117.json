"The main objectives of the project are\n            to support the Ministry of Railways (MOR's) effort in\n            undertaking:  (a) railway policy and management initiatives;\n            (b) institutional development of the railway system; (c)\n            expansion of railway capacity; and (d) modernization of\n            railway technology on a systemwide basis.  The project\n            consists of:  (1) a policy component, comprising:  (a) the\n            application of the decision support system to determine\n            high-priority capacity expansion projects, and optimize\n            future railway investments programs; as well as (b) the\n            formulation and implementation of measures and plans to\n            rationalize the railway tariff system; (2) an investment\n            component, including:  (a) a capacity expansion subcomponent\n            comprising electrification of two major railway corridors;\n            (b) three systemwide technological modernization\n            subcomponents; and (c) a pilot container transport\n            subcomponent covering two main railway corridors; and (3) a\n            technical assistance component, including the preparation\n            and implementation of action plans for:  (a) expanding and\n            modernizing railway container transport services; (b)\n            implementing more cost-effective railway technology to\n            increase railway capacity at lower cost; and (c)\n            strengthening MOR's environmental protection capability\n            and solving some of its most pressing environmental problems."}, "docdt": "1993-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
