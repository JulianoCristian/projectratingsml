{"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory\n            with sustainability considered highly likely. Overall, the\n            World Bank's performance is assessed as satisfactory,\n            despite the lack of attention to the implementation of some\n            of the policy components in the \"middle years\" of\n            the project. Overall, Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            However, there were some significant procurement delays and\n            perhaps of even greater concern, the lack of recognition of\n            the importance of safeguard issues during the early years of\n            project implementation. There are four important lessons\n            cited in this report. First, if the Bank expects to\n            influence reform and change, it must make a long-term\n            commitment, and build a long-term relationship with its\n            client agencies. Genuine railway reform takes time in most\n            countries. Second, the Bank should never lose sight of the\n            fact that economic or political factors well beyond the\n            scope of this project can be major determinants of project\n            success or failure. Third, a very large project with many\n            investments and institutional development components will be\n            expensive for both the Bank and our clients to manage and\n            supervise. Finally, the client must fully appreciate the\n            importance and value of the Bank's safeguard policies\n            at the project. The Bank aggravated the problem by\n            continually \"raising the bar.\""}, "docdt": "2002-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
