Financing Data        IBRD loan

                      Amount: US$400 million

                      Term: IBRD Flexible Loan at 6 months LIBOR for US dollars
                      plus variable spread, with a 30 year maturity, including 5 year
                      grace period, commitment linked and with level repayment
                      pattern.

Operation Type        The proposed Programmatic Financial Rehabilitation
                      Development Policy Loan 1 (PFRL 1) is the first of a series of
                      two programmatic development policy loans designed to
                      support a multi-year program of assistance to Ukraine to
                      address the effects of the financial sector crisis. The first
                      PFRL aims at preserving the core Ukrainian banking sector in
                      the context of the crisis, while the second aims at restructuring
                      the sector and enhancing the legal and regulatory framework to
                      make it more resilient and position the sector for post crisis
                      recovery.

                      The full IBRD loan is expected to be withdrawn in a single
                      tranche of US$400 million.

Main Policy Areas     The PFRL series support the following four pillars of the
                      Government of Ukraine's program:
                         (i)   Banking sector recapitalization and restructuring
                         (ii)  Resolution and consolidation of the banking
                               system
                         (iii) Strengthening the deposit insurance payout
                               functions
                         (iv)  Enhancing the legal and regulatory framework
Key Outcome            Key outcome indicators under the project include: Banking
Indicators             system recapitalized (CAR 10 percent) using transparent
                       criteria (quantitative definition of systemic banks) allowing
                       the use of public funds only where there is no private sector
                       alternative (public funding automatically gives GoU 75
                       percent of voting rights and no special rights to minority
                       shareholders on voting rights, board positions, management,
                       or any future financial transactions); and increased efficiency
                       and transparency of bank resolution system. The exit of (15 -
                       25) non-viable banks rapidly consolidates the banking
                       system, lowering systemic risks. Adoption of policies that
                       ensure that DGF meets the following conditions: fast pay-out,
                       extra funding if needed, transparent investment of resources.

Program Development   The objectives of the proposed PFRL 1 are to: (i) support a
Objective(s) and      sound banking sector recapitalization program and
Contribution to CPS   restructuring process, (ii) enhance the legal framework for
                      bank resolution, and (iii) strengthen the deposit insurance
                      payout functions. This will in turn contribute to restoring
                      financial sector stability.

                      The CPS for 2008-2011 envisaged Bank engagement in the
                      financial sector through three cross-sectoral DPLs, which
                      included financial sector policy actions. To allow for deeper
                      engagement in the banking sector in the wake of the financial
                      crisis, the proposed PFRLs are being considered.

Risks and Risk        Three risks have been identified: macroeconomic, political and
Mitigation            implementation.

                      Macroeconomic risk is rooted in the following: (i)
                      inappropriate implementation of fiscal and monetary responses
                      in the context of upcoming presidential elections; (ii) worse
                      than expected external economic environment and terms of
                      trade deterioration; (iii) further depreciation of the exchange
                      rate with knock-on effects for corporate and banks; and (iv)
                      lower than expected roll-over of private sector external debt.
                      The main mitigant to macroeconomic risk is the framework
                      provided by the IMF program.

                      Political risks are high, due to a recent track record of
                      instability and the upcoming presidential elections, which may
                      delay or derail implementation of the program. However,
                      Ukraine has proven in the past, and yet again with the recent
                      approval of amendments on bank resolution, that it can
                      generate consensus at critical times. While political risks to
                      program implementation are substantial, this operation takes
                      the view that such risks are best managed through continued

                                          2
               active engagement and the design of a policy operation, which
               can serve as a focal point for critical reform steps.

               Implementation and governance risks pertain to the fact that
               program success is dependent on (i) transparent processes and
               appropriate use of public funding with respect to the bank
               recapitalization and resolutions program, and (ii) adequate
               technical skills of the NBU and RECAPU staff. The first is
               mitigated by adoption and disclosure of clear rules for the
               program and the fact that both the IMF SBA and PFRL series
               are anchored to the implementation of processes and rules.
               The second is mitigated by the strong technical capacity of
               staff of the RECAPU and CMD and a comprehensive TA
               program to support both entities.

               IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
PROPOSED PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL REHABILITATION DEVELOPMENT
                       POLICY LOAN 1
                        TO UKRAINE




                     I. INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY CONTEXT


1. This program document describes the first in the series of two Programmatic
Financial Rehabilitation Development Policy Loans (PFRLs) to Ukraine to support the
Government's financial sector rehabilitation program. The proposed operation is in the
amount of US$400 million.

2. The objective of the proposed PFRL 1 is to support the essential pillars of the
Government of Ukraine (GoU) bank rehabilitation program. In particular the proposed
PFRL 1 will: (i) support a sound banking sector recapitalization and restructuring process, (ii)
enhance the bank resolution framework, and (iii) strengthen the deposit insurance payout
functions. This will in turn contribute to restoring financial sector stability.

3. Ukraine is a lower middle income country. It lags its eastern European neighbors in
structural reforms, but has made important progress in some key areas, such as World
Trade Organization (WTO) membership. Ukraine is an open economy and strongly
supports closer integration with the European Union, and a new Association Agreement is
under negotiation to be signed in the near future, including a deep and comprehensive Free
Trade Agreement (FTA), which would anchor important institutional and structural reforms.
At the same time, the country continues to suffer from corruption, despite a significant
improvement in the environment for voice and participation since the political events of late
2004, often referred to as the "Orange Revolution".

4. Ukraine has experienced a substantial reduction in poverty rates in recent years, an
achievement that is now at risk due to the economic crisis. The headcount index fell
steadily from 46.9 percent in 2002 to just 12.3 percent in 2007 (measured by the US$5 in
Purchasing Power Parities poverty line) with a faster decline in urban poverty rates (see
Figure I.1 and Table I.1). The decline in poverty rates were mostly driven by real wage
increases but aided also by substantial government transfers, including a pension system
accounting for some 16 percent of GDP. Inequality has remained moderate by regional
standards. Social assistance transfers account for 2.5 percent of GDP, comparable with the
OECD average, but targeting is poor, with only around one third of transfers received by the
bottom 10 percent. There is a vast array of privileges, many of which are not targeted at all
but impose significant costs on both the national budget and on state owned enterprises
burdened with unfunded public service obligations. The crisis is likely to increase the poverty
headcount by several points and is putting a strain on the funding of social expenditures. The
social impact of the crisis and of this operation is analyzed in more detail in Section VII.A.

1/ The difference between the nationally derived rates and the WB staff estimates are due to differences in
methodology. The World Bank uses absolute measures of poverty (in particular, in defining a minimum
consumption basket), while the national estimates use a relative poverty line (70 percent to the median
consumption). Thus, the World Bank's poverty estimates measure changes in the welfare of the population,
while official poverty estimates are linked to relative changes in the distribution.

5. Vulnerability to poverty is high and pockets of poverty have persisted. A significant
share of the population is found in the vicinity of the poverty lines, implying that small
changes in economic activity can have large impacts on the number of poor. This
vulnerability is higher in urban areas, and thus higher energy prices and unemployment during
the economic downturn are likely to have a significant impact on this segment of the
population. The World Bank under the Social Assistance System Modernization Project and
the Development Policy Loan (DPL) IV (under preparation) is working with the authorities to
strengthen the targeting of the social assistance system to better protect the poor and
vulnerable (see the poverty impact analysis in Section VII.A). Pockets of poverty and
vulnerability persist among families with many children and households headed by single
mothers. The poverty headcount for pensioners is lower than the national average.

6. The government sector is large and inefficient, accounting for over 40 percent of
GDP. Significant inefficiencies persist in the financing and management of public services
and satisfaction levels with these services are low by regional standards, as highlighted by the
Life in Transition Survey conducted by the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2007. At the same time, capital spending is both
too low and poorly executed, with years of underinvestment in critical infrastructure
increasingly a risk to growth and security. As fiscal pressures are acute in the context of the
economic crisis, rationalization and improved allocation of fiscal spending is a key priority.
These priorities are being addressed in parallel to this operation through the World Bank DPL
series on socioeconomic reform/growth, investment loans for critical infrastructure and by
other International Financial Institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the EBRD and the European Investment Bank (EIB).


               II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

A.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

7. The global financial crisis exposed Ukraine's inherent macroeconomic and banking
sector vulnerabilities, leading to an acute economic crisis in which GDP is projected by
the World Bank experts to contract by 15 percent in 2009, compared with average
growth of 7.5 percent per annum between 2000 and 2007. The intensification of the
international financial crisis during the last quarter of 2008 triggered the joint materialization
of a range of pre-existing risks highlighted in previous World Bank documents. 1 These
include external debt refinancing (given the short maturity structure of external debt and high
leverage in the private sector), banking sector vulnerabilities associated with the rapid loan
growth and predominantly external funding of recent years, and terms of trade and external
demand vulnerabilities mainly related to the metallurgy and heavy industry sectors on the
export side and the gas sector on the import side (see Section B). The joint realization of
these risks continues to necessitate concerted macroeconomic policy responses. The
continued political infighting between various decision makers and the upcoming presidential
elections of January 2010 present a significant implementation risk in this regard, particularly
related to fiscal policy. The IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) approved in November 2008
continues to be the main anchor of the authorities' anti-crisis response.

8. After a strong recovery in growth during 2000-2007 following the 1998 financial
crisis, the economy was showing increased signs of overheating by late 2007. The
financial crisis of 1998 led to a realignment of the real exchange rate which, together with
fiscal and financial stabilization efforts, initial structural reforms, a favorable external
environment, and significant idle industrial capacity, helped to stimulate economic recovery.
Until early November 2008 the macro-policy framework involved a de facto peg of the
Hryvnia (UAH) to the US$, which placed a significant burden of the adjustment to external
shocks on fiscal policy. In an environment of positive external trade shocks and increased
access of the private sector to external borrowing, rising domestic demand was fueled by
current fiscal spending and transfers and rapid commercial bank lending. As a result, from

2005 growth shifted from being export-led to being consumption-led, placing additional
pressure on the external current account and price stability.

9. Macroeconomic pressures intensified in the first half of 2008. With rising
consumption and imports, the current account balance deteriorated from a surplus of 10.6
percent of GDP in 2004 to a deficit of 7.2 percent in 2008, despite substantial terms of trade
improvements over this period (see Table II.1). Up to mid-2008, the widening of the current
account deficit was financed by large inflows of foreign borrowing and foreign direct
investment (FDI). Inflationary pressures also mounted in 2008, driven by higher food and
energy prices, but also by an inconsistent macroeconomic policy mix with loose fiscal and
monetary policies. Real wage growth continued to outstrip productivity improvements. In
response, the Government tried to contain fiscal and monetary pressures by restraining non-
discretionary spending, over-executing revenues (helped by the de facto inflation tax),
tightening provisioning on external borrowings, and allowing the appreciation of the official
UAH rate by 4 percent relative to the US$ in May 2008. 2 Nevertheless, concerns over
overheating and rising inflation contributed to a widening in sovereign and corporate spreads
from the first half of 2008 onwards.

10. The Ukrainian economy has deteriorated sharply since the beginning of the crisis.
Annual real GDP growth decelerated to 2.1 percent in 2008, with an 8 percent year-on-year
contraction in the fourth quarter. Real GDP dropped by 20.3 percent in the first quarter of
2009, with fixed investments and private consumption falling by 48.7 percent and 11.6
percent year on year, respectively. Real exports fell by 15.9 percent while the decline in
domestic demand and the real exchange rate adjustment led to a sharp contraction of imports
(-35.6 percent), making the contribution of net exports to growth positive. Output indicators
remained sluggish through the second quarter, with industrial production contracting by about

5.05 UAH per dollar in line with NBU's Main Guidelines for the Monetary policy in 2008 that envisioned a
possibility for UAH/US$ fluctuations within the band of UAH 4.95-5.25 per dollar.

11. The fiscal situation has deteriorated. The decline in economic activity resulted in a
sharp drop in fiscal revenues in the last quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009, particularly
driven by a collapse in the VAT on imports and corporate income taxes. Based on a recent
review of revenue projections, the general government deficit is now projected to be at 6
percent of GDP (after 0.6 percent of GDP in corrective measures taken by the authorities
under the IMF-SBA second review). The decomposition of the deficit is roughly as follows:
3 percent of GDP originally envisaged in the approved 2009 budget (which included 2 percent
of Pension Fund deficit), close to 2.5 percent of GDP in revenue shortfalls, and 0.5 percent of
GDP in additional transfers to the Pension Fund (mainly due to payroll tax revenue shortfalls).
Adding the 2.6 percent of GDP operational deficit of Naftogaz (that includes the structural
deficit due to under-pricing), the aggregate deficit would be 8.6 percent of GDP. All this
excludes bank recapitalization costs (see paragraph 20). The 2010 deficit is a moving target
for now, but the Government has publicly committed to a deficit at or below 4 percent of
GDP (including transfers to Naftogaz).

12. The exchange rate took most of the burden of the initial adjustment, helping to
reduce substantially the current account deficit. The exchange rate depreciated sharply
(close to 40 percent 3 relative to the US$ over the last four months of 2008) as the capital and
financial accounts experienced large outflows. But, due to slippages in managing the
transition to a more flexible exchange rate, between October 2008 and June 2009 the National
Bank of Ukraine (NBU) spent over US$13 billion in reserves trying unsuccessfully to defend
the currency. According to preliminary data, external rebalancing is taking place with the
current account deficit amounting to US$0.7 billion in the first five months of 2009,
compared with US$6.4 billion a year ago. This adjustment has been driven primarily by the
sharp improvement in the trade balance. The level of gross foreign exchange reserves stands

mismatches, and loan concentration both by sector and borrower (including lending to related
parties). With rising concerns over the health of the banking sector, overall local currency
and foreign exchange deposits in the system fell significantly between September 2008 and
April 2009. However, the leakage started to subside in April and there was a small net
deposit inflow in May-June 2009 (see Section III for a detailed account of banking sector
developments).

B.      KEY MACROECONOMIC VULNERABILITIES

14. The key macro-financial vulnerabilities in Ukraine include the size and financing of
the fiscal deficit, the refinancing of private external debt, continued weak external
demand, the erosion of price competitiveness, and solvency and credit risks in the
banking sector. As discussed in Section E, the extent to which these vulnerabilities are
reduced through policy measures, or are realized through further domestic or external shocks,
will be an important determinant of the economic recovery and medium-term growth outlook.

15. Ukraine's key vulnerability now lies in its fiscal imbalance, brought about by steep
revenue falls against unrevised expenditure commitments and the large financing needs
of Naftogaz. Given recent developments, Bank staff estimate that the likely general
government deficit in 2009 to be 6 percent of GDP taking into account the corrective
measures agreed during the IMF's SBA second review. As stated earlier, this figure does not
account for bank recapitalization costs (currently expected at 2.9 percent of GDP in 2009) and
the operational financial gap of Naftogaz (generated largely due to under-pricing and
collection problems) estimated at 2.6 percent of GDP. Financing the fiscal deficit remains a
challenge, and this has prompted the IMF (requested by the Government) to start budget

support as part of the SBA. 4 The Government has also been discussing budget support with
the European Commission and bilateral donors. Moving forward, actions will be needed to (i)
reduce the structural financial gap of Naftogaz through gradual but significant tariff increases;
(ii) achieve fiscal savings in current spending of non-priority programs, (iii) move forward in
2010 with fiscal reforms on pensions, subsidies, and spending categories where structural
efficiencies can be achieved; and (iv) improve revenue mobilization through improved tax
policy and administration.

16. Aside from its structural deficit, Naftogaz has a cash flow gap in its purchases of gas
from Russia. This is mainly due to technical reasons related to the transit system capacity
and needs, which obliges Naftogaz to make purchases ahead of the heating season and
requires an amount of "technical" gas to be used during the transit operations throughout the
year. To help the financial situation of Naftogaz, the Government approved the
recapitalization of this company (with roughly 2 percent of GDP in resources) using
government bonds. 5 However, the underlying structural gap will continue to be a source of
fiscal instability if not addressed. The Bank macroeconomic indicators table and debt
sustainability analysis incorporates line items for the Naftogaz deficit and debt, respectively.

banks and more than one third of external corporate debt is owed to parent firms and/or
related parties abroad (see detail in Table II.2). Over the January-May 2009 period, the
overall external debt roll-over rate was at 80 percent, including a 103 percent rate in the
corporate sector and 74 percent rate in the banking sector. More than a third of the corporate
debt is with parent corporations or related firms abroad; the latter may be connected to thin
capitalization schemes used to reduce tax liability. Debt has been declining rapidly over the
last months in tandem with trade credits.

18. The adverse terms of trade and the export demand shocks have been sharp, and the
prospects of a rapid recovery in the external environment are not high.

  This recapitalization scheme would work similar to the bank recap scheme, with NBU cashing these
government bonds.

not likely to pick up fast. 6 These
developments have underpinned the need for shock absorption through lower domestic
demand and/or real exchange rate adjustment.

19. Wage and price inflation over 2005-2008 eroded Ukraine's competitive position (see
Figure II.4, Figure II.5). Consumer price inflation had been on the rise since mid 2007 and
peaked in May 2008 at 31 percent year-on-year. As economic activity declined along with a
tightening of monetary policy, inflation has fallen, reaching 15 percent year-on-year in June
2009, despite the pass-through of the sharp exchange rate depreciation. The higher level of
inflation compared to regional peers contributed to the real effective appreciation of the UAH
over recent years. This eroded Ukraine's external competitiveness at a time when its terms of
trade and access to finance were worsening. The adjustment has therefore involved a
combination of real wage restraint and real exchange rate correction since the beginning of
the financial crisis. Further correction may be needed as export demand continues to be low
and Ukraine's export competitors and neighboring economies are also depreciating their
currencies.

20. The solvency of the banking sector has been severely undermined. In the past few
months, several banks were put by the NBU under temporary administration and more
recently five systemic banks were recommended by the NBU to GoU for recapitalization with
public funding (see Section IV on GoU program). GoU announcement on the banks'
recapitalization, coupled with some NBU administrative measures, helped to reduce the
leakage of deposits from the system, but the situation remains fragile. Bank recapitalization
costs for 2009 were originally set at 4.5 percent of GDP. However, there was a delay in the
implementation of bank recapitalization and, as of now, fewer-than-planned banks are under
the recapitalization program, thus reducing the recapitalization costs to around 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2009, with the balance likely to fall due in 2010. However, these figures would need
to be recalculated continuously given the dynamic macroeconomic and financial sector
situation in general and the likelihood of a sharp increase in non-performing loans during the
remainder of 2009 in particular.


C.   THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE AND THE IMF STAND-BY
ARRANGEMENT

21. Against the background of a worsening external outlook and evident strains in the
domestic economy, the authorities requested an IMF supported program in late October
2008. An "Anti-Crisis" Law containing critical elements of the authorities' response to the
financial crisis was passed by the Verkhovna Rada on October 31, 2008 (including banking
sector stabilization measures, the creation of the stabilization fund, and policies to restrain
income growth). These measures, coupled with the introduction of exchange rate flexibility, a
commitment to prudent fiscal policy, and additional banking sector measures, helped to build
up the response of the Government that was supported by a Stand By Arrangement (SBA)
amounting to SDR 11 billion (US$16.6 billion) over two years. The policy actions supported
by the IMF SBA are detailed in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP). 7

22. The difficult political environment has constrained the ability of the authorities to
implement all needed macroeconomic policies. This is particularly the case with fiscal
measures to contain the general government deficit and close or at least reduce the financial
gap in Naftogaz. Needed measures on pensions and subsidies are politically difficult as they
require legal amendments, in the context of a broken parliamentary coalition. Utility tariff
increases are also difficult as they are widely unpopular, in the midst of an on-going electoral
campaign towards the presidential elections and a sharp domestic recession. As regards to
banking sector measures, a number of positive developments have taken place and the process
of banks' recapitalization is underway, although more remains to be done to complete the
recapitalization program, initiate a restructuring program for banks that will be recapitalized
with public funding, and enhance the resolution framework (see Section IV on Government
Program).

23. The IMF's Board approved the second review under the Stand-By Arrangement on
July 28th, 2009. The corresponding third tranche disbursement would be for SDR 2.1 billion
(approximately US$3.3 billion). 8 All end-May quantitative performance criteria and prior
actions have been met. In addition to the legal amendments on bank resolution, prior actions
included: an announcement to increase the price of natural gas paid by households and utility
companies (with implementation deadlines in September for households and October for
utility companies); a revised 2009 financial plan for Naftogaz; and amendments to recent
regulations that limited progress towards a more flexible exchange rate policy. As a prior
action, the authorities also implemented fiscal corrective measures worth 0.6 percent of GDP
for 2009. The fiscal deficit target under the program (now expanded to also include
Naftogaz's deficit) has been increased to 8.6 percent of GDP to cushion the impact of
economic contraction and due to the increased financing needs of Naftogaz. The
disbursement for the second review can be channeled to the budget to finance this increased
deficit. The current macroeconomic projections following the IMF's SBA second review
show an expected real GDP contraction of 14 percent in 2009, against 8 percent at the time of
the first review.

D.       MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

24. Ukraine has entered a deep recession as a result of the global credit crunch, a terms
of trade deterioration, and the slowdown in export demand. The macroeconomic
stabilization in the face of the crisis requires orderly adjustment to external imbalances
through a combination of reducing the current account deficit and achieving high external
refinancing rates. The former will require a shift in the composition of aggregate demand
towards net exports and further diversification of the export base, the latter a macroeconomic
and structural policy framework that safeguards stability and fosters a return to sustainable

 During the first review the IMF agreed to re-phase the disbursements under the SBA planned under the first
and second reviews in two equal amounts, which increased the planned second tranche from the original amount
(of SDR 1.3 billion), and allowed half of the second tranche to be used for budget support. The Board also
granted waivers on the nonobservance of performance criteria on the passage of the zero-deficit 2009 budget,
exchange rate restrictions, multiple currency practices, and the imposition of import restrictions, which the
authorities have committed to remove in the near future. The staff report for First Review under the Stand-By
Arrangement and revised version of the MEFP are available on:

economic growth. In this context, fiscal policy should aim at reining in the fiscal deficit in the
remainder of 2009 and into 2010, maintaining prudent and financeable deficits. Key to the
fiscal adjustment and medium-term sustainability are pension and utility tariff reforms, as
well as reforms in subsidies and social programs. The stock of public and publicly guaranteed
debt reached 20 percent of GDP at the end of 2008, and is projected to remain sustainable,
even after adding the potential costs of bank recapitalization. While the IMF SBA provides
an anchor to Ukraine's macroeconomic policies over the next two years, implementation risks
remain large, both in terms of inadequate fiscal adjustment and insufficient structural reforms.
World Bank efforts are targeted to complement the IMF SBA in both areas.

25. The basic macroeconomic parameters in our baseline forecast are broadly consistent
with those of the IMF's SBA. Table II.3 contains our latest macroeconomic estimates for
2009-2012, and includes the IMF SBA over the next 2 years. Given continued global and
domestic volatility, the assumptions underlying these projections are likely to undergo further
revisions and thus the projections presented here are associated with a more than usual degree
of uncertainty.

26. The key factors underlying these projections are as follows:

    (a)     The economy will be in a recession in 2009 with real GDP projected to
            contract by 15 percent, followed by slow recovery to 1 percent growth in 2010,
            and then to a medium-term average growth between 4-5 percent starting in
            2012. The estimated medium-term growth rate is consistent with a rather
            moderate pace of convergence towards European Union income levels based on a
            modest pace of structural reforms. It is at a lower level than the previous growth
            episode, owing to an assumed protracted high level of risk aversion in international
            capital markets. More broadly, Ukraine's medium term growth prospects depend


                                                 14
      heavily on its ability to improve productivity growth by strengthening the enabling
      environment for innovation and investment.

(b)   Balance of payments pressures will require an adjustment to the composition
      of growth through 2009. Domestic demand is expected to contract sharply,
      following years of rapid expansion, while the contribution of net exports is going
      to become positive due to rapid import contraction. The growth composition is
      expected to stabilize thereafter with moderate (compared to output dynamics)
      domestic demand growth.

(c)   As a result, the current account deficit is expected to improve from over 7
      percent of GDP in 2008 to an overall balance in 2009-10. To achieve this
      adjustment, a 40 percent real import contraction would be needed in 2009 in order
      to counter the assumed 10 percent terms of trade deterioration and 16 percent
      decline of real exports. This move to current account balance is consistent with
      the significant tightening of fiscal and income policies needed.

(d)   With this current account adjustment the balance of payments would be
      financeable under our baseline assumptions. Our estimates show that a
      combination of smaller FDI inflows, a 72 percent of external debt roll-over, and
      the IMF SBA would cover the balance of payments needs that Ukraine faces in
      2009 (see Table II.4). The medium-term projections assume a slow normalization
      of access to financing beginning in 2010-12. With the IMF SBA the level of gross
      international reserves is expected to stabilize at above 5 months of imports over
      the medium term.

(e)   Real wages and employment are projected to decline further in 2009 to restore
      the price competitiveness of Ukrainian exports in the wake of declining export
      prices and to support the adjustment in aggregate demand. In the context of tight
      labor regulations it is likely that real wage adjustment will be larger relative to
      changes in employment.

(f)   The NBU is expected to move gradually to a system of inflation targeting with
      consumer price inflation declining to around 8.8 percent in 2011. As the NBU
      will limit foreign exchange interventions, the exchange rate will cease to serve as a
      formal or informal nominal anchor for prices. Declining commodity prices,
      limited monetary growth and cooling domestic demand will contribute to
      disinflation. However, offsetting this, the pass-through of exchange rate
      depreciation, upward adjustment of energy and utilities tariffs, and a still sizable
      fiscal deficit (mostly originated by current transfers) will make disinflation a more
      prolonged process.

(g)   The general government deficit will be at 6 percent of GDP in 2009 (8.6
      percent including Naftogaz' deficit) , just over 4 percent in 2010 and around 3
      percent in 2010-12 (not accounting for banks' recapitalization costs but
      including all transfers to Naftogaz in 2010 and onwards). Growth in public
      consumption will decelerate to provide more room for capital spending. In the
      absence of substantial market access, the bulk of financing for the budget deficit
      will come from official sources, primarily the IFIs.

27. Accounting for the potential fiscal costs of banks recapitalization, and taking the
above assumptions for the fiscal deficit in 2009 and 2010, direct public debt levels are
projected to remain sustainable in the base case. Given the low level of direct public debt
(at 13.8 percent of GDP in 2008) and the projected fiscal cost of recapitalizations, direct
public debt would increase to just above 28 percent of GDP in a base case scenario. Figure
II.7 below presents a number of debt sustainability stress scenarios. For example, the level
would rise to 35 percent of GDP under a stress scenario that doubles the fiscal costs of banks'
recapitalizations. These calculations encompass an adjustment path for the exchange rate
consistent with macroeconomic balance. Should the exchange rate depreciate significantly
more than expected (30 percent beyond the base case), the required capital injections into the
banking sector would be larger (closer to the stress scenario) but at the same time existing
public debt, which is predominantly denominated in foreign currency, would also increase as
a share of GDP. A combined stress test, doubling banks' recapitalization costs and assuming
the exchange rate overshoots by 30 percent from the base case, would take public debt levels
to 40 percent of GDP. Significant fiscal reforms in 2010 will therefore be needed to avoid
compromising debt sustainability. The analysis below also contains stress scenarios with the
IMF's lending through the SBA and contingent liabilities generated by all Naftogaz debt
(even though only a small fraction has sovereign guarantee).

28. The labor market will need to play an important role in economic adjustment to the
crisis, with both employment and real wages having to adjust downwards. During the
last seven years real wage growth outpaced real GDP growth by more than 100 percentage
points (cumulative) and outstripped underlying productivity growth. At the same time,
unemployment almost halved to 6.2 percent as of mid-2008. With the economy going
through a recession, the real wage is likely to drop by more than output. Using the experience
of the 1998-1999 crisis to calibrate the real wage response to GDP decline, we roughly
estimate that the real wage might decline up to 20 percent in 2009. During the last quarter of
2008 and first quarter of 2009, firms were approaching redundancies carefully, using "leave
without pay", negotiated vacations without pay, and wage cuts. But in the second quarter of
2009, the savings achieved through those routes seem to have been exhausted and now
employment is being adjusted, with unemployment rates growing to 10.3 percent (ILO
methodology) by end of June. Further wage and employment adjustments are likely to
generate unease among unions and other workers associations.

E.         MACROECONOMIC RISKS MOVING FORWARD

29. Clearly, the downward economic adjustment has been sharp and further downside
risks are significant. The most important risks to this forecast are: inappropriate fiscal
and monetary policies (particularly in the context of the run up to the presidential
elections), above-expected and prolonged terms of trade deterioration, and external debt
refinancing difficulties with its impact on corporate and household balance sheets (and
consequent banking sector credit risk). More specifically:

     (i)    Inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies. There is a tangible risk that an
            additional (significant) fiscal deficit (in 2009 and 2010) driven by pre-electoral

                                                          17
       policy/legislation ­ without equivalent corrective measures -- could compromise
       fiscal sustainability and further weaken investor and creditor confidence, leading to a
       disorderly adjustment with exchange rate and roll-over rates implications in the short
       term as well as longer term borrowing cost effects. Moreover, excessive
       monetization of the deficit moving forward may place non-trivial pressures on
       inflation and the exchange rate while implementation slippages of the new exchange
       rate regime may exacerbate the risks of disorderly adjustment. The authorities and
       political stakeholders need to come together to take joint responsibility for the
       policies needed over the next two years to respond appropriately to the current
       economic crisis.

(ii)   Terms of trade and global demand shock. While our base case forecast assumes a
       sharp decline of metal prices in 2009, the correction may turn out to be stronger,
       leading to a larger deterioration of the terms of trade. On the import side, the terms
       of trade might deteriorate further should oil price dynamics be higher than expected,
       with upward implications for natural gas prices. In such event, the economy would
       need to further reduce domestic absorption and, correspondingly, growth. A similar
       effect would result from worse than expected growth dynamics in major trading
       partners.

(iii) Private debt refinancing. Our baseline assumes a 72 percent roll-over rate for
      external debt in 2009 based on the substantial presence of foreign-owned banks,
      foreign corporations, and large Ukrainian corporations with offshore subsidiaries.
      Nonetheless, the risk of parent banks having little room to refinance their
      subsidiaries in Ukraine (due to their own liquidity and solvency problems) remains.
      Should the international financing environment deteriorate again, or Ukraine's
      perceived risks increase, banks and corporations might not be able to reach this level
      of refinancing, and the resulting financing gap would likely require additional
      exchange rate adjustments to reach external balance. Our estimation suggests that a
      10 percent reduction of the debt roll-over assumption would imply about US$4
      billion of additional financing needs and a corresponding need for further reductions
      in the current account deficit. Strong policy action by the authorities as agreed
      under the IMF SBA would provide the right signal to private sector lenders and may
      allow a faster resumption of external financing. Without private sector action,
      support from official lenders is unlikely to be sufficient.

(iv) Credit and exchange rate risks in the banking sector. In addition to liquidity and
     refinancing risks, the banking and corporate sectors face significant credit (balance
     sheet) risks associated with the possibility of loose fiscal and monetary policies and
     slippages in the implementation of the new exchange rate regime that could lead to
     an overshooting of the exchange rate. This would harm domestic un-hedged
     borrowers (particularly those with limited export activities and households) and
     directly and indirectly (through feedback loops) the banks' balance sheets. Policy
     makers face difficult trade-offs in this context between achieving external balance
     through exchange rate adjustment rather than costly real wage declines on the one
     hand, and the balance sheet stress that a larger devaluation implies on the other.

                      III. RECENT BANKING SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS

30. The banking sector dominates the financial sector, with 90 percent of private
financial sector assets. Even with more rapid development of the non-banking financial
system in recent years and large inflows of foreign investments in the insurance, leasing and
non-bank consumer lending institutions, the share of the non-banking financial sector is less
than 10 percent of GDP. Hence, as systemic risks are primarily concentrated in the banking
sector, the remainder of this section focuses exclusively on this sector.

31. The Ukrainian banking system experienced a major expansion in the 2006-2008
period. Ukraine's banking sector assets grew at record levels in 2005-2008, registering one
of the highest growth rates in the region and reaching 84 percent of GDP in 2007 and nearly
98 percent of GDP in 2008 (See Table III.1). A stable exchange rate, abundant external
liquidity, and steady economic growth provided an impetus for the rapid expansion of
corporate lending, while increasing real income and the consumption boom drove the
development of retail lending. At the same time, Western European markets enjoyed
considerable liquidity and European banking groups started expanding aggressively in
Ukraine.

32. As of June 2009, there were 187 banks in Ukraine, a large number of which are very
small and serve primarily related companies. Although NBU liquidated 62 banks during
the period 2000-1H2009, the banking sector is populated by an inordinate number of small
banks with less than US$100 million of total assets (see banks in group 4 ­ Table III.2). This
owes to regulatory forbearance of tough entry rules on paper (minimum capital amounts to
Euro 10 million and 10 percent CAR) and weak enforcement of the existing supervisory
framework. Many of the 120 small banks (which are classified by the NBU as group 4 banks
by the size of their assets) are "pocket banks", established to provide banking and treasury
operations to related companies, mainly large industrial-financial conglomerates. The Table
III.2 below presents data for the sector divided into four groups by asset size, which is the

classification used by the NBU for supervisory purposes. Group 1 consists of 18 banks,
Group 2 of 20 banks, Group 3 of 24 and Group 4 of 122.

33. In recent years the banking sector has been characterized by rapid entry of many
foreign banking groups. Many local banks have expanded fast in the hope of being acquired
by foreign banks. Out of 187 registered banks, the number of banks with foreign capital has
more than doubled during 2006-2009, growing from 23 banks in 2005 to 51 banks by mid-
2009. Of these, 17 banks are fully foreign owned, representing leading international groups
such as Unicredit Group, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, Raiffeisen, ING, Citibank, SWED,
SEB, OTP, a number of Russian banks and many banks from CEE and CIS (see Table III.3).

34. By July 1, 2009, the share of foreign capital in the total registered capital increased
to 39.1 percent as compared to 27.6 percent at the end 2006 and around 13 percent in
2000. Assets of foreign owned banks reached 55 percent of total assets of the banking sector,
while the top 10 commercial banks (including six foreign controlled, two state-owned and two
private owned Ukrainian banks) account for 53.2 percent of assets. A number of local banks
have followed the risky strategy of expanding their assets at all costs in order to gain market
share in the hope of being acquired by a foreign bank at a multiple of their book value. These
distorted incentives contributed to excessive risk taking behavior on behalf of many bankers
and to the overbanking of the system.

 35. Growing market competition, particularly in the retail and large corporate customer
 segments, has resulted in fast paced lending growth in 2006-2008, especially in US$. In
 just three years assets increased more than 4 times to UAH 926 billion and banks' loan
 portfolios grew nearly 5 times, showing one of the highest growth rates in the region (see
 Table III.4). Total loans increased from UAH 156 billion at the end of 2005 to UAH 792
 billion at the end of 2008. Starting from a very low comparative base, the retail lending
 portfolio expanded even more aggressively, recording an 8-times growth during 2005-2008.
 Specifically, the household loan portfolio grew by 134 percent, 97.6 percent and 75 percent in
 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. In terms of currency composition, the banks' balance
 sheets are significantly "dollarized". The share of foreign currency loans (primarily in US$
 equivalent) in banks' retail loan portfolios at the end of 2008 stood at nearly 73 percent and
 remained at 72.9% as of end June 2009. The share of foreign currency loans in total loans
 account for 56 percent (see Table III.5). Foreign currency denominated assets comprised 51.1
 percent of banking sector assets as of July 1, 2009.

36. Credit growth has been funded among other sources by external borrowings, many
of which fall due in 2009, and short term liabilities. Since the early 2000s, banks loans
have grown faster than the domestic deposit base. The loan to deposit ratio for the system
was one of the highest in Eastern Europe at about 211 percent in December 2008 (up from
117 percent in 2005 ­ see Table III.5). The share of external borrowing of banks grew to
US$40 billion as of 2008 year end, or more than 1/3 of banks' total liabilities, the lion share
of which are syndicated loans with an average maturity of around one year. It is estimated
that about US$12 billion of banking sector external debt falls due in 2009. In addition to the
short term maturity profile of the banks' external borrowing, 60 percent of domestic deposits
are demand deposits and term deposits, with maturity up to one year. The short term structure
of the liabilities of the Ukrainian banking sector exposes many banks to significant liquidity
and solvency risks.

37. Currency and maturity risks have been compounded by severe underprovisioning.
In the case of Ukraine underprovisioning is due both to unsound credit practices and rapid
credit growth, as well as inadequate enforcement of NBU loan classification and loss
provisioning (LLP) rules. Main shortcomings of lending practices include: limited credit
history especially for the retail segment due to the fact that the portfolios are relatively young
and limited coverage of customers by the credit bureaus (out of four credit bureaus, two (First
All-Ukrainian Bureau of Credit Histories and International Credit Bureau) operate in line with
the international practices and have foreign equity, but so far have only 20 percent coverage),
high debt to income and loan to value ratios, in a context where it is difficult to document
income and assess real market values of the underlying assets. Lack of precise definition and
tests for troubled loan restructuring, absence of rigorous tests to control for re-aging of loans
and over-reliance on collateral result in likely under-provisioning, while the absence of sound
practices and experience in debt restructuring and foreclosures in a legal system where
repossession and divestiture can take a number of years complicate debt workouts,

38. Macroeconomic shocks and political uncertainties in the context of the above
mentioned vulnerabilities, caused a sharp drop of confidence and an outflow of more
than 25 percent of deposits in the period of September 2008-April 2009, with 12 percent
deposits reduction in 1H2009. The rapid devaluation of the national currency UAH since
October (58.4 percent in October 2008-Jan 2009) and depositors' run on Prominvestbank in
October 2008 significantly undermined confidence in the banking sector and triggered
massive withdrawals of deposits. The period October-December 2008 saw a deposit flight of
15 percent for UAH deposits and 13 percent of FX deposits (adjusted for UAH depreciation in
October-December 2008). This first wave of deposit withdrawals was caused both by the
UAH devaluation and political infighting (see Section IV on Government program), plus

                                                    22
reduction of trust in banks by the general population as a reaction to the banking and the
economic crisis. Another UAH 44 billion (UAH 28.2 billion of corporate deposits and UAH
15.8 billion of household deposits, which stands for 12 percent of corporate and household
deposits respectively) was withdrawn by depositors in January-June 2009. Interest rates in
the interbank market hiked significantly; and the difficult liquidity situation was further
compounded by the closure for a number of weeks of interbank lending among banks.

liquidity injections by              Figure III.2: Loans issued to banks by NBU, UAH mln

accompanied by the

of the recapitalization

of October ­ December
2008       the    NBU
provided banks with
more than UAH 50
billion of net new
lending.         NBU's
exposure to nearly 130 Source NBU
banks thus increased at record levels to UAH 60.6 billion at the end of 2008 and UAH 80.6
billion as of end April 2009 (see Figure III.2). In spite of the massive liquidity support, the
deposits outflow continued. The share of liquid assets in total assets dropped from an average
15 percent during 2001-2007 to 9 percent by the end of June 2009. Only since May, in
response to NBU measures and following GoU announcement of its recapitalization program
for systemic banks, there has been a noticeable slow down of deposit outflow , with recorded
1.6 percent aggregate deposits growth in May-June 2009. During this period (May-June
2009) retail deposits increased by 3.4 percent, while corporate deposits on the books of banks
reduced by 1.4 percent. However, the situation remains fragile and liquidity risk remains high


                                                                                        23
for the next few months, due to the substantial amount of banks' external debts falling due in
the rest of 2009 and tightening NBU obligatory reserve requirements. A number of banks
have met their external obligations, however several of them (including Finance & Credit,
FUIB, etc.) have not repaid on a timely basis and instead have launched debt restructuring
renegotiation proposals. Banks with significant liquidity and most likely solvency problems
have been transferred into provisional administration, as outlined below.

40. Credit defaults have escalated in the first few months of 2009 due to the sharp
decline in Ukraine's exports and rapid Hryvnia devaluation, which exposed unhedged
borrowers.       This                   Figure III.3: Liquid assets and demand deposits
has resulted in the
wiping      out     of
capital      in      a
number of banks.

obligations.
Overexposure        of      Source: NBU
the banks to the traditional exporting sectors such as steel and metals, whose output has
plummeted in recent months, has further impacted portfolio quality. As a result, in the first
six months of 2009, LLPs grew by 67 percent; non-performing loans (substandard, doubtful
and loss) have nearly doubled and are estimated to have reached 15-20 percent of total loans.
The Ukrainian National Mortgage Association estimates 20-30 percent of mortgages to be
non-performing in 2009, up from 1 percent in 2008 (primarily due to foreign exchange risks).
In addition to residential mortgages, many banks have exposure to the real estate sector, with
loans often extended against unrealistic asset valuations. As real estate prices have
plummeted, collateral values have been eroded. Assets of the banking sector shrank by 6.6
percent to UAH 864.7 billion from UAH 926 billion during the period January-June 2009 and
banks have recorded losses of UAH 14.3 billion as of July 1, 2009. This is explained
primarily by the significant build up of loan loss provisions due to portfolio deterioration and
expected future losses, including on the books of some severely distressed banks under
temporary administration (e.g. Ukrprombank). In addition, the reduction of lending activity
also brings lower earnings to banks to cover their operational and administrative costs. Based
on the diagnostic exercise conducted by the NBU with the involvement of banks' external
auditors, 25 of the largest 38 banks were undercapitalized to different degrees (see more
details in Section IV). The diagnostic results are likely to understate the amount of capital
shortfalls, as the second round impact of the crisis in the real sector have yet to be felt and the
macroeconomic assumptions used in diagnostic could have been overly optimistic.

41. Bad debt workout and transfers of assets to specialized collection or asset
management companies is hampered by confusing tax legislation and limited knowledge
of asset valuation by market participants. While the legislation for asset repossession and
registration of secured interests is in place and out-of-court repossession and settlement of
debts is allowed, banks have limited experience in bad debt work outs and asset valuation.
Moreover, ambiguity and contradictions in tax legislation with relation to sale/transfer of
assets to debt collection companies, and passage in the Parliament of Ukraine of numerous
laws preventing asset repossession, make it difficult to transfer assets.

42. NBU temporary administration of banks was introduced in 19 institutions, with 16 of
them under temporary administration as of July 2009. Factors contributing to illiquidity
and insolvency in several large and small banks include poor liquidity and risks management,
excessive credit and foreign exchange risks and related parties operations, in addition to the
general loss of confidence in the wake of the Prominvestbank run. Nadra, Ukrprombank and
a dozen of medium to small size banks have not been able to meet the claims of depositors
and creditors despite the significant liquidity support from the NBU in October-December
2009. As a result, in October 2008-June 2009 NBU introduced temporary administration in
19 banks, imposing a formal legal moratorium on repayment of liabilities (including a freeze
of household deposits) and mandating temporary administrators to develop resolution
programs. Since then the temporary administration has been lifted in three banks:
Prominvestbank (ranked 7th in total assets as of April 1, 2009) was sold to a new shareholder
(Russian Vnesheconom Bank purchased 73 percent of bank's shares), and Prichernomorja
Bank (ranked #167 by assets) and bank Odessa (ranked #124 by assets) were put into
liquidation (See Table III.6). A bank recapitalization program has been developed for the five
systemic banks, Kiev, Nadra, Rodovid, Ukrprombank, Ukrgazbank, while the temporary
administrators and the NBU are developing a strategy for the smaller banks. See Section IV
for details.

43. Until very recently, the existing resolution framework allowed only for liquidation
and recapitalization of systemically important banks with government resources.
Transfer of assets and liabilities was de facto not implementable in Ukraine. The options
for bank resolutions were thus limited to (i) liquidation of a bank with payoff of insured
individual depositors through DGF; (ii) recapitalization of the bank by the Government for
systemically important banks; and (iii) a transfer of selected assets and liabilities (P&A) of a
bank to an acquiring bank with no financial assistance from the Government. The legislation
also provided the possibility of voluntary merges and acquisitions, but in practice few such
deals happened. While an open bank P&A was foreseen by the existing framework, in
practice it was very difficult to implement, as consents of creditors, including depositors, had
to be obtained, and creditors had the right to accelerate their debt so that it would be
immediately payable by the bank. The requirement of creditor consent created a significant
operational impediment, particularly for larger banks with numerous depositors. Moreover,
the absence of financial assistance for P&As limited the effectiveness of that resolution
method. Finally, no closed bank P&As or bridge banks were possible.

44. Complex rules to intervene troubled banks, the absence of key resolution tools and
the low ranking of DGF in bank liquidation made bank resolution very expensive in
Ukraine. Due to complex rules to intervene banks, interventions were often triggered by
NBU at a fairly late stage, therefore little value was left in the bank by the time the liquidation
process was initiated and very little was recovered. Moreover, the DGF was 5th in line, after
uninsured household depositors, with respect to priorities in liquidation. The fact that very
little value was recovered in liquidation, combined with the low ranking of DGF, made it
almost impossible for the DGF to recover any cost.


      IV. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

45. To address the root causes of the crisis, the GoU has committed to a two phase
program -- crisis response and medium term. The first phase aims at preserving the core
banking sector through the period of crisis. The second aims at supporting consolidation and
increasing the sector's resilience to future crisis by strengthening supervision and governance.

46. The GoU's banking sector rehabilitation program focuses on five areas: (i)
enhancing market confidence, (ii) establishing an effective liquidity management
framework, (iii) performing a diagnostic test to determine the banks' financial
condition, (iv) enforcing a private and public bank recapitalization scheme, and a
resolution program based on least cost principles, and (v) strengthening the
legal/regulatory and enforcement frameworks. Although the program has not been
articulated in a single policy document, policy decisions have been taken in the above
mentioned areas in a number of laws and regulations, in particular: the Anti-Crisis Law, the
Law on State 2009 budget, the Law on amending other legal acts of Ukraine (with respect to
financial rehabilitation measures), CoM Resolutions #960, #214 and #249 (amending
Resolution #960) and various NBU regulations (Regulations #319, #389 and #455). Details
of the program in the above areas are summarized below. The institutional arrangements for
the diagnostic tests and the bank recapitalization and resolution program in Ukraine are
represented in Figure IV.1.



                                                26
47. Market confidence, liquidity management, bank diagnostics, bank recapitalizations
or resolution, and enhancement of the supervisory framework are the key pillars of any
comprehensive crisis response. Market confidence measures aim at stemming the deposit
outflow and usually include policies on deposit protection, crisis communication strategy to
stop panic and the creation of a crisis management committee to coordinate the major policy
decisions. To ensure that the banking sector has enough liquidity to function, central banks
expand the provision of liquidity (maturity, terms, types of acceptable collateral), but at the
same time ensure that liquidity is not provided to insolvent banks (in many jurisdictions a
"solvency option" is required from regulators prior to central bank lending). Since the capital
adequacy of many banks is likely to have been significantly impaired by the crisis, a program
to assess the extent of the undercapitalization is required. Following the determination of the
extent of capital impairment, the banks need to be recapitalized to the extent possible with
private resources and, when not possible, banks need to be recapitalized or resolved with
financial assistance from the Government. Finally, to prevent future crisis from happening,
the supervisory framework should be reassessed and, if required, strengthened.

48. The banking sector rehabilitation program has been designed around "common
denominator" goals amongst stakeholders, including political parties. The Government's
Letter of Development Policy has received endorsement letters from both the Presidential
Secretariat and the NBU (see Annex 1). The Ukrainian and foreign bankers associations,
financial sector regulators and donors engaged in the sector have been consulted at key
junctures on the design of the program. The program has also found support across party
lines. Indeed, the head of the banking sector committee responsible for key legislative
changes required for the implementation of the Government's program is a senior opposition
politician. The fact that the legal amendments introducing new bank resolution tools have
been approved by a large majority (larger than that supporting GoU) is a testament of the
cross party support for the banking sector rehabilitation reform agenda. Nonetheless,
financial sector policies have been an issue of vigorous political debate and significant
attention in the media and the authorities will need to continue to communicate consistently
on the main objectives and implementation steps of the program.

Market confidence and crisis resolution framework

49. To deal effectively with the crisis and restore market confidence, a crisis
management committee has been created, the deposit insurance coverage has been
increased and the DGF has received additional funding. The Crisis Management
Committee includes representatives from the Cabinet of Ministers, the President's Secretariat
and the NBU. The Committee acts as the main coordinating body on crisis response, being in
charge of broad policy decisions. With the Anti-Crisis Law, the deposit coverage has been
increased to UAH 150,000 (about US$20,000 equivalent) from UAH 50,000. The Law also
foresees the possibility of transferring a quarter of NBU profits (and not less than UAH 1
billion) yearly to the DGF as well as to the State Mortgage Institution and recapitalized banks;
in late 2008, the NBU already transferred UAH 1 billion to the DGF.

50. In addition, to prepare for the eventuality of large scale pay-outs, the DGF has
developed a crisis management plan including the option of borrowing on an emergency
basis. The plan includes staff relocation and work plan in case of large scale reimbursements
and the enhancement of the exchange of information between the NBU and the DGF, so that


                                              27
the latter receives information more promptly on intervened banks. Given the limited
financial resources of the DGF (DGF funds amount to 4.2 percent of total insured deposits as
of end Q2 2009), the NBU has approved a regulation outlining the process to extend bridge
financing to the DGF on an emergency basis. On the basis of the regulation, DGF can obtain
financing if more than 80 percent of DGF's resources are depleted or expected to be depleted.
Financing can be provided against government securities, state guarantees, and/or future
premium payments to the DGF.

Liquidity framework

51. NBU amended the existing liquidity framework in late 2008 ­ early 2009.
Specifically, in November 2008, NBU approved Regulation #319 (subsequently abolished by
Regulation #413 in December 2009). The regulation expanded the range of acceptable
collateral that could be offered for liquidity purposes to include all collateral deemed to be
liquid and increased loan to collateral value to 90 percent. Moreover, based on the approved
regulation, liquidity support could be extended up to 60 percent of the bank regulatory capital
(rather than 50 percent) for banks whose deposit base has decreased by more than 2 percent in
the previous 5 days. Regulations #259 "On approving the procedure for regulation of banks'
liquidity" and #262 "On credit support to banks in case of threat to their stability", approved
by the NBU Board on April 30, 2009 to replace the above mentioned regulation, have reduced
the length for NBU short term liquidity support of banks, clarified criteria for extension of
loans to banks in financial rehabilitation, revised collateral eligible for refinancing. As a
result of the crisis, NBU has extended significant liquidity support to banks (see paragraph
39), including severely undercapitalized ones. Provision of large liquidity lines to banks
reputed to be severely undercapitalized proved very controversial amongst the authorities and
led to an attempt to dismiss the NBU Governor and to the adoption, and subsequent repeal, of
Article 86 of the Law on State 2009 budget, which required NBU's preapproval of
refinancing lines with the GoU.

52. Despite significant political controversy, NBU seems to have followed existing
policies for the provision of liquidity. A recently completed audit by Ernst and Young on
behalf of the IMF of the NBU's liquidity support suggests that the NBU followed approved
procedures and authorization policies in conducting liquidity operations in late 2008.
However, going forward there is a need to continue improving the liquidity framework. The
IMF will continue to monitor and work with NBU to enhance the liquidity framework.

Diagnostic and viability test framework

53. All banks have undergone a diagnostic exercise, led by the NBU and performed by
international and local auditing firms, to determine their capital adequacy and solvency.
The diagnostic audits are based on a methodology developed by the NBU (with IMF and WB
support) and conducted by the banks' auditors. The diagnostic is primarily geared at
assessing regulatory capital shortfalls. It is based on November 1, 2008 data for banks in
group 1, January 1, 2009 data for banks in group 2, and March 1, 2009 data for banks in
groups 3 and 4. The bank's financials have been stress tested based on specific assumptions
agreed in the diagnostic exercise.




                                              28
54. Based on the results of the diagnostics, banks are required to increase their CAR to
10 percent by the end of 2009 or exit the market. Banks that have a CAR lower than 10
percent based on the stress tests have been required to increase it to 8 percent by May 1, 2009
for banks in group 1 and 2, and by the end of the summer for banks in group 3 and 4. All
banks are required to reach 10 percent by end of December 2009.

55. The results of the diagnostic tests are assessed by two level committees within the
NBU, which put forward a recommendation to the NBU Board. The first level committee
(FLC) provides an analysis of the diagnostic results of each bank, provides an opinion on the
diagnostic, and seeks clarification when necessary. Based on the information provided by the
FLC, the second level committee (SLC) makes a recommendation to the NBU Board. In
order to make a final recommendation, the SLC verifies the banks recapitalization plan and
requires the shareholders committed to investing resources to sign a commitment letter with a
specific timeline.

56. At the end of the review process, undercapitalized banks are divided in 3 types: 1)
banks whose shareholders commit to raise private funding to increase CAR to 10
percent by year end (type A); 2) banks that can apply for a capital injection with public
funding (type B); and 3) banks that will be resolved based on a least cost option (type C
and D). See Figure IV.1. Banks type A are banks whose shareholders have committed to
increasing CAR to 8 percent by May 1 and 10 percent by end December 2009. Banks type B
are banks that are systemically important (banks with 2 percent or more of total banking
assets and 1 percent or more of household deposits) 9 and whose shareholders have not
committed to increase capital to the required level(s). These banks are potential candidates
for recapitalization with public funds. Banks type C and D are not systemic banks and their
shareholders have not committed to increase capital to the required level(s); as such they will
either be liquidated or resolved otherwise.

    Figure IV.1. Institutional Arrangements of the Diagnostic and Recapitalization and Resolution Program




9
 There is no complete overlap between the definition of group 1, 2, 3, 4 used by NBU for supervisory purposes
and the definition of systemic. There are 25 systemically important banks, 24 are in group 1 and 2 and one in
group 3.

                                                     29
57. Following the completion of the diagnostic phase for banks in group 1 and 2, 25
banks (out of 38) were found to be undercapitalized to various degrees. The shareholders
of all banks in group 1 and 2, except for four, have committed to increasing capital. Nadra
Bank, Rodovid Bank, Ukrgazbank and Ukrprombank have been recommended by the NBU to
MoF for recapitalization with public funding, given their systemic nature and the fact that
shareholders did not commit to recapitalization (in full or part). Bank Kiev, a systemic bank
of group 3 has also been recommended by the NBU, thus bringing the number of banks
subject to the public recapitalization program to five 10. Amongst the 13 banks in group 1 and
2 not requiring further capital upon completion of the diagnostic exercise, two were state
owned banks for which GoU had preemptively increased their capital. UAH 3.7 billion and
UAH 12.6 billion were injected in Ukreximbank and Oshchadniy bank respectively in late
2008 and an additional UAH 1 billion of GoU bonds in Ukreximbank in May 2009.

58. Of the 21 banks whose shareholders committed to raise private capital, 15 have not
fulfilled the commitments and 8 banks have been subject to NBU sanctions. Of the 15
non compliant banks, 11 banks have a CAR < 8 percent and another 4 banks have a CAR
between 8 percent and 10 percent. The level of undercapitalization of the 11 banks that do
not meet a CAR of 8 percent varies, with four banks substantially undercapitalized. Of the 15
undercapitalized banks, 8 banks have been put under a sanction regime, during which they
will not be allowed to grow their balance sheet. Compliance with the sanctions will be
monitored by dedicated NBU staff from the on-site supervision department. The owners of
all 15 non compliant banks have committed to a phased capital increase starting from
September 2009 and on the basis of all banks in group 1 and 2 are expected to reach CAR 10
percent as per diagnostic studies by the end of December 2009.

       Banks which were sufficiently capitalized                                                     13

        (*) An additional systemic bank of group 3, Bank Kiev, will be recapitalized with public funding

59. The diagnostic phase for the banks in group 3 and 4 has just been completed and it is
estimated that there are 31 undercapitalized banks. Given the poorer quality of the
diagnostics for banks in group 3 and 4, the NBU complemented the exercise with on-site
inspections in selected banks out of 31 undercapitalized banks. Of the 31 undercapitalized
banks, the shareholders of 26 banks have committed to increasing capital to the required level
by the end of December 2009, while NBU is in process of developing a resolution strategy for
the remaining 5 undercapitalized banks. In one of these banks NBU has introduced
provisional administration.


10
   Originally seven banks were proposed for the state recapitalization. In addition to Kiev, Nadra, Rodovid,
Ukrprombank and Ukrgazbank, Finance & Credit and Imex bank also requested GoU assistance. However, the
shareholders of these banks have eventually refused state participation. This can be explained by the fact that the
GoU has tightened its "entry requirements" for receipt of state capital support by revising COM Resolution #960
in February-April 2009 (amendments introduced by the COM Resolutions ## 148, 241, 429) and insisting on
75%+1 share in votes/shares, dilution of shares of existing shareholders, appointment of a temporary
administration and change of a bank's management.

                                                       30
Banks recapitalization with public funding and resolution

60. To prepare and monitor the GoU investment in recapitalized banks, the GoU has
created a dedicated unit (RECAPU) in the MoF and appointed a dedicated Board. To
resolve non-systemic banks the NBU has created a Crisis Management Department
(CMD). A dedicated unit on bank recapitalization was established in the Ministry of Finance,
with 21 staff. The unit (RECAPU) is subordinated directly to the Minister of Finance and is
in charge of preparing and monitoring the GoU investments in banks. A nine members
RECAP Board was established under the auspices of the CoM, chaired by the Prime Minister
of Ukraine and comprising representatives of the MoF, NBU, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of
Economy, and CoM. The RECAP Board includes two international experts with non-voting
powers. To coordinate the work of the temporary administrators and advise on resolution
methods a CMD was created and staffed in the NBU.

61. Banks that are eligible for recapitalization with public funding are recommended by
the NBU Board to the MoF via the RECAPU, which undertakes the required analysis.
Applications are further approved by the RECAP Board and CoM. Systemic
undercapitalized banks are eligible for recapitalization with public funding. For these banks
the NBU is in charge of updating the capital shortfall calculation based on the November
2008 diagnostics and of appointing a temporary administrator who is in charge of adjusting
the capital of the bank, and the nominal value of its shares, to the level specified in the bank
statements as of the date of the updated diagnostic. With this, plus other information, the
RECAPU prepares the application for the GoU funding, which is then submitted to the
RECAP Board and CoM for final approval.

62. Recapitalization with public funds comes with conditions attached, namely,
shareholders' dilution, the GoU voting rights of at least 75 percent, and no special rights
for minority shareholders. To ensure that public funding is used only when there are no
private sector alternatives, the existing shareholders are diluted, public recapitalization entitles
the GoU to at least 75 percent of voting rights, and no special privileges can be given to
minority shareholders. The existing shareholders also need to disclose the ultimate controllers
of the bank.

63. Recapitalization bonds have been designed so that the yield/amount is sufficient to
ensure that the bank is able to achieve positive operating cash flows and positive
operating income, but the banks' access to liquidity from the sale of recapitalization
bonds is restricted. Given that the banks' earning assets have been sharply diminished by
the rising proportion of nonperforming loans and the priority is to rebuild liquidity, rather than
lend to generate income, the banks' ability to generate positive operating income is in large
measure be a function of the yield/amount of recapitalization bonds received. Moreover,
control on the access to liquidity is important to ensure that funds are not misused. Based on
these two principles, recapitalization bonds are issued with eight and nine year maturities and
a yield of 9.5 percent. Bonds can be cashed only at the NBU and based on a previously
approved (by the RECAP board) liquidity plan, which initially coincides with the deposit
withdrawal schedule.




                                                31
64. Frozen deposits are being liberalized in the recapitalized banks, new management
and supervisory board are being appointed and a full due diligence is being conducted.
Lending activities will be restricted until a restructuring plan has been approved.
Deposits are being "unfrozen" starting with smaller deposits and based on an agreed liquidity
plan between the NBU and the MoF. Fit and proper management and members of the
supervisory board are being appointed and both will be tasked with managing and supervising
major restructuring; to facilitate consolidation and organic restructuring, to the extent possible
the same individuals will be appointed to the supervisory boards of each recapitalized bank.
A comprehensive due diligence to re-assess the capital shortfall estimated by the NBU prior
to recapitalization is being conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Ernst and
Young on the three banks recapitalized with public funding. Should a capital deficiency be
identified, the GoU will increase the banks' capital. Lending activities will be limited until a
restructuring plan has been approved and it will be released gradually and upon evidence that
the management meets the targets established in the restructuring plan.

65. GoU has committed to divesting itself of banks recapitalized with public funding in
the medium term through a transparent tender process. Upon restructuring and re-
establishment of the viability of the banks recapitalized with public funding, GoU has
committed to selling its shares in the banks. Minority shareholders have no special privileges
to this end and public tenders will be conducted.

66. To date, CoM has approved the recapitalization of Bank Kiev, Rodovid Bank and
Ukrgazbank. A decision on Nadra Bank and Ukrprombank is pending, following
agreements with creditors and compliance with other requirements stated in the CoM
Resolution #960. As per CoM decisions ## 566, 567, 580 of June 10, 2009, CoM has agreed
to recapitalize bank Bank Kiev, Rodovid Bank and Ukrgazbank. Upon write down of capital
owned by existing shareholders and following issuance of new shares to be acquired by the
GoU, the GoU will hold 99.94 percent, 99.97 percent and 81.58 percent of Kiev, Rodovid and
Ukrgazbank, respectively. A decision on Nadra Bank and Ukrprombank will be taken prior to
the expiration on the moratorium of deposits and upon conclusion of the negotiations between
the temporary administrators and the banks' creditors.

67. To increase the bank resolution tools available to the NBU, legislative amendments
have been approved to make it possible to conduct purchase and assumptions, and
create bridge banks, in addition to their liquidation (which is already possible in
Ukraine). The amendments enable revaluation of shareholder capital by the temporary
administrator without creditor notification; allow for the transfer of assets and liabilities
(purchase and assumption transactions) on an open or closed bank basis (i.e. before or after
license revocation) without prior approval of creditors, including depositors; enable the
Government to provide financial assistance to banks under resolution and to acquirers of such
banks by the MoF; provide authority to create a bridge bank, and the GoU to own it, as part
of, or to facilitate, a resolution transaction; and introduce civil liability protection for the
NBU, the DGF and the MoF officials, temporary administrators, auditors and contractors
when discharging tasks related to their official duties; simplify grounds for introduction of
temporary administration in problem banks by the NBU by reducing applicable time period,
defining key terms, and deleting unnecessary conditions; and change bank liquidation
requirements to provide a higher priority for the GoU, the NBU and the DGF funding.



                                               32
68. The CMD will be in charge of preparing resolution decisions. The CMD has been
tasked with identification of the most suitable resolution method based on a least cost test; the
resolution method for each individual bank will be approved by the NBU Board. Should the
resolution require GoU funding, and to ensure appropriate checks and balances, the MoF will
engage a third party on behalf of the GoU to conduct a due diligence on the asset valuation. In
the medium term, GoU has committed to transferring some resolution powers to the DGF,
potentially ranging from transferring liquidation functions, to requiring the DGF to act as a
temporary administrator in resolving banks, to full resolution powers.

Strengthening the legal and regulatory for supervision

69. GoU post-crisis financial sector strategy aims at ensuring that the banking sector is
more consolidated and resilient to future crisis. In the medium term GoU and NBU
strategy aims at promoting a deeper yet less fragmented banking sector, this will be achieved
by strengthening supervision, governance, and possibly increasing minimum capital
requirements. The implementation of the recently approved resolution tools, including
simplification of the grounds for intervening in banks will also lead to consolidation.
Enhanced supervision will be key to ensure that the sector is more resilient to future crises.

70. In line with this vision, GoU has committed to promoting disclosure of ultimate
controllers, promoting consolidated supervision and the NBU is committed to increasing
data disclosure and enhancing its governance. Increasing disclosure and introducing
consolidated supervision in the medium term will require amendments to a number of laws,
including the Laws on Banks, on Financial Services, Capital Markets and Insurance.


               V. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A.      LINK TO CPS

71. The proposed operation is consistent with the principles of the 2007-2011 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS). The CPS was built on the principles of selectivity, flexibility,
and partnership. The CPS recognizes the need to react flexibly to a dynamically changing
economic environment. The CPS envisaged support in the financial sector through a
combination of advisory assistance, ongoing investment lending operations and as part of a
series of three cross-sectoral DPLs (paragraph 77). However, in response to the global
financial crisis and the resulting shift in the GoU priorities, there is a need for deeper
engagement in the financial sector and support for a comprehensive approach to banking
sector strengthening. Consistent with the CPS principle of selectivity, and in line with good
practice of DPL conditionality, the proposed new series of PFRLs is narrowly focused on the
banking and financial sector reform agenda. The CPS Progress Report, planned for FY10,
will reflect the adjustments to the program to take account of this and other developments.




                                               33
B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

72. The proposed PFRL series is being developed in close collaboration with other IFIs
and donors engaged in the sector. The proposed operation has been designed together with
the IMF and other key international donors, namely EBRD, IFC, USAID and US Treasury.

73. The program between the authorities and the IMF involves a multi-sector strategy
covering exchange rate, monetary, banking sector and fiscal policies. A flexible exchange
rate has been implemented to cushion against terms-of-trade shocks, and further action is
expected on establishing a nominal anchor and enhancing NBU independence. Monetary
tightening is foreseen to guard against inflation and currency depreciation, while liquidity
provision is being met through reductions in effective reserve requirements and liberal
collateral rules for refinancing. The banking sector program is detailed under the government
program section (see Section IV). The fiscal program envisages a tighter stance in the light of
financing constraints; cuts in planned wages and subsidies, and utility tariff increases
accompanied by measures to protect the most vulnerable.

74. Technical assistance under the program is being provided in a coordinated fashion
by the Bank, IMF, USAID, US Treasury and IFC. Under the PFRL, the Bank has
provided extensive technical assistance (TA) to the MoF to set up the RECAPU and design a
transparent recapitalization process. The IMF has assisted the NBU in the diagnostic phase.
Both the Bank and the IMF have assisted GoU and the NBU in designing the resolution tools
introduced under the recently approved amendments. The EBRD has provided grant funding
to the NBU to fund diagnostics of banks in Group 3 and 4 and is planning to provide TA to
the MoF. The US Treasury is also supporting the bank rehabilitation program by providing
TA to the NBU on resolution transactions and to the MoF on recapitalization. The IFC is
assisting financial institutions improve risk management practices and GoU to improve the
legal framework for distressed assets. USAID and EU funded programs aim at addressing
medium term challenges faced by the Ukrainian financial markets, namely improvement in
capital markets infrastructure and mortgage lending, and adoption of EU directives/standards
in financial sector regulations.

75. EBRD and IFC have also committed to providing investments to the banking sector.
The EBRD has committed EUR 500 million to invest in the banking sector in Ukraine. Thus
far it has made investments in Bank Forum (Commerzbank Group), Procreditbank,
Raiffeisenbank Aval (Raiffeisen International Group), Ukreximbank, and Ukrsotsbank
(Unicredit Group) for EUR 400 million in aggregate. Moreover, investments in Mega Bank
and Ukrsibbank (BNP Paribas Group) have been approved for the total of EUR 85 million.
Up to date IFC has invested more than US$200 million into the Ukrainian banking sector in
form of equity, debt and trade finance facilities. Most recently, US$20 million IFC
investment (US$10 million sub-debt and US$10 million convertible debt) in Megabank, a
medium-sized Ukrainian bank, was approved, jointly with EBRD. In addition, the IFC
approved US$40 million trade credit facility with Ukreximbank and US$30 million with
Raiffeisenbank Aval.

76. To support banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe, the EBRD, the EIB, and
the World Bank Group have pledged to provide up to EUR 24.5 billion over a two year
period in the context of a joint IFI initiative. The World Bank Group committed to


                                              34
investing EUR 7.5 billion (EUR 2 billion by the IFC in the banking and infrastructure sector
and advisory services; EUR 3.5 billion by IBRD to address banking sector issues, and EUR 2
billion by MIGA). Thus far, the World Bank Group has approved EUR 688 million, of which
EUR 500 million by MIGA for political risk insurance, and EUR 188 million by the World
Bank for financial sector support. The IFC is focusing on equity and trade finance, including
through selective investments in Ukrainian institutions. While the IFI initiative is not directly
targeted at Ukraine, by supporting, amongst others, European groups operating in Ukraine, it
supports the banking sector in the country.

C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

77. The Bank is engaged in Ukraine through a parallel DPL series, which supports the
Government's socioeconomic reform program to promote sustainable and broad-based
growth. In particular the series focuses on improving the investment climate, creating fiscal
space for growth through strengthened public finances and public sector reforms and
improving service delivery and social inclusion. The third DPL in the series was approved by
the Board of the World Bank in December 2008. Consideration was originally given to use
the DPL III as a vehicle to support bank rehabilitation efforts. However, the deepening of the
banking sector crisis expanded the sets of reforms needed to overcome it to an extent which
justified the initiation of a separate DPL series focused exclusively on banking sector reforms,
the PFRL. Consistent with the principles of good practice on conditionality, the latter
envisage narrow, financial sector-focused conditionality. In parallel to the PFRL 1, the Bank
is preparing the DPL IV in the socioeconomic reform/growth series. Together, the two DPL
series support a solid agenda of core policies that assist Ukraine overcome the current
economic and financial crisis.

78. The Bank provides financing to part of the banking system through lines of credit
operations. In particular, the Bank is providing medium and long-term working capital and
investment loans to Ukrainian exporting enterprises under the Second Export Development
Project (EDP2). The Borrower for the Project is UkrExImbank, state-owned foreign trade and
development bank, which channels the loan proceeds through participating commercial banks
to eligible sub-borrowers. Since EDP2 effectiveness in Spring 2007 about US$100 million
were provided to banks out of US$154 million available under this line of credit. Additional
Financing for the EDP2 of around US$120 million is planned for the fiscal year 2010.

79. The Bank also supports the improvement of the enabling environment for financial
intermediation through non-lending technical assistance and grants. Through a stand-
alone Dutch Grant for Financial Sector Reform Program (EUR 1.5 million), and the
Programmatic Technical Assistance Program/Free Trade Agreement Technical Assistance
(PTAP/FTA TA), the Bank also supports the improvement of enabling environment for
financial intermediation by strengthening the legislative framework and the institutional
capacity of financial sector regulatory bodies. Under PTAP in particular, the Bank and
USAID deliver technical assistance to the Government and regulatory agencies to develop
security markets and non-bank financial institutions in preparation for the introduction of a
second pillar to the pension system, and for integration into the EU single financial market
under the planned deep and comprehensive FTA.



                                               35
D.          LESSONS LEARNED

80. The Bank recently has undertaken a comprehensive review, both in its operations
and research areas, of its responses to earlier financial crises. 11 Notably, the largest Bank
crisis-response programs for South Korea, Argentina, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia
have been reviewed and critically assessed.

81. The main generic lessons from Bank responses to previous related to the importance
of an early response. The fiscal cost of interventions can be quite large, but the cost of
inaction can be even larger. The proposed Bank operation comes at a time when the
Ukrainian banking system is undercapitalized but still has enough capital and potential for
new capital increases as to sustain operations in the short-term.

82. Prior crises led to large temporary increases in Bank lending, often underpinned by
ambitious programs of policy reform. Experience, for example, during the events of the
1990s, points to three broad areas requiring close attention:

        · Focus and selectivity. The speed and focus of Bank response are both crucial for
good outcomes during and after crises. Past crisis support was much more successful when it
was nested in a results framework (explicit or implicit) that incorporated selective coverage,
and focused on the Bank's comparative strengths. The proposed operation incorporates this
lesson by focusing only on policy actions that address directly the immediate needs of
stabilizing the financial sector.

        · Financing modalities and organizational arrangements.                Programmatic
Development Policy Loans (not available in previous crises) can usefully address crisis needs.
This lesson has been chiefly incorporated in the proposed PFRL 1, as the proposed operation
is a programmatic DPL.

        · Coordination with partners. Coordination among key partners, particularly with the
IMF, is critical, as differences of view surface quickly during crises and are potentially
damaging to achieve better results. Collaboration across the Bank Group also strengthens
program effectiveness. The proposed PFRL 1 incorporates fully this lesson, in fact the Bank
program has been designed together with IMF and other key donors active in the sector and is
part of the joint IFI initiative in the financial sector.

E.          ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

83. The PFRL series relies on the findings of the FSAP carried out in the first half of 2008
and management note on the financial sector prepared in the Fall of 2008.

       VI. THE PROPOSED PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL REHABILITATION
                        DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN 1
A.      OPERATION DESCRIPTION

84. The objectives of the proposed PFRLs are to: (i) support a sound banks recapitalization
and restructuring process using public funding (when private solutions are not feasible), (ii)
consolidate the banking sector by enhancing the resolution framework, and (iii) strengthen the
deposit insurance payout functions. This will in turn contribute to restoring financial sector
stability.

85. PFRL 1 focuses on rescuing the core banking sector. As such the first policy operation
focuses on the recapitalization process with public funds for systemic banks, enhancement of
the resolution framework and strengthening of the pay-out functions of the DGF.

86. PFRL 2 focuses on medium term objectives of consolidation and increased resilience
to future crisis. Under PFRL 2, banks recapitalized with public funding will undergo major
restructuring (both on the asset and liabilities sides), the new resolution framework will be
implemented on non-systemic banks and some resolution responsibility will be transferred to
the DGF. This, together with more stringent regulatory measures, will facilitate consolidation
in the sector. Further enhancement of the regulatory framework for bank supervision
(including strengthening of on-site supervision, introducing consolidated supervision and
requirement to disclose ultimate shareholders, introducing incentives for loan portfolio
restructuring in provisioning levels, improving home-host supervisory arrangements,
introducing IFRS and enhancing NBU governance) will increase the sector resilience to future
crisis. The decision to address these issues in the medium term is founded on the following
rationale: (i) given limited capacity, the NBU and the GoU should focus on the most essential
task first, namely preservation of a core banking sector, (ii) in the current political
environment there is no appetite to introduce legal reforms unless such reforms are directly
related to the crisis, and (iii) prior to the introduction of regulatory changes related to
supervision, a comprehensive review of the supervisory architecture will be required and such
review should take into account lessons learnt internationally from the crisis.

87. The PFRL series supports three areas of the Government banking program, namely
market confidence, private and public bank recapitalization and bank resolution, and
strengthening of the legal-regulatory framework. The PFRL 1 has four pillars. The first
focuses on ensuring that the publicly funded recapitalization program is transparent and
designed in a way that public funds are used only when there are no private alternatives and
that the private recapitalization program is implemented in a transparent and timely fashion
(First Pillar). PFRL 1 also focuses on the introduction of a more efficient resolution system
(Second Pillar) and on preparing the DGF in case large pay-outs are required (Third Pillar).
PFRL 2 focuses on restructuring the recapitalized banks and completion of the privately
funded recapitalization program (First Pillar); implementation of the new resolution
framework (Second and Third Pillar); and strengthening the legal-regulatory framework
(Fourth Pillar).

88. The policy actions (including the triggers) for the PFRLs are included in the Policy
Matrix. The prior actions for PFRL 1 are featured in Box 1 below. The overall program
outcomes envisaged through the two programmatic operations are featured in the last column
of the Policy Matrix.

                    Box 1. Prior Actions/Tranche Release Conditions/Triggers for PFRL 1

The following constitute prior actions for presentation of the Loan to the Bank's Board of Directors:

 1.    Adoption by the CoM or MoF of resolutions or orders, as the case may be, to establish the institutional
       framework for a transparent bank recapitalization with public funding, to define criteria for accessing
       public funding for recapitalization, to layout the recapitalization process, including bond structure and
       liquidity requirements, and to specify monitoring/governance framework of banks recapitalized with public
       funding.

 2.    Implementation by MoF and NBU of the newly established recapitalization process by recapitalizing three
       banks with public funding (Ukrgazbank, Rodovid Bank and Bank Kiev).

 3.    Adoption by NBU of a regulation outlining specific and monitorable enforcement actions and timeline to
       ensure compliance by undercapitalized banks with privately funded recapitalization program.

 4.    Amendment of the legislative framework to introduce more efficient bank resolution techniques, including,
       amongst others: transfer of assets and liabilities without prior creditor approval (including depositors)
       before and after bank license revocation; powers of the Government to provide financial assistance to
       banks under resolution and/or to acquirers of such banks; creation of bridge banks owned by the Borrower;
       simplification of the grounds for introduction of temporary administration in problem banks by the NBU;
       civil liability protection for the NBU, the DGF and MoF officials, temporary administrators, auditors and
       contractors when discharging functions related to their official duties; and change in bank liquidation
       requirements to provide a higher priority for Government, NBU and DGF funding.

 Consistent with the principles of good practice on conditionality, the present PFRL series narrows
 conditionality to only four triggers, designed to ensure progress in a few critical areas. This operation specifies
 four triggers with the purpose to achieve breakthroughs in few critical areas as a result of the program. The
 design assumes broad continuity in the Government's strategic vision and the gradual deepening of the dialog
 around critical reform bottlenecks. The reforms underpinning the PFRL series coincide with key areas of the
 Government's bank rehabilitation program, as a result all triggers and other benchmarks are owned by the
 authorities. The legal amendments required for the fourth trigger have been extensively commented and
 discussed with the authorities and other stakeholders. As a result they have been approved in Parliament by a
 large majority.




                                                         38
89. The design of the Government's reform program and PFRL 1 has benefited from
consultations with relevant stakeholders (as required by OP 8.60). The authorities have
pro-actively communicated with the public through the media on the objectives of the
program. The Prime Minister has met with depositors affected by the temporary moratorium
in intervened banks and has highlighted that depositors in recapitalized banks would receive
access to their deposits ­ which has helped stabilize market confidence. Throughout the
crisis, senior politicians have met with banking sector representatives to discuss reform
options and priorities. The President of Ukraine has held several roundtables, some of which
have been attended by IFI representatives. Bank staff has also consulted with stakeholders,
including banking sector representatives, academic experts, members of parliament (including
the opposition) and representatives of the key foreign investors in Ukraine's financial sector.
The team also held deep background briefings for journalists to make them aware of the
strategy being followed. Despite these efforts, the financial sector policies of the authorities
remain strongly debated, and with approaching Presidential elections, the implementation of
the program remains at risk of becoming politicized. Open and consistent communication of
the program's objectives and structure thus remain important going forward.

90. By supporting banking sector stability, and hence protecting households' deposits,
PFRL 1 assists in mitigating the impact of the crisis on the population. By focusing on
the recapitalization of systemically important banks and introduction of more efficient
resolution tools that allow for protection of deposits at lower cost to taxpayers, the PFRLs
help to avoid the loss of deposits. In turn this helps avoid the potential further
impoverishment of households that now depend heavily on the cushion provided by their
savings to support their consumption.

B.      POLICY AREAS

91. As for any budget support operation, a sound macroeconomic framework needs to
be in place. Given the fact that Ukraine is availing itself of an IMF stand-by facility, such an
arrangement needs to be on-track for the Bank to disburse a budget support loan.


First pillar ­ Bank Recapitalization and Restructuring

92. The two loans would support policy actions covering the adoption and
implementation of a sound publicly funded recapitalization program. Policy actions
under this pillar aim at ensuring that the recapitalization and restructuring program meets the
highest standard of transparency and good governance and the value of banks recapitalized
with public funding is maximized. Under this pillar and for PFRL 1, CoM or MoF would
approve resolutions or orders, as the case may be: (i) establishing the RECAPU and RECAP
Board with respective governance arrangements and controls and budgetary resources; (ii)
establishing the process for recapitalization and eligibility criteria for bank recapitalization
with public funding; (iii) defining the instruments for recapitalization and liquidity support for
banks recapitalized with public funds; and (iv) defining the mechanisms and methodology for
monitoring and control by RECAPU of banks recapitalized with public funds. Approval of
the first PFRL is also conditional upon satisfactory progress of the recapitalization process as
evidence by a CoM decision on recapitalization of Bank Kiev, Rodovid Bank and
Ukrgazbank and by the NBU resolution imposing monitorable sanctions on banks in group 1

                                               39
and 2 which do not comply with agreed privately funded recapitalization programs. PFRL 2
would support continued and satisfactory implementation of the recapitalization and
restructuring program. To achieve these objectives the GoU will continue to ensure a smooth
functioning of the RECAPU.


Second pillar ­ Resolution and consolidation of the banking system

93. The two loans assist GoU adopt and implement legal amendments enhancing the
existing bank resolution process. Policy actions under this pillar aim at ensuring that
insolvent banks be promptly resolved based on a least cost principle. In the context of PFRL
1, this pillar supports the approval of Banking Law, Anti-Crisis law, Civic Code, Joint Stock
Company Law and Bankruptcy Law amendments requiring the enhancement of the existing
resolution framework, namely: allowing the transfer of assets and liabilities (purchase and
assumption transactions) on an open or closed bank basis (i.e. before or after license
revocation) without prior approval of creditors, including depositors; enabling the
Government to provide financial assistance to banks under resolution and to acquirers of such
banks by the MoF; providing authority to the Government to create a bridge bank owned by
the GoU to facilitate resolution transactions; introducing civil liability protection for the NBU,
the DGF and the MoF officials, temporary administrators, auditors and contractors when
discharging functions related to their official duties; simplifying grounds for introduction of
temporary administration in problem banks by the NBU by reducing the applicable time
period, defining key terms, and deleting unnecessary conditions; and changing bank
liquidation requirements to provide a higher priority for the GoU, the NBU and the DGF
funding. PFRL 2 would support a satisfactory implementation of the resolution program on
non-systemic banks and approval in the Parliament of amendments transferring responsibility
for bank resolution to the DGF. These would include at a minimum responsibility for
liquidation.


Third pillar ­ DGF payout functions

94. The two loans support policies that enhance deposit insurance operations to ensure
preparedness in time of crisis and expansion of DGF functions. PFRL 1 supports the
formulation and implementation of a strategy for crisis management to include: (i)
identification and training of additional staff and work plan required in case of large scale
reimbursement; (ii) validation of appropriateness of current IT software; (iii) approval by the
NBU of a regulation on process required to extend a credit to the DGF, (iv) enhancement of
the existing MoU between the NBU and the DGF on exchange of information on banks. In
addition, the first loan would support the approval of an investment policy and the
establishment of a new division within the DGF to deal with future expansion of its functions.
The second loan would be anchored to the enactments of amendments to the legislative
framework to increase the role and funding for the DGF in bank resolution; potentially
ranging from transferring liquidation functions, to requiring the DGF to act as a temporary
administrator in resolving banks, to full resolution powers.

Fourth Pillar - Enhancing the legal and regulatory framework

95. PFRL 2 would assist GoU implement its medium term strategy by disbursing against
the introduction of legal and regulatory changes to improve supervision and promote
sector consolidation. PFRL 2 will tackle priorities beyond the immediate needs of rescuing
the core banking sector. As indicated in the Letter of Development Policy, the post-crisis
financial sector strategy of GoU and NBU aims at ensuring that the sector is more
consolidated and resilient to future crisis. To do so, GoU and NBU will, amongst others,
strengthen on-site supervision and corrective action plans, review provisioning rules for
restructured loans, introduce consolidated supervision, require to disclose ultimate
shareholders, improve home-host supervisory arrangements, increase minimum capital
requirements and introduce IFRS.

                         VII.       OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

96. The poverty and social impacts of the crisis are expected to be serious. However, the
specific measures supported by this operation are not expected to have negative social
implications, and indeed are targeted to mitigate the impact of the crisis in particular for
households holding bank deposits. A detailed analysis of the social and poverty impacts of
the crisis and key transmission channels follows below. The measures supported by this
operation impact primarily the stability of the banking system. Ukrainian households have
traditionally low trust in banks, since they have experienced losses in their deposited savings
as a result of high inflation and bank failures at several instances in the recent past. PFRL 1 is
aimed to avoid such an outcome during this crisis ­ both by anchoring the Bank's support in a
sustainable macroeconomic framework, and by supporting measures that safeguard banking
system stability and give priority to depositors in the process of bank resolution. At the same
time, it is well known that banking crises have large direct fiscal costs and even larger indirect
costs in terms of foregone economic growth ­ costs that increase significantly as a result of
non-action. PFRL 1 is designed based on the principle of least cost solutions to addressing
banking sector stress, with private shareholders and unsecured creditors bearing the brunt of
the costs of bank failures. The extent to which this is achieved is a function of the
transparency and speed with which the program is implemented. There are significant
implementation risks in the Ukrainian context, which may result in larger than necessary costs
to households and tax payers, and not all of which can be effectively mitigated. However, the
costs of inaction would be significantly larger and hence on balance this operation is expected
to have positive impacts on social developments. Parallel efforts of the Bank aim at
strengthening direct social support to the poor and vulnerable and will complement the efforts
to stabilize the financial sector.

97. Significant poverty impacts will derive from the underlying financial crisis and the
economic slowdown in Ukraine. Bank staff simulations suggest that as a result of the
aggregate effect of the economic downturn up to 4.7 million people may fall into, or not get
out of, poverty in 2009. These estimations are based on Household Budget Surveys, using the
poverty and vulnerability line of US$5 a day in PPP terms (see Figure VII.1). This
benchmark is used with the objective of capturing the pre-crisis poor plus those potentially
vulnerable households that are likely to be shocked by the downturn. These simulations are
consistent with the macroeconomic projections presented in Section III and with the Bank
projections on labor displacement in Ukraine. The economic slowdown has been impacting
the poor as well as lower middle class groups, particularly in small towns and urban areas.

98. The transmission channels of the crisis to the population are multiple. They include
adverse labor market outcomes and movements in real wages as a result of the contraction as
well as increased household debt service costs due to the exchange rate adjustment. Figure
VII.2 shows the decomposition of these key effects. The income and labor effects represent
the largest share of the poverty effect of the crisis accounting for around 90 percent of the
overall effect, although the increased debt service (due to the exchange rate) effect is also
significant at 12 percent (see Figure VII.2). There are, however, other potential transmission
channels that include a loss of savings due to bank liquidation and higher costs for utilities if
the needed pass-through (to households) of higher energy prices takes place. 12

   While the sharp import price increase was fully passed through to industrial users, the pass-through to
households has, so far, not taken place in 2009. A very moderate increase is expected in the last quarter of 2009.
The DPL IV, which would contain measures in this area, will present a revised evaluation of the poverty impact
of likely increases under the IMF SBA in 2010.

including interest rate risk and currency risk associated with foreign currency liabilities.
Overall households' debt in Ukraine in 2008 was close to 30 percent of GDP, the highest level
amongst CIS countries and a comparable level to that in EU countries within ECA such as
Hungary, Poland and Lithuania (see Figure VII.3). Mortgages account for around 75 percent
of household debt. Rapid growth in consumer and mortgage lending by commercial banks in
recent years was accompanied by relatively lax credit policies. Around 73 percent of
household debt is denominated, or linked to, foreign currencies. While increased access to
finance has brought benefits to households, for example increased scope for consumption
smoothing and financing purchases of durables and property, it also made them particularly
vulnerable to un-hedged interest rate and exchange rate shocks. Over the last 5 years the
share of monthly debt repayments in the total consumption of households with positive
commercial bank debt has almost doubled, reaching 12 percent (see Figure VII.4).

100. Lower and middle income households will be particularly affected by the
exchange rate depreciation effect of commercial bank debt. The mortgage and consumer
lending growth experienced in Ukraine has been particularly sharp in lower middle-income
and middle-income households, which are especially vulnerable to the deteriorating economic
conditions. Figure VII.5 and Figure VII.6 break down this effect by household income
quintiles. The financial losses due to the exchange rate depreciation are estimated to have
affected all quintiles of the distribution. The average loss is estimated to be equivalent to 5.4
percent of total consumption, with a range by quintile between 4.1 and 7.8 percent (see Table
VII.1). However, the figures on debt repayments may be underestimated by households in the
surveys, implying that the negative effects on household consumption may be much larger
than those estimated.

101. Maintaining the stability of the weakened banking sector, a central aim of the
proposed operation, is critical to safeguard household deposits, which in turn are an
important cushion to the shock. While there is no data in the Household Budget Surveys on
deposits, it is clear from aggregate statistics that private savings have increased significantly
over the last years (from 12 percent of GDP in 2003 to 20 percent of GDP in 2008). 13 One of
the steps taken by the Government at the beginning of the economic crisis was to triple the
threshold of deposit insurance (currently at UAH 150,000). However the resources of the
DGF represent only 4.2 percent of the insured deposits as of end Q2 2009. By focusing on
the recapitalization of systemically important banks and introduction of new resolution tools
(the application of which will allow to protect deposits at least costs to the tax payer), the
PFRLs help to avoid the loss of deposits. This helps avoid the potential further
impoverishment of households that now depend heavily on the cushion provided by their
savings to support their consumption.

13
     The share of household deposits in total deposits also grew from 53 percent in 2003 to 62 percent in 2008.

                                                                                  45
102. Ukraine maintains a sizable system of social payments and transfers, including
the non-contributory transfers and safety nets system, that will provide some relief to
the poor and vulnerable. Ukraine spends around 21 percent of GDP on social transfers,
including the pay-as-you-go pension system, other social insurance funds (including
unemployment), and social assistance programs. Repeated discretionary changes in key
parameters in transfers allowed pensions and other social transfers to increase in real terms.
Within that fiscal envelope, 2.5 percent of GDP is spent in social assistance programs (i.e.,
non-contributory transfers and safety nets programs) ­ the same level as a percent of GDP as
the average of OECD countries. The largest programs in terms of spending are the child-
related allowances followed by the privileges programs, allowances for people with
disabilities, and the income-tested programs (such as the program for low-income families
and the housing and utility subsidies).

103. But targeting of social assistance programs needs to be improved to better
cushion the shocks for the poor and vulnerable. There are indeed some effectively targeted
programs that reach the poorest and the vulnerable such as the program for low income
households and program for single mothers with children. But there are also a number of
categorical transfers and programs that absorb substantial resources of the budget that are not
particularly well-targeted, such as the housing and utility subsidies and the "privilege"
programs (see Figure VII.7 and Table VII.2). Although Ukraine operates a number of well-
targeted programs, their relative share in total social assistance spending has fallen over the
last 3 years at the expense of categorical poorly targeted programs. 14

System Modernization Project

  Categorical program are based in some particular characteristic of the receipt (e.g., pensioners, veterans,
families with many children) rather than income.

104. The World Bank under the Social Assistance System Modernization Project and
the DPL IV (under preparation) is working with the authorities to strengthen the
targeting of the system. Given that the overall fiscal envelope to support safety nets in the
budget is roughly adequate, the aim is to make the programs work more fully as automatic
stabilizers that protect not only the pre-crisis poor but also those vulnerable to the economic
shock that are just above the poverty line. Ukraine can achieve a more cost-efficient and
targeted spending mix, either by scaling up funding well-targeted program at the expense of
the poorly targeted ones -- a reallocation, or by using the same eligibility procedures possibly
with higher eligibility thresholds for some of the categorical programs. The authorities have
so far decided to move forward with measures on the latter, but will also lay out a long term
strategy to phase out the poorly targeted privileges (some of which are constitutionally
guaranteed). Some transitory measures moving in this direction have been approved, but
most of the work is still ahead.

B.          ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

105. Specific actions under the proposed PFRL 1 are not expected to have any
negative effect on the environment. The specific country policies supported by PFRL 1 are
not likely to cause effects on the country's environment and natural resources. The legal and
regulatory changes implemented in the context of PFRL 1 do not allow the banking sector to
circumvent environmental regulations governing investments, nor modify the existing
environmental regulatory framework in any way.

C.          IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

106. Monitoring and evaluation of the operation will be supported by various data
sources collected by different stakeholders. Baseline and medium term outcomes are
clearly stated in the matrix (Annex 2). Stakeholders involved in monitoring and evaluation
include, (i) the NBU and the CMD in particular, (ii) the MoF and the RECAPU in particular,
(iii) the DGF. The baselines and outcomes established are objective, concrete, and
measurable indicators of economic, financial and institutional performance. They will be
tracked periodically under the PFRL series.


                                                             47
D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

107. In 2007, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment
(PEFA) for Ukraine, which benchmarks the country's public financial system against
international comparators and provided the basis for discussions on further
improvements in public financial management. The PEFA assessment concluded that
Ukraine has in place fundamental systems for macro-fiscal management, some elements of a
framework to enable strategic allocation of resources, and selected tools for improving
operational efficiency. Key findings of the PEFA assessment are that Ukraine scores
relatively well against regional and international comparators on budget credibility,
comprehensiveness and transparency, but retains weaknesses in areas such as public
procurement, internal audit, controls over payroll and the management of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs).

108. The Government's reform efforts have improved the Public Financial
Management (PFM) significantly over the last six years. The on-going programmatic
cross-sectoral DPL series picks up on the PEFA analysis through its support for a new law on
public procurement as well as measures to improve SOE management and financial reporting.
Efforts to further consolidate the public financial management system (moving to second
generation reforms including IPSAS accrual implementation), integrate it into a medium-term
planning framework and further improve financial controls are also pursued under the Bank's
Public Finance Management investment loan; investments to improve capital budgeting are
supported through a Bank-executed technical assistance facility. Reforms in recent years
have put in place the treasury and improved budget processes. Ongoing reform efforts are
targeting improvements in strategic resource allocation as well as operational efficiency and
accountability.

109. Fiduciary risk for development policy operations is assessed as moderate. With
regard to fiduciary risk management, there exist a variety of risk mitigation measures. Poor
capital budget completion rates and weaknesses in external and internal audits add to the
fiduciary risks of the PFM system. In addition to the some of the efforts to improve the
performance of the central PFM systems (as noted above), the Bank's efforts also extend to
modernizing the public procurement law, supporting the further modernization and integration
of the treasury, the audit of budget revenues and expenditures by the Accounting Chamber
(Supreme Audit Institution) and further development of the concept of Public Internal
Financial Audit and Control. Taking into account these efforts as well as the document
improved performance of the core PFM systems, the fiduciary risk for development policy
operations is assessed as moderate.

110. The IMF has conducted a safeguards assessment of the NBU in June 2009 and
found that the NBU has improved its safeguard framework since 2004. The main
conclusions of the 2009 IMF Safeguard Assessment included hiring of an international audit
firm to conduct an independent review of the NBU's refinancing operations and currency
interventions to verify compliance with applicable resolutions and control procedures. In
addition, the IMF is working with the NBU to further strengthen its overall governance
framework, transparency policy and accountability to align them with international best
practices. In particular, the NBU Law is being amended to, inter alia, specify IFRS as the
benchmark financial reporting framework, provide for a risk-based internal audit function and


                                             48
removal of the annual audit requirement of all structural units, and provide for an independent
audit oversight mechanism.

E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

111. Disbursements. This operation is a single-tranche loan of US$400 million. The loan
proceeds will be made available to the Government upon Loan effectiveness. Upon approval
of the loan and notification by the Bank of Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a
withdrawal application. To simplify the flow of funds, the Government has indicated it would
prefer to use the treasury foreign currency account (located in the NBU and which is part of
the country's official foreign exchange reserves) as the deposit account rather than account of
MoF opened in NBU. The Government shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of
the Loan into this account, an equivalent amount is accounted for in the Government's budget
management system and reflected in the budget.

112. If, the proceeds are deposited in the treasury foreign currency account located in the
NBU, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan
Agreement (e.g., to finance goods or services on the Bank's standard negative list), the Bank
will require the Government to promptly, upon notice from the Bank, refund an amount equal
to the amount of said payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request
shall be cancelled.

113. No audit will be required under PFRL 1. The Government will maintain accounts
and records showing that loan disbursements were made in accordance with provisions of the
Loan Agreement. Within seven days of remittance of funds by the Bank, the Government
will provide a confirmation to the Bank that the funds have been received by the treasury
account in the NBU and that these funds are available for financing budget expenditures. The
generally positive IMF Safeguard Assessment of the NBU indicate that there are no strong
prevailing reasons for the Bank to request an audit of the deposit account or to require
additional safeguard measures, as permitted under OP 8.60.

F.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

Macroeconomic risk

114. Moving forward, the most important economic risks lie in: (i) inappropriate
fiscal and monetary policy responses through the adjustment process, for example,
through incomplete implementation of the IMF-supported government program (and in
the context to the run up to the presidential elections); (ii) the size, and duration, of
current external shocks (terms of trade and external debt roll-over difficulties); and (iii)
further deteriorations in corporate and banking sector balance sheets due to the impact
of the economic contraction and a disorderly adjustment process. Moreover, the macro-
financial risks are inter-linked. For example, there is a tangible risk that an additional
(significant) fiscal deficit (in 2009 and 2010) driven by pre-electoral policy/legislation ­
without equivalent corrective measures -- could compromise fiscal sustainability and further
weaken investors and creditors confidence, leading to a disorderly adjustment with exchange
rate and roll-over rates implications in the short term as well as longer term borrowing cost


                                              49
effects. Further, disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate would have serious effects on
sectoral balance sheet and their various feedback loops.

115. The main risk mitigation would come from appropriate macroeconomic and
structural policies and, to a large extent, from a higher level of unification and backing
for those policies among government authorities (i.e., President, Prime Minister, speaker
of the Parliament, and fiscal and monetary authorities) and political parties. While
implementation of adequate policies has been so far uneven, moving forward consistent
signals will need to be sent to markets. In account of this Bank staff have sought and obtained
endorsement letters from both the Presidential Secretariat and the NBU to the Government's
Letter of Development Policy. The fact that the stakes are high may reduce the risks of
inappropriate policies, as key stakeholders among Ukrainian businesses and political factions
in the Government have much to lose from disorderly adjustment.                    Nonetheless,
implementation risks remain high even after mitigation, and policy uncertainty is significant,
particularly in the context of pre-election competitive politics.

116. In addition, the policy framework agreed with the support of the IFIs may serve
as an anchor to maintain an appropriate macro-economic framework during the time of
adjustment. The IMF SBA is based on implementing exchange rate flexibility, reining in the
fiscal deficit, and, together with the Bank financed PFRL, establishing the basis for financial
sector stability. The IMF-supported government program would further help to rebalance the
economy if implemented thoroughly by the authorities. The EBRD and IFC have supported
banks in their recapitalization effort and bilateral donors have been providing technical
support to the authorities. The Bank is also preparing the DPL IV focused on structural
reforms to facilitate business entry and exports, to generate fiscal space for needed
investments and well-targeted programs, and to help ensure sustainability in the gas sector.
These structural reforms are critical to underpin a difficult process of recovery.

Political Risks

117. Political instability can severely delay the implementation of the banking sector
reform program and hamper the recovery process itself. There is no pro-government
coalition in the Parliament at the moment and Presidential elections are scheduled for January
2010. The combination of these two factors has undermined the pace of the reform and could
derail it in the future.

118. Notwithstanding the fractious politics, recent political history (including the
approval of legislative amendments on bank resolution) suggests that consensus can be
generated around key reforms in times of crisis. The amendment on bank resolution have
been approved by a cross party section of Parliament at a time when the Rada is often unable
to meet due to opposition obstruction. This is a clear evidence of the fact that members of the
Rada realize the importance of stabilization of the banking sector for the economy overall.
Indeed, the head of the relevant profile committee in the Rada is a senior opposition
politician. Other recent examples of by-partisan reforms include the passage of a new Joint
Stock Company Law, and the approval of the Anti-Crisis Law. While political risks to
program implementation are substantial, this operation takes the view that such risks are best
managed through continued active engagement and the design of a policy operation, which
can serve as a focal point for critical reform steps, as the recent approval of the amendments

                                              50
has demonstrated. Bank staff will continue to reach out to representatives of all political
groups and stakeholders. Discussions with the authorities have also emphasized the need for
coherent, open and consistent communication on the key policy measures supported by this
operation, to facilitate constructive debate and avoid these critical reforms becoming
politicized.

Implementation and Governance Risks

119. Ukraine suffers from endemic corruption and key political institutions are
subject to capture by private business interests. This is a challenging context for policy
reform. Some desirable policy measures are blocked or delayed in the Rada not due to
fundamental policy disagreements, but to protect vested material interests. The resulting
political trade-offs often lead to two-step-forward, one-step-back type policies.

120. In this environment, the Bank must find ways to focus its support and leverage
on a few critical measures that are likely to yield large benefits and thus would be
unlikely to be reversed once adopted. The focus of PFRL 1 on rescuing the core of the
financial system is an example of such a focused set of reforms.

121. Nonetheless, the credibility of the banking rehabilitation program could be
severely undermined by a lack of transparency, perceived or actual misuse of public
resources. Concerns raised in the Ukrainian media, for instance, included that private bank
owners would use budget money through the recapitalization process to recover their own
equity investments; that the selection of banks to be recapitalized was determined through
political rather than objective criteria; or that banks once recapitalized by the Government
would entertain politically directed lending.

122. The above risks can be mitigated through the establishment of clear rules, high
disclosure and a program funded by IFIs founded on implementation of such rules. The
Anti-Crisis Law and the amendments to the Law on Banks and Banking, Anti-Crisis Law,
Civil Code, Joint stock Company Law and Bankruptcy Law provide the framework for the
bank recapitalization and resolution program. Clear and unambiguous rules have been
adopted in terms of the selection, governance and close monitoring of banks recapitalized
with public funding. Key rules and decisions have been disclosed to the public at large
through press conferences and the internet. Audits will be conducted on each banking
transaction. Finally, the IFI program (including the proposed PFRL series and IMF SBA)
supports not just the adoption of policies but also their implementation. Thus, PFRL 1 is to
be disbursed against prior actions including the completion of recapitalization in three
systemic problem banks and the adoption of sanctions against eight banks that have failed to
fulfill their recapitalization commitments.          Nonetheless, effective mitigation of
implementation risks will require continued attention and support to policy makers at all
stages, which will be assisted by the programmatic nature of the PFRLs.

123. Implementation of the banking rehabilitation program requires strong technical
skills by the two key implementing entities, the NBU and MoF. Under the program and
thanks to the legal amendments recently approved, a number of new resolution techniques
have been introduced. Moreover the designed recapitalization with public funding involves
the implementation of new governance and monitoring arrangements. To implement the

                                            51
recapitalization with public funding and the new resolution techniques, the NBU and the MoF
will require staff with strong technical skills.

124. Mitigating factors include the strong technical capacity of the head of the
RECAPU, and incipient, but promising professionalism of the CMD. A coordinated and
comprehensive TA program will support both entities going forward. The RECAPU is
headed by a competent individual who has long standing expertise in banking sector and the
CMD has thus far shown high professionalism. To support these departments, the Bank
jointly with IMF, and a number of bilateral donors have committed to provide expert support
(see paragraph 74). In particular the IMF and US Treasury will support primarily the NBU
resolution activities, while the Bank and US Treasury have and will continue to support the
MoF in monitoring state investments in banks, restructuring the banks and reviewing
resolution transactions when public funding is required.

125. Weak articulation and implementation of the post-crisis financial sector strategy
due to pre-electoral politics could jeopardize the implementation of the PFRL series.
The risk that a broader strategic framework for financial sector fails to emerge is real and will
increase as the elections get closer ­ this would have implication for the PFRLs.

126. To mitigate the risk, the Bank will continue to provide TA on strategy advice.
The Bank will mitigate the risk by focusing its TA on strategic advice rather than capacity
building, which will be provided by other donors. The Bank will also continue to engage with
the full spectrum of stakeholders.

       Dear Mr. Zoellick,

1.      The Ukrainian economy has been hit hard by the serious and long recession of the
world economy and by the resultant drop in the demand for steel products and the sharp
reduction in access to international capital markets. This has had a bad impact on the
financial sector of Ukraine. In order to stabilize and restructure the sector we have designed a
multiyear reform effort in the financial sector to focus first and foremost on addressing the
most urgent banking system issues and salvage the core banking sector. This will be followed
by a series of reform steps to restructure the banking sector and enhance the legal and
regulatory framework to make the sector more resilient.

2.      In support of our multiyear financial sector reform program the Government of
Ukraine would like to receive the World Bank`s assistance. Specifically, at this stage, we
would like to request the World Bank to provide the First Programmatic Financial System
Rehabilitation Loan (PFRL 1) to support the first phase of our financial sector reform
program as described below. Subsequent to the successful implementation of the first phase,
we would like to request the Bank's assistance through the second PFRL (PFRL 2) to support
the second phase of the of the Ukraine financial system rehabilitation program.


Macroeconomic Framework

3.       As a result of the profound recession of the world economy and the related drop in the
demand for steel products, our output indicators have fallen sharply since the last quarter of
2008; out traditional export earnings have decreased and tax revenues have begun to lag
behind the anticipated figures. These events have caused the need to review economic
policies, but within the framework of our economic strategy that continues to be based on our
firm intention to restore internal and external trust in Ukraine`s macroeconomic and financial
stability. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on October 31, 2008 approved the Law On the
Priority Measures for Preventing the Negative Effects of the Financial Crisis and On
Amendments to Some Legislative Acts of Ukraine (the Anti-crisis law), which contains
important elements of the crisis response of government agencies (including steps towards the
banking sector`s stabilization and recovery, establishment of a stabilization fund, and a
restrained income policy). These measures as combined with other components, mostly with
a flexible exchange rate, a commitment to carry out a prudent fiscal policy, and further
measures in the banking sector, have helped formulate our response to the crisis and have met
with the support of the IMF, which has provided us with 11 billion. in SDR (US$16.6 billion.)
for two years under a Standby Loan Agreement.

4.     Our Government remains fully committed to observance of fiscal discipline, which we
believe is an essential condition for restoring confidence, facilitating the adjustment of our
economy to shocks, relieving the pressure on prices and the exchange rate and ensuring public
debt sustainability. In December 2008, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the Law on
2009 State Budget, which included measures for curtailing public sector payroll. The budget

                                               67
provided for a deficit of UAH 31 billion. (approximately 3 percent of GDP). Since the
approval of the budget, however, the growth of the economy and public revenue has slowed
down, which is causing a growth of the budget deficit. Given the uncertainty about
availability of funding, we have decided to keep the budget deficit within the limits specified
by the Standby Loan Agreement.


Financial Sector Developments

5.    The Ukrainian banking system underwent significant turbulence in the period since
September 2008.

6.      To stem the deposit outflow and build confidence, after the approval of the Anti-crisis
law, we have, as is appropriate, introduced the principles of crisis management, diagnostic
process and subsequent recapitalization/resolution of banks. On the basis of this law, and to
coordinate policy responses in a time of crisis, we have created a crisis management
committee including the President, the Prime Minister, and the Governor of the National Bank
of Ukraine (NBU). We have increased deposit coverage for individuals from UAH 50,000 to
UAH 150,000 to enhance market confidence, and the NBU has transferred part of its profits in
the amount of UAH 1 billion to the State Budget of Ukraine for further transfer to the Deposit
Guarantee Fund (DGF), to enhance the effectiveness of and build confidence in this policy.
To maintain operations of the banking system and to ensure that banks have access to the
required liquidity, the NBU has provided liquidity to banks within the limits of monetary
policy targets. To identify the magnitude of the undercapitalization in the banking sector and
the magnitude of the required further capitalization of banks, the NBU, with the involvement
of external audit firms, has conducted diagnostics on all the banks (in line with NBU
Resolutions #389 "On diagnostic of banks" dated November 2008, #455 (with amendments)
"On Procedures for creation and operations of the NBU Committee for current and future
bank solvency and viability at time of crisis" dated December 2008, and # 80 "On diagnostic
study of banks in groups 2, 3 and 4" of February 2009, as well as NBU Letter #47-512/4475
of 03.10.2009).

7.      Undercapitalized banks are given a timeframe to increase capital to CAR 8 percent
and subsequently 10 percent with private funding. Banks that do not comply can apply for
recapitalization with public funding if: (i) they are systemic (i.e. banks with 2 percent or
higher share of total assets or 1 percent or higher share of total household deposits), and (ii)
existing shareholders agree to be diluted. In the case of recapitalization with public funding,
the Government will hold voting rights for at least 75 percent.

8.      Diagnostic studies completed for the group of the largest banks (banks in group 1 and
2 - covering around 85 percent of total system assets) in February 2009 and the rest of the
banks (banks in group 3 and 4) in May-June 2009 have revealed deficiency of regulatory
capital with some banks in various groups. While most banks from the groups 1 and 2 were
able to raise new capital to cover the deficiency, 15 banks still require additional capital. The
deadline for completion of their recapitalization was set by the NBU Board`s Resolution
#355 15 dated 06.17.2009, On the Status of Implementation of the NBU Board`s Resolutions #

15
     Regulation not subject to public disclosure.

                                                    68
47 16 dated 02. 05. 2009 and # 249 17 dated 04.22.2009 and Further Measures for Increasing
the Regulatory Capital of Banks in Groups 1 and 2, by the end of 2009. The NBU set up an
interim working group on coordination of bank capitalization process, drew up a
recapitalization schedule and developed its monitoring mechanism. To restore public trust in
the banking system, the Government decided to recapitalize three systemic banks in the
groups 1, 2 and 3 with public funds.

9.      With respect to banks in group 3 and 4, deadline for capital increase in these banks is
established by the NBU Resolution #397 18 of July 9, 2009. All banks are required to reach a
CAR of 10 percent based on the assumptions of the diagnostic studies by the end of 2009.
Banks that will not meet this requirement will have temporary administration appointed, be
reorganized or liquidated. To reduce the cost of bank resolution, we have prepared the law
"On amending other legal acts of Ukraine (with respect to financial rehabilitation measures)
registered as #4630, that has been passed by the Verhovna Rada of Ukraine on July 24, 2009
and would allow for purchase and assumptions on open and closed banks without prior notice
to the creditors and bank shareholders, and bridge banks.


Progress under PFRL 1

10.    Under our PFRL 1 commitments, we undertake to: (i) provide a satisfactory
macroeconomic environment, (ii) support bank recapitalization and restructuring, (iii)
reorganize and consolidate the banking sector, and (iv) strengthen the payout functions of the
DGF.


Component . Providing a satisfactory macroeconomic environment

11.     In the framework of our commitment to provide a satisfactory macroeconomic
environment we will continue to thoroughly track fiscal changes and make amendments to the
budget as appropriate. To maintain a sustainable fiscal position, in 2010 and the years to
come we will take measures for saving budget resources and implementing a more prudent
spending policy to ensure fiscal stability for the medium and long term. Also, we remain
committed to implementation of the necessary structural reforms to step up economic activity
and make the process of recovery possible. We would like to assure you that we have a major
social security program and a social safety net for the vulnerable sections of society that may
be affected by the economic recession.

12.     We are consistently introducing the flexible exchange rate regime. Since the adoption
of this program, the UAH exchange rate has adjusted considerably, which has provided a
buffer for our economy so that it could adjust to significant external shocks. In the future our
interventions will increasingly become an exception and will be used mostly for mitigating
excessive volatility. We will continue to keep our interest rate positive in real terms. We will
adjust our interest rate policies to improve incentives to return deposits to the banking system
and check the devaluation pressure on the currency market. The key goal of monetary

policies will be to reduce inflation to a level of about 13 percent in 2009. Our medium-term
goal is to connect monetary policy with the inflation targeting regime. To make the policy
more effective and build confidence in it, we will strengthen the organizational structure and
capacity of the NBU.


Component . Bank recapitalization and restructuring

13.     To ensure the required recapitalization and restructuring of the banking sector, we
have already successfully met certain conditionalities that are the key factors for PFRL 1,
specifically:

a. Following the completion of the diagnostic studies, the NBU has implemented a
   recapitalization schedule for banks in group 1 and 2 that were undercapitalized. Five
   banks have been recommended by NBU to the Government for recapitalization with
   public funding. Additional 15 banks have a CAR below 10 percent, as per diagnostic
   studies (of the originally 16 undercapitalized banks, one has recently raised necessary
   capital from private sources). In particular, 11 banks have a CAR < 8 percent and another
   4 banks have a CAR between 8 percent and 10 percent. Of the 15 undercapitalized banks,
   8 banks have been put under a sanction regime during which they will not be allowed to
   grow their balance sheet. The owners of all 15 non compliant banks have committed to a
   new recapitalization schedule on the basis of which all banks in group 1 and 2 will reach
   CAR 10 percent as per diagnostic studies by the end of December 2009. The NBU will be
   reporting monthly to the World Bank on compliance of these banks with sanctions and
   recapitalization plan as per agreed template.

b. We have created a unit for the preparation and monitoring of state investments in
   recapitalized banks and a special board for recapitalization approval on a case-by-case
   basis. The Department for Bank Capitalization with State Funds (RECAPU) was created
   in the Ministry of Finance (MoF), staffed, and allocated all necessary resources to
   implement and oversee the procedure for the State's participation in bank capitalization
   (MoF Order # 386 dated March 10, 2009 on creation of the Department, and MoF Order #
   577 dated April 17, 2009 with the by-laws of the Department and its 4 divisions.). In
   addition, to approve recapitalizations and in compliance with CoM Resolution # 960 dated
   November 4, 2008 (with amendments by COM Resolutions # 148 of February 2009, #241
   of March 2009, #429 of April 2009 and #469 of May 2009), an Expert-Analytical Board
   on Bank Capitalization with the Use of State Funds (Recap Board) was created. The
   Recap Board is led by the Prime Minister of Ukraine with 9 members, including
   representatives of the Government, the NBU, and two international experts as members of
   the Board with advisory rights.

c. We have developed and implemented (through CoM Resolutions # 960 dated November
   4, 2008, as amended, #148 dated February 18, 2009, # 241 dated March 11, 2009, #429
   dated April 17, 2009) a recapitalization procedure, including criteria of access to public
   funds. A procedure for the State`s participation in bank capitalization was established,
   including definition of instruments and eligibility criteria for bank recapitalization. Under
   the established procedures, the NBU proposes banks for state recapitalization; the
   RECAPU then prepares a proposal for the use of public funds for bank recapitalization,

                                              70
   which is approved by the Recap Board and finally by the CoM. Eligibility criteria for
   bank recapitalization with public funds have been outlined in the joint COM and NBU
   Resolution #421 dated April 2, 2009. As per this Resolution only systemic banks are
   eligible, namely banks with 2 percent of total assets or over, or 1 percent of total
   household deposits or over.

d. We have identified recapitalization instruments. Key principles on recapitalization
   instruments of banks recapitalized by the State are set forth in CoM Resolution # 80 dated
   January 31, 2001 and in the Anti-Crisis Law (October 31, 2008). The CoM has adopted
   Resolutions #566, #567 and #580 dated June 10, 2009 regarding state recapitalization of
   the Bank Kyiv, Rodovid Bank and Ukrgazbank, which established the terms of
   recapitalization of these banks by the State. In accordance with these Resolutions, bonds,
   of which the period of repayment is 2017-19 and the interest rate is 9.5 percent, have been
   injected in the above mentioned banks. The bonds can only be exchanged for cash by the
   NBU at face value and in accordance with the banks performance and liquidity plans. The
   latter has been prepared by the MoF and the NBU respectively and approved by the Recap
   Board. This procedure for issuing bonds will be applied in the future to other banks
   subject to capitalization by the State.

e. We have developed, and have undertaken to perform, due diligence of banks following
   their recapitalization with public funding. The due diligence will be performed in order to
   update results of the diagnostics carried out in November 2008 and in order to re-assess
   the extent of capital deficiency. A due diligence methodology and pre-qualification
   criteria for firms to perform due diligence have been approved by the MoF. Respective
   trilateral agreements for due diligence in eligible banks have been signed by the MoF,
   Temporary Administrators of banks, and the external auditors: the audits have been started
   and will be completed by the end of July 2009.

f. We have established criteria for monitoring recapitalized banks. A methodology for
   monitoring by the RECAPU of banks recapitalized by the State has been approved by
   MoF Order #877 dated July 8, 2009. The methodology lays down key principles of
   monitoring and control of risks of banks of which the corporate rights are managed by the
   MoF. Under its legislative powers, the NBU regulates and oversees operations of banks,
   confirms bank managers, establishes reporting requirements, etc.

g. We have taken a final decision to recapitalize three systemic banks. Under an established
   procedure, the NBU proposed five systemic banks to the Government for recapitalization.
   The Government approved a decision to recapitalize three of them (CoM Resolutions ##
   566, 567 and 580), namely bank Kyiv, Ukrgazbank, and Rodovid bank after dilution of
   existing shareholders. The Government's decision about the other two banks, Nadra and
   Ukrprombank, is expected to be made after an agreement has been reached with external
   creditors and other conditions laid down in the CoM Resolution #960 (with respective
   amendments) have been met.




                                             71
       Component . Reorganization and consolidation of the banking sector

14.     To facilitate resolution of problem banks we have developed the law "On amending
other legal acts of Ukraine (with respect to financial rehabilitation measures) (registered as
#4630) that has been passed by the Verhovna Rada of Ukraine on July 24, 2009 and was
signed into law by the President of Ukraine on July 31, 2009. In particular, amendments to
the Law on Banks and Banking and the Anti-Crisis law, Civil Code, Joint Stock Company
Law and bankruptcy Law were approved, which :

·   provide for explicit powers for temporary administrators to revaluate and reduce
    shareholder capital, reduce nominal value of shares, eliminate the requirement of
    notification of creditors or other creditor rights;

·   allow transfer of assets and liabilities (purchase and assumption transaction) on an open or
    closed bank basis (i.e. before or after license revocation) without prior approval or
    notification of shareholders or creditors, including depositors, and without any ability of
    creditors to demand immediate payment of their liabilities, as well as to eliminate taxes
    and fees on transfer of any assets or liabilities;

·   enable the Government to provide financial assistance to banks that acquire assets and/or
    liabilities of problem banks;provide authority to the Cabinet of Ministers, after the
    National bank proposal agreed with Banking and Finance Committee of Verhovna Rada,
    to create a bridge bank to facilitate a resolution transaction;

·   provide directors, officials, and staff, temporary administrators, auditors and contractors
    with protection against civil suits associated with the performance by these persons of
    their official duties and limit the jurisdiction of courts regarding actions by the NBU;

·   simplify grounds for introduction of temporary administrators in problem banks by the
    NBU through reducing the interim period, establishing key terms and removing
    unnecessary circumstances, and

·   change the terms of bank liquidation to raise priorities of the claims of the Government,
    the NBU and the DGF.


Component IV. DGF payout functions

15.   To get ready for possible large scale reimbursements the DGF has adopted a crisis
management strategy, specifically:

a. Approval of an action plan in case of large scale payouts, including a temporary staff
   relocation plan.

b. We have tested the IT software. It was validated as appropriate.



                                              72
c. We have established a process by which NBU loan resources could be extended to the
   DGF in case of need. To this end, the NBU Board on May 25, 2009 passed Resolution
   #308 in compliance with the DGF law.

d. We have strengthened information exchange between the NBU and the DGF. The NBU
   and the DGF amended the Memorandum on Exchange of Information on banks, which
   reduces the timeframe within which information is exchanged between the two
   institutions, and increases the scope of the information to be exchanged.

16.     The DGF Administrative Board approved a comprehensive investment policy for the
DGF to ensure transparent investment of its resources (Decision of the Administrative Board
#6 of June 12, 2009 with further revisions approved by Decision of the Administrative Board
#9 of July 07, 2009)

17.      The DGF Administrative Board established a new division within the DGF to handle
future resolution functions that will be transferred to the DGF in the medium term, and have
launched the appointment process of a new Deputy General Manager who will oversee the
newly created division (Decision of the Administrative Board # 8 of June 24, 2009).


Government priorities going forward

18.     Moving forward, we will continue implementation of stabilization measures, and in
particular we will: (i) preserve a satisfactory macroeconomic environment, (ii) ensure that all
banks are recapitalized to a CAR of at least 10 percent by December 2009 and banks
recapitalized with public funding undergo substantial restructuring to ensure profitability in
the medium term; (iii) resolve banks that do not meet CAR of at least 10 percent and
implement the recently introduced resolution framework; (iv) transfer resolution powers to the
DGF in the medium term, and (v) enhance the existing legal and regulatory framework to
ensure that the banking sector is more resilient to crisis in the future.

19.     As regards recapitalization of the systemic problem banks with public funding, the
Government will complete due diligence in all banks recapitalized with public funds. It will
also establish corporate governance arrangements in the banks, which will ensure sound
management of these public investments by fit-and-proper management and supervisory
boards, with no conflicts of interest by individual members of these boards. The Government
will also restructure the recapitalized banks, with an objective to maximize their value at the
point of their sale in the future, as well as for management purposes. In order for the above-
mentioned measures to be implemented successfully, the Government will ensure smooth
functioning of the RECAPU in the MoF.

20.     A coordinated and comprehensive restructuring program both on the assets (company
and household debt restructuring) and liabilities side (creditor restructuring) will be required
to restructure the banks recapitalized with public funding.

21.     We recognize that resolving problematic non-viable banks is an essential part of the
banking sector rehabilitation strategy. As such we will apply the recently introduced
resolution tools on all non systemic banks that do not comply with CAR of 10 percent. To

                                              73
increase the effectiveness of the resolution process, we commit to transfer resolution powers
to the DGF in the medium term.

22.     With respect to the DGF, the new functions and responsibilities will elevate the
Fund's role in the financial sector. To ensure a smooth preparation for the new, expanded
role and functions, the DGF Administrative Board will approve an Institutional Development
Plan (IDP) for the DGF transformation in line with the functional changes. Also, the
Administrative Board and management of the DGF will approve policies and internal
regulations to implement the IDP within the agreed timeline. DGF management will ensure
that the organization is adequately staffed to perform its new functions. Finally, the
Administrative Board will approve an investment strategy for the Fund for 2010, and will
continue to approve such strategy in all subsequent years.

23.      We also intend to strengthen the financial system of Ukraine with a long-term view, in
order to make the system more resilient to future challenges. We have developed a list of
priorities for change, beyond the immediate needs of stabilizing the banking sector. In this
respect, we are planning to introduce a number of legal changes which would address, among
others, the following areas:

         (i)   disclosure of ultimate controllers of banks and other financial sector
               companies,
         (ii) introduction of supplementary and consolidated supervision of financial
               groups,
         (iii) strengthening of the on-site supervision of banks,
         (iv) introduction of IFRS in the entire Ukrainian financial system.

       We will continue to closely cooperate with the World Bank and other IFIs in preparing
and implementing these changes.

24.     Under such conditions, the Government of Ukraine requests the Bank to grant the First
Programmatic Financial Sector Rehabilitation Loan in the amount of US$400 million, which
would support a successful response to the financial crisis and promote the necessary reforms
going forward. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine will put all its efforts into achieving the
outcomes of the PFRL 1 program. By a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the
Ministry of Economy is appointed as the implementing agency within the framework of the
Project.

    IMF Completes Second Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with Ukraine and
                      Approves US$3.3 Billion Disbursement

Press Release No. 09/271
July 28, 2009

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the second
review of Ukraine's economic performance under the two-year Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA), and approved the immediate release of the third tranche under the arrangement
equivalent to SDR 2.12 billion (about US$3.3 billion). This will bring total disbursements
under the SBA to SDR 7 billion (about US$10.9 billion).

With the completion of this review, the Executive Board also approved the modification of a
performance criterion on the fiscal deficit in response to a broadening of the fiscal deficit
target to include the deficit of Naftogaz.

The SBA with Ukraine was approved on November 5, 2008 in an amount equivalent to SDR
11 billion (about US$16.4 billion; see Press Release No. 08/271).

Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:

"Financial stress has eased in recent months and Ukraine's current account is adjusting
rapidly. At the same time, the fall in output is more pronounced than expected, which has
necessitated further significant policy adjustments. The revised economic program continues
to seek to mitigate the effects of the global crisis, restore confidence in the banking system,
and preserve fiscal sustainability, while protecting the most vulnerable segments of the
population.

"To cushion the impact of the sharper economic contraction and to reflect the imbalances of
the state gas company Naftogaz, the revised economic program targets a broadened fiscal
deficit. Corrective fiscal measures and structural reforms are a priority to ensure fiscal
sustainability and to avoid crowding out of private sector borrowing. The authorities have
reduced nonpriority expenditures as well as taken a number of steps to restore viability in the
natural gas sector. A key step is a schedule of natural gas price increases to bring domestic
prices in line with international prices. Vulnerable households will be protected by a better
targeting of the social safety net programs. The authorities are also moving ahead with a
strategy to strengthen the financial situation and transparency of Naftogaz. Plans for pension
and tax reforms in the context of the 2010 budget will also help entrench fiscal sustainability
and reduce fiscal financing needs.

"The monetary policy stance is adequate. The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) will closely
monitor developments in monetary aggregates and stands ready to tighten its policies if
inflation or exchange rate pressures were to reemerge. The NBU has also taken measures to
increase currency flexibility in both directions, including by amending regulation to allow
foreign exchange forward transactions. Further progress in this area will help Ukraine to
adjust better to external shocks, discourage dollarization and excessive risk taking by
unhedged borrowers, and allow monetary policy to focus on inflation objectives.
"Restoring confidence in the banking system, which is essential to facilitate the economic
recovery, remains a key priority. Recent important steps include the recapitalization of the
systemic banks, the decisions taken with regard to two other banks, and the adoption of legal
amendments to enable the resolution of nonsystemic banks.

"The authorities plan to phase out remaining import restrictions in line with their
commitments under the program.

"Going forward, close adherence to the program will be key to create the conditions that
facilitate an expeditious economic recovery," Mr. Lipsky stated.
