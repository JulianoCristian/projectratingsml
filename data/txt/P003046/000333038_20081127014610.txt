       t h e A f r i c a Regional Office.                P a r t I1 is based on Borrower torments.

                     C r e d i t 902 (USS20 million, approved A p r i l 29, 1979) was closed on June
       30, 1986 (four years behind schedule).                             Credit 1475 (SDR 25.2 m i l l i o n , approved
       May 15, 1984) was closed on December 31, 1990 ( t h r e e years behind schedule).
       Both C r e d i t s were f u l l y disbursed.

                     The main objective of t h e F i r s t Project was t o r e s t o r e t h e railway t o an
       acceptable l e v e l of operational e f f i c i e n c y .                         While the railway's                 s i t u a r i o n

       obtained w i t h regard t o maintenance capacity and s t a f f t r a i n i n g .

                     The Second P r o j e c t was an emergency rescue operation: prevent f u r t h e r
       d e t e r i o r a t i o n ; strengthen t h e railway; continue r e h a b i l i t a t i o n work s t a r t e d under
       t h e F i r s t Project.             I n addition, t h e Second P r o j e c t was expected t o contribute
       t o t h e successful implementation of t h e Onatra Modernization Project and of the
       Matadi-Kinshasa Ports Rehabilitation P r o j e c t s .                             None of t h e objectives of the
       Second Project were met.                    External f a c t o r s and t h e c o l l a p s e of t h e main c l i e n t

                     The comprehensive PCR notes: "the recent collapse of t h e railway occurred
       a s a consequence of t h e public s e c t o r management of t h e e n t e r p r i s e which has

SNCZ railways; (ii)rehabilitate and improve track; (iii)improve availability of rolling stock; and (iv)
develop management capability in SNCZ.

lm~lementationExoerience

2.             After a good start, Railways I was disorganized by the defection of major
cofinanciers. Before a relaying project (Railways 11) could be organized, the situation of the railway
deteriorated rapidly for internal and external reasons. After three years of intense crisis, during
which SNCZ was able to survive and to operate the railways, albeit at a less than satisfactory level,
project execution sped up in 1987 with the arrival of technical assistance. Both projects were
completed well behind schedule. Cost to IDA was about 210 man weeks per project, a high figure.

Results

3.             Quantified targets. either operational or financial, were not reached. After project
execution, they appear to have been unduly optimistic. The main results can be summarized as
follows:


        (i)    the railways have survived as an operating entity, even after expatriates, who
               were still in fairly large number before the project started, have been replaced
               by nationals;


        (ii)   the railways have continued to move minerals from mine to processing plants
               and output from processing plants to export routes through the Voie
               Nationale (a raillriver transport system linking the mineral rich Shaba to
               Matadi, Zaire's only seaport-VN). Shaba continued to have access to
               essential imports and was not entirely dependent on foreign routes (to East
               and South Africa);


        (iiil  track has been relayed or rehabilitated over and above project objectives and
               valuable experience has been acquired by SNCZ staff; 300 km of additional
               track were to be rehabilitated under a follow-up project (Transport
               Rehabilitation I, Credit 2027-ZR) but the future of this program is now
               seriously threatened as the credit was suspended;

        (iv)   rolling stock and motive power have been rehabilitated also over and above
               project objectives;

        (vl    financial systems have been improved, assets revalued, a costing system
               established, computerization has been completed and organized, some
               progress has been made in marketing and commercial activities; and

        (vi)   staff has been trained.

Overall Assessment and Sustainability

4.               As seen from above, the projects while generating some positive results failed to
achieve their financial and managerial objectives. Continuous and costly efforts and investments are
necessary to maintain at a reasonable level of efficiency a railways network whose traffic is modest.
Most investments are long term, but the long term future of the railways is uncertain since the
Shaba to Lobito line in Angola may be reopened and deprive the VN of part of its traffic. The
projects are hardly sustainable. Continued support to a VN based railways system is questionable, in
particular in light of the economic disruption caused by the unsettled political situation in Zaire in
1991.

5.               The recent collapse of SNCZ occured as a consequence of the public sector
management of the enterprise which has given priority to keeping on or hiring new staff when the
priority should have been to maintain the enterprise's assets. Operating costs have gradually
increased while revenues have decreased. The drop in transport demand is mainly due to the fall-off
in Gecamines activities.




6.      The experience suggests that:

        li)      country problems and their impact on a major parastatal were underestimated;

        (ii) the railway's capacity to recover rapidly was overestimated;

        (iii) processing was too longfor projects which were considered urgent;

         (iv)    conditionality was not realistic;

         (v)     actual equipment needs of SNCZ were larger than foreseen;

         (vi)    the original project was still too ambitious, especially since the number
                 and diversity of cofinanciers exposed it to the defection of one or
                 more sources of financing, a risk which should have been assessed;

         (vii)   simpler projects, more quickly processed, without overlap between
                 cofinanciers would have permitted an immediate intervention which in
                 turn would have avoided deterioration of the railways and long term
                 consequences still being felt a decade later;

         Iviii)  the success of a development project is dependent upon capacity
                 building results; in practice, SNCZ is now entirely run by nationals, an
                 important achievement which the project helped to obtain;

         (ix)    staff continuity during supervision is important, and the projects suffered from
                 the involvement of too many and different staff members and Bank
                 consultants;

         (XI the change in reportingpolicy (Form590 plusacopy of the
                 aide-memoire) makes it important that proQressreports from borrower
                 are carefully formatted and consistent one with each other and with
                 appraisal estimates and PCR data .

                                                 2. Background

Basic Problems

2.01                 One of Zaire's most critical transport problems is to provide a reliable means for
transport of local minerals in Shaba, between Shaba and the sea, and for transport of imports to
Shaba. The only route located in Zaire is the 2,600 km long Voie Nationale (VN) which connects
Shaba to the port of Matadi on the Atlantic. It comprises rail transport from Shaba to Ilebo on the
Kasai River, then river transpon on the Kasai and Zaire Rivers to Kinshasa, followed again by rail
transpon from Kinshasa to Matadi. Other routes are available through one or more foreign countries
to and from Southern Africa (3522 km to Durban1and Eastern Africa (2400 to 2600 km to Dar es
Salam). The shortest alternative route (1200 km app.) is through Lobito in Angola, but it has been
closed since 1975 as a result of the Angola civil war.

2.02                 The various routes provide the necessary transport capacity. However, bottleneck s
delays or closures occur from time to time. The VN carries some 50% of the copper from Shaba
Zaire is committed to its greater use through improving operations of facilities and investments to
maintain or increase capacity. The VN is less costly in direct foreign exchange than the foreiqn
routes1/. Its existence ensures that a reasonable degree of competition exists between the d~tfer*~            .
routes and develops a sense of economic unity in a vast and diversified country.




2.03                 Transport on the VN has been dominated by two large state-owned companies :-c
Office National des Transports (ONATRA) and the Societd Nationale des Chemins de Fer Zairo~s
(SNCZ). ONATRA operates the sea port at Matadi and the river port in Kinshasa, the railway
between Matadi and Kinshasa, river transport and coordinates with SNCZ at the riverlrail port of
Ilebo.




    ' IThe difference wss eathated at 45% when Railways I1 wsr, appraised. This percentage in highly dcpcndcru
availability of foreign exchange in Zaire.

2.04             SNCZ owns all railway lines, including that operated by ONATRA, which does not
come in the scope of the projects here reviewed. SNCZ directly operates the following:


          (i)    the branch lines (lignesintersites) inside Shaba between the ore deposits and
                 concentrate plants, and the lines from the plants to the points where mineral
                 traffic is distributed between the different export routes (mainly Tenke at
                 present as the Lobito line is closed);

        (ii) the Shaba to llebo line (the Southernnetwork on the VN);

        (iii)    the Tenke-Sakania line, for exports through Zambia to South Africa;

        (iv)     the Eastern network, a system of branch lines connected to the VN at
                 Kamina, which serves agricultural traffic and mining export traffic to
                 Tanzania through Kalemie on Lake Tanganyika; and

        (v)      the Northern line, an isolated narrow gauge railway, serving agricultural areas
                 in the Haut Zaire and Equateur regions.

                 SNCZ also operates port services at Kalemie, transport services on Lake Tanganyika,
and owns the port of llebo on the Kasai River, a transfer point for rail and river transport.

SNCZ Oraanization

2.05             SNCZ, which results from the nationalization and consolidation of formerly private
railways lines, is fully owned by Government. As a utility parastatal, it is, by law, required to be
financially self-sufficient, while producing no surplus. Before the closure of the Lobito line, Zambian
copper used the SNCZ network in transit to Angola, resulting in sizeable foreign exchange revenue
for SNCZ, which financed investments, fuel and spare parts. Loss of that source of revenue after
1975 has been a cause of permanent imbalance in SNCZ finance, with a lasting effect on
maintenance and renewal of track and equipment.

Government Obiectives

2.06             The main objectives of Government rail transport policy in relation to these railway
projects have been:

        (i)      to ensure a smooth flow of transport in the mining area of Shaba;


        (ii)     to maintain and develop transport on the VN while rehabilitating and
                 improving its facilities;

        (iii)    to make transport as inexpensive as possible for users (mining
                 industry and agricultural producers); and

        (iv)     to strengthen management of the SNCZ after consolidating in 1973
                 three different railway networks in the company, and ensure national
                 control through a phased Zairianisation of its staff.

2.07             The Bank Group supported the above government policy, including the increased use
of the VN, for the purposes stated above: diversification of evacuation routes, national economic
unity and competition. In addition, the investments supported were economically justified. Before
financing the projects reviewed here, it financed earlier rail and river projects. The rail projects were
for rehabilitation and improvement of the Kinshasa-Matadiline. The river projects were for
improvement of river navigation and port facilities and equipment, mainly at Kinshasa. These
projects are listed in Part Ill,Table 1.



                               3. Proiect Obiectives, Com~onentsand Sco~e

Obiectives of Railwavs I

3.01             When the project was identified and prepared, SNCZ was suffering from lack of
maintenance and from the 1977 invasion of Shaba. Eighty percent of its track in the Shaba was
more than 45 years old and was badly worn. Derailments were frequent. Many locomotives were
out of service because of lack of spare parts. Sixty-five percent of wagons were more than 20 years
old and needed repairs or overhaul. The objectives of Railways 1 (1979) were therefore to:

        (i)      help restore the operational efficiency of the railway;

        (ii)     rehabilitate and improve track; and

        (iii)    improve availability and utilization of locomotives and rolling stock; and

        liv)     develop management capability.

                 The Bank Group had a special interest in adequate functioning of SNCZ networks at
one end of the VN since it financed river transport and railways projects at the other end. The earlier
(1975) Project (Cr. 571-ZRIfor rehabilitation of the river and Kinshasa-Matadi railway included an
understandingthat the Southern network of SNCZ, that is the line from Shaba to Ilebo, would
operate efficiently and move the Shaba traffic satisfactorily on the VN.

Com~onentsof Railwavs I

3.02             SNCZ had an investment program for 1976-1980, from which project items were
selected. Urgent items identified during appraisal were added and the components were as follows:

        (a)      renewing and upgrading 210 km of track and ballasting another 285
                 km; track equipment, including a concrete sleepers plant;

        (b)      procurementof one hundred hopper wagons, 9 shunting locomotives
                 and 12 passenger coaches;

        (c)      procurement of spare parts for locomotives and wagons;


        (dl      procurement of maintenance, telecommunications, data processing,
                 handling and medical equipment, including an oxygen plant;

        (el      extending and improving llebo port facilities;

        (f)      training of staff in middle and top management; and

        (9)      consultant services for studies, including a costing study and a study
                 of low density lines.

S c o ~ eof Railwavs I

3.03             The scope of the project was based on the expected availability of financing rather
than on the actual needs of SNCZ, which were larger. As procurement experience later
demonstrated, SNCZ's approach (small, isolated bids) had inherent limitations. SNCZ could not
absorb a larger project2/. Composition of the project was adequate as regards physical components.
Management of SNCZ, still largely by expatriates, was considered "well qualified and competent".
The project included training, but no technical assistance. Cost was estimated at US $ 161.5 million
equivalent (66 % foreign exchange). IDA was to finance 19 % only of the foreign exchange cost,
making the project sensitive to the defection of any major cofinancier. This happened at an early
stage of project execution. Table 5 of Part Illgives details of the financing plan for Railways I.

3.04             In 1982, the Arab cofinanciersjudged inappropriatea foreign policy decision of the
Government of Zaire. They suspended disbursements on their loans, which were financing major
items, mainly in track rehabilitation and spare parts. This led to an interruption and a partial collapse
of Railways 1,  which had started slowly in a deteriorating economic, financial and management
environment. SNCZ developed an emergency recovery program (the 1982 emergency program)
which was supported by a revised Railways Iand a new project.

3.05             The revised scope (September 1983) of Railways 1 was redefined as follows:

         (a)     relaying, reballastingand re-sleepering 128.5 km of track (reduction of
                 original program by 40%); track layinglballasting equipment,
                 (cancellation of concrete sleepers plant);

         (b)     spare pans for maintenance and rehabilitation of rolling stock (new
                 locomotives under original project were dropped from project);

         (dl     computer and telecommunications equipment;

         (el     training, technical assistance (new item) and studies.

                 The llebo Port extension was dropped, together with the passenger cars and the
hopper wagons, which were financed by bilateral aid or directly purchased with assistance from
Generate des Carridres et des Mines, the mining concern (GECAMINES). Funds were reallocated for
additional workshop, computer and service equipment.

gbiectives of Railwavs II

3.06             Railways I1was developed as an emergency operation:

         ti)     to continue the rehabilitation started under Railways I ;and

         (ii)    to strengthen SNCZ's organization, management, maintenance
                 procedures and staff capability, which proved weaker than initially
                 expected. In fact, the evaluation was now that "SNCZ management
                 had very seriously deteriorated in most areas and at all levels", in
                 sharp contrast with earlier evaluations (see paragraph 2.06 (iv)).

Com~onentsand Sco~eof Railwavs II

3.07              The project consisted of items selected from the SNCZ 1982 emergency proeram to
address its most urgent needs resulting from the interruption of Railways I:


         (a)      renewal of 128 km of track 31 and improvement of SNCZ's ability to
                  carry out regular maintenance;

         (b)      rehabilitation of 850 wagons, putting in service 200 new wagons and
                  improving maintenance of the entire fleet;

         (c)      rehabilitation and maintenance of the locomotive fleet (66 main line
                  and 20 shunting locomotives);

         (dl      70 man-years of technical assistance to management and 55
                  man-months of studies;

         (el      training and training equipment;

         (f)      telecommunications, computer and medical equipment;


         (9)      consulting services to Government for a review of the air transport
                  sub-sector; and for strengthening the Groupe d'Etudes Economie et
                  Planification (GEEP)at the Ministry of Transport.

3.08              The scope of Railways IIwas based on what could be achieved in two years to
restore the railways to an acceptable condition. It was more balanced and somewhat more modest
than the scope of Railways I, by concentrating on track rehabilitation and repairs to rolling stock
which had suffered from inadequate maintenance, largely due to the foreign exchange shortage after
the closing of the Lobito line (para 2.011.           Still, it hardly covered SNCZ's short term reasonable
needs. The project scope was therefore necessary, if not fully adequate. The project included a
substantial technical assistance component, thus reflecting an improved knowledge of SNCZ
problems. Total cost at 1984 prices was estimated at US$ 73.3 million, of which 62.6 were fore~gn
exchange. IDA was to finance 48.5 % of the foreign exchange component. While it concentrated
on the highest priority items, it participated in the financing of all components, which would permit a
better control if any cofinancier dropped out. It also reallocated US$ 4.0 million from the first cred~t
to the financing of the second project. Table 5 of Part Ill gives details of the financing plan for
Railways II.



                                      4.         Project Desian and Oraanization

Institutions: Main Issues

4.01              The first issue, concerning institutions, derived from the regrouping in 1973 of Zaire                  5

railways into a single national railway company (paragraph 2.06). While the Southern network
(Shaba, Voie Nationale) was operated at relatively high standards of efficiency and was in a sound
financial position, the other networks had been developed as public services to facilitate access to
remote agricultural regions. They had to operate at lower standards, carrying smaller volumes of
traffic, and were financially weak. It was therefore essential to reinforce SNCZ's management to
permit the integration of the different networks into a coherent company. The risk of loss of
efficiency and of financial laxity resulting from cross-subsidizationbetween networks, was real



    ' I  This wan in additionto the 128.5track relaying prognun carrid out underthe revid Railways I project (paragray

However, the design of Railways I did not question the existence and viability of one single company
operating railway networks in different parts of the country. The design of Railways II benefitted
from an improved knowledge of SNCZ and included a study of the low density lines in the North and
in the East.

4.02            The second issue was the rapid Zairianisation of managerial and technical staff.
However justified financially and politically, replacingof expatriates by equally qualified local staff
was carried out too hurriedly and eventually led to lower operational and maintenance standards and
performance. Expatriate staffing was reduced from 1,400 before independence to 484 by 1971 and
186 in 1976, of which 50% were in lower supervisory levels, expected to be replaced by local staff
within five years. The suggestion during project preparation to place a moratorium on the
replacement policy was not followed up at appraisal. Rather, ambitious training programs were
included in the project to upgrade local staff and to maintain a sufficient number of qualified
personnel at all levels, given the general shortage of engineering and other talents in the country.
However, project design did not include a staffing plan for expatriates, to establish their number at
an optimal level in specific positions. Altogether, human resources planning and management played
a modest role in the design of Railways I. It was based on the premise that the main issue was
technical qualification, which could be solved by training. SNCZ's management was considered
good and was assumed to remain so. As noted above (paragraph3.061, the assessment was
different in 1982, and Railways II included a technical assistance program. Human resources
deployment was given extra attention, a staffing plan for higher management positions was
introduced in project design, and the issue of staff motivation and performance was squarely
addressed.

4.03            The setting up of one single railway agency (paragraph 4.01 resulted in development
of centralized tasks, such as payroll and stores administration. Development of
informationlcomputer systems was included in both Railways projects in order to permit better
management control and execution of these centralized tasks, even though the Bank seemed to
have, from the start, doubts about the feasibility of such a centralization.

D~erations:Main Issues

4.04              The main issue was the need to concentrate on the VN which, following the closbfr
of the Lobito line had to evacuate most of Shaba's copper and other minerals exports, expected to
increase from 600,000 t in 1979 to 800,000 t in 1984, and to absorb imports. Government made
an obligation to GECAMINES to give SNCZ and ONATRA all the traffic that they could handle on           :t +.

VN before using alternate routes. This program resulted in additional demands on track,
communication and signalization systems and rolling stock. Lack of wagons also resulted from ttle
loss of 800 SNCZ wagons held in Angola as a result of the civil war. Design of the projects took
this into consideration, by including priority equipment relating to the VN, and by giving prior~tv1  : :
track rehabilitation.

Finances: Main Issum

4.05              Financially, the closure of the Lobito line, which was earning some US$ 1.0 rnl1la
equivalent each month (onefourth of SNCZ revenue), resulted in a severe shortage of foreign
exchange because profitable Zambian transit traffic was diverted to other routes. Both projec~r      ...
therefore designed to concentrate on track rehabilitation and the procurement of spare parts an.7
equipment for maintenance, which SNCZ could no longer finance from its foreign exchange re,*,

Conce~tualIssues: Prioritv to Voie National*

4.06             Conceptually, the foundations of the projects were clear and well in line with er8    .
IDA-financed transport projects, which had aimed at reinforcing the other end of the VN (rivet
operations and Matadi-Kinshasarailway). Strict adherence to Government's commitment to           t v*

raised objections in the Bank. Advice was given to carefully evaluate the advantages and
disadvantages of the different routes, mainly foreign, before making all the investments needed to
make the Voie Nationale the only route for evacuation of Zairian copper. These concerns were not
justified, because the appraisal teams were cautious in evaluating SNCZ's capacity to accommodate
the transport needs of the copper industry. Neither project ever envisaged that mineral exports
would use only the VN. The appraisal of Railways I projected that the share of these exports
through the VN would increase from 40% in 1977 to 47% in 1983, to reach 50% in 1987 and
55% in 1990. In 1983, the share of the VN was 42%. Again, the appraisal of Railways II
projected a modest increase to 54% by 1990. While these projections proved optimistic, they
nevertheless reflected caution on the future of the VN, despite Government's official policy.

Pre~arationand Processing: Rail-




4.07            Railways I was carefully prepared. It was identified in November 1975; a detailed
report was issued by April 26, 1976. In parallel the Bank discussed with Government the broad
issues regarding VN and panicipated in a local working group on the subject, while Bank staff
prepared the details of the project with SNCZ. Government was late in requesting financing. The
request came as late as July 1977. Appraisal took place in NovemberIDecember 1977 and the
Appraisal Report was issued on April 25, 1979. However, between 1975 and 1979, SNCZ's
finance, operations and management deteriorated, which the Appraisal Report did not reflect.

Effectiveness

4.08            Cross-effectiveness clauses with cofinanciers and slow processing in Zaire delayed
                                                                                                    '

the effectiveness of the loans of the cofinanciers until May 1980. The remaining effectiveness
condition, requested by IDA the establishment of a Tariff Commission
                               -                                          - andthe belated issuance by
Zaire of the necessary legal opinions, delayed effectiveness for eight additional months. The Credit
Agreement was signed on June 14, 1979, 20 months after appraisal, and the Credit was effective
on January 27, 1981, 38 months after appraisal. Altogether, the benefits of good project
preparation were jeopardized by excessive duration of project processing, multiple effectiveness
conditions and cross-conditions, and the borrower's own delays in satisfying effectiveness
conditions. The median duration of the effectiveness period for all loans related to the projects was
22 months.

Railways I1

4.09            In May 1982, the Saudi Development Fund ISDF) and the OPEC Fund IOPECF)
stopped disbursing on Railways I. Preparationof Railways I1started in December 1982 and the
project was appraised in MayIJune 1983. It was approved by the Board in April 1984, on schedule,
was signed on August 7, 1984 and the credit was effective on June 5, 1985, 24 months after
appraisal. Effectiveness was delayed by the need to complete cofinancing arrangements and
execute a subsidiary credit agreement. Despite an active preparation, much had still to be done after
appraisal to establish lists of soare pans for rehabilitation and maintenance, which were the most
important items in the project. The median duration of the effectiveness period for all loans
financing the project was reduced to 8 months, much shorter than for Railwavs I.

                                             5. Proiect Im~lementation

lm~lementationSchedule: Railwavs I

5.01                The project was originally scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1982, after a
period of four years of implementation after negotiations. It was completed on December 31, 1987,
after nine years. Delays in effectiveness, interruptions, rebidding 'f after OPECF and SDF canceled
their participation, etc may have delayed it by three years. The original schedule was therefore
optimistic. Part Ill,Table 2 gives the original and actual project timetables.

Progress of lm~lementation

5.02                 SNCZ used the long period before effectiveness to process procurement documents,
prepare training programs, specifications, etc. Orders were placed quickly after effectiveness. Six
months after effectiveness, 50% of IDA funds had been committed. But the long time that had
elapsed between preparationfappraisal and implementation made the following original assumptions
less and less relevant:

(a) Assum~tionson Manaaement

                    SNCZ management, originally sound, deteriorated rapidly. From 1976 to 1986, there
were five different general managers. Some did not perform adequately. None could, over such
short periods, demonstrate his ability and capacity. The need for additional top level expatriates
appeared. Political and ethnic tensions, and the change of corporate culture resulting from
Zairianization, had been underestimated. At an early stage of supervision, Bank staff indicated "a
deeper need to reorganize SNCZ's overall organization" and recommended a management study.                         -.

However useful, this was probably insufficient. At that stage, the Bank had not yet identified the
basic shortcomings of parastatals in Zaire and of government policy towards these parastatals,
which were at the root of the worsening management situation at SNCZ             .

(b) Assum~tionson Procurement

                    After a good start (all project preparation had been conducted by SNCZ without
recourse to consultants), procurement at SNCZ proved slow and confused. When, in 1984, the
Government established the Societe Nationale de Trading (SONATRADI, as the central procurement
agency for parastatals, delays increased. Procurement of essential items under the rules of other co-
financiers was also slow and cumbersome.




                    Execution necessitated an adjustment of the project to new realities. For example:


          (;)       the information systems component had not actually been appraised, and had
                    to be after the project started, in 1982, with the useful help of IBRD's
                    computing department;

          (ii)      the spare partsfsmall equipment issue became acute because of cash flow
                    problems (see (el below);

          (iii)     track and right of way required more equipment than originally
                    appraised;




    '1    Some of the conditions applicable to Saudi Fund and OPEC Fund lo- were not applicable to other bilateral
                                                                                                                   ~ t r
international lending agencies .

         (iv)   the limitations at llebo port, the transfer point between rail and river traffic, were
                more severe than foreseen. However, these difficulties, which were not exceptional
                given the magnitude of this first SNCZ project, were being overcome in 1982.


Id) Assumwtions on Cofinancinp

                When the OPECF and Saudi Fund, in May 1982, canceled their participation, and
stopped disbursements, even on items ordered and under construction, the weakness of project
design appeared: these cofinanciers were present in five components out of seven, for 40% of
foreign currency financing, and their defection paralysed the project, particularly track renewal, the
most important item. SNCZ made good on some US$ 10.5 millions (out of a financing gap of US$
42.0 million) through self-financing and using the balance of earlier loans. The risks of multiple
cofinancing and dispersion of items between cofinanciers had been underestimated. The risk that a
political Government decision might trigger a negative reaction by cofinanciers had not been
assessed.

(el Assum~tionson the Macroeconomic Situation

                Both projects rested on the assumption that Zaire's economic situation, which had
been deteriorating since 1975 (deterioration of terms of trade, burden of external debt, scarcity of
foreign exchange, poor economic management, etcl would recover 'at best with slow growth"
during project execution. Actually, the situation continued to deteriorate, leading to the need for a
strong stabilization program which started in 1983, followed by structural adjustment in 1986.
Adjustment measures however proved insufficient and the budget and the exchange rate came under
increased pressure. Monetary expansion put pressure on domestic prices and on the exchange rate;
and the local currency, the Zaire, depreciated rapidly.   All macroeconomic assumptions proved ill- .
founded.




                SNCZ's own contribution to the project was also jeopardized by the rapid
deterioration of its financial situation. Traffic was lower than expected, if only because the project
had been delayed, limiting the capacity of the network. The government did not authorize tariff
adjustments on general cargo (specially on agricultural products) and the main user of the railway,
GECAMINES, did not agree on tariff increases for copper transport. Minerals traffic, both between
mines and processing plants and export, operated at a loss as early as 1982. In addition, the
increased foreign exchange shortage in the country deprived SNCZ from foreign exchange allocations
by Government contrary to what was stipulated in Credit Agreement 902-ZR. Spare parts could not
be purchased and salaries of expatriates were not paid on schedule. Credit proceeds had to be
reallocated to the purchase of spare parts, to the detriment of the financing of other items.

Implementation Schedule: Railwavs II

5-03            Railways Iwas scheduled to be completed by end 1982. This deadline was soon
made obsolete by the delay in effectiveness and later by the withdrawal of major cofinanciers.
Railways II, which followed Railways I and was combined with it for the purpose of execution, was
scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1987, after three years of implementation following
negotiations. It was completed by the end of 1990, after six years. The implementation schedule
agreed upon at negotiations (March 1984) was irrelevant. Son,e of the actions planned for 1984 did
not take place before 1985. Preparation work in SNCZ continued after appraisal. The starting year
of the project was in fact 1987, and its implementationshould be assessed accordingly.

Proaress in lmnlementation

5.04              Two periods with very different implementation paces can be identified:




Implementationwas delayed by SNCZ's management difficulties, and its staffing and financial crisis,
compounded by internal socio-political problems in the company itself. Again, three successive
general managers were appointed over three years, during which SNCZ slowly elaborated a five-year
investment and rehabilitation plan, to be used as a basis for future operations. The establishment in
1984 of the Soci4t4 Nationale de Trading (SONATRAD), with jurisdiction over all procurement by
parastatals, also delayed execution. Despite early approval by IDA, before effectiveness, of lists of
spare parts for procurement, the procurement program fell behind.




The project actually started in early 1987, three years after negotiations, under a new general
manager and with technical assistance reinforcement. The implementation schedule was revised
and, by end 1988, 94% of funds had been committed. Wagon rehabilitation was ahead of schedule.
Locomotive rehabilitation and telecommunications waited for delivery of spare parts and were
completed at the end of the project. The training component was implemented smoothly and has
been in general ahead of schedule. It would have been completed by end 1989, if cash flow
problems at SNCZ, which delayed execution, had been solved.



                                            6. Proiects Costs

Railwavs I

6.01               Original cost estimates were US S 161.5 million. Items were canceled and only
54% of the original track relaying program was completed. The total cost of the project, as
completed, is estimated at US $ 102.4 million aquivalent, of which 63.3 million in foreign exchange
Cost overrun would therefore be 3.5%, attributable to an underestimation of the cost of track
relaying. Part Ill,Section 5 includes a tabulated comparison of appraisal estimates, actual costs and
actual financing.

Railways II

6.02               Original cost estimates were US$ 73.3 million, of which 62.6 million were in forelgn
exchange, to be financed from new loans, including IDA Credit 1475-ZR, and the balance of earlier
loans. Final foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$ 100.9 million, of which US$ 88.8 mill~on
came from new loans, from self-financing, and 12.1 million from earlier loans. Table 5 of Pan 111
gives details of project eosts. The rapid devaluation of the Zaire during project execution makes the
calculation of local currency costs impossible.

Disbursements

6.03              Actual disbursements from the Credits, compared to appraisal estimates are given
Part 111,' Table 3. Disbursements took place over five years and nine months for Credit 902-ZR and
over five years for Credit 1475-ZR. Appraisal estimates were three years in each case. The Zatre
disbursement profile is six years. Had it not been for the projects' belated start, the disbursement
profile would have been normal. The appraisal estimates were not realistic.

Credit Allocation

6.04             The original and revised allocations for both Credits are shown in Part Ill, Table 5.
Credit 902-ZR was formally reallocated in 1986. Credit 1475-ZR was reallocated in 1987, 1988,
1989 and 1990. Main categories affected were II (Equipment)and Ill (ConsultingServices) and
reflected increased costs.


                                             7. Proiect Results

Proiect Obiectives

7.01       The objective of Railways I and II was to restore the railways to an acceptable level of
operational efficiency to permit it to carry some 50% of minerals exports through the Voie Nationale
in 1987. SNCZ's share declined to 36% in 1983, then increased as the two projects were being
implemented. In 1985, 1986 and 1987, SNCZ carried 3996, 46% and 50% of exports respectively
through that route, which can reasonably be credited to the project. Detailed operational targets
were agreed during negotiations. These and actual results are detailed in Part Ill, Table 4. In 1987,
at project completion, targets had not been reached and could not have been, for the following
reasons:

          (i)    the first project, considered as a minimum, became disorganized when 40% of its
                 financing vanished;

          (ii)   delays in effectiveness and implementation led to a compounded deterioration of
                 track, equipment and facilities;

          (iii)  SNCZ never obtained the necessary allocations of foreign exchange, outside the
                 project, for its recurring expenses;

          (ivl   traffic during 1981-1987 increased but was only 62% of traffic projected at
                 appraisal;

          (v)    tariffs were not increased when needed, resulting in severe cash flow problems. and

          (vi)   staff productivity, discipline and supervision declined steadily.




7.02             The projects were instrumental in maintaining SNCZ performance at a level near      the
original one, which can be seen, under these circumstances, as an achievement in itself: main Idne
diesel locomotive availability was 48% in 1979, and 46% in 1987; electric locomotives availabll~r       .
went from 79% to 78%; wagon availability was 76% in 1981 and 71% in 1987, etc. In the
absolute, none of these figures are satisfactory. But they reflect the survival of SNCZ, which     the
project permitted. Project impact is also reflected in the reduction of the number of derailments
where track had been relaid: 21 in 1983, 24 in 1984, 6 and 4 respectively in 1986 and 1987 rt*-,
track relaying was completed.

Performance

7.03             In 1984, new operational targets were assigned to SNCZ under Railways II. SO-U
were stricter than those assigned in 1979, which was optimistic given the experience gained       rr.1  .
difficulties which had led to a rescue operation. Traffic projectionswere revised downward. M           -
                                                                                                       a

realistic objectives were also later assigned in the 1988 contract-program, associated with rho
Transport Rehabilitation I Project (Credit 2027-ZR). Because of delays in starting Railways II

1989/1990should be selected as the last year of the project, rather than 1987 '1. Traffic from 1985
to 1989 was roughly 90% of appraisal projections, with a sharp decline to 78% of projections in
1990. Total mineral exports were projected to reach 650,000t, in 1986,of which SNCZ should
have carried 350,000t. That year, SNCZ was offered 327,000t and carried 309,000,or 94%.
Basically, the operational targets assigned for 1987 were achieved at an 80% level in 1990                                  In
1989,staff productivity and transit time improved 125 days from Shaba to the sea in 1988,23.5in
1989,24.0in 1990).So did average wagon loads. The number of wagons leased from South
African Railways (SARI decreased and locomotive utilization increased, etc, but at the cost of an
excessive utilization of Overaged equipment and increasing operating costs. Despite overhauls,
locomotive availability declined. Progress regarding derailment reduction was impressive. In the
section being renewed under the project, there were 15 derailments in 1987,28 in 1988,3 in 1989
and 2 in 1990.

Mineral Traffic

7.04                In 1930,SNCZ shipped only 178,000t, or 60% of mineral exports through the VN
compared with an objective of 55%. GECAMINES had a bad year and could not offer much more.
Exports dropped overall to 380,000t because production met difficulties, equipment was missing, a
mqjor mine collapsed and a three-week strike paralyzed the company.                         Clearly, SNCZ's performance
is closely linked to that of GECAMINES. If GECAMINESdoes not offer cargo, SNCZ is left with
under-utilized investments and staff, at no cost to the defaulting GECAMINES. While the issue is at
present academic, given SNCZ's own performance, it is worth mentioning (see paragraph 9.05).

Rate of Return

7.05                The economic rates of return estimated for Railways Iand I1at appraisal were 20%                              '
and 37% respectively. The appraisal of Railways I concentrated on benefits derived from
improvement in maintenance and performance on each component, while the appraisal for Railways
IIwas basedon savings from avoided use of road transport and use of Southern Africa and Eastern
Africa routes for exports and imports.               Data is missing for a recalculation of a rate of return7/on
the project. A recalculation, based on the model adopted for the appraisal shows hardly any positive
return. It is based on the difference in costs of the different routes to Shaba South Africa, East  -
Africa and Voie Nationale. The former routes are nominally cheaper by 3% to                           lo%,    but shadow
pricing for foreign exchange makes them 50% more expensive.

7.06                Infact, the methodology used dl~ringappraisal is open to question. The main SNCZ
Southern (Shaba) network is actually made up of two sub-networks, which need to be considered
separately. A first sub-network of 1014 km serves the mines and the plants and gives access to the
export routes (VN, Lobito and ZambiaISouth Africa). A second sub-network of 631 km is part of the
VN itself from the Shaba to Ilebo. On the first sub-network, the economic return is high because
without a railway, transport of minerals would be by road, at a cost estimated at twice that of
transport by rail. On the other hand, the second sub-network is in competition with both the South
and East Africa routes which, as noted above, are nominally cheaper, but more expensive in foreign



    'I    In addition, not all locomotiva had been mhabiitated by the end of 1989. However, the Transpofl Rehabilibtb~mI
Project of 1989 may have impacted on SNCZ's 1990 performance. The cut-off point between Railways I1 and Transpbrc
Rehabilitation I cannot be exactly located.

exchange. If the necessary information could have been obtained, the economic calculation should
have been conducted on each of the sub-networks, to permit an accurate judgment on the economic
justification of the project. But again, in view of the collapse of SNCZ, this data could not be
gathered, despite several requests made by IDA.

Phvsical Execution of Railwavs I

7.07             Tracks were relayed and reballasted on 109km (85% of planned and redesigned
project), involving 244 km of rails and 305,000 sleepers. Altogether, physical project execution may
have been 65% of the original project, with some items entirely completed (training,
computerization), some partially completed by SNCZ on its own, despite cancellation and shortage of
foreign exchange (port works at Ilebo), and some cancelled altogether (shunting locomotives) with
consequences still being felt at present. Variations from the original project were due mainly to the
long gestation period and to the cancellation of the Arab loans. Training reached 79 staff for 317
manlmonths, against 99 and 891 planned, because many of the staff to be trained were also the
most qualified and necessary for operations. The training program was, in that respect, too
ambitious. It nevertheless appears to have been successful in developingtechnical capacity in
SNCZ.

Phvsical Execution of Railwavs II

7.08              In executing this project, SNCZ displayed initiative and imagination: old sleepers from
another railway were used for track rehabilitation, 40 second hand locomotives were bought from
South Africa for the low price of US$ 1.35 million to keep traffic going during project execution and
overhaul of SNCZ locomotives, direct help was obtained from GECAMINES, etc. By using rails and'
sleepers left over from an earlier bilateral financing allocation, SNCZ was able to relay 176 km        -.

completely and to conduct on-the-spot replacements on an additional 119 km (sleepersand rails in
curves). All 30 locomotives overhauls were completed. Some 1130 wagons were repaired (800 in
program). Other physical items of the project were adequately completed. Technical advisers
performed well in:

         (i)      establishing ground rules for maintenance and operations;

         (ii)     the physical execution of the project; and in

         (iii) improving accounting and auditing systems.

Financial Performance

7.09              From 1974 to 1978, before appraisal of Railways I,the SNCZ operating ratio was as
high as 1.49. In five years, SNCZ accumulated losses of Zaire 72.0 million (US$ 110 million) for a
total revenue of Zaire 340 million (US$ 523 million). SNCZ did not even cover depreciation of
assets. The 1979 appraisal unrealistically projected a quick financial recovery from 1980 onwards,
with a comfortable operating ratio of 0.85 from 1983. The assumption was that tariffs would be
readjusted with inflation and anti-inflationary measures enforced frequently enough to compensate
for the impact of inflation on costs. In fact, except for a small surplus in 1982, SNCZ continued to
incur major losses through 1984 (Zaire 194 million or US$ 6.5 million against revenue of Zaire 2998
million or US$ 100 million). Nevertheless, the 1984 appraisal of Railways IIprojected financial
recovery for 1987, with an operating ratio of 0.82 that year. Assumptions were in accordance with
Bank projections for inflation. Tariff adjustments and a 3% financial rate of return were covenanted.

Causes of Poor Financial Performance

7.10            During the execution of both projects, SNCZ's financial performance was
disappointing. Projected revenues were wiped out by large deficits. While the working ratio was
positive, the operating ratio was 1. l o in 1986 and 1.02 in 1989 (see Part Ill, Table 6). Most of the
causes for such poor performance were related to the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in
Zaire :

         (i)    high cost of maintenance;

         (ii)   cost of leasing SAR wagons;

         (iii)  the impact of galloping inflation on local costs;

         (iv)   the rapid and catastrophic depreciation of the exchange rate, increasing financial
                costs on foreign currency borrowing and costs of imported materials;

         (v)    limited tariff increases, granted after long delays, and at times not accepted by the
                main user of the railway, GECAMINES;

         (vi)   the inability to obtain foreign exchange allocations, which forced SNCZ to deposit in
                banks the amounts in Zaire corresponding to the amounts of its letters of credit, thus
                immobilizing large amounts at no interest;

         (vii)  the deficits of the Eastern and Northern networks; and

         (viii) the structural staff costs, inflated by staff benefits such as hospitals, schools, food
                allocations, etc.


                                         8. Project Sustainability

8.01            The projects permitted the survival of SNCZ, reorganized some of its maintenance
activities, extended its data processing capacity, artd trained its staff. They helped to keep the
company alive, but did not stop its decline. Traffic declined from 1.35 million passengers and 4.0
million tons merchandise in 1979 to 626,000 passengers and 3.4 million tons merchandise in 1990.
Average speed of trains fell during the same period from 19.6 to 14.0 km-h. However, many of the
past and present difficulties of SNCZ are closely related to the state of affairs in the country in
general. For the projects to have been sustainable, in addition to the return to normal economic and
social conditions in the country, it would have been necessary that:

         (i)    track and rolling stock rehabilitation be continued beyond the scope of the on-going
                projects, financed by external sources;

         (ii) SNCZ operate the railwaysprofessionally at optimal cost, with the objective
                of increasing its share of traffic, rehabilitating its finance and later derive a surplus;

         (iii) tariffs beadjusted as needed;

         (iv)   staff recruited by or assigned to the company remain competent, active and honest;

         (v)    GECAMINES offer the traffic to which investments were geared; and

         (vi)   the company obtain the foreign exchange necessary to its operations.

                  Based on experience, the type of public utility management which has been prevalent
at SNCZ over the last two decades has not permitted these conditions to be met. Fundamental
changes are necessary in the approach to railways management by the sole shareholder, the
Government of Zaire.

8.02              The economic analysis, however simplified, seems to indicate that under normal
circumstances (unlimited access to foreign exchange and the relatively poor condition of the VN), it
would be more economical for Shaba traffic to use other routes rather than the VN. A considerable
amount of money has been invested since the country gained independence in 1960 but the VN
would become competitive only after, and if, the whole scope of the Transport Rehabilitation Project
could have been implemented. The question that must be asked, under the present political turmoil,
is whether the effort on the VN is worth continuing, especially after the expected reopening of the
Lobito route which might make the VN even less competitive.

8.03              IDA'Sdecision has been to support the government's policy of developing its railway-
equipped VN, as indicated in paragraph 2.06, because it considered it a reasonable, and
economically sound, national choice. The VN has, more or less, been kept open by the projects.
This is already an achievement, even if SNCZ's management could not be strengthened as intended.
Nevertheless, the real issue is whether it is a matter of concern to the economy of the country that,
despite its national importance, the Voie Nationale would be better served by a road and air network
than by a railway system.



                                         9. Bank's Performance




9.01              Scrutiny of Railways Iappraisal in the Bank was long and esoteric at times. Efforts
necessary to satisfy all levels of review were not commensurate with the final result or with the
importance of the issues involved. Technical issues were raised by non-technicians, which resulted
in delays and in frustration. For example, an evaluation of the political risks associated with multiple
cofinancing would have been more relevant from Programsstaff than objections to the selection of
types of sleepers. More attention should have been given to what now appears as extremely
optimistic financial projections. The establishment of a Tariff Commission delayed effectiveness
unnecessarily. This commission proved to be 3 ghost institution and its establishment was an
institutional failure. Processing of Railways IIwas smoother. However, three years were necessary
to effectively launch a project recognizedas urgent from the start.

Leaal Issues

9.02              The Project Agreement stipulated a rate of return of 3% on fixed assets. As
mentioned in paragraph 2.05, Zaire's basic legislation stipulates that utilities such as SNCZ are not
supposed to generate surpluses and to obtain a positive rate of return on their assets. They are onr.,
expected to cover costs. The legal issue of possible conflict between national law and the loan
agreement was not raised by Zaire and IDA did not request, or even suggest, a change in Zaire's
legislation. A legal appraisal concomitant with the economic, financial and other appraisals would
have made that clear. However, given SNCZ deficits (paragraph 5.051, this question never became
an issue and, if so, the Association would have been able to rely on the provision of the General
Conditions stating that the obligation of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement are valid,
notwithstanding any of its laws of any state.

Re~ortinabv Borrower

9.03             IDA'S supervision of reporting by the borrower seems to have been uneven, without a
permanent format which would have allowed IDA to follow project execution easily (such a format
was still under study three years after appraisal of Railways Ill. The borrower indicated to the
evaluation mission that the reporting requirements of successive staff involved in supervision differed
from one staff member to another.

Staff Input

9.04             On average, 423 staff weeks, or about 26.75 per year, were spent on the projects.
Table 8 of Part Illgives details.

Supervision

9.05             There were regular supervision missions twice a year.     In addition, other missions
visited SNCZ as frequently as possible. Staff continuity was ensured as much as possible, which
was difficult, considering the duration of project execution and the Bank reorganization in 1987.
Still, it was probably not optimal.   All but one name of staff participating in preparation and
appraisal of Railways I disappear from the list of staff involved in supervision of the project. The
coverage and thoroughness of supervision reports suffered from discontinuity. While some include
all information necessary, others are extremely short, or their information is not consistent with that
given in earlier reports. Continuity and quality of supervision were far better after 1986, with a
positive impact on project execution, project reporting and preparation of Transport Rehabilitation I.
not reviewed here, which was a follow-up project. A Bank traininglmanpower specialist participated
in several supervision missions and proved most useful. Lastly, the Bank devoted a considerable
effort to attracting cofinanciers, maintaining contact with them, explaining the Bank's approach and
settling differences.

9.06             The major weak point in Bank performance may have been in overall country strareg.
and evaluation. Four points are specially significant :

(a) Relations Between SNCZ and the Minina Industry

                 Given earlier experience on railways projects in general, and in projects in Zaire
especially, the strategy was optimistic and did not explore a number of important issues. When r
mining industry plays a major role in the traffic of a railway, as was the case, it needs to be closet.
associated with the project from the start and have special arrangements and contracts with the
railway, within the framework of the project. There have been cases where IDA requested such
agreements (e.g. the 1969 Bok6 Bauxite Project in Guinea, a captive project). It was not done       hclr
and, when GECAMINES, which was in fact to be the first direct beneficiary of the project, denled
tariff increases, not much could be done. Yet GECAMINES and SNCZ are in close daily operar1or.r.
contact, and GECAMINES has financed railways equipment during the period of execution of the
projects, when there was no other solution for ensuring the continuity of transport of its mineral
production. It nevertheless remains that the need for a contractual relationship between
GECAMINES and SNCZ initially escaped IDA's attention.

(b) Issue of Zairianisation

                 IDA underestimated the issue of accelerated Zairianisation and steffing plans.         *
                                                                                                  *r
was politically a difficult one, but probably central to project performance.

(c) Procurement

                 The Association was also slow in reacting to less than optimal procurement practices,
when too many small contracts delayed project execution.

(dl Countrv and Borrower's Ca~acitv

                 The capacity of both the country and the executing agency, to execute these large
projects, was overestimated. Altogether expectations were far too great. Judging from their
objectives, the projects appear as failures. Judging from what could really be achieved, and was
achieved, and not from unreasonable expectations the assessment is different.


                                       10. Borrower Ptrformanc~

10.01            The Government was slow in satisfying effectiveness conditions and proved generally
unable to implement the financial stipulations included in the Credit Agreements, especially with
regard to tariff adjustments. SONATRAD, the Government agency responsiblefor procurement, was
slow in processing contracts. There seems to have been a disappointing lack of urgency regarding
project execution and project objectives on the Government side. The major issue of Zairianization,
for example, was handled much more from a political angle than with the objective of reaching
maximum technical and operational efficiency at SNCZ.

10.02            The performance of SNCZ was uneven. It was one of successive management teams
                                                                                                    .
who had considerable difficulties in adjusting to rapid Zairianisation, to hyper centralization, to
deteriorating salaries, to low morale and motivation of staff, to the shortage of spares and
equipment, to rampant inflation, and to a difficult political and ethnic environment. On specific
issues, SNCZ failed to perform. It was unable, for example, to draw up a financial recovery plan
when necessary and when requested to do so. Maintenance standards and work discipline remained
low. General managers appointed from outside (either expatriates or nationals) had difficulty in
monitoring an entrenched railway bureaucracy. Marketing remained weak. Minerals traffic has
remained for too long captive of SNCZ (itis no longer) and SNCZ has not made much effort to
attract other traffic. With the impact of technical assistance from mid-1987, the quality of
information provided by SNCZ was greatly improved. Disbursementsand procurement records
improved considerably. The fact remains that SNCZ managed, despite all its weaknesses, to ensure
the survival of the railway during the execution of these two projects under difficult macroeconomic
conditions. This demonstrates some degree of performance, for which its management, and the
technical assistants seconded to it, should be credited.


                                       11. Proiect Relationships

11.O1            Relations between the IDA and the borrower were very good, despite the difficulties
of implementation. Each IDA supervisior~mission was handed supervision files well prepared by the
borrower, though not always in the prescribed format. The tone of correspondence was excellent
Representatives from the borrower visited the Bank from time to time to discuss project execution
and the future. Relationships between consultants and borrowers were also good, and there were
no major problems with contractors.

12.01            The performance of consultants on studies was generally satisfactory, except for the
management organization study which critical findings and recommendations were issued in an
undiplomatic manner. Also some consultants had difficulty in adjusting to local conditions. Two
teams of technical advisers were in place from September 1987 and considerably helped project
execution and institution building. It is clear, however, that it is difficult to find, at present, top
expatriate railways managers to serve in technical assistance positions and the experience in these
projects with some expatriate general managers and an assistant general manager was disappointing.
Recruitment of mixed teams in different countries also has its shortcomings, if only because their
approaches to railways management and operationsare different.



                                 13. ProiectDocumentation and Data

13.01            Basic project documentation was standardfor this type of project and was carefully
established. In essence, the changes in events made them outdated rapidly. The main problem
seems to have been one of reporting. Reports from SNCZ have been abundant, especially under
1475-ZR, when technical assistants were called in to support project implementation. However, no
fixed format was followed from the beginning to the end, making the preparationof the PCR a
difficult task, and, worse, making it difficult to follow project development. It is recommendedthat
the new Supervision Report (Form 590 plus Aide Memoirel systematically include updated tables
which would constitute the permanent reportingsystem, all through the project's life.

               PART 11: REVIEW OF PROJECTS FROM BORROWER PERSPECTIVE




                                                1. General

1.O1            The borrower basically confirmed the accuracy and adequacy of the factual
information contained in Part Iand Part Illof the PCR, which were sent to him. Tables prepared by
the borrower (SNCZ)have been instrumental in PCR preparation, particularly as regard computation
of local costs and of the distribution of financing between different cofinanciers. The borrower
commented in French on the draft PCR and its comments are translated hereinbelow. They are
immediately followed by Bank staff comments on borrower's reactions.



                                      2. lm~lsmentationExoerienca
                                    (Evaluation Summary, paragraph 2)

2.01            The borrower confirms that technical assistance sped up project execution from 1987
on. But it also considers that SNCZ has gained experience in management of projects financed from
foreign aid. Further, it considers that the development of computerized management systems had "a
very positive impact in that respectw.

Staff Comments

2.02            The staff agrees with the borrower's comments. Of special interest is the positive
impact of management information systems, which shows that the Bank's effort for financing this
type of item is relevant. Whether the Bank is equipped for appraisal of management information
systems is not certain. See paragraph5.02 of Part Ion the belated, but useful intervention of a
Bank computer specialist.

2.03            The borrower considers that the high cost to IDA, mentioned in the last sentence of
the paragraph, should be attributed to IDA "which alone decides on the scheduling of its missions".
But the borrower indicates that the supervision missions, specially those of the last three years
(1987-1990) "had a positive impact not only on project execution but also on the preparation of the
Transport Rehabilitation Project. These missions permitted to take the necessary corrective actions
in project execution and to participate positively to keeping a firm line of conduct in the operations
contributing to SNCZ's rehabilitation."

Staff Comments

2.04            The statement on project costs was purely factual and by no means intended to place
any blame on the borrower.

                                            3. Zairianisation
                                         (Part I, paragraph 4.02)

3.01            The borrower considers that there is "some exaggeration" in the importance given to
Zairianisation as an obstacle to the good execution of the projects: "while it is recognized that some
of the appointments to management positions had not been made according to objective criteria ...
this should not have such a negative impact".

Staff CommenQ

3.02       '    Again, the statement on rapid Zairianisation is factual. It reflects project files, which
include evidence that Zairianisation was decided as a political measure, with a time limit, which did
not permit a phased and logical approachto the replacement of expatriates by equally qualified
nationals. Part I of the PCR does not formulate an opinion on the measure per se. Such an opinion
would be ultra vires. But it points out, as it is its role to do, that the project design did not include
all the measures necessary to alleviate the possible negative effects of the decision of Zairianisation.



                                    4. Assum~tionson Manaaement
                                       (Part I,paragraph 5.02(a))

4.01            The borrower "fully agrees" with the Bank on this point. But it regrets "that the
Bank, which was so aware of what was going on, did not take the necessary measures, despite that
it hadthe means to do so, to stop the deterioration of management. Its recommendationsrelative to
the candidates to strategic positions in SNCZ were not what they should have been, given the lever
of competence necessary to serve adequately in the position".

Staff Comments

4.02            This is an interesting and indeed refreshing comment from the borrower. In
substance, it regrets that the Bank has not been firm enough in its dealings with Government. The
Bank is being clearly blamed for having accepted candidates which should have been rejected, to the
disappointment of the borrower, which clearly expected that its good management would be
protected by the Bank from the vagaries of Government decisions.

                         5. Conseauences of the Cancellation of Arab Loans
                                       (Part I, paragraph 5.02(dI)

5.01            The borrower "always regretted that the Bank refused to act totally as the leader In
the financing of Railways I. This translated in its subsequent refusal to provide funds to eliminate
the financing gap, but also in the fact that it did not help SNCZ to find other sources of financing
The consequences of this are still felt today. In addition, SNCZ's unexpected efforts to mitigate the
loss of foreign financing from its own resources limits its self-financing capacity."

Staff Cornmenu

5.02            The Bank could not provide more IDA funds than allocated to the project, which 1s
why it sought cofinancing in the first place. But the borrower's comment, after years of cooperatloo
with the Bank Group, shows that the Bank should not take for granted that borrowers know the
difference between Bank, IDA, etc, and know of the rules which govern cofinancing. An informatloll
effort is necessary. The statement that the Bank did not help SNCZ in finding other sources of
financing is not accurate. On the contrary, the Bank made substantial efforts to arrange new
financing, which resulted in the second project.    As for SNCZ self-financing capacity, it is true that .
has been hurt by the withdrawal of the Arab sources of finance. But it is jeopardized much more c.
SNCZ's poor financial situation.

                                    6. Proaress of lm~lementation,
                                         (Part I,paragraph 5.04)

6.01            The borrower agrees with the Bank on the poor performance of SONATRAD and on
its negative impact on the project. It points out that the good progress made on wagon
rehabilitation, which is now ahead of schedule, should be credited to SNCZ staff, which worked
overtime, and to management, which accepted to deliver the necessary incentives.

                                         (Part I, paragraph7.06)

7.01             The borrower dos not agree with the statement that the technical assistants did set
up ground rules for maintenance and operations of equipment : 'on the contrary, SNCZ at present
uses the procedure manuals issued by equipment suppliers"       ...'further,SNCZ deplores that some
technical assistants ....preferredto work alone and did not really cooperate with the national
counterparts which they were supposed to train"      ... "when they left, some of them did not accept to
conduct a formal transfer, even though such a transfer was stipulated in their contract".

Staff Comments

7.02             The information in paragraph 7.06 is based on supervision and other reports used in
preparing the PCR. Possibly, Bank missions did not fully appreciate the tensions between expatriate
technical assistants and local staff during project execution. The situation was not an easy one.
Technical assistants came from different countries. Their experience of the country and their
                                                                                       -

8.01             The borrower considers that "the inadequate performance for which SNCZ is blamed
should be shared with the Bank, since it asked for the appointment of a Financial Director, w h ~ h $1
