efficiency of the\n            energy sector by providing a sound legal, institutional and\n            regulatory framework, fostering sound planning and pricing\n            policies, attracting private sector participation to the\n            power sector, and strengthening the Comision Ejecutiva\n            Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa's (CEL) efficiency and\n            management.  These objectives will be achieved through: (a)\n            the formulation of an energy policy document; (b)\n            transferring the policy and regulatory functions from CEL to\n            a regulatory body to be created; (c) reforming the\n            organization of the power sector to foster private sector\n            participation; (d) assistance in redesigning the structure\n            of electricity rates; (e) preparing a portfolio of power\n            generation projects; and (f) improving management\n            capabilities within CEL.  The project will include the\n            following components: (a) sector studies; (b) engineering\n            and management studies; (c) acquisition of equipment and\n            materials; and (d) a training program."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
