The lessons\n            learned about reform and privatization include: a) the\n            strategy for power sector reform should be designed with\n            consideration to the potential size of a neighboring\n            regional market. b) Sector policy and regulatory reform\n            should be well underway before privatization in the sector.\n            c) The government's reform and privatization team\n            should be staffed with qualified top level staff, with\n            proven commitment to the reform. d) it is often better to\n            break up large companies. e) Full attention must be paid to\n            public relations. f) Top-level political support is critical\n            for the success of the reform and privatization process.\n            Lessons learned about bank lending include: 1) The Bank\n            should be proactive in its sectoral dialogue and prepared to\n            take the time to bring up to speed government officials of\n            new administrations. 2) The loan should not become effective\n            unless the project executing unit is in place. 3) In the\n            event that the Bank is not successful in persuading the\n            Borrower to use new procurement procedures, the Borrower\n            should be given the option of using the old procedures spelt\n            out in the loan agreement. 4) Adequate use of consultant\n            services for diagnostic studies prior to project\n            implementation is advisable. 5) While executing project\n            contracts, the technical staff should also focus on\n            administrative and legal matters in addition to technical matters."}, "docdt": "1998-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
