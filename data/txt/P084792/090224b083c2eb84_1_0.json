follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: identifying the\n            most important constraints and addressing them through\n            well-tested simple technical solutions proved to be the key\n            factor for project success. Strong, high-level political\n            commitment on the part of the Government of Assam was\n            instrumental to the success of the project. Implementing\n            project activities through government agencies can advance\n            major policy reforms and mainstream innovations within and\n            throughout public sector institutions. The innovative\n            community procurement model was a key factor contributing to\n            the success of the project. Agricultural technology\n            management agency (ATMA) has proven an effective model for\n            developing and disseminating new agricultural technologies\n            but now its role should be extended to promoting value chain\n            development activities. Comprehensive groundwater monitoring\n            system is an important policy tool for environmental and\n            economic management of irrigation systems."}, "docdt": "2015-12-02T00:35:01Z"}
