Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Project closing date is March 15, 2015. All the planned activities have been completed and project has achieved its outcome indicators. In view of this
 project implementation and achievement of project development objectives are rated as “Satisfactory”. The average boro season paddy productivity in
 the project area has gone up fro, 1.5 tons/ha to 5.0 tons per has; cropping intensity increased from 1305 to 200% in the project area; and the average
 fish productivity in the project area, has gone up from 485 kg/ha at baseline to 3278 kg/ ha (increase of 575 % over baseline)) in farmers’ ponds and
 from 875 kg/ha at baseline to 2462 kg/ ha in case of community tanks (181% increase); and from 480 kg/ ha at baseline to 1008 kg/ha (111% increase
 over baseline).There has been increased crop diversification to high value crops (from 17% to 24%) in the project area. The project has reached and
 benefitted some 546,503 beneficiaries across the agriculture, fishery, dairy, forestry, and livestock sectors. Innovative activities proposed under
 additional financing have been successfully undertaken, including the establishment of a state-wide groundwater monitoring system, farmer producer
 organization and a pilot program of using solar-power for running irrigation pump.
 The project has made excellent progress on all components and most targets have been achieved. In addition, the project has demonstrated many
 best practices:
 a) Government of Assam (GoA) has mainstreamed the process of community procurement for the procurement of irrigation pumps as well as for other
 farm machinery and equipment such as tractors and power tillers; b) Project also facilitated many policy level interventions viz., formation of State Road
 Board and adoption of Road Maintenance Policy; introduction of Fish Seed Act; amendment to the Assam Fisheries Act and Rules to facilitate long-term
 lease of Beels to the community groups (under progress); phased cost recovery of AI services; and c) Project introduced many innovative pilots viz.,
 Centralized Fund Management which reduced the time taken for the funds to reach the beneficiary groups, from 30-45 days to just 3 days; Piloting of
 Artificial Insemination services for piggery breed improvement; and use of prefabricated bridges under Rural Roads by PWD to reduce cost and time of
 construction

 Overall Comments
 As mentioned in the Additional Financing project paper, all the indicator values realized for the Original Credit are due to the sustained project
 interventions, through infrastructure development (irrigation / ponds /tanks / beels / markets / rural roads, mechanization, and extension (ATMA)
 approaches spreading over five seasons. During AF period (2012 to March 2015), new areas that came under similar project interventions, went
 through only three seasons (2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15). Even here, the impact of the third season (2014/15) will not be captured in the EOP
 Impact Assessment, since the project is ending in March 2015. Now, with only two seasons available for the new areas, for some of the indicators
 value thus recorded is lower than the original credit levels, but higher than the PAD projected levels.
 The values for "Increase in Market Surplus" for mustard and paddy is much lower than expected as there was crop loss. This would be updated in
 the EOP survey.
