                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Under the project, AACP has reached and benefitted some 497,612 beneficiaries in about 109,406 beneficiary groups across the agriculture, fishery dairy, forestry, and livestock.
                         Impact assessment of the original credit shows that the project interventions are heavily skewed towards the most disadvantaged sections of the state. Socioeconomic screening,

                         last mission in December 2013. It has completed many of the critical actions, especially on procurement and implementing the contracts agreed in the previous mission. All the
                         planned major procurement activities have been completed. Innovative activities proposed under additional financing have been successfully undertaken, including the establishment
                         of a state-wide groundwater monitoring system, farmer producer organization and a pilot program of using solar-power for running irrigation pumpsets. In light of this, implementation

                         progress rating has been raised to “satisfactory”.
                         With regard to component progress under the Investment Grant Scheme component, the project has been able to achieve the targets set out under the additional financing period;
                         progress of Agricultural Services and Market Chain Development component is mixed - the AACP ATMA program continues to perform well, while the performance of CSS-ATMA is
                         not as desired and is yet to take off; overall progress under livestock activities has improved; and progress under the Infrastructure Development component- is also satisfactory.
                         However, focus should shift on completing the contract work within the project closing date. With less than six months remaining for the project closing date, focus of the project and
                         the participating line department should be on completing the planned activities on time. The recently concluded implementation support mission reiterated the tight time line with
                         respect to completing the contracted activities on ground with virtually no room for slippages.
