The project will benefit an\n            area of about 640,000 ha covered by the NIS through:  (a)\n            improvement of 18 NIS, urgent structural repairs in another\n            14 NIS, construction of three sediment excluders and\n            improved water control structures on a pilot basis, and\n            erosion prevention measures in critical areas; (b) continued\n            support of the improved system-level operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) services; (c) institutional\n            development through: (i) strengthening of existing\n            Irrigators' Associations (IAs), establishment of new\n            IAs, and enhanced financial and management training; and\n            (ii) strengthening of the National Irrigation Administration\n            (through improvements in the Irrigation Service Fee\n            collection process; staff training in O&M, appropriate\n            engineering design techniques, farmer training techniques,\n            etc; technical assistance for various studies, IA\n            development work and staff training; and provision of high\n            priority O&M equipment and materials; and (d) improved\n            agricultural support services in the NIS areas including\n            research and extension, farmer training in integrated pest\n            management, and promotion of IA-based seed production.
