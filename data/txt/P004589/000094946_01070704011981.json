However, there was a delay\n            of about two years in project implementation due to a\n            variety of reasons: including: a) inadequate budgetary\n            allocation in the first three years of the project; b)\n            expansion in the scope of the systems improvement\n            sub-component and the institutional development component;\n            c) a considerable delay in the recruitment of consultants\n            for the design of modality of operation and the Irrigation\n            Management Transfer program; and d) the lack of knowledge\n            and experience among the National Irrigation Administration\n            design and field staff of the new technology promoted for\n            water level control and modality of operation.

A program approach is needed for irrigation sector\n            reform and National Irrigation System improvement. The\n            borrowing policy for technical assistance should be decided\n            early in the project cycle.
