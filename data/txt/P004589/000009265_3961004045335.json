national\n            irrigation systems (NIS) and thereby help increase\n            agricultural production (mainly rice), expand small farmer\n            incomes and rural employment opportunities, and contribute\n            to rural poverty alleviation. The project will benefit an\n            area of about 640,000 ha covered by the NIS through:  (a)\n            improvement of 18 NIS, urgent structural repairs in another\n            14 NIS, construction of three sediment excluders and\n            improved water control structures on a pilot basis, and\n            erosion prevention measures in critical areas; (b) continued\n            support of the improved system-level operation and\n            maintenance (O&M) services; (c) institutional\n            development through: (i) strengthening of existing\n            Irrigators' Associations (IAs), establishment of new\n            IAs, and enhanced financial and management training; and\n            (ii) strengthening of the National Irrigation Administration\n            (through improvements in the Irrigation Service Fee\n            collection process; staff training in O&M, appropriate\n            engineering design techniques, farmer training techniques,\n            etc; technical assistance for various studies, IA\n            development work and staff training; and provision of high\n            priority O&M equipment and materials; and (d) improved\n            agricultural support services in the NIS areas including\n            research and extension, farmer training in integrated pest\n            management, and promotion of IA-based seed production.  A\n            distinctive feature of the project is its emphasis on\n            beneficiaries' participation in identification of\n            specific deficiencies and required improvements of the NIS,\n            and increasing responsibility for O&M of the relevant\n            portions of the system serving them."}, "docdt": "1993-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
