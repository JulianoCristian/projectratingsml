A. BACKGROUND
I.The Guangxi Highway Project contains the following two parts:
(1) Hechi(Shuiren) via Duan to Nanning highway (Shuiren-Nanning Highway hereinafter-main
road), includinlg the main route and connccting lincs(Sec Fig.2-1);
(2) The Highway Network Improvement Program in the Poverty area of Guangxi Shuiren-
Nanning Highway Project(HNIP): of 8 roads(See Fig.2-1).
The EIA of Shuiren-Nanning Highway was compiled by Xi'an Highway University. In March
1996, the unit compiled the EIA outline of the project. In June 1997, the SEPB gave a reply on the
review of the outline. In November, 1998, and it worked out the first edition of EIS. Early December,
1998, the Environmental Protection Agency of the MOC held a preview meeting on the EIA in
Nanning. Based on the  new edition of the "Project Feasibility Study Report of the Hechi(Shuiren)-
Duan-Nanning Highway" of Dec. 1998, the EIS was completed in January, 1999 (edition for review
& approval). In May, 1999, the second edition was finished.(revision), and in September, 1999, the
final edition was achieved.
The EIA work, for the HINIP Roads, is held by Guang provincial EP Institute. They've drawn out
the EIA report in May, 1999, and achieved the final edition in September, 1999.
2. The process of environmental review involve from various institutions in Guangxi Zhuang
Region, including GEPB, EPB of Hechi Prefecture, the provinicial E,l Monitor Station, and EMS of
Hechi Prefecture and the Meteorological Bureau of Guangxi Zhuang Region. The affected groups and
NGOs along the highway, and the people subject to resettlement and land acquisition in particular, have
been consulted.
3. The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of development
projects in China were followed during preparation and evalution of EIA, as well as the World Bank
s OP/BP/GP 4.01 on the Environmental Assessment. The Criteria of EIA for the project are listed in

4. The Scope and Criteria for the EIA are presented as below:
(a) Assessment Scope
The assessment of social surroundings covers within 200 m on either side of the proposed road,
with certain extension in sensitive areas, while that the ecosystem covers within 200 m on either side,
with certain extension in sensitive areas, the surface water environment within I CKOrn downstream of
bridge, with extension 5000m at locations of drinking water. And atmbient noise and air are within
200m on either side, the aesthetics & tourism impact analysis are within 500m on either side, with
certain extension at section of Yilingyan. The cultuwal relics scope along the route is within ICK0m, with
some extension at somne sections of key areas.
(b) The following standards are applied as the criteria for the EIA:
(1) For environmental impact assessment of acoustics, Environmental Noise Standards in Urban
Areas GB 3096-93 is adopted. On the main road and its connecting roads, class-one is adopted for
schools and hospitals, and class-four for villages and residential areas.
(2) For the EIA of ambient air, class-two standards in GB 3095-1996 are adopted. For emission
of atmospheric pollutants, class-two standards are adopted (GB 16290-1996);
(3) For water environment, class-three standards are adopted in Surface Water Quality
Standards GB 3838-88. For emission of domestic sewage, Water Quality Standards of Farm Irrigation
GBB5084- 92 and class-one standards in Sewage Emission Standards GB 8978-1996 are adopted-
(4) Class-two standards in Soil Environmental Quality Standards GB 16518-1995 and Pb Limit
Sanitation Standards in Food GB 14935-94 are adopted.
5. Class of Assessment and Content of Work
Shui-Nan Highway: The total length of the alignment is 237.915lkm. There villages and towns
are with dense population. Considering the important role the areas play and the complex geological
conditions, the class of assessment has been identified as Category A. Therefore, the project need to
made EIA and EAP.
2



HNIP Roads: All projects are no new road construction and no land acquisition under this
program. along the proposed alignments, no natural and cultural prDtected sites are observed. While
several environmentally sensitive sites such as school and hospitals are located along the alignments,
environmental impacts at those sites are temporary during the construction period. And, their
environmental conditions (noise, dust, etc.) are expected to be improved after the completion of this
program. Therefore, all projects under this program are classed as Category 1, which needs only EAP.
6. Based on the project features and construction cycle, and precliction of traffic volume, the EIA
prediction phases are determined as follows:
For Shuiren-Nanning Highway
Highway construction phase (2000 - 2005);
Short-term of operation phase (2006);
Medium-term of operation phase (2014);
Long-term of operation phase (2024).
For II Roads
Highway construction phase (2000 - 2003);
Short-term of operation phase (2005);
Medium-term of operation phase (2015);
Long-term of operation phase (2022).
B. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE P'ROJECT
7.The total length of the proposed road is 237.588 km. The whole route is divided into two
sections for which three different technical standards will be adopted considering the following factors:
the predicted traffic volume, the level of economical growth of the respective areas, the natural
conditions, construction capital and the state planning for the highway configuration. They are:
(I) Section from Hechi(Shuiren) to Duan K96+000-K194+300. The newconstruction mileage is
96.855km with standards Class-two, including:

C. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
1. Environmental Survey of Shuiren-Nanning Highway
9.Terrain
The terrain of the alignment rises from southeast to northwest. Hechi (Shuiren) where the route
starts is situated in the southern edge of Yungui Plateau with an average elevation of 600 meters above
the sea level. While Duan and Mashang in the imiddle has an elevation of 400-300 meter, Nanning,
the destination, located in the center of Guangxi Basin, has an average elevation of about 150 meters.
The terrain through which the road passes takes three kinds of topography. The northwest has a
comparatively great altitude difference with huge mountains, valleys, and steep cliffs. While southeast
has smaller rise and fall with open and flat terrain. Generally, the topography falls into three categories,
namely plane of denudation, hills, Karst and small alluvial plains.
I O.River Regime
The area of the study section is abundant in rivers, with all belonging to the Zhujiang River
System. From north to south the road passes or goes parallel to the following rivers: Diaojing,
Chengjiang, Hongshuihe, Dongjiang and Wuminghe. The Hongshu;he River flows southeast, and it is
the longest river it passes through. The water current is swifL, Both upper and lower have terraced
structures, and it is used for navigation. The second largest river is the Diaojing River, basically going
south-north. The Chengjiang River, flowing from underground, has a depth of over I-meter, and the
route passes over it nearly at its end. The road goes parallel to it for about 14 km. Both Dongjiang and
Wuminghe go from east to west. All the rivers are of rain   fed rivers affected by the weather and
seasons. The flow resulted from flood in spring and fall may be decades or a hundred times that in dry
seasons.
The study areas are rich in surface water. There are plenty of streams, canals, reservoirs and ponds
for fishery.
IL. Climate
The proposed highway lies north of the Tropic Cancer belonging to humid weather of subtropical
zone. The climate is mild with an annual average temperature of 20 C -22 C. It is steamy and hot
with an average temperature of 24.8 C - 26.3'C. The annual lowest temperature is 17.5C. The
weather year around is frost-free. These areas are rich in rainfall with an average of more than 1216
mm. The rainfall is mainly concentrated in April -September accounting for 85% that of the whole
year. Nanning and Wuming are struck by typhoon and storms, while Mashan and Duan is affected not
so severely.
Because of the great rainfall, floods occur very often here resulting in disasters.
Every year in May - December, Guanfxi is effected by typhoon with coastal areas and Yulin
Prefecture in.particular. When there is typhoon in Nanning, the wind is usually force S - 7. Typhoon
brings heavy rainfall affecting highway service.
The average quarterly and yearly wind speed frequency shows no obvious difference between
seasons in wind directions. The main wind directionis in these areas are Hechi E, Duan NNW, Mashan
6



NE, Wuming SE, Nanning ENE.
12. Ecosystem
The total length of the proposed alignment is 237.588 km. The study areas are rich in biological
resources because of favorable climatic conditions of humid monsoon. However, these resources are
unevenly distributed due to various geographical conditions and population.
1 3. Flora
The virgin vegetation in the study area includes tropical evergreen broad-leaved forests, but as the
altitude rises, typical mountain evergreen broad-leaved forests, forests with both broad-leaved and
acicular forests and mountain low forests are found. Secondary vegetation consists of evergreen and
deciduous forests. At those areas where there are more human activiities, most high arbor trees have
been cut with only shrubs or bare rocks left. The forest coverage at backcountry mountains is 40-50%,
while in the central and densely populated areas, in vast karst areas in particular, the coverage is only
5-10%. The study area is in the area with frequent human activities. The forests here are evergreen
and deciduous ones mixed with bushes.
There are plenty trees in the project areas, including pines, iirs, eucalyptus, oak, China fir,
Chinaberry, Chinese mahogany, tung tree, paper mulberry, tea   oil tree, Chinese chestnut, pine,
meadow fescue, camphor tree, silk tree. Medicine plants are: honeysuckles, ninebark, multiflower
knotweed, asparagus fern. The major grain crops are: rice, potatoes, cringe and tangerine, sugar cane,
peanut and lotus root etc. The major fruit trees are bryony, litchi, longan, sand pear, persimmon, peach
and plum etc. All these species do not belong to rare plants under protection of national level.
14. Fauna
Due to frequent human activities and advanced farming, large wild animals are rarely found
except in the mountainous areas in Duan and Hechi Counties. Large animals are monkey, wild dog,
boar, paguma larvata, muntjac, Rrinaceeus earopaeus, Manis pentadactyla, goat, otter and musk deer.
Birds are; magpie, owl, cuokoo, Garrulax canorus, crow, conure ancl mandarin duck etc. The route
areas are frequently populated and there are no state-level wild animals in the areas.
15.Soil and Crops
(1) The major soil types in the study areas are red soil, yellow soil, calcareous soil, alluvial soil,
and purple soil and paddy soil. The red soil is the leading one that is; found below 700 m of the sea
level on the low hills; the yellow soil is found above 700 m, and the paddy soil is found in the central
Guangxi Basin and valleys and plains. Calcareous soil is found mainly in the northem part of the
alignment at calcareous areas.
(2) The reference from ten monitoring spots of soil and plant defected shows that the content of
lead in soil is 41.576 - 23.083mglkg, much lower the most strict standards 250 mg/kg. This means
thial the soil has not been polluted. It has much capacity.
The monitoring result of lead content in crops: rice 0.387mg/kg -  none; in vegetable 0.15
0.1 8mg/kg; in com 0.366mg/kg. All are lower than the standards. They have not been polluted so far.
7



16. Soil Erosion
The ground surface is covered with green plants year around in Guangxi thanks to its humid and
warm climate that fits growth of plants. The soil erosion along the alignment is slight.
17. Farming
The advantages in natural and geographical conditions in Guangxi are favorable for crop growth.
There are various kinds of crops and other plants in the study areas taking in rice, beans, potatoes, com,
wheat, sugar cane, tobacco, peanut, tea, fruits and medicine herbs.
In Nanning, Wuming and Mashan, rice is grown with higher per unit area yield because of
favorable climate. Whereas in Duan, the natural and geographical conditions are much poorer than
those in the above areas. There are lots of mountains and hills. The good farmland is scarce there, so
special attention to that must be paid in construction of the road.
18. Socio-economics in the Study Areas
The proposed project will pass Hechi Prefecture, Nanning Prefecture and the City of Nanning with
rive directly impacted counties and citics of Nanriing, Wuming, Mashan, Duan and Hechi.
Nanning City is located in the central south of Guangxi Region. It governs six districts and two
counties covering an area of 10,029 km2 with a population of 281.20 million (1997) including 62% of
agricultiral population. There are rich mineral resources and subtropical plant resources and tourist
resources being one of the five tourist resorts. Thie GNP in 1997 was 17,489 million yuan being in the
leading position of development in the whole region.
Wuming County, located in the north of Nanning, is under juristication of Nanning. It is an area
where a number of nationalities live together with Zhuangzu being in the greatest number. The area of
the county is 3,366 km2 with a population of 6.408 million with the agricultural population making up
85.8 %, among which the Zhuang people account for more than 86 % .
Mashang County is under jurisdication of Nanning Prefecture. The whole county is located in
deep rocky mountain area with poor natural resources and deteriorated biological conditions, and it is
one of the development areas in Honghe River power station reservoir districts. The area of the
county is 2,365 km2 with a population of 0.4855 million people, 93%  of which is engaged in
agriculture. It is an agricultural county with less farmiand for per person. The county is resided by 13
peoples including Han Zhuang and Yao, with Zhuang and Yao taking up 84.6% of the total population
The GNP was 415 million yuan in 1997. Therefore, we can say that it is a backward county in
Guangxi with slow growth of economy. So far, about 30%  of the population are under the poverty
line.
Duan County is a Yaozu autonomous county under jurisdication of Hechi Prefecture. The total
area is 4,095 km2 with a population of 0.6217 million people, 94% of which are engaged in agriculture,
and 21.7 are Yao people. The GNP in 1997 was 464 million yuan being one of the poorest counties in
the country which needs assistance to get rid of poverty. Now, 26 thousand people still live in poverty
making up 42 %  of the wlhole population. Agriculture is the supporting industry in economy. However,
the township enterprises are developing fast. There are favorable natural conditions for developing
a



green food.
Hechi City is an access to the seaports for Guizhuo and Sichuang and other provinces of
Southwestern China. The total area is 2,340 km2 with a population of 0.304 million in 1997, 64% of
which are engaged in agriculture. The area is rich in mineral resources, water resources, forest
resources and tourism resourses. Economy is booming fast. Industry includes metallurgy, foodmaking,
cement, farming tool and other businesses forming the backbone of economy. Agriculture consists of
growing industry and husbandry. The GNP in 1997 was 1,262 million-yuan taking the leading position
in economical development in Hechi Prefecture.
19. Traffic Transportation at Present
The major transportation means in the study areas is highway transportation. The main highway in
operation at present is 210 National Highway. Most sections of the highway are of class three or four or
simple country road except the class two sections between Nanning and Wuming, .which is 29 km long.
The bad conditions of the road cause frequent traffic accidents. Besides, they can not meet the
economic growth. Therefore, these areas need a high-class highway urgently.
20. Tourism Resources
In the areas directly affected by the project, the main tourist resort is Wulingyan in Wuming
County. Wulingyan scenic zone is the paradise in Nanning tourist areas. The passage of the alignment
through the tourist attraction will add beauty to the scenery, so the tourists can enjoy the pleasure.
21. Cultural Relics
Through site survey reconnaissance and visit to the institutions; of historic relics, no important
cultrual relics have been found in the assessment area.
22. Minority Nationalities
The total length of the proposed alignment is 237.588km. The areas of the minorities and villages
where they live make up above 95 percent of all villages thirough which the proposal passes. They are
mainly Zhuang, Yao and Maonan nationalities.
The various nationalitiles of Guagnxi Region have long got along well with each other for ages.
They learn from each other and help each other in culture and econornic deeds. There are no customs
deserving special attention except for some distinctive dress style, languages, diet etc. They all share
the same festivals with the Han except for the Zhuzhu Festival observed by some minorities.
The areas through which the projected highway passes are very backward because of poor
transport conditions. As a result, the economical and cultural activities have long been limited leading
to poor living conditions of the local people. So, they are enthusiatically interested in the construction
of the new highway. To conclude, the construction of Shuiren-Nanning is bound to promote the local
economy to a great extent.
23. Acoustics
According to the rield investigation with 11 noise moniloring spots, there are no other noise
sources found except those from the highway. The results are as follows:
(I) In general rural areas, the noise level in daytime is LAN=38.2-44.7dB; at night LA., =32.1-
9



40.9dB,which are in accordance with 0 grade iin GB3096-93 in Noise Level Standards in Urban Areas.
(2) The noise level beside the main county highways and near the suburbs of county town sites is;
at night 45.9-59.0dB which is in excess of the standards; in daytime the noise level is of class 4; at the
distance of 20 m or behind the level is class 3-1. The traffic noise resulting from these highways do not
have significant effect on the environmental noise due to the fact that the proposed alignment goes
parallel to the existing highway only at a few sections.
It can be concluded that the quality of acoustics along the projected highway is fairly good. The
residents and the schools enjoy a quiet environment.
24. Water
The results of 6 mnoiiiorinig spols show thiat the water quality in the water bodics is good witli its
existing level in accordance with class  two except Daojiang River over class-five.
25. Ambient Air
Five monitoring spots are identified along the alignment to monitor CO, NOx, TSP and lead
content in air. The results show the concentrations of pollutants are all below class-two standards in GB
3095-1996, so it has great acceptance capacity. The air quality is fairly good thanks to the humid air
and thick vegetation.
II. Environmental Survey for HNIP Roads
26. Terrain
Qintan-Sanli section, Sanli-Hengxian section and Huigang-Shinan section are located at south-
eastern Guangxi Region. The terrain presents hilly plain mainly; Wuja-Hepu section, Hepu-Changle
section at sourthern Guangxi, with a terrain of alluvial plain and hilly, 30km from the North Gulf;
Wuming-Yingxu section at south by west, with hilly terrain; Yinxiu-Pingcun section and Beise-Tianlin
in western Guangxi, tihe former of which is in Karst topography with continual mounts, embeding with
small or large round or honeycomb low-laying lands, the later section of which is mainly with hilly and
basins. Among the above 8 sections, the Pingcin-Jiuxu section is full of spirals, with plenty of bends
and heavy grades. Beise-Tianlin section owns many gradual slopes. Some other sections are
comparatively flatted, only a little hilly at some parts.
27. Climate
There are no much differences in climate among the 8 road areas, all under monsoon climate in
subtropical zone. They all have a long summer and short winter with splendid sunshine. It rains in hot
days with a long frost-free period and dry wet season. Also it is the places with many disasterious
weather. The local meteorological statistics show that the summer covers at the end of April and middle
Oct., lasting half a year and the winter from rniddle Jan. to middle Feb. for only one month. The
average temperature reaches the top in June and the bottom in Jan.,, the humidest month in March and
April, the driest month in Nov. and Doc.. Typhoon occurs mostly in months of March to August.
28. The Route Hydrology Regime
The 8 road areas are rich in surface water, with great water development. Rivers, channels,
reservoirs and ftshing ponds spread everywhere. The main rivers include such as Zijiang river, Yujiang
10



river, Nanliu river, Liaojiang river and Leli river.  Reservoirs spread all over the route areas, mosly in
small size. There are 8 medium-sized reservoirs (12 million m    3 more in storage capacity) for
irrigation.
29. Ecology
(1) Qitang-Wuli section
Agricultural vegetation plays a great role in ecology along the route. Within 300m, rice are grown
as well as some other fruits and vegetables. The natural vegetation contains some bushes and little
original forest remains except some spreading masson pines and eucalyptus in hilly area. The existing
road has some high protective belts and fruits along the road. Soil erosion stages vary from low-grade
to moderate degrees accounting for 90.1% of total erosive area. Partial sections have intensive and
severe erosions.
(2) Wuli-Hengxian section
The natural vegetation has been taken place by artificial ones alonlg the route. The local agriculture
developes quickly with plantation of rice, sugarcane, jasmine, fruit, peanuts, watermelon, cassava etc.
Rice and sugarcane take the most part. Vegetation exists with some preventive belts (mainly arbor)
along the route and around villages. The forestry coverage reaches 15-25%. Soil erosion stages in this
section cover various grades but mainly of low and moderate degrees accounting for 80.2%. Partial
sections have severe erosion occupying 9.8% of total erosive area.
(3) Changle-Hepu section
It is an agricultural area, mostly with plantation of rice, sugarcane, corn, peanuts, watermelon,
vegetables and fruits etc. Rice takes the most part in plantation. Soil erosion grade features severe
degree accounting for 71.2% of total erosive area; erosion grades of low-grade and moderate only
account for 19.0%.
(4) Shinan-Guigang section
It is an agricultural base on a comparatively plain area. Agricultural vegetation contains rice,
sugarcane, corn, peanuts, cassava, vegetables and fruits etc. The natural vegetation spread mainly as
mass on pines and eucalyptus, as well as some protective belts around villages and along the route,
with the forestry coverage rate of 15%-25%. Soil erosion stages vary from low-grade to moderate
degrees accounting for 90. 1% of total erosive area. Partial sections have intensive and severe erosions.
(5) Wujia-Hepu section
The route area is hilly as well as plain. Vegetation in hilly, distributes with masson pines and less
eucalyptus groups; in light hilly, with fruits and irrigation land on 1plain. The major categories on
farmland covers rice, sugarcane and com etc. The forestry covcrage rate reaches 20-30%. Soil erosion
of the section features severe grade belonging to destructive soil erosion.
(6) Wuming-Yingxu section
The route area is covered with rice and fruits, including litchi, longan, orange, awn fruits etc. The
natural vegetation spread with sparsely masson pine groups, with a forestry coverage of 18-25%. The
II



route area shows light and medium erosion, taking 93.2% of total area; strong erosion takes 6.8%. It is
not very severe in erosion.
(7) Pingcun-Jiuxu section
The same road to that of Shuiren-Nanning of the main route, which is located at the southern edge
of Yungui Plateau. Forest (artificial) takes the most part of local ecology. The main arbor category
contains some China fir, pine, eucalyptus, oak chinaberry etc. Fruits as orange and chessnuts distribute
at some hilly land. Soils are poor. Soil erosion belongs to light degree and the potential danger
belongs to light degree.
(8) Beise-Tianlin section
The route area stands at the southern edge of Yungui Plateau. Man-made vegetation takes the most
part in ecology. At the hilly land along the road, conifers spread, including masson pines and China fir
etc. In light hilly area, gardens exist with main economic fruits as chessnut, bamboo shoots etc. In the
vallay or flat mounts, agricultural vegetation distribute as rice, coM, soyabean, peanuts, sweet potato
etc. The forest coverage rate reaches 30%, and there are rare amount of wild animals. Soil erosion is
relatively serious, but mainly of light-degree, accounting for 74% of total erosion, moderate erosion is
17%, turbidity erosion is 9%. Storms will cause serious water erosion.
30. Social Environment
The HN]P roads go across 5 counties and 3 cities, through 26 townships, impacting directing upon
Beside city, Tianlin county, Hechi city, Wuming county, Hepu county, Hengxian county, Guigang city
proper and Xingyu county, indirectly upon some other areas in Guangxi Region.
Beise city: It is located in western Guangxi, a key town to touch with Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces as well as a revolutionary base. The whole city covers an area of 3717 km2, with a population
of 315200. Out of the whole population, 242500 are Zhuang, Yao, Miao or some other minorities,
taking 77% of total. Within the area, water resources are rich as well as mineral and agricultural
resources. Agriculture in local economy plays as a basis other than the industrial column as mining
machinery, sugar refinery, building material, chemnical industry, electricity etc.
Tianlin county: It is in northwestem Guangxi, one of the 48 poorest counties in the province, with
an area of 5577km2. It is one of the largest counties in size. The whole population amounts to 222000,
including farmers of 202000. The rich soil, forest, mineral resources etc are still not exploited
reasonably because of poor traffic conditions. In 1997, the GDP of the county reached 494 million
RMB yuan. Agricuture plays the most rolc other than the industry in early step.
Hepu county: It is in the south of Guangxi, facing the North Gulf. It is a famous pearl place. The
whole area covers 2380km2, with its long coastline of 307km. The population amounts to
871300,including country people of 715800. The rich marine resources are very typical other than
mineral and tourism resources. It is an agricultural base for grain production. The development of fish
catching and  breeding industries promote the aquatic products process turns the county into one of
the richest places in Guangxi Region.
12



Hexiang county: A southeastern county in Guangxi covers a whole area of 3464 km2 and a whole
population of 1039300, including 919000 of country people. The rich land and natural environment
turns the county into a base for grain and sugarcane, and sugar refinery, building material, jasmine
processing, food etc begin to take shape.
Guigang Cityproper: It is in the south of Guangxi, a hub of trafilics and inner harbor on Xijiang
river, as well as an industrial centre in southeastern Guangxi. The city area covers 51.83km2, with a
population of 267400. Industry plays a main role in the city, which has the largest sugar refinery factory.
It is also developing in sugar refinery, building material, food, chemical industry and some relevant
industrials.
Xingye county: A newly built county in southeastern Guangxi, thie area takes 1486.7 km2, and its
population of 630800, including its county people of 603900. The rich mineral and natural resources
provide the local enterprises with leading over development.
31. Residents' living standards
Primary education is popularized in the sections covered by thie project. One village has one
primary school, one town has one to three middle schools. Schooling rate of school-age children
reaches more than 98%. Each town has one hospital with 4-15 ward beds each ten thousand population.
Telephone is the main device of communication among towns and villages and with outside world.
Ielephone owning rate is 100-500 units cvcry ten thousand populaticin. Annual income per capita of
town residents is between 1700 - 6800 yuan, whilc that of peasants is about 2000 yuan.
According to investigation, peasant's averagc annual income of the eight cities and counties
(Tianlin's is a bit lower), schooling rates and number of middle school students etc. are near to or
higher than those of average of whole Guangxi. Employee's average income per capita, residential area
(except Heng county of moderate level) are lower than those of average figures of whole Guangxi.
Communication facilities of Baise and Hechi are well-developed and with good medical conditions.
Communication and medical conditions of other six places are lower than the provincial average
figures.
D.   POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND
MITIGATION MEASURES
1. Shuiren-Nanning Highway
Major potential impacts and their mitigation measures regarding Shuiren-Nanning Highway and
its linking roads are summarized below and incorperated in the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) of
the project. The EAP stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the EIA will be dealt with
in the design, construction and operation phases, and institutional arrangements have been made for the
implementation of the EAP in the three distinct phases. The key elerments of the EAP for Shuiren
Nanning Highway are summarized in Annex I-1.
13



IN DESIGN PHASE
32. Alternative Alignment
One from the two sectional altematives was chosen as the recommended scheme to use less land
and mitigative pollution & noise and less cutting mountain to reduce the impact of landscape.
The comparison of the Highway to be or not to be constructed shows the superiority of the project
to local economy, reduction of traffic accidents, the improvement of local environment.
Further comparison was/will be down in detail in cutting mountain spots to reduce the amount of
excavation and protect the landscape resources.
33. Social Disruption
168 passes (average every 700m), 6 interchange and 24 grade separators will be constructed to
facilitate the crossings of the expressway by local people, animals and vehicles.
34. Soil Erosion
Plantation of trees on either side of the road will be taken into account. In addition, the slopes in
the mountainous areas will be stabilized by means of various techniclues to avoid soil erosion and better
the environment. Catch drains will be installed in the design at the places where there are large cuttings
considering that there is plenty of rain that leads to collapse.
In design of the alignment, sites for building materials borrow and waste will be chosen properly
in the light of soil conservation and environmental protection.
The earth / stone works for the construction is 35,221,100m3, The construction will utilize material
excavated from cutting within the road-right- of-way for embankment fills of longitudinal balance; the
surplus earth or stones will be dumped into appropriate gullies. To prevent soil erosion and collapse,
retaining walls & drainage works will be providecl.
There are some weak poor geology on the project, the protective measures such as retaining walls
or protection slopes at toes, sand bed, top load have been designed.
To protect the soil erosion, the follow were/will be down:
(I)Trees and grasses will be planted in the side slopes and other parts within the occupied slopes.
The slopes in the mountainous areas will be stabilized by various techniques including
retaining and protecting walls in order to avoid flooding of the slopes.
(2)Subgrade drainage system will be installed.
35. Noise
There are 17 schools, I clinic, and 100 villages (about 7,400 household with 36,000 people) in the
study section along the alignment of Main road.
Based on the EIA and EAP, a combination of measures such as resettlement, installation of noise
barriers and afforestation will be undertaken to mitigate the short and medium term noise problems.
Before the operation of the highway, 13 villages and 2 schools (I school will be removed because the
land is needed by Highway) will be relocated and approximatety 3450 m2 noise barriers will be built at
sensitive locations.
In Table 4-1 are listed the villages exceeding the standards by more than 3 dB at night in 2014; in
:14



Table 4-2, the schools exceeding the standards by more than 3 dB in 2024 in daytime are listed. Based
on the existing conditions of a particular place, the following measures are proposed to take:
(I) It is suggested that in construction the housing in the residenitial centers within 40 mn from the
road center be demolished, considering the fact that the noise level at ~night in 2006 or 2014 exceeds the
standards by more than 5.0 dB. See Table 2-1. There is much less demolition in mountainous villages
because the houses are located sparsely. Besides, the slopes of Shuireni-Duan Section is very steep, so
40m of land it) width is used for embankment. Therefore, there will not be more removal due to impact
of traffic noise.
(2) In the villages where the level exceeds the standards by more than 4.0 dB in 2024, the noise
preventive measures and implementation time will be determined according to the monitoring level
behind 2014. See Table 4-1.
(3)Noise preventive measures will be taken at the schools where the excess is more than 3dB in
2024 in daytime. See Table 4-2.

Note: Weizou Primary School will be resettled in eng. because the land acquired, it is not made measure of noise prevention here.
36. Air Pollution
For Shuiren-Nanning Highway, in 2006, 2014 and 2024, at the cross sections predicted, neither
NOx nor CO will exceed the assessment criteria except for the concentration caused by the increased
traffic. However, some measures will be taken such as to check the exhaust gas at the toll stations.
37. Water Pollution
There will be two service stations in the section of Duan-Nanniing expressway. Sewage treatment
facilities will be set up at the service centers. The sewage will not be discharged unless is disposed of
properly. For it, secondary biological treatment procedures are suggested.
At section of Chengjiang River, five settlement tanks will be dug to catch the runoff from the road-
sides to alleviate the impact on water quality.
38. Culture Relics
Following the relevant regulations in China, an archaeologcial survey was carried out by Guangxi
Archaeological team. There are no relics along the road present.
39. Land Resources
By survey, the proposed highway construction will occupy all land of 24250.1mu, including
2643.59mu irrigated land, 6172.66mu arid land, 7547.54mu forest, 1018.39mu orchards, 5334.14mu
wasteland.
The project plan contains some treatment items on land taking impact in the operation plan of
removal and resettlemcnt.
16



In the section from Duan to Mashan, they are very short of farming land in some villages,
averaging 0.3-0.6mu/person, (referred in attached list 1). All the land is infertile, rather low in
production.
In design of the alignment, sites for building materials borrow and waste will be chosen properly in
the light of soil conservation and environmental protection.
To protect the land resources, the follow was/will be down:
(1) Trees and grasses will be planted in the side slopes and other parts within the occupied slopes.
The slopes in the mountainous areas will be stabilized by various techniques including retaining
and protecting walls in order to avoid flooding of the slopes.
(2) Subgrade drainage system will be installed.
(3) 980 culverts will be constructed to retain the irrigation function.
40. Biological Resources
The study areas are very rich in biological resources. So, reserves of plants and animals have been
taken into account in choosing the alignment.
4 1. Flooding
The construction of the project will interfere with the river courses and artificial channels in bridge
construction mainly. In design, many factors have been taken into account as flood-discharge and
farmland irrigation. The construction must be coordinated with water conservancy projects to reduce
the impact.
42. Irrigation
The proposed highway will cross densely irrigation systems and webs on the way, crisscrossing
plenty of irrigation canals. The design unit has detoured some major canals to ensure the regular
operation of irrigation, 980 culverts will be constructed to retain the irrigation function. In doing so,
the- runoff drainage and canal circulation is no more a problem.
43. Landscape
There is some apparent impact on local sceneries from cutting and road building in construction
phase. Some vegetation measures must be taken for local scenery protection.
To reduce the impact of landscape, follows were/will be down:
(1) The detail alignment will be determined to minimize spots, volume and areas of cutting
limestone mountains.  In the preliminary design, elabration  has made and the amount of earth/stone
work in relation to limestone mountains has been reduced by 9%, the areas of side slopes by 8%, and
thus  the number of cutting sites by 7 to 61, compared with those in the   feasibility study.  Further
efforts will be made in the detail design to further lessen the impacts on the landscape of Limestone
Mountains.
(2) On all of cutting sites, appropriate mitigation measures including the restoration of vegetation
will be taken. All plantable cutting slopes will be covered with turl: Cutting at some low and steep
slopes will be a little expanded so as to turn the slopes gentle for grass plantation. A 50 cm-wide
planting belt on shoulders at some I Om and higher steep slopes will be designed to allow such grass as
Boston ivy to grow on the slopes.  I'lic sections requiring large cxcavation along the highway and
17



protecting measures show in Table 4-3.
(3) Trial sections would be set up in an early stage of construction, where the environmental
mitigation measures against the cutting of limestone mountains adcdressed in the EA reports will be
examined in order to identify the most effective and practical measures.
(4)The school and village areas will be treed and sodded to create scenic belts.
(5)Highway management areas will also be treed and sodded to make the environment more
beautiful.
(6)Aesthetic plantation will be incorperated in the design of interchanges and of section of
Yilingyan.
(7)At cutting slopes, grass or some other climbing plants can be grown in order to restore the
landscape quickly.
44. The route risks present low probability, but still some prevention is needed at some important
sections. Crash barriers will be designed for the section of Chengjing River and Shuiren Reservoir to
prevent vehiales carrying hazardous goods from falling into the rivers.
IN CONSTRUCTION PHASE
45. Removal
In the recommended plan, the main buildings to be removed along the line will cover 57104 m2,
the removal of 2099 persons, all of which will be resettled in their own villages. That is in step with the
willing of local people.
The resettlement in the project can be organized under the provincial Communications Dept. while
the local city and county governments as well as the traffic bureaus in charge of land acquisition,
resettlement, removal of buildings etc. In principal, all the removing households will be resettled in
their own villages, 200m beyond the highway. All the removing households will be under
compensation in accordance with relevant rules, and resettled under the criterion of local plan.
46. Air pollution
The storage sites and mixing stations will not be located 300m within the residential quarters or
schools; storage sites and haulage roads will be sprayed regularly to recluce dust. The construction sites
also will be sprayed regularly.
Asphalt mixers will be located properly to avoid asphaltic pollution. According the relevant
regulations, asphalt mixers should be at least 300 m beyond residential areas and other sensitive
locations like schools or hospitals.umps of fine materials will be covered with mufflers or spayed with
water, and dispatched timely.
The weather decides the spraying. On rainless or arid days, spraying twice a day (in the morning
and in the afternoon).
47. Noise
In order to reduce the time to expose to loud noise, it is suggested that the workers operate noise
producing machines on shifh basis. Besides, the machinery will be maintained properly to keep it in
lowest noise level. The workers will wear earplugs and helmets.
When the construction sites are 200 m within the residential areas, no noise   producing

construction activities will be allowed between 22:00 - 6:00.
Interfere with teaching activities will be minimized at the sections of schools by consultation with
schools in order to ensure the suitable time of high noise machinery working.
48. Ecosystem
Temporary settlement tanks will be dug at the locations where thliere is runoff in construction of
subgradc to calcic mud and sand. Tlhe tank is usually 0.5 m deep, and thc si7e depends on the area of
catchment. Geotextile will be provided at the outlet where necessary. These places will be rehabilitated
on completion of the work.
Borrow earth will be planned, and it is required that borrow, leveliing, rehabilitation and plantation
be implemented at the same time. In the plain areas, the pits borrow will be suggested to be used as
fishiing pools. Before excavation the masses will be consulted about locations of borrow pits.
The road will be accepted together with works of plantation, slope protection and drain ditches.
When land for temporary use is concerned, the top fermented soil will be collected for
rehabilitation after the work is completed.
No borrow will be allowed to excavate from farmland at will.
No poaching will be allowed.
49. Water Pollution
To mitigate effect of highway construction on water bodies, the following measures will be taken:
(I) Muddy water caused by mud excavation and material washing pollutes water. Cofferdams
and caissons will be used in bridge construction with the former applying to the construction in the
river with smaller flow and wider surface and the latter applying to the r iver larger flow.
(2) Waste water at worker' camp will be properly treated by septic tank, etc. and disposed of.
(3) Oil leakage from machinery and ships or waste oil will not be discharged into the river. T'hey
should be collected and recycled as appropriate.
(4) Asphalt, oil and chemicals will not be stocked at the places close to the water bodies, and they
will be covered with mufflers to avoid them running into the water bodies:
(5)The removal and resettlement operation plan has been made out to deal with the people to be
impacted.
50. Traffic Management and Safety
The proposed alignment goes parallel to the 210 National Highway and crossing it several times at
Section Honglong - Duan, so it is very important to manage the traffic., It is suggested to construct the
road section after section. Wardens will be posted to guarantee smooth traffic and safety. Detours will
be built at crossings prior to the construction.
Wardens will be posted at crossings, school sectionis and residential areas to ensure that they are
safe.
The working time must be in schedule at some blasting sections. At blasting, no vehicles and
pedestrians are allowed to cross. ThC nciglibouring villagers can be subsided for their temporarily
lcaving at blasting.
No crossing of pedestrians is allowed when building up bridges.

51. Protection of Cultural Relics
Construction works will be stopped immediately if any cultural relics are discovered as a result of
road construction or excavation activities. T'he local cultural relics authorities will be informed
immediately. Excavation will not be resumed unless the authorities approve of it.
52. Vibration Monitoring
When vibration-producing construction (compaction of piers or operation of vibrat'ing rollers) is
carried out, the impact on neighboring adobe houses will be supervision. Reparative measures will be
taken if they are exposed to severe vibration and likely to suffer from damage.
53. Protection of Visual Resources
It is suggested to locate borrow sites at smaller hillsides. In excavation, it is better to cut off-the
whole hill head to make use of. If it is impossible to make full use of, it is better to excavate at the
backside. Ilills will be used as borrow sites, empty holes can not be left but a slope so as to the
restoration of vegetations.
54. Connecting Lines
A block in construction on connecting lines is a considerable problem. Some working as section
by section or side by side can be adopted to smoothen the traffics.
IN OPERATION PHASE
55. Local Plan
The prediction of trafric noise reveals that in the long-tern of operation (2024) the noise levels
withiit 100 in of thc road arc below class 4 of GB 3096- 93 (Standard levels on bothi sides of artery
road). Therefore, no villages (within 50m) and schools (within lOOm) or other sensitive locations will
be built.
56. Noise
According to EIA of Shui-Nan Highway
(I) Residential areas in villages: The noise level at the residential centers in both short term (2006)
and long term (2024) operation in daytime is consistent with class-four standards except for a minor
places. No obvious impact on the acoustic environment has been found in daytime. At night, however,
the noise level exceeds to some extent. In short-term, 4 places are in excess by 5dB with the greatest
being 7.0 dB; in medium-term, 13 places will be in excess by 5 dB with the greatest being 9.5 dB; in
year 2024, 14 places will be in excess by 5dB with the greatest being 10.4 dB. We know from Table 4-
4-4 that the noise will disturb the residents with sleep.
(2) Schools and hospitals: In operation phase in daytime, the traffic noise will have some impact on
teaching in the schools at Lintang, Daxing, Keyang, Baishe, Linjiang, Gucai and Qide, and Duan
Hospital. Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate preventive measures be taken at these places.
Yongning primary school is seriously beyond the standards, reaching 15dB in year 2006, mainly from
the Nan-Wu class-two highway. At present time, it is under large impact on its teaching sulToundings.
Some prevention measures must be taken.
24



Although the noise level exceeds the standards at night, it does not interfere withi the teaching
because there are not teaching activities at that time.
Follows were/will be down to decrease the noise:
(1) No Homing Marks will be posted at the sections near schools.
(2) At accesses of road, noise   monitoring stations will be installed, and the vehicles with loud
noise will not be allowed to run on the road.
(3) Noise barriers or other appropriate noise prevention measures will be taken at locations where
noise cxcceds the standard, based on the rcsult of monitoring.
(4) With the necessary prevention measures, the excess levels can be controlled below 5dB at
villages; below 2.0 dB at schools in daytime.
57. Vehicular Management
(I) Better vehicle maintenance/management will be enhanced to keep vehicles in good conditions.
Vehicle noise and emission inspection will be strengthened. If a vehicle does not comply with the noise
and/or emission standards, the vehicle wvill not be allowed to pass until the problem is rectified.
Periodical and random exhaust gas emissions inspection will be undertaken.
(2) Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize people with the problem of air
pollution and noise from vehicles and with related regulations.
In case of foggy weather, the speed of vehicles will be controlled, and no transportation of
hazardous materials will be allowed.
Drivers will not bc allowed to drivc whien drunk, tired, or overtake by breaking rules.
58. Risk of spills of hazardous goods
(I) Sewage treatment facilities will be set up at the service centers. The sewage will not be
discharged unless is disposed of properly. For it, secondary biological treatment procedures are
suggested.
(2) Different kinds of leakage and material spill will be avoided to prevent water bodies from
being polluted.
(3) Public Security Departments will be informed about the transportation of hazardous materials,
and they can be transported only with their approval, especially at the section of water protection of
Chengliang River, i.e. K163 - K 171.
(4) At section K163 -  Kt41, five settlement tanks will be dug to catch the runoff from the road
sides to alleviate the impact on water quality.
(5) In case of foggy weather, the speed of vehicles will be controlled, and no transportation of
hazardous materials will be allowed.
(6) Driving will not be allowed when drunk, tired, or overtaken.
59.Aesthetics and Plantation
(I) The school and villagc areas will bc trccd and sodden to create scenic belts.
(2) Highway management areas will also be treed and sodded to make the environment more
beautiful.
60. I'rafTic safety of linking roads
When in operation, there will be more traffic accidents because of increased traffic volume,
25



speedy driving while with no dividing facilities. So, there will be some safety problems, the solution to
which is to install dividing facilities. Publicizing the route people and marking at villages and
accidental spots are favorable for less trafric accidents.
111. Potential Impact and Mitigation for HNIP Road Project
An EAP has been made out for HNIP Road project. All the available measures in the main route
of Shuiren-Nanning Highway are adoptable in HNIIP Road Project, such as scenery protection, traffic
safety and ecological protection etc. All the following are some specific measures for HNIP Road. The
key elements of the EAP for HNIP Road summarized in Annex 1-2.
61. In Design Phase
(1) If the project has earth borrowing and discarding, it is necessary to ascertain the source sites of
earth, disposal sites of wastes and earth.  Farmiand can not be used, and the project can not cause
adverse effects on rivers, ditches and reservoirs. It is not allowed to destroy riverbeds and scenery spots
during sand dredging and stone mining.
(2) If treciching system of road sides have to be occupied by the project, subgrade and trenching
system must bc rc-designcd, and it is also reqLUired to avoid dischargc of oily sewagc to fairmiand and
drinking water.
(3)Project afforestation should be included in project general planning, for which necessary funds
shall be placed to guarantee the timely implementation after the project completion. The most
important places to be afforestated are schools, sections of road near residential areas, slopes where the
vegetation are destroyed, temporary land use, borrow pit and waste area etc.
(4)lf the newly-designed slopes are big, necessary technical measures must be taken to stabilize
the slopes to prevent water erosion and add to the beauty of the highway. Upon completion of the
project, it is required to construct protection slope, shoulder, ditches and other places, which have been
damaged by the construction. All these places shall be recovered with vegetation to prevent water
erosion.
(5)This project belongs to road rehabilitation and improvement project. Due to historical reasons,
there are a lot of schools, hospitals and villages, during project design and construction, it is important
to avoid or reduce the environmental impacts on these places during construction. In the stage of design,
it is required to choose the sites which are possibly far away from these places for materials stacking,
concrete and asphalt mixing etc. Materials transportation shall be equipped with dust-proof facilities
and try to detour to avoid pollution. These facilities include water sprayer, low-noise equipment etc.
Equipment of high noise shall be adequately treated to avoid noise pollution such as by using sound
arresters.
(6)According to the result of project environmental impact assessment, necessary preventive
mneasures against noise and water pollution are required during project design.
(7)Earthwork construction shalI avoid being done (luring storm scason so to reduce
watcr crosion.

62. In Construction Phase
(1) Noise
The existing road are always streetilized, which means there are many shops and houses on both
sides of road approaching some towns and villages. The innovation of roads will widen and level the
prcvious roadbcd. Somc largc maclincrics are not nccessarily used, except the noise sources from
spreader, roller and some other traffics. In construction phase, the work and life (especially sleeping at
night) near the road are influenced as the instant noise values can exceed the criteria (70dB(A) in
daytime; 55dB (A) at night). The construction and its noise will impact on schools (noise values exceed
60dB for the roadside classrooms). The lucky thing is there are no pupil living in school, and no ill
impact on them. The completion of road, with its improvement of higher transport, noise will be lower.
In construction phase, the noise decrease can be realized by controlling of working time, that is,
there are no work between 2:00 at night to 6:00 of the next morning.
(2) Air Pollution
TSP presents the main pollutant for the surrounds in construction phase, spraying at the dusting
sections timely can control TSP to a minimum.
(3) Ecological Impact
In the projects, therc arc no land acquisition or only a little land taking and all the widening and
improvement occur mostly only on the original subgrades. Some roadslope vegetation are cut out at
some sections on original roadbeds, and some protective trees are cut down at some roadbed to be
widened. All the above actions are inevitable, and they all can be restored after the completion of
construction.
Dust exists only when stirring and material breaking as there is no other land taking, nor river
course or channel change. Water for irrigation is not necessarily needed for dusting, as it is rich in local
areas. There is slight impact from water. One thing must be noticed, that is, the project area is situated
under subtropical climate with much rainfall. If storm comes soil erosions at construction site occurs,
which will impact temporarily the roadside water bodies. A previous measure of prevention from
weather report is needed to decrease the damage.
At some fill sites, borrowing can choose at some waste hills, and the wastes (sewage) during
construction will be dealt with. The relevant sites must be built upwith retaining walls to free from
erosion in rainy days.
(4) Impact from Traffic Environment and Some Other Factors
To ensure the proper transportation on roads in construction phase, the work can be done first at
half side of the road, another side for traffic, which fits in with the: current situations in China. In
construction phase, the traffic block will be increasing than normal, only can it solved in operation
plhase.
Meanwhilc, the construction will bring some inconvenience to local people in their normal life. It
is temporary and acceptable.
27



63. In Operation Phase
(1) Traffic Noise and Air pollution
Afiler the improvement, the road condition will be in better condition in pavement widening, and
pressing as well as in better transport capability. The increase of traffics will worse the noise conditions
along the roads, especially at night to local people.
Before the year 2005 in operationi plhase, thcrc is not increase of traffic and the better road
conditions reduced mechanical noises. At that time, the traffic noise will be a little lower in comparison
with the later increase of traffics and of operating years. According to the EIA on some other class
two roads, when the day traffic volume reaches 15000 med. Vehicles, the exceeding distance (class-
four in daytime) is within 10m, within 40m for class-two. All the two distances exceeding criteria at
night are within 40m and 80m. The 2022 traffics on HNIP Roads are predicted by 4000-7000 med.
vehicles. It's long-term distances exceeding criteria for class-four atnd class-two in daytime are 8m and
35m respectively, 30m and 80in at night.
The people to be impacted are very limited, as there are mostly shiops on both sides of the roads.
Traffic noise will be much more serious to road side schools. The local govemments and some
certain management must take more available measures to decrease. Heightening enclosures for school
at some criteria-exceeding places are accepted. Refer to table 4-4.

By prediction in the operation terms (in 2005, 2015 and 2022) the exhaust gas will not impact the
air apparently. Under usual weather condition, the concentrations of CO and COx can reach the state
213



standards of class-two beyond 200m.
(3) Safety
At some sections, accidents possibly occur near villages and towns as traffic speed can increase on
the improved roads. Signs can be posted and publicizing can be commonly used for the reduction of
accidents.
E. ALTERNATIVES
Only Shui-Nan Highway is in discussion.
64. Under the general scheme, the alignment has three sectional alternatives namely Diaojiang
alternative, Duan-Wuming and Wuming-Nanning alternative. See Fig. 5-1 for their alignments.
Alternative of Diaojiang Section: The number of the villages, schools and towns exposed to traffic
noise and air pollution remains the same in both schemes. However, Scheme R takes less land and there
is less work amount and soil erosion. The local governments and pulblic are in favor of Scheme R.
Besides, environmentally it superior to the south alignment too. Ior this reason, Scheme R is
recommended in the Assessment just like in the Feasibility Study Report.
Alternative of Duan - Wuming Section: That the number of the villages and schools affected
by air and noise pollution in the straight scheme is less than that in Schemes B. Besides, the scheme
R is superior to Scheme B in the following aspects: the length, land use, demolition and removal, work
amounit, soil erosion and trarnlc flow. For tihis rcason, the R alignment is recommended in the
Assessment just like in the Feasibility Study Report.
Altemative section to Wuming-Nanning : That the C   line has smaller work amount and
shorter & mileage. Besides, the two schemes have almost the same environment factors and work
amount of removal. Therefore, it is suggested to decide in preliminary design phase through detailed
comparison of factors of engineering and economics.
Landscape Protection is a very important factor in selecting route. To minimize spots, volume and
areas of cutting limestone mountains, the dcsigners and experts have done follows in route design:
1) Different technical standard has been adopted according to the predicted amount of traffic and
actual topograpily.
2) According to the requirements of tcchnical standards, the best roule has been selected.
3) Fturther adjust the alignment location, to reduce the amount of cutting mountain.
By studying, the amount of earth/stone work is reduced by 6,'994,949m3 and the area of side
slopes is reduced by 502,911 m2 respectively, which is certainly beneficial to environmental protection.
4)The recommended alignment schcmes have bcen chosen on the basis of layout of the alignment
in plan and elevation, excavation, amount of work involved, land to be acquisitioned, houses to be
demolished and people to be resettled and environmental impact.

In the preliminary design, elaboration has made and the amount of earth/stone work in relation
tolimestone  mountains has been reduced by 9%, the areas of side slopes by 8%, and thus  the
number of cutting sites by 7 to 61, compared with those in the   feasibility study. Further efforts will
be made in the detail design to further lessen the impacts on the landscape of limestone mountains.
When the recommended scheme is chosen, the design unit take all factors as excavation amount,
noise etc into consideration before their optimizing the recommended route. 24 schools along the line
have been reduced to l1, 68 large excavations to 61 and less cutting slopes. The impact reduces more.
F. INVESTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL F'ROJECTION
65. Based on the measures suggested in EIA, the total estimated cost for the project of Shuirei-
Nanning Highway is 38.7994 million RMB yuan, including 27,9994 RMB yuan of the nonrecurring
cost on the environmental protection, and 0.54 million yuan of 20 years operation cost.
66.The total EP investment for HNIP Road project amounts to 6.631 million RMB yuan.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND AONITORING
a. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
67. During the construction and operation phases of Guangxi Highway Project, environmental
monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the environment, identify unexpected
environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust environmental protection measures as appropriate.
T'he Guangxi envionment monitoring station unit will be responsiblc for environmental monitoring in
construction and operation phases.
68. The major items to be monitored in construction phase will include air quality, noise, and
water quality. These items will be monitored in the operation as well. In addition, sewage discharge at
survice areas, toll stations and administrative areas will be monitored. T'he detailed monitoring plan is
presented below.
69. Air Quality
During the construction phase, TSP will be monitored at lime & earth mixing sites & unpaved
construction road. It will be monitored once two-months, four times a day.
During the operation phase, TSP, NOx and CO will be monitored two times a year for five
consecutive days each time, with 4 monitoring spots locating in sensitive areas as schools & hospitals.
70. Noise
During thc conistructioni phase, Noise monitoring will be carried out twice a month at sensitive
31



sites such as schools and hospitals, and one day a time, i,e. two times of sampling in daytime and night.
During the operation phase, noise will be monitored four times a year, one day each time, i,e. two
times of sampling in daytime and night.
71. Water quality
Dluring the constrictionl andl operation phiasc, water quali(y will bc mnonitored involvinig thc 5
rivcrs and rescrviors in Shui-Nan Higlhway, COD, SS and oil will detected two times a year, one day
each time.
72. Waste water from the survices, toll stations and administrative areas will be monitored two
times a year.
73. An annual monitoring report would be furnished to the Bank by January 31 of each year
starting in 2001 during the construction phase and each of the first three years following completion of
construction.
b. Institutional Arrangements
74. During the construction and operation phases, the following institutional arrangements will
undertake responsibilities of environmental protection of Guangxi Higlhway Project.
The Guangxi Communications Division (GCD) is responsible for the EP management. Its
responsibilities are to coordinate the EP management between executive departments and employers;
instruct employers to implement the managerial measures. The divisions are: The EP department under
the agency of the PMO under GCD is responsible for the EP plans and environmental management in
the design phase. The PMO is responsible for the implementation and management of the EAP in the
construction phase for Shuiren-Nanning Highway and the Guangxi Expressway Administrative Bureau
(GEAB) is responsible for the EAP in the operation phase. The Guangxi Highway Bureau (GCB) is
responsible for the implementation and managemient of the EAP in the construction phase and the
operation phase for HNIP Roads.
See Fig. 7-1 for the surveillance that will be conducted by stage.
(a)Design phase: the EP unit of PMO (2 persons).
(b)During the construction phase, the two supervisors from the PMO will be responsible for the
supervision of the implementation of EP measures in EAP and tenderilg documents.
(c) Upon completion of the project, specialized people will be assigned to take responsibilities of
EP in their areas in the following cities and counties: Hechi, Duan, Mashan, Wuming, Nanning and
others with HNIP Road.

involved in environmental protection so thal they can acquire the knowledge of environmental
protection and ensure the fulfillment of tihC EAP.
According to their responsibilities, the trainees fall into the following three groups:
Administrative personnel, Environmental supervisors, and Working staff.
The training is to be carried out both at home and abroad. Those to be trained abroad will learn the
new methods, techniques and management experience from the advanced countries and to introduce
them to all the personnel in charge of environmental protection. Those to be trained at home (in
Nanning City) include administrative personnel and working staff, with the training seminars sponsored
by the Project Office, and lectures given by the senior staff from the World Bank, government officials
and experts.
The training of 9 high-level administrative personnel will cost 450,000RMByuan, with
50,OOORMByuan for each; The training of 18 working staff will cost 270,000RMByuan, with
I5,000RMByuan for each; The training of 12 environmental supervisors will cost 240,OOORMByuan,
with 20,000RMByuan for each; The cost totals 960,000RMByuan.
H.  PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
76. Th1e EA panel from Xian Highiway University conducted three times social and public
involvemncit irnvestigation in the study areas taking in Hechi City, Mashan County, Duan County,
Wuming County and Nanning City. Hearings into the comments from the masses, the Council
representatives, governments and enterprises along the alignment were convened.  Questionnaire
forms were handed out to collect the opinions of masses (see Table 8-1). They also consulted the
following departments: agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and communications about
environmental protection. In September 1998, secondary investigation was conducted to collect more
opinions of the masses and governments.
77. The public participation and investigation show that all the governments, Council
representatives, enterprises and masses concerned expressed their wishes that the highiway will be put
into use as soon as possible. In resettlemcnt, 87% of the household wish to be resettled in the same
village. Those who wish to remove to other villages also expressed their opinions to obey the state
interests.
78. Some comrades in Guangxi provincial Environment Institute took part in the public
involvement and investigation for the 11 Roads. The results show that the local governments and local
people are greatly enthusiastic in the road construction and will constantly support all relevant work
around the construction.

I  CONCLUSION
I . Shuiren-Nanning Highway
79. Assessment Results of Existing Environment
(1) The soil and crops along the alignment are fairly good not affected by the Pb.
(2) The environmental noise at the schools and villages comply with relevant standards ir. GB
3096-93.
(3) The water quality in the rivers and reservoirs complies with class   two standards except
Diaojiang River in which COD exceeds class   three standards.
(4) The air along the alignment is quite good meeting class   two standards in GB 3095-1996 at
all eight monitoring spots.
80. Prediction Analysis Conclusion of impact on Environment
a) Phases of Design and Construction
(I) The impact in the construction phase is decrease of farmland, damage to vegetation and soil
crosion. These impacts could be alleviated by use of rational selection of alignment, plantation of trees,
building catch ditches, protcction slopes or earth settlement tanks.
35



(2) T he construction will not havc itilpact on watcr environimcnt by strcigthlicning managemcent
and adopting advanced techiniques in bridgc construction.
(3) The noise and dust during construction do have some effect on environment. However, the
effect can be mitigated by means of reasonable construction time and location to reduce impact on
school teaching and other sensitive locations.
(4) No rare plant and animal species occur in the study areas, so there is no impact on them.
(5) No important cultural relics have been found along the alignment within the assessment scope.
(6) The alignment is in favor of masses and governments along the route.
(7) The recommended scheme is superior to the alternatives in many respects as environmental
impact, land use, public opinions and urban development. The comparison among the highway to be or
not to be construction shows the superiority of construction for local economy, traffic safety,
environmental protection etc.
(8) In construction phase, the existing roads will be affected severely. But this effect could be
mitigated by construction section by section and control of the traffic.
(9) The Hechi-Duan section is mountainous, that is, large excavation can not be avoidable. A
detailed survey has been made to reduce largely the excavation amounts and areas. Also, some
plantation design will work in order to minimum the impact on local scenery and soil erosion.
b) Operation Phase
(1) The impact on ecosystein in construction phase is resulted from dust and emitted lead by
vehicics. Ilowevcr. thlc dust hias very minor impact on crops due to the fact tilat there is plenty of
intensive rain that continues long. There is slight lead impact on the route areas.
(2) The runoff from pavement in the early stage of operation has minor impact on the water
quality except that it has some impact on the water in Chengjiang River (mainly risky accidents). The
sewage from tolling stations could be used as manure for farming after disposed of.
(3) The risk of spill of hazardous materials will not be neglected, especially at the section of
Chengjiang.
(4) In 2024 in operation phase, the standards at 47 places (35 villages, 10 schools and I hospital)
will be in excess. Noise preventive measurcs will be taken at those locations where noise exceeds the
standards.
(5) The exhaust gases will deteriorate the air iquality along the higlhway in operation phase, but the
extent will not exceed class-two standards in GB3095-1996.
(6) The traffic safety on connecting lines must be taken into account.
(7) The benefit/cost analysis shows that the implementation of the preventive measures will bring
about significant social environmental benefit.
II. HNIP Roads
81. Environment Assessment for Present
(1) Agricultural vegetation cover the most parts of local environment along the route. Original
forest remains a little except some distribution at hilly sites. Soil erosion present slight and medium
slight as well as some severe erosion at a few places.
(2) Hospitals and schools on both sides of roads within 30ni of dlistance are impacted apparently
36



by traffic noise almost approaching or excceding the standard values in GB3096-93.
(3) Ambient quality present good along the routes and the ambient quality at route schools and
hspitals fit in with the class-two standards in GB3095-1996.
82. Prediction Analysis Conclusion of Impact on Environment
a) In Construction Phase
All sections of various sub-projects belong to road improvement project. It is only required to
extend, strengthen and improve the existing road pavement without requirement of land requisition and
residents' resettlement. Therefore, the environmental impacts done by the project actions mainly
include the following aspects:
(I)Noises and dust of construction equipmcnt and transport vehicles will affect the acoustic and
air environment of the sections of various sub-projects to some extent. It is necessary to adopt
environmental measures such as suitable construction time, working site and sanitary protection
distances etc. to ensure the environmental quality of sensitive points inclusive of schools and hospitals
along the sections covered by various sub-projects.
(2)No rare animals and plants are found along the section of various sub-projects. The project
construction will not have obvious impact on rare animals and plants.
(3)The environmental ecological influence on vegetation and soils of the sections covered by these
sub-projects is not serious. It is only rcquired to take grade descending in some sections to form some
lilling-excavating slopes. In addition, due to removal of some vegetation on slope, it will cause certain
damage and water erosion in some sections. But such can be controlled through environmental
education during construction and adopting suitable preventive measures such as to re-plant the
vegetation immediately after construction.
(4)The existing road will be half-open and half-construction during construction period, this will
obviously affect the traffic flows. Such shall require mitigatory measures such as adopting sectionalized
construction and proper traffic leading.
b) Operating period
(l)During the operating period, with the increase of traffic flow every year, the noise level will
also increase. It is estimated that, as upto the operating period, the sensitive points nearby the highways
will received obvious traffic noises. Noise levels of some schools; and hospitals may exceed the
environmental standards. It is necessary to adopt noise preventive measures for these sensitive points of
relative higher estimated values if necessary.
(2)Vehicle offgas and dust will reduce the air quality of the section covered by the sub-projects
during the operating period. But this will not exceed the assessing standard during short-term period. -
(3)Environmental ecological impacts during operating period are mainly lead offgass and dust of
vehicle. But the quantity of dust retention on vegetation is limited due to adequate and relatively higher
frequency and strength of rainfall in the sections covered by various sub-projects. Rainfall has strong
washing capacity of the dust settled on surface of vegetation. So road dusting have less impact on
vegetation.

Annex 3:
Preventive Schemes Against Soil Erosion of Shuiren-Nanning Highway
A. Bases of Schemes and Objectives
(I) Laws & Regulations
e Water and Soil Conservation Act of the PRC;
e Implementation Rules of Water and Soil Conservation of the PRC;
* Management Methods on Water and Soil Conservation in Development Projects by the State
Planning Commission et al;
* Management Methods on Water and Soil Conservation by the Ministry of Water
Conservancy;
* Technical Specifications of Water and Soil Conservation by the Ministry of Hydro-power;
Circular on Carrying out Management Methods in Water and Soil Conservation Projects by
Guangxi Water Conservancy Division et al.
(2) Objectives
* To minimize damage to water and soil conservation facilitics, and to compensate for the
damage if any;
* To dispose of waste earth and stone in a proper way;
* To get rid of possible collapses, slides and subsides;
* To restore top soil and vegetation at the exposed areas resulted from cutting;
* To avoid soil erosion damage to other units or individuals;
* To put forward engineering measures against soil erosion.
B. Preventive Measures against Soil Erosion
(1) Preventive measures against soil erosion during excavation of subgrade in plain areas
When the excavation takes place where there is runoff, temporary earth settlement tanks will be dug.
'I'he settlement tank takes the shape of a pit of 0.5 m deep and 20-30 square meters area. When it
rains, the speed of the rainwater slows down in the tanks. As a result, mud and sand settled down. At
the outlet side, geotextile is used to catch mud and sand for one more: time. On completion of subgrade,
the tanks will be filled. Around earth dumps and at sections prone to soil erosion, geotextile will be
used to catch mud and sand. The structure of geotextile enclosure is: the width is 65 cm; a pillar of 5

(2) Schemes to dispose of waste earth and stone
There is cutting at heavy rolling areas, most waste earth at which will be used for filling. The
surplus waste earth will not be heaped at will or dumped onto flood-land. Instead, it will be stored up in
the waste earth sites. It can also be used for rehabilitation. In selecting and designing the waste earth
sites, the following will be considered:
* The sites will not be located upstream of villages and large public utilities, neither will they
be located downstream of dangerous areas of'collapses or slides;
48



* The height of the dump will not bc higher than thc adjacent grouind level;
* On either side of the highest dump, drain ditches will be dug;
* If the height is above 5m, there must be a terrace of 1.5-2.0m with every Sm increment, the
slope of which will not be greater than 1:1.0;
* To remove seepage, blind pipes will be installed. The diameter of the pipe will be 250 -
300mm buried with pebbles of 500mm depth.
* The surface of the waste sites will be planted with trees or grasses.
(3) Preventive works
Large scale of cutting, filling, excavation of mountains will lead to exposure of slopes resulting in
soil erosion, collapses or slides. The slopes at roadsides and newly cutting will be protected. In the
preliminary design, the concrete requirements have been suggested about preventive works:
a) Embankment of filling
To protect the slope of embankment of filling, wlhen the magnitude of the slope is less 8m, the
design cut slope is 1: 1.5; when the height is more than 8m, the cut slope is 1:1.5 at top part, 1:1.75 at
lower part. For embankment of stone filling, when thc magnitude is less than 20m, thc design cut is
1:1.3 at 8in; 1:1.5 below 8 m. When thc maginitude is more than 20m, 1:1.3 at 8m above. Below that
magnitude, the ratio varies every 12m. The slopes are in turn: 1:1.5, 1:1.75 and 1:1.2. A Im high
terrace is provided every two stages.
b) Sections of cutting
The construction in heavy rolling hilly areas, exposure of slopes of large areas is resulted from
ctitting and excavation. As a result, soil erosion, collapses and slides occur. Therefore, the exposed
slopes need to be protected. The work amount of protection is in table 3-1. For embankment slope
protection, see Table 3-2. When the height of slope in more than I Om, there is a terrace every 10 m the
width of whiicih is 2m or I in depending onl their geological conditions. On the terrace a rectangular
drain ditch of 40 x 40cm is dug.
c) Protection of embankment
According to the landform, geological conditions and properties of filling, the following measures
are proposed:
* Sodding for the slope less than 1.5m of earth;
* Diamond-shape frame protection for slopes between 1.5 - 5m. A square is provided 2m apart,
and in the square grass is planted.
* Arc frame protection for slopes of earth more than 5m in which grass is planted;
* Stone masonry slope for slopes exposed to flood or near outlets of bridges and culverts;
* Stone masonry toe for half-cutting half-filling embankment. The toe will not be higher than Sm,
and 7.5 mortar bond.
* Stone retaining walls for steeper natural slopes, the height of which will not be more than 20m.
(4) Drainage works
Rain seepage and artesian aquifer contributes to slope collapse and slides to great extent.
Therefore, at slopes of large cutting, drain ditchcs will be provided to cnsure that the runoff on both
sides is discharged more smoothly and faster. The following requirements will be met in designing of
drainage facilities.
a) The side ditches will be placed parallel to the road to remove the runoff of the pavement or
from upstream. The side ditches will be dug in the following way:
* The minimum longittidinal slope will bc above 0.5%;

* Subgrade slopes and cutting slopes of mountains will be sodded or grassed;
,The permanent waste sites will be compacted and covered with surface soil to restore vegetation;
I It is suggested to plant fast-growth trees like masson pine, acacia rachii, Chinese sweet gum,.
cypress, camphor tree, camplotheca acuminata and oriental white oak; grasses are ciliate desert-grass,
caloglossa, asparagus and yellow couchgrass etc.
C. Implementation Management of Schemes
(I) Institutional arrangement
Water and soil conservation programs will be in the charge of Guangxi Communications Division
and the highway construction commission agencies. Their responsibilities contain: construction
drawing design the contents and requirements of which will be specified in tending documents as
contracts; the facility quality and schedule will be monitored by experts; the acceptance staff will be
include experts from EP units and water conservation units. In operation phase, specialized staff will be
assigned by Guangxi High-class Highway Agency to take care of highway environmental protection
and water conservation works. Their work also include routine and maintenance work..
(2) Technical measures
* In inviting tenders, the traits, awareness of environmental protection and water conservation of
the workers will be taken into account;
* Qualified technicians water and soil conservation will be assigned for supervision;
* Fund will be set aside by both employer and contractor for training or monitoring of soil erosion
etc.
