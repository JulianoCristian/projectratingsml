F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project had two development objectives:

  - provide an effective transport link between the Borrower's land-locked provinces of
Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan and its southern coastal areas through Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region; and

  - strengthen the institutional capacity of Guangxi's highway sector agencies to enable
them to administer, regulate, manage and operate the sector with greater effectiveness
and efficiency.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Guangxi Highway Project (the Project) was identified in April 1998 at a time when
the surging demand for transport in China, particularly roads, was just beginning to be
realized. Passenger transport by road in 1980 constituted 32.0% of the total; by 1997 it
had gone to 55.3%. Freight transport showed a similar trend, doubling from 6.6% of the
total to 14.0% during the same period.

Studies undertaken by the Bank concluded that the country's road network capacity fell
short of demand, that deficiency in capacity had led to transportation bottlenecks that
restricted the development of the Chinese economy, and that the problem was due mainly
to inadequate investment, insufficient reforms and management and operational
weaknesses. These studies included (i) "China Highway Development and Management:
Issues, Options and Strategies" (February 1994), (ii) "China, Forward with One Spirit: A
Strategy for the Transport Sector" (March 1996), (iii) "Review of Highway Technical
Assistance" (December 1998), and (iv) "Issues Note for China Highway Strategy" (May
1999)

Inadequate capacity and poor accessibility had undermined the development of China's
interior provinces, resulting in economic disparity between rich coastal areas with access
to deep-water ports and poor landlocked provinces.

In the medium term, China's main transport concern was to ensure that its highway
system helped integrate the country's economy and facilitated the movement of goods
and services. The Ninth Five Year Plan (9FYP)(1996-2000) gave priority to the rapid
development of the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), the construction of
provincial and rural roads that fed into the NTHS, and policy and regulatory reform that
focused on the financing of highways. A measure of success was achieved; by 1998 some
7,500 km out of the planned 17,000 km of highways in Phase 1 of the NTHS had been
built, with another 4,000 km due for completion in 2000.

It was evident that the Project supported China's strategy to correct the imbalance in
economic development between her coastal areas and her interior provinces. It also met
the Bank's investment priority (CAS R98-107, May 28, 1998) of expanding China's
transport infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks that constrained economic growth and
affected the quality of life.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)


The Project had two development objectives (Schedule 2, Loan Agreement):




                                              1

    a) provide an effective transport link between the Borrower's land-locked provinces
    of Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan and its southern coastal areas through Guangxi
    Zhuang Autonomous Region; and

    b) strengthen the institutional capacity of Guangxi's highway sector agencies to
    enable them to administer, regulate, manage and operate the sector with greater
    effectiveness and efficiency.

Key indicators for monitoring performance (section A2, PAD) included:
    a) Reduced time for inter-provincial trips due to a more efficient highway system
        involving lower cost and shorten distance;
    b) More staff trained, formally and-on-the job, in technical and managerial skills, to
        respond to the needs of an expanded, high-grade highway network;
    c) An increased budget to rehabilitate and maintain provincial roads (other than the
        high-grade network); and
    d) Fewer traffic accidents, especially on the heavily traveled corridors.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The development objectives and key indicators remained unchanged throughout the
implementation of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,


The main beneficiaries of the Project were the provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan,
and Guangxi Autonomous Region; four of the country's poorest provinces. When the
Project was proposed in 1998, these provinces had a per capita GDP of $265, $476, $467
and $524 respectively with the national average income per capita at $733. Specifically in
Guangxi, the Project would directly benefit an estimated 4 million people living in the
towns and counties impacted by the development, 80% of whom were ethnic minorities,
and where per capita GDP ranged between $145 and $180, way below the national
average of $733.

Finally, the Project would also benefit the administration of Guangxi Communications
Department (GCD) and related agencies and entities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project had four parts (See Schedule 2, Loan Agreement)
Part A: Highway Capacity Expansion (total estimated cost $406.7 million)
Part A comprised constructing a 238 km Shuiren-Nanning Highway (SNH) in Guangxi
consisting of (a) the construction of about 97 km of Class 2 highway between Shuiren
and Duan and related interchanges; (b) the construction of about 141 km of expressway



                                              2

between Duan and Nanning and related interchanges; (c) the construction of toll stations,
service and parking areas, and administration and maintenance facilities; and (d) the
supply and installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical equipment for toll
collection, traffic monitoring, lighting and telecommunication.

Part B: Highway Network Improvement and Maintenance Program (total estimated cost
$64.7 million)
Carrying out a program of rehabilitation and maintenance of ten selected sections of
provincial roads totaling some 236 km.

Part C: Highway Safety Program (total estimated cost $2.9 million)
Carrying out a black spot improvement program in twelve selected locations in the
provincial highway network in Guangxi.

Part D: Institutional Development (total estimated cost $2.6 million)
Carrying out a program to build up the capacity of highway sector agencies and
institutions in Guangxi in areas of planning, design, construction supervision, operation
and maintenance, project management, and environmental and resettlement monitoring,
through the provision of training and equipment.

Carrying out studies on (a) the design of slopes on road embankments and environmental
protection and (b) highway construction and economic development in poor areas.

1.6 Revised Components

There was no revision of the Project's components. There were, however, changes within
each of the components as explained below in section 6.7.

1.7 Other significant changes

Several changes in the design and scope of work occurred during the implementation of
the Project. Early in the Project a supplemental and detailed geo-technical investigation
was undertaken along the entire alignment of SNH in order to improve substructure
design. This led to significant changes, resulting in over 676 contract variations
amounting to approximately $7.3 million.

Significant changes were also made in the contracts for building works and interchange
design. According to the original plan, building works consisted of the construction of 7
toll stations, 2 service areas, 3 parking areas and 3 administrative maintenance depots at
Mashan, Xijin and Sanan. During the detailed design stage, detailed site investigations
were made and, based on these investigations, the exact locations and arrangements for
the management/maintenance depots and service facilities were revised. An interchange
and toll station at Yilingyan, maintenance offices at Daxing and Duan and a monitoring
center at Sanan were added. The original design of having two interchanges at Xijin was


                                               3

also amended to combine them into one. The revisions in the building works led to an
estimated increase in cost from $7.6 million to $13.5 million. Due to the increase in the
scope of building works, contracts for their construction were revised from two to three
packages.

The original composition of roads in the Highway Network Improvement and
Maintenance Program (HNIMP) was also revised in the course of project implementation.
At the time of project appraisal (February 2000), ten roads totaling some 236 km were
selected based on criteria that included the pavement quality index (PQI), the degree of
congestion and the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR). Following a review in
February 2002, five of the roads were replaced by roads that were better qualified to meet
the selection criteria, two of the roads were combined into one, and one had its length for
improvement extended by 11 km. The net effect of the revision was to reduce the
estimated cost of HNIMP from $57.0 million to $48.6 million and the total length of
roads for improvement marginally from 236 km to 231 km.

An amount of $19.7 million was cancelled at the request of the Borrower on November
30, 2004.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


The construction of SNH was launched by the Guangxi Communications Department
(GCD) based on a pre-feasibility study completed in 1996.

Project preparation commenced with a pre-identification mission in September 1998
followed by an identification mission in November the same year. Due to the passage of
time, the pre-feasibility study was substantially revised with a fresh O-D survey
undertaken in October, 1998, to take into account recent growth in the economy and, as a
result, various development options were considered. Preliminary designs of works to be
undertaken were completed in March 1999 and were reviewed by foreign consultants
financed by the Japanese Trust Fund (PHRD).

The preparation and design of the Project took into account lessons learned from seven
completed and sixteen on-going highway projects in China. Past projects, in particular,
had revealed a tendency to compromise quality in order to shorten the construction
schedule; roads had been opened to traffic upon completion of civil works without
waiting for the installation of electrical and mechanical facilities, and that the Bank
imposed TA and required heavy foreign consultant input. To address these issues, the
Project Management Office (PMO) set up to manage the implementation of the Project
was staffed with a strong team of consultants (foreign and domestic) and local on-site
staff. In addition, TA studies included in the Project had direct application in project



                                               4

implementation and required minimum inputs from foreign consultants. Finally, the
Bank would provide more oversight through its field office.

The resettlement action plan (RAP) was prepared in accordance with the land
administration law of the country and the Bank's operational directives on involuntary
resettlement and indigenous people. Preparation of the plan included a detailed inventory
of assets, census of the affected population, review of socio-economic conditions on the
project areas and a study of impacts on poverty. The consultation process which produced
active feedback from the local and county governments and village leaders that helped to
finalize the resettlement plan was adequate.

Environmental assessment (EA) of the Project took cognizance of the country's laws
relating to environmental protection, pollution control and the protection of cultural relics.
In carrying out the EA, residents along the project routes were regularly consulted and
their opinions reflected in the project design and environmental mitigation measures. The
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the environmental action plan (EAP)
submitted in October 1999 were reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank.
Risks, mainly institutional (government commitment, accountability for use of internal
and external resources, external pressures, application of skills and familiarity with Bank
procurement guidelines) were identified and measures to mitigate these risks were
included in the Project design. Inherent was the risk that the highway might not be
utilized to the extent forecasted. To ensure, in part, that the proposed highway would be
effectively used, it was necessary that the condition of access roads connecting the
interchanges and intersections along the highway be improved. Agreement was reached
during project preparation to have the improvements completed by April 2004 when the
SNH was to be completed.

2.2 Implementation


The Project was implemented at a total cost of $556.8 million, a difference of 6.4% from
the estimated cost of $524.7 million (excluding interest during construction) due
principally to the appreciation of the Renminbi (RMB) relative to the dollar. Civil works
and resettlement cost more than originally estimated but the increase was offset by a
reduction in the cost of equipment. Loan disbursement was less than estimated due to
reduced costs in categories with higher disbursement percentages

The commencement of work was delayed by about a year due to processing in obtaining
approval from the State Council. This delay resulted in the implementation performance
being rated unsatisfactory in ISR Seq 3. However, notices to contractors to commence
construction were soon issued and the rating was upgraded to satisfactory in the
subsequent ISR. Once started, project implementation on the whole proceeded
satisfactorily. The Project was not at risk at any time. SNH, the major component of the
Project, was completed on schedule (second half of 2004) despite the late start of work.

Work on HNIMP started in 2002 with improvements to the Dahua-Mashan road. All
roads in the program were completed between July 2003 and August 2005, with the
exception of the Hengxian-Mashan road, which was completed in March 2007. Reasons
for the delay included poor management on the part of the contractor, a shortage of
crushed aggregates due to production and supply being poorly regulated by local
authorities, a protracted process for approving variations, and an extremely low price that
deterred the contractor from providing sufficient resources. The delay required an
extension of the loan closing date by a year from June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007.

Highway Safety Program: Under the program, 12 locations on existing roads were
identified for black-spot improvements. The Bank and GCD agreed on the exact
locations for improvements during Bank supervision missions in February and November
2001. The program was satisfactorily completed at a cost of US$2.26 million, less than
the US$ 2.58 million set aside for the program.

Institutional Strengthening: In September 2001 the institutional development component
to be financed by the loan was increased from two studies to four by the addition of a
study on stone-filled embankments and one on the treatment of unsuitable soil. GCD, on
its own initiative, launched several in-house training courses (not included in the project
budget) using internal resources and instructors. The foreign supervision consultants
(Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation --Australia) offered a course on contract
management and construction supervision. Outputs of the component exceeded
expectation (see Annex 4, Outputs by Component).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Project was monitored annually in accordance with key performance indicators.
The rate of progress in project implementation for each component was also measured
against planned targets of the amount of work to be completed for each year.

The choice of indicators was appropriate for measuring achievement of the Project's
objectives. However, only NR210 was earmarked for accident-rate monitoring and only
one section of NR 210 was in the Highway Safety Program. It would have been more
appropriate if target rates applicable to all roads in the program were included. In the
absence of such targets, accident rates at other roads were not monitored.

The construction quality of the Project, rated "excellent" by provincial authorities, was,
indeed, very good. SNH and the roads improved under HNIMP, upon completion, were
utilized more or less as forecasted although the diversion rate of traffic from the existing
highway, NR210, to the newly constructed SNH was lower than expected (see Annex 1,
Results Framework Analysis)




                                               6

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


Compliance with loan covenants was timely and satisfactory. Safeguard and fiduciary
compliance was good. Environmental monitoring during project implementation was in
accordance with the Environmental Action Plan.

Requirements for environmental monitoring were included in contract documents and, to
ensure their compliance, contractors were required to deposit cash amounting to 2% of
the contract value at the commencement of the contract, to be returned at the end of the
contract to the contractor upon the satisfactory performance in accordance with the
contract clauses related to environmental protection. This measure effectively assured
sound implementation of the environmental safeguards. Upon completion of the SNH in
September 2004, environmental monitoring was shifted from construction to operation.
Final acceptance of satisfactory compliance was certified at the end of 2005 by the
(national) Ministry of Communications' Environmental Protection Center.

A decree issued in 2000 resulted in land compensation rates for Guangxi being lower
than stipulated in the RAP (34% lower for paddy fields and 19% for dry land).
Following Bank intervention, GCD made up the compensation, mainly in kind, in the
form of village infrastructure (rural roads, power supply, irrigation and drainage canals,
primary schools, pavement of loose slopes behind homes, land filling of home plots, etc.)
after extensive consultation with the affected villagers. Follow-up surveys found that the
livelihood of affected villagers was not only restored but their income had increased an
average of 23% and the average size of the resettled home unit increased from 28.1 sqm.
to 83.5 sqm. A resettlement assessment undertaken by the external monitor concluded
that the resettlement and rehabilitation program was satisfactorily concluded.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Upon completion, the Class 2 section of SNH became the responsibility of the Guangxi
Highway Administration Bureau and the expressway section the responsibility of the
Guangxi Expressway Administration Bureau. A financially independent entity was
established in 2004 for purpose of operating the highway. This arrangement was in
accordance with the current practice of GCD and seemed to be working well.

Maintenance of the project roads is estimated to require about 1% of the provincial
annual budget. This is well within the means of the provincial government. The budget
allocation for maintenance has been increased annually by about 14% from an average of
RMB 10,490 per km to RMB 24,660 per km between 2000 and 2005. It would appear
that the policy change towards a more balanced allocation of financial resources between
new construction and maintenance of existing roads, an aim of the Project, has begun to
take root.




                                              7

Traffic on SNH during the first full year of operation (2005) was 83 % of the volume
forecasted at the time of appraisal. This was due to a slower rate of diversion from
NR210 than expected. Inclusive of traffic on NR210, however, the Shuiren-Nanning
corridor had an average daily traffic of 7,482 vehicles a day, an increase of 10% over the
forecasted volume (6,796 vehicles).

Environmental monitoring was to continue until after a full year of operation to ensure
adequate compliance with safeguard measures.

The sustainability of the Project is rated high. The project highway is an integral part of
the strategic international corridor linking the Pearl River Delta with the ASEAN
countries. Currently, Guangxi has a total of 1,459 km of expressways. With the
completion of SNH, highway development in Guangxi is being accelerated. By 2010,
Guangxi expects to have more than 3,000 km of expressways. Radiating from this
expressway network, accelerated construction of provincial roads connecting counties,
townships and villages in remote areas can be expected.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the Project were to provide an effective transport link between the
Borrower's land-locked provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan and its southern
coastal areas through Guangxi and to strengthen the institutional capacity of Guangxi's
highway sector agencies. The Project was designed to meet the former objective through
the construction of SNH and the latter through formal and on-the-job training and
technical studies that would provide inputs in the planning, design, construction and
operation of highways. The Project was also designed to increase the mobility of the poor
in remote areas of Guangxi by improving conditions of existing provincial roads through
increased budget allocation for maintenance and measures to increase road safety. The
objectives, design and implementation of the project are consistent with the Bank's
current assistance strategy for China of upgrading transport infrastructure to link inland
provinces to the coast so that transportation benefits accrue to the poor while also
improving network management and traffic safety. (See Country Partnership Strategy for
the People's Republic of China for the Period 2006-2010 dated May 23, 2006). The
Project would also meet China's main transport concern of ensuring that its highway
system help integrate the country's economy and facilitate the movement of goods and
services.
The Project was, and continues to be, highly relevant to the development needs of the
country in general and of Guangxi in particular.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Based on the performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation, the Project has
achieved its objectives. The construction of SNH has reduced travel time between
Shuiren and Nanning from more than 8 hours to about 3 hours. Guangxi's institutional
capacity to administer, regulate, manage, and operate the sector has been strengthened
with 6 studies that have direct application in the design, construction and operation of
highways, the provision of some 900 person-months of training, and a five-fold increase
in the budget for road maintenance. The Highway Safety Program appeared to have
achieved its objective. Traffic accidents at various sections of NR210 on the Shuiren-
Nanning corridor dropped dramatically to 1% to 5% of the pre-project rate. Tonnage of
goods transported to coastal provinces increased from about 700,000 tons in 1999 (year
of appraisal) to some 1.5 million tons in 2005.

3.3 Efficiency

The investment in the Project was cost effective. The economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) of the SNH was determined to be 22.5%; the net present value (NPV), at a
discount rate of 12%, at RMB 4,780 million. Comparable estimates in the PAD were
16.4% for the EIRR and RMB 1,246 million for the NPV. The EIRR (29.3%) and NPV
(RMB 680 million) for the HNIMP were also better than the PAD's estimates of 24.3%
and RMB 247 million.

Overall, the recalculated EIRR and NPV for the entire project were 22.9% and RMB
5,460 million, which were better than anticipated at appraisal (17.0% and RMB 1,493
million). This was due mainly to (a) no cost overrun of the total project cost, (b) the
higher traffic demand on the SNH corridor, and (c) no delay in opening of the main road.
Discounted net cash flow has a negative value due to a low income stream from toll
collection on the Class 2 section of the highway. However, the fiscal impact analysis of
the Project confirmed that GCD would have sufficient financial capacity to support
operating expenses, as well as to meet the financial obligations for the project roads.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project's outcome is rated satisfactory as a result of the relevance and favorable
achievement of the Project development objectives. Travel time between Shuiren and
Nanning has been reduced from an average of 8.7 hours to about 2.9 hours, thus
providing a more effective linkage of the interior provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and
Sichuan to the coast. Budget allocation for the maintenance of provincial roads in the past
5 years had increased at an average of 14% annually. Improved maintenance of the
highway network, especially in remote areas, would increase the mobility of the poor.
Traffic accident reduction on the NR210 was dramatic, demonstrating the success of the
Highway Safety Program.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

An estimated one million man-months of unskilled labor were generated during the four-
year construction period, contributing positively to the alleviation of poverty in the region.
Farmers who had been resettled to new areas had benefited from the cultivation of higher
valued crops and fruit trees. Average income in the affected counties increased 22.6%.
The average size of a home increased from 28.1 sq. m to 83,5 sqm. The livelihood of
people resettled due to land acquisition was better off than in the past.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Under the Project, more staff were trained and more technical assistance studies were
undertaken under the Project than planned. Technical assistance studies (for more details,
see Annex 4, Outputs by Component) were relevant to current challenges faced by GCD
and its related agencies in the normal course of their work and, with the training provided
under the Project, would contribute to the long term capacity building particularly in
relation to highway engineering, construction supervision, contract management,
resettlement, environmental monitoring and highway management, maintenance and
administration.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no unintended outcomes or impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted in the Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low or Negligible

The risk to development outcome is low or negligible. SNH is part of the NTHS,
effectively linking the interior provinces of southwest China to the deep water ports of
Zhangjiang, Beihai and Fancheng. Capacity building in GCD has been enhanced and
more funds are being allocated for road maintenance Traffic on SNH in the first year of
full operation has been lower than forecasted due to the slower than expected rate of
diversion of traffic from NR210. An accelerated rate of diversion of traffic from NR210
to SNH can be expected, as there is a clear advantage, in terms of travel time, in using
SNH (less than 3 hours) over that of NR210 (more than 8 hours).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The design of the
Project was highly relevant to the development needs of the country in general and of
Guangxi in particular

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory. Field supervision missions focused on
the timely completion of work and their impact on the achievement of the Project's
development objectives and were regularly mounted twice a year. Issues that emerged
during implementation were attended to efficiently and promptly. Compliance with
safeguard and fiduciary policies was monitored closely.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, Bank performance is rated satisfactory taking into account its performance in
ensuring quality at entry and the consistency and quality of its supervision throughout the
implementation of the Project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Government performance was satisfactory. The Ministry of Communications, directing
the Project at the central level, closely supervised project co-ordination during the first
year of project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Implementing
Agency                Performance

                      GCD created a Project Management Office (PMO) to manage the
Guangxi               preparation and execution of the Project. GCD/PMO's performance in
Communications        preparing, designing and implementing the Project was generally
Department            satisfactory. The Project was completed efficiently at the
                      cost estimated. The EIRR of the Project at 23% was more than the


                                              11

                     return of 17% estimated at the time of appraisal.

                     Some delays in project implementation could have been avoided or
                     minimized if consultants undertaking the design of SNH had not erred
                     in their initial construction drawings. Conceivably if site
                     investigations in the first instance had been more comprehensive and
                     design drawings examined more rigorously the errors might not have
                     arisen. HNIMP and HSP could also have been completed earlier if
                     preparatory works on the two programs had commenced in earnest
                     earlier. The later than expected completion of HNIMP could be
                     attributed to the time taken in completing the EIAs for the replacement
                     roads, but no justification could be offered for the late commencement
                     of HSP. Procurement of the electrical and mechanical equipment
                     went through a protracted process before bid documents were
                     formalized, although in the end the equipment was installed in time for
                     the opening of SNH. Better management of the bidding process would
                     have avoided the delay.

                     Co-operation between the implementing agency and the Bank was
                     good. GCD/PMO discharged their fiduciary responsibilities
                     conscientiously and professionally. Compliance with the Bank's
                     requirements and loan covenants was timely and highly satisfactory.

                     The loan closed 12 months later than scheduled due to the delay in
                     completing the upgrading of the Hengxian-Mashan road.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the Borrower's performance may be considered satisfactory based on its
performance in the preparation, design, implementation and post-completion operation of
the SNH and other project roads.

6. Lessons Learned

Site investigations should be comprehensive and detailed to minimize inconsistencies
between construction drawings and field conditions. Contract variations would have
been minimized if designs and technical specifications had been subjected to closer and
more rigorous examination and review.

Planning and design of interchanges and administrative and maintenance facilities
warranted careful consideration before contracts were awarded. It was found, for
example, that administrative facilities were inadequate and incorrectly located and two
interchanges were provided for Xijin when only one was needed. The additional works
resulted in a revision in contract packaging and some attendant delay in the



                                                12

commencement of work. Fortunately the delay did not impact on the commencement of
operation of SNH.

Close supervision by the supervising consultants focused on carefully selected sites in the
field paid dividends in terms of ensuring quality and timely completion of work. The
cash deposit of 2% of contract sum required of contractors ensured that environmental
safeguard measures contained in civil works contracts would be carefully executed.
Technical studies providing assistance and solutions to specific problems encountered in
project implementation were well received and appreciated by the implementing entity.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower commented that consideration should be given to the rejection of bids
where unit rates had not been correctly priced. The Bank's procurement guidelines on
the examination of bids are explicit that unless a bid is substantially unresponsive to the
bidding documents, it should not be excluded from further consideration. It would seem
that where an examination of a bid reveals an inconsistency in the pricing of the unit rates,
which by itself is not a material deviation from the terms, conditions and specifications in
the bidding documents, the bidder should be called upon to clarify the inconsistency.

(b) Cofinanciers

There are no cofinanciers on this project

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

There are no other partners on the project. Comments were not received from other stake holders.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic evaluation is composed of two major components: (a) the Shuiren -
Nanning Highway (SNH), including the Class II road between Shuiren- Duan and the
expressway between Duan ­ Nanning, and (b) the 10 local roads under the Highway
Network Improvement and Maintenance program (HNIMP). An economic evaluation for
the whole project covering all the components is also undertaken in this exercise. Both
costs and benefits in the analysis reflect December 2005 prices.

The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of SNH is estimated at 22.5%; the net
present value (NPV), at a discount rate of 12%, is estimated at RMB 4,780 million,
compared to the PAD estimate of 16.4% in EIRR and RMB 1,246 million for the NPV.

The reevaluated EIRR and NPV of the roads under HNIMP is estimated at 29.3% and
RMB 680 million, respectively, compared to 24.3% and RMB 247 million estimated by
the PAD. The reevaluated EIRR and NPV for the HNIMP were also better than the
PAD's forecast.

The recalculated EIRR and NPV for the entire project are estimated to be 22.9% and
RMB 5,460 million respectively, which are better than anticipated at appraisal (17.0%
and RMB 1,493 million), mainly because of (a) a very limited economic cost overrun
for the entire project (b) the higher traffic demand on the SNH corridor, and (c) no delay
in opening of the main road.

        The SNH opened to traffic in September 2004 and the traffic on the new and the
old roads in 2005 were 141% and 198%, respectively, of the PAD's estimates. The total
corridor traffic (the sum of traffic on the new and the old roads) in 2005 was 157% of the
PAD estimate at appraisal. For 2005, the road diversion ratio (the portion of the road
users using the new road) was 65%. A higher diversion ratio for 2006 was expected.
This would indicate that road users were gradually accepting the toll road concept. The
traffic growth rates of the corridor and the new road for 2006 are expected to be about
8.1% and 7.2%, respectively, higher than the PAD's estimates. In the long ­term (2006-
2025), traffic on the corridor was estimated to grow at 3.6%.

The traffic and distribution between the old and the new highways are presented in Table
5.1 below.

 Fiscal Impact of the SNH and HNIMP Investments

While on average the road networks during the period 2000 ­2005 increased 3% annually,
the average yearly maintenance expenditure increased 14%, resulting in a net increase in
average maintenance expenditure per kilometer from RMB 10,490 in 2000 to RMB
24,660 ($3,000) in 2005. The total annual maintenance required for the project roads is,
however, less than 1% of the annual budgeted maintenance expenditures for GCD in
2000- 2005. This low ratio indicates that the project presents a very modest financial risk
as regards the availability of counterpart funding for the future maintenance of the project
roads.

About 79% of the total project cost was financed in the form of borrowings (World Bank:
34% and the local banks: 45%). For the loan repayments, GCD budgeted sufficient
reserves to meet its financial obligations. In 2005, for example, the total loan repayment
of the project (principal and interest payments for foreign and domestic loans) is
estimated to be RMB 155 million, which constitutes only 6% of the total budgeted loan
repayment reserves of GCD in that year. Compared to the total revenue of GCD, the loan
repayments came to only 1.3%. This indicates that the loan repayment of the project will
not pose any problem on GCD's cash flow. All the financial indicators show that the
fiscal impact and risks are modest.

Project Background

The Shuiren to Nanning Highway (SNH), the primary component of the Guangxi
Highway Project, is a 2-lane Class 2 highway (96.56 km) from Shuiren to Duan and a 4-
lane access-controlled expressway from Duan to Nanning (141 km). Officially opened
on September 28, 2004, it has 9 large bridges, 12 minor bridges, 8 interchanges, 46 level
crossings, several connector roads (bituminous pavement) and 8 toll plazas. SNH
replaces the existing NR 210 in linking the relatively poor land-locked provinces of
Guizjou, Yunnan and Sichuan to the southern seaports of Beihai and Fancheng in
Guangxi and Zhangjiang in Guangdong.

The construction of SNH was conceptualized in 1998. Project preparation for Bank
financing started in March 1999. The Bank appraised the Project in November the same
year. The loan was negotiated in Washington DC in February 2000 and approved on
March 28, 2000.

Project implementation was managed by the Project Management Office (PMO) of
Guangxi Communications Department (GCD). PMO was established in August 1999.

Project Objective and Design

The primary objective of the Project was to provide a more efficient and cost effective
transport link between the land-locked provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan and
the southern coast areas through Guangxi and to strengthen the institutional capacity of
the highway sector agencies of Guangxi. The Project was also designed to improve the
conditions of several existing roads in the poorer rural counties as well as to reduce
traffic accidents on the provincial road network.

Project Components

With the above objective in mind, the Project was designed with the following
components:

    · Highway Capacity Expansion consisting of the construction of SNH;
    · Highway Network Improvement and Maintenance Program (HNIMP) consisting
        of a program to rehabilitate and improve the maintenance of selected sections of
        the provincial highway network;
    · Highway Safety Program (HSP) comprising remedial measures (black-spot
        improvements) in selected locations of the provincial highway network; and




                                             24

   · Institutional Development consisting of training programs in highway planning,
        design, construction supervision, operation and maintenance, environmental and
        resettlement monitoring and the carrying out of studies to provide technical
        assistance in soil treatment, design of slopes and embankments, the economics of
        highway development in poor areas.

Project Outputs

The outputs of the Project included i) the 238 km Shuiren-Nanning Highway constructed
as designed; ii) 10 provincial roads improved to the standards of Class 2 roads; iii) 12
black-spot improvements with a total length of 11,043 m; iv) 917 man-months of training
and v) 6 technical studies.

Project Outcomes

The outcome of the Project was favorable. It included, as expected,

   · a reduction in travel time on the Shuiren-Nanning corridor of some 5 hours;
   · an increasing volume of goods transported between the land-locked provinces and
        the coast as a result of the savings in transport cost;
   · significant improvements in the existing provincial road network;
   · a considerable reduction in traffic accidents; and
   · enhanced institutional capacity among GCD's transport entities.


Poor communities (mainly minorities) in Guangxi's mountainous counties benefited
through better access to markets, public services and places of employment. The Project
facilitated the increase in living standards of the local rural population.

Project Implementation

The Project was implemented satisfactorily and on schedule except for the Hengxian-
Mashan Road in HNIMP, whose completion was delayed by about 10 months to January
2007 due mainly to poor contract management on the part of the contractor and the
regulated supply of construction material by local authority. This delay caused an
extension of the Closing Date from June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007

Overall, the quality of work was rated "excellent" by provincial standards.

Highway Capacity Expansion: The construction of SNH was implemented through 10
civil works contracts for the roadway, 3 contracts for building works and one contract for
electrical and mechanical works. Due mainly to geo-technical difficulties, there were
some revisions in the scope of work for the roadway and the buildings that increased the
construction cost by about 28.5%. By end September 2004, all civil works contracts



                                              25

were substantially completed satisfactorily and SNH was opened to traffic on September
28. Revisions in the scope of work for buildings included a re-arrangement of the
management and maintenance depots and service facilities, the addition of an interchange
at Yilingyan, a maintenance office at Duan, a monitoring center at San'an and the
amalgamation of the two interchanges at Xijin into one. The works were executed
through three contracts instead of two as was originally planned. The cost of this sub-
component was increased from RMB 57.4 million to RMB 97.7 million.

Highway Network Improvement and Maintenance Program: The original composition of
roads in the program was determined during project appraisal. The Bank agreed to the
revision of the composition and it was revised before the commencement of work on the
program. This, however, did not delay the overall completion of the Project.

Highway Safety Program: The12 accident-prone locations for remedial improvements
were selected in discussions with the Bank task team during review missions in February
and November 2002. Three site offices were set up to manage the improvement works
that came to a total of US$ 2.26 million (US$ 2.90 million estimated at appraisal).
Improvements at 2 locations were completed in December 2004, the rest by end
December 2005.

Institutional Strengthening: The training program has successfully provided an added
dimension to the Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau and the Guangxi Expressway
Administration Bureau. The impact on institutional strengthening was positive,
particularly with regard to highway administration and management. Four studies funded
by the loan and two by domestic funds not only provided timely application of new
methodologies to the on-going construction and offered practical solutions to some of the
difficulties encountered in construction, but also provided valuable information that may
be adopted in future projects.

Environment Safeguards

The EIA and EAP prepared by Xian Highway Engineering Institute were approved in
November 1999. During project design, due consideration was given to environmental
issues related to alignment selection, crossing locations, bridge, culvert, slope protection
and landscaping. During construction, environmental monitoring was entrusted to
Guangxi Environmental Science and Research Institute.

Initially RMB 28.00 million was budgeted for implementation of environmental
safeguard measures. Actual cost amounted to RMB 79.32 million. The increase in cost
was largely due to changes in the requirements for highway landscaping and slope
protection.




                                             26

Measures to safeguard the environment were included in contract documents. To ensure
that these measures would be implemented properly, contractors were required to deposit
cash amounting to 2% of the contract sum which would be refunded upon the satisfactory
completion of work. This procedure worked very well and ensured a sound
implementation of environmental safeguards.

Environmental monitoring was conducted faithfully at required time intervals. Annual
Environmental Monitoring Reports were submitted to the Bank regularly.
Land Acquisition and Resettlement

PMO maintained close liaison with local authorities to coordinate land acquisition and
the relocation of public utility services. Sub-offices were set up at county level to manage
day-to-day operation. Total land acquired amounted to 23,748 mu; 150,93m sq. m of
buildings were demolished and the number of households and persons affected were 881
and 34,302 respectively. Total resettlement costs amounted to RMB 486 million.
Compensation was paid timely.

During implementation, a decree stipulating land compensation rates was passed that had
the effect of lowering the compensation rates provided in the RAP. This was not
acceptable to the Bank and following high-level discussions with MOF and MOC in
February 2002, GCD agreed to make up the shortfall in kind in the form of community
infrastructure improvements. In consultation with villagers concerned, 25 sites were
selected for the improvement works.

Eight External Resettlement Monitoring Reports and eight Internal Resettlement Reports
were timely furnished to the Bank during implementation in accordance with the Loan
Agreement. The final Resettlement Completion Report was accepted by the Bank in
August 2005.

Transition Arrangements and Operation

Upon the commencement of operation of SNH on September 28, 2004 responsibility for
the Class 2 section passed to GHAB's Hechi Highway Administration Bureau while that
for the expressway section passed to the GEAB's Nanning Expressway Administration
District. GHAB and GEAB are two among the ten divisions of GCD, a functional body
of the government of Guangxi Autonomous Region. At the end of 2004, Guangxi had a
total highway length of 59,704 km.

Sustainability

The Project is sustainable in view of the achievement of the Project's development
objective that is in conformity with national and regional transport plans and strategies.
Revenue generated from toll collection is sufficient to meet the cost of operating and


                                              27

maintaining the project highway. Budget allocation for road/highway maintenance had
been increased significantly in the last 2 years and will be further increased as more
highway lengths are added.

Government Plans

China is in the process of implementing the Great Western Development Strategy to
expedite the economic development of the western region. SNH is playing a significant
role in providing a needed ocean outlet for part of the western region as well as becoming
an integral part of the strategic international corridor linking the Pearl River Delta with
the ASEAN countries.

Performance of Bank

The World Bank provided assistance in areas of project design, technical concepts, and
issues related to environmental safeguard and resettlement during the preparation of the
Project. During appraisal, attention was focused on technical standards, alignment of the
highway, design of interchanges and linking roads and the staffing of the PMO. During
the implementation period, an average of two supervision missions a year was undertaken.
Overall, the Bank's performance throughout the preparation and implementation of the
Project has been satisfactory. Although there was a change of task manager during the
period of implementation, Bank's performance at supervising the Project was not
interrupted or affected. Bank staffs assigned to the Project were professionals with
positive and helpful attitudes. GCD/PMO maintained an amicable working relationship
with the Bank task team throughout the entire process.

Lesson learned

Contractors tended to include in their offers unit rates that were unbalanced-very high for
those items where they expected variations and very low for those items where variations
were not expected. Under such circumstances, awarding contract to the lowest evaluated
bidder, as required by the Bank's procurement guidelines, without considering the
reasonableness of the offered price in totality, might not be in the best interest of the
employer/client. It would be preferable if the employer has some flexibility to reject an
offer where it was obvious that unit rates were not reasonably priced.
