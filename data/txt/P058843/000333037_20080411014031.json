Some lessons learned included: site\n            investigations should be comprehensive and detailed to\n            minimize inconsistencies between construction drawings and\n            field conditions. Contract variations would have been\n            minimized if designs and technical specifications had been\n            subjected to closer and more rigorous examination and\n            review. Planning and design of interchanges and\n            administrative and maintenance facilities warranted careful\n            consideration before contracts were awarded. Close\n            supervision by the supervising consultants focused on\n            carefully selected sites in the field paid dividends in\n            terms of ensuring quality and timely completion of work. The\n            cash deposit of 2 percent of contract sum required of\n            contractors ensured that environmental safeguard measures\n            contained in civil works contracts will be carefully\n            executed.
