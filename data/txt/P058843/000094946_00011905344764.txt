PREFACE
Hechi(Shuiren)-Duan-Nanning Highway (called Shuiren-Nanning Highway) is the main section of
Chongqing-Zhanjing National Artery Highway, serving as an easy access to the sea ports. It is one of
the three main sections of "The National Artery Highway Configuration Planning" approved by the
state council. The total length of the proposed main highway is 237.588km, including 140.733km of
expressway, 97.182km of class-two highway. Five connecting lines with a total length of 25.6km under
Class-two are planned at 5 county town sites and a tourist resort. The total estimated cost is 4,117.2
million RMB yuan with inclusion of 1.660,billion RMB yuan of the World Bank Loan.
The EIA of Shuiren-Nanning Highway was compiled by Xian Highway University. In November,
1998, and it worked out the first edition of EIS. In early December, 1998, the Environmental Protection
Agency of the MOC held a pre-review meeting on the EIA in Nanning. Based on the new edition of
the "Project Feasibility Study Report of the Hechi(Shuiren)3DuanONanning Highway" of Dec. 1998,
the EIS was completed in January, 1999 (edition for review & approval). In May,1999, the second
edition was finished (revision).In September,1999, the final edition is achieved.
To obtain the environment protection targets put forward in the EIA and to control or mitigate the
adverse impacts due to the construction project, the environmental action plan of Shuiren-Nanning
Highway is compiled on the basis of the project features, the design documents concerned and
environrnent protection references of highway construction provided by the World Bank.

1 PROJECT INTRODUCTION
1. lGeneral Introduction
1. The Shuiren-Nanning Highway is one of the important parts of the national trunk-line Chongchen-
Zhanjang Highway, one of the three key highways in the "National Trunk Line Configuration Planning"
approved by the State Council. Therefore, it is essential to achieve the general planning target in the
general highway planning configuration of the state. The proposed project goes from north to south,
passing through Hechi, Duan, Mashan, Wuming, and it is destined at Nanning. The study areas are
peopled mainly by minority nationalities. Duan County and Mashan County through which the
proposed route will pass are ones of the poorest counties of both Guangxi provincial and country leve
which receive assistance. Although these counties are rich in natural resources, their economy is
backward mainly because of poorer traffic conditions. The construction of the highway will provide
these areas with a better infrastructure to help them to get rid of poverty and become rich.
For the geographical location of the alignment, refer to Fig. l -l .
2. The total length of the proposed road is 237.588 km. The whole route is divided into two sections
for which three different technical standards will be adopted considering the following factors: the
predicted traffic volume, the level of economical growth of the respective areas, the natural conditions,
construction capital and the state planning for the highway configuration. They are:
1) Section from Hechi(Shuiren) to Duan K96+000[1K194+300. The new construction mileage is
97.855 km with standards Class-two , including:
Section K96+0007K163+748 with a length of 66.155 km in hilly heavy rolling area; the
design driving speed is 60 km/h; and section K163+7480K194+300 with a length of 30.70 km
in plain light rolling area; the design driving speed is 80 km/h.
2) Section from Duan to Nanning K194+300E1K335+139. The new construction mileage is 140.733
km. Standards for this section will be expressway in plain light rolling areas; design speed is 100 krn/h.
The construction scale, major technical indices and work amount are shown in Table 1-1.
3. Connecting Line
There are 5 connecting lines, which can play a better role of the proposed highway in the economic
are planned at 5 county town sites and a tourist resort. The connecting lines will be built according to
class-two standards. The five lines comprise: Duan County Town line (1.5 km), Mashan County Town
Line (4.0km), Dahua County Town Line (16.0km), Wuning County Town Line (3.8km) and Yilingyan
Line (0.3km).

4. The project is planned to commence in May, 2000, completed and put into operation in May,
2004, the construction period being 4 years.
5. The total cost for the recommended plan of the proposed highway is estimated as 4,117.0172
*               million RMB yuan including 1,660.00 million RMB yuan(200 million) from the World Bank loan,
1,000.000 million RMB yuan appropriated by the MOC, some other self-raised by GCD and loan from
some internal banks.
1.2 Main Standards in EIA
1. For environmental impact assessment of acoustics, Environmental Noise Standards in Urban
3



Areas GB 3096-93 is adopted. For schools and hospitals along the route class-one is adopted, and for
villages and residential areas class-four is adopted.
2. For the EIA of ambient air, class-two standards in GB 3095-1996 are adopted. For emission of
atmospheric pollutants, class-two standards are adopted (GB 16290-1996);
3. For water environment, class-three standards are adopted in Surface Water Quality Standards GB
3838-88. For emission of domestic sewage, Water Quality Standards of Farm Irrigation GBB5084- 92
and class-one standards in Sewage Emission Standards GB 8978-1996 are adopted.
4. Class-2 standards in Soil Environmental Quality Standards GB 16518-1995 and Pb Limit
Sanitation Standards in Food GB 14935-94 are adopted.
1.3 Main Conclusions of the EIS
1.3.1 Assessment of Existing Environment
(1) The soil and crops along the alignment are fairly good not affected by the Pb.
(2) The environmental noise at the schools and villages comply with relevant standards in GB 3096-
93.
(3) The water quality in the rivers and reservoirs complies with classOZtwo standards except
Diaojiang River in which COD exceeds classOthree standards.
(4) The air along the alignment is quite good meeting classEltwo standards in GB 3095-1996 at all
eight monitoring spots.
1.3.2 Prediction Analysis Conclusion of Impact on Environment
1.3.2.1 Phases of Design and Construction
(1) The impact in the construction phase is decrease of farmnland, damage to vegetation and soil
erosion. These impacts could be alleviated by use of rational selection of alignment, plantation of trees,
building catch ditches, protection slopes or earth. settlement tanks.
(2) The construction will not have impact on water environment by strengthening management and
adopting advanced techniques in bridge construction.
(3) The noise and dust during construction do have some effect on environment. However, the effect
can be mitigated by means of reasonable construction time and location to reduce impact on school
teaching and other sensitive locations.
(4) No rare plant and animal species occur in the study areas, so there is no impact on them.
(5) No important cultural relics have been found along the alignment within the assessment scope.
(6) The alignment is in favor of masses and governments along the route.
(7) The recommended scheme is superior to the altematives in many respects as environmental
impact, land use, public opinions and urban development. The comparison among the highway to be or
not to be construction shows the superiority of construction   for local economy, traffic safety,
environmental protection etc.
(8) In construction phase, the existing roads will be affected severely. But this efTect could be
mitigated by construction section by section and control of the traffic.
(9) The Hechi-Duan section is mountainous, that is, large excavation can not be avoidable. A
detailed survey has been made to reduce largely the excavation amounts and areas. Also, some
plantation design will work in order to minimum the impact on local scenery and soil erosion.
1.3.2.2 Operation Phase
(1) The impact on ecosystem in construction phase is resulted from dust and emitted lead by
vehicles. However, the dust has very minor impact on crops due to the fact that there is plenty of
intensive rain that continues long. There is slight lead impact on the route areas.
(2) The runoff from pavement in the early stage of operation has minor impact on the water quality
except that it has some impact on the water in Chengjiang River (mainly risky accidents). The sewage
from tolling stations could be used as manure for farming after disposed of.
(3) The risk of spill of hazardous materials will not be neglected, especially at the section of
4



Chengiiang.
(4) In 2024 in operation phase, the standards at 47 places (35 villages, 10 schools and 1 hospital) will
be in excess. Noise preventive measures will be taken at those locations where noise exceeds the
standards.
(5) The exhaust gases will deteriorate the air quality along the highway in operation phase, but the
extent will not exceed class-ithvo standards in GB3095-1996.
(6) The traffic safety on connecting lines must be taken into account.
(7) The benefit/cost analysis shows that the implementation of the preventive measures will bring
about significant social environmental benefit.

impacts.
* Environmental Supervision Plan: supervision activities to ensure synchronous implementation of
mitigative measures together with the project cotistruction.
* Environmental Monitoring Plan: monitoring activities to eliminate pollution during both
construction & operation phases.

2 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACTIONS
2.1 Management Plan of EP for Project Feasibility Study Phase
The major EP task during the viability study phase is the EIA of the project.
The compilation of the EIA is undertaken by Xi'an Highway university. The EIA panel made the
field reconnaissance survey in detail. An EIA was compiled in January, 1999 as a result and its second
edition was completed in May, 1999, the final edition is achieved in September, 1999.
To implement the EP measures put forward in the EIA and prevent or mitigative the negative impacts
of the projects, the Environmental Action Plan has been worked out as a result of consultation with
designers, resettlement mission, and World Bank Project Agency of Guangxi Conmmunication Division.
In September, 1999, the final draft was completed.
2.2 Environmental Protection Actions for Design Phase
These measures have basically been deterrnined, and should be optimized as necessary in design
phase.
2.2.1 Route Selection
(1) The alignment wi]l be selected considering minimizing land acquisition, relocation and
resettlement, and impact of air pollution and noise on enviromnentally.
(2) The alignment will avoid cities, towns and other sensitive locations as much as possible.
(3) The alignment will be selected considering reducing cutting mountain to protect the resource
of landscapes.
2.2.2 Social Disruption
168 passes (average every 700m) and 24 grade separators will be constructed to facilitate the
crossings of the expressway by local people, animals and vehicles.
2.2.3 Soil Erosion and Land Resources
(1)Trees and grasses will be planted in the side slopes and other parts within the occupied slopes.
The slopes in the mountainous areas will be stabilized by various techniques including retaining and
protecting walls in order to avoid flooding of the slopes.
(2) Subgrade drainage system will be installed.
(3) 980 culverts will be constructed to retain the irrigation function.
2.2.4 Noise
A combination of measures such as resettlement, installation of noise barriers and afforestation will
be undertaken to mitigate the short and medium tern noise problems. Before the operation of the
highway, 13 villages and 2 schools (I school will be removed because the land is needed by Highway)
will be relocated and approximately 3450 m2 noise barriers will be built at sensitive locations.
In Table 2-1 are listed the villages exceeding the standards by more than 3 dB at night in 2014; in
Table 2-2, the schools exceeding the standards by more than 3 dB in 2024 in daytime are listed. Based
on the existing conditions of a particular place, the following measures are proposed to take:
(1) It is suggested that in construction the housing in the residential centers within 40 m from the
road center be demolished, considering the fact that the noise level at night in 2006 or 2014 exceeds the
standards by more than 5.0 dB. See Table 2-1. There is much less demolition in mountainous villages
because the houses are located sparsely. Besides, the slopes of Shuiren3Duan Secti6n is very steep, so
40m of land in width is used for embankment. Therefore, there will not be more removal due to impact
of traffic noise.
(2) In the villages where the level exceeds the standards by more than 4.0 dB in 2024, the noise
preventive measures and implementation time will be determined according to the monitoring level
behind 2014. See Table 2-1.
(3) Noise preventive measures will be taken at the schools where the excess is more than 3dB in
2024 in daytime. See Table 2-2.

2.2.5 Landscape Protection
(1) The detail alignment will be determined to minimize spots, volume and areas of cutting limestone
mountains. In the preliminary design, elabration has made and the amount of earth/stone work in
relation to limestone mountains has been reduced by 9%, the areas of side slopes by 8%, and thus the
number of cutting sites by 7 to 61, compared with those in the feasibility study. Further efforts will be
made in the detail design to further lessen the impacts on the landscape of limestone mountains.
(2) On all of cutting sites, appropriate mitigation measures including the restoration of vegetation will
be taken. All plantable cutting slopes will be covered with turf. Cutting at some low and steep slopes
will be a little expanded so as to turn the slopes gentle for grass plantation. A 50 cm-wide planting belt
on shoulders at some 10m and higher steep slopes will be designed to allow such grass as Boston Ivy
to grow on the slopes. The sections requiring large excavation along the highway and protecting
measures show in Table 2-3.
(3) Trial sections would be set up in an early stage of construction, where the environmental
mitigation measures against the cutting of limestone mountains addressed in the EA reports will be
examined in order to identify the most effective and practical measures.
2.2.6 Water Pollution
Sewage treatment facilities will be set up at the service areas and toll stations. Secondary biological
treatment is recommended.
2.2.7 Cultural Relics
Cultural relics survey was carried out and no important cultural relics were found out in the working
area of the project.

(1) Temporary settlement tanks will be dug at the locations where there is runoff in construction of
subgrade to catch mud and sand. The tank is usually 0.5 m deep, and the size depends on the area of
catchment. Geotextile will be provided at the outlet where necessary. These places will be rehabilitated
on completion of the work..
(2) Borrow earth will be planned, and it is required that borrow, leveling, rehabilitation and
plantation be implemented at the same time. In the plain areas, the borrow pits will be suggested to be
used as fishing pools. Before excavation the masses will be consulted about locations of borrow pits.
2.3.1.2 Land Protection
(1) Temporary land taking will be to the minimum.
(2) The road will be accepted together with works of plantation, slope protection and drain ditches.
(3) When land for temporary use is concerned, the top fermnented soil will be collected for
rehabilitation after the work is completed.
(4) No borrow will be allowed to excavate from farmland at will.
(5) Workers will be educated to protect animals and no poaching will be allowed.
2.3.1.3 Sewage and Wastes
Working wastes and sewage will be under gcod treatment in case of pollution.
2.3.2 Noise
(1) In order to reduce the time exposing loud noise, it is suggested that the workers operate
noise3producing machines on shift basis. Besides, the machinery will be maintained properly to keep
it in lowest noise level. The workers will wear earplugs and helmets.
(2) When the construction sites are 200mn within the residential areas, no noise producing
construction activities will be allowed between 22:00 - 6:00.
(3) Interfere with teaching activities will be minimized at the sections of schools by consultation
with schools in order to ensure the suitable time of high noise machinery working.
2.3.3 Air Pollution
(1) The storage site and mixing stations will located at least 300 m from residential areas on the
leeward side and haulage roads will be sprayed regularly to reduce dust.
(2) The construction sites also will be sprayed regularly, mainly on sunny days, twice a day in the
morning and in the afternoon.
2.3.4 Water Pollution
(1) Muddy water caused by mud excavation and material washing pollutes water. Cofferdams and
caissons will be used in bridge construction with the former applying to the construction in the river
with smaller flow and wider surface and the latter applying to the river larger flow.
(2) Waste water at worker' camp will be properly treated by septic tank, etc. and disposed of
(3) Oil leakage from machinery and ships or waste oil will not be discharged into the river. They
should be collected and recycled as appropriate.
(4) Asphalt, oil and chemicals will not be stocked at the places close to the water bodies, and they
will be covered with mufflers to avoid them running into the water bodies.
2.3.5 Traffic Management and Safety
(1) The proposed alignment goes parallel to the 210 National Highway and crossing it-several times
at Section Honglong - Duan, so it is very important to guide the traffic. It is suggested to construct the
road section after section. Wardens will be posted to guarantee smooth traffic and safety. Detours will
be built at crossings prior to the construction.
(2) Wardens will be posted at crossings, school sections and residential areas to ensure that they are
safe.
17



(3) The working time must be in schedule at some blasting sections. At blasting, no vehicles and
pedestrians are allowed to cross. The neighbouring villagers can be subsided for their temporarily
leaving at blasting.
(4) No crossing of pedestrians is allowed when building up bridges.
2.3.6 Cultural Relics
Construction works will be stopped immnediately if any cultural relics are discovered as a result of
road construction or excavation activities. The local cultural relics authorities will be informed.
Excavation will not be resumed unless the authorities approve of it.
2.3.7 Vibration Monitoring
When vibrationEproducing construction (compaction of piers or operation of vibrating rollers) is
carried out, the impact on neighboring adobe houses will be supervised. Reparative measures will be
taken if they are exposed to severe vibration or blasting and likely to suffer from damage.
2.3.8 Visual Resources
It is suggested to locate borrow sites at smaller hillsides. In excavation, it is better to cut off the
whole hill head to make use of. If it is impossible to make full use of, it is better to excavate at the
backside.  hen hills are used as borrow sites, empty holes can not be left but a slope so as to the
restoration of vegetations.
2.4 Environmental Protection Actions for Operation Phase
2.4.1 Zonal Planning on Either Side of the Road
The prediction of traffic noise reveals that in the long-term of operation (2024) the noise levels
within 100 m of the road are below class 4 of GB 3096- 93 (Standard levels on both sides of artery
road). Therefore, no villages (within 50m) and schools (within lOOm) or other sensitive locations will
be built.
2.4.2 Traffic Noise
(1) No Homing Marks will be posted at the sections near schools.
(2) At accesses of road, noiseDmonitoring stations will be installed, and the vehicles with loud noise
will not be allowed to run on the road.
(3) Noise barriers or other appropriate noise prevention measures will be taken at locations where
noise exceeds the standard, based on the result of monitoring.
(4) With the necessary prevention measures, the excess levels can be controlled below 5dB at
villages; below 2.0 dB at schools in daytime.
2.4.3 Air Pollution
(1) Afforestation by planting trees on both sides. The natural conditions along the alignment are
good for growth of trees, it is required that high trees and bushes should be planted where possible on
either side to absorb pollutants and beautify the environment.
(2) The vehicles on the road will be tested ad hoc in emitting pollutants. Those in great excess of
pollutants will not be allowed to run on the road.
2.4.4 Potential Risk of Water Pollution
(1) Sewage treatment facilities will be set up at the service centers. The sewage will not be
discharged unless is disposed of properly. For it, secondary biological treatment procedures are
suggested.
(2) Different kinds of leakage and material spill will be avoided to prevent water bodies from being
polluted.
(3) Public Security Departments will be informed about the transportation of hazardous materials,
and they can be transported only with their approval, especially at the section of water protection of
Chengjiang River, i.e. K163 - K171.
(4) At section K163 0 K141, five settlement tanks will be dug to catch the runoff from the
roadOsides to alleviate the impact on water quality.
(5) In case of foggy weather, the speed of vehicles will be controlled, and no transportation of
18



hazardous materials will be allowed.
(6) Driving will not be allowed when drunk, tired, or overtaken.
2.4.5 Aesthetics and Plantation
(1) The school and village areas will be treed and sodden to create scenic belts.
(2) Highway management areas will also be treed and sodded to make the environment more
beautiful.
2.4.6 Vehicle Management
(1) Better vehicle maintenance/management will be enhanced to keep vehicles in good conditions.
Vehicle noise and emission inspection will be strengthened. If a vehicle does not comply with the noise
and/or emission standards, the vehicle will not be allowed to pass until the problem is rectified.
Periodical and random exhaust gas emissions inspection will be undertaken.
(2) Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize people with the problem of air
pollution and noise from vehicles and with related regulations.

2.6 Environmental Training
The program is intended to train the administrative personnel, technicians and supervisors involved in
environmental protection so that they can acquire the knowledge of environmental protection and
ensure the fulfillment of the EPAP.
According to their responsibilities, the trainees fall into the following three groups.
I. Administrative personnel: they include high-level and middle-level administrative personnel,
who are to be trained to be able to handle issues and emergent situations in environmental
protection. There are altogether 9 persons, with 3 from the Project Office; 3, from DCG; 2, from
CPSDIG and the Research Institute; 1, from the extemal monitoring agency.
2. Environmental supervisors: They will be trained to have a sound knowledge of environmental
protection, control of environmental quality, management of expenses and techniques of
environmental protection engineering so as to ensure the fulfillment of the EPAP. All the
training seminars will be held at home. There are altogether 12 persons, with 1 from each
contracted section.
3. Working staff: There are altogether 18 persons, with 3 from each country; 3, from each
city/prefecture. They are to be trained to have a sound knowledge of the project and its
environmental protection issues so as to cooperate with the other authorities to ensure the
fulfillment of the project.
The training is to be carried out both at home and abroad. Those to be trained abroad will learn the
new methods, techniques and management experience from the advanced countries and to introduce
them to all the personnel in charge of environmental protection. Those to be trained at home (in
Nanning City) include administrative personnel and working staff, with the training seminars sponsored
by the Project Office, and lectures given by the senior staff from the World Bank, government officials
and experts.

4 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
4.1 Objective of Monitoring
During construction, the major impacts on environment are: domestic pollution resulted from
construction workers, water pollution from bridge pier construction, noise from construction machinery
or explosion, earth and stone excavation, soil erosion from pavement spreading and filling and asphalt
smoke etc. In operation phase, the major impacts come from noise, dust and waste gases caused by
high-speed vehicles. Besides, contingency accidents may also cause severe pollution. So it is required
that the dynamics of pollution should be known all the time through monitoring.
4.2 Surveillance Institutions
In both construction and operation phases, of the Environmental Monitoring Station in Guangxi will
be entrusted to take the responsibilities to monitor the environment since it is a qualified station in all
respects.
4.3 Implementation of Monitoring
The routine monitoring is conducted by the central station to comply with the requirements in Tables
4-1 ]4-3.
The monitoring will center on atmosphere, water quality and noise. The monitoring will be carried
out at fixed sites, in moving model.
In implementation of surveillance plan, such things as monitoring methods, objective or the training
will be determined through consultation with GCD and the monitors.

damage if any;
*To dispose of waste earth and stone in a proper way;
*To get rid of possible collapses, slides and subsides;
*To restore top soil and vegetation at the exposed areas resulted from cutting;
*To avoid soil erosion damage to other units or individuals;
*To put forward engineering measures against soil erosion.
B. Preventive Measures against Soil Erosion
(I) Preventive measures against soil erosion during excavation of subgrade in plain areas
When the excavation takes place where there is runoff, temporary earth settlement tanks will be dug.
The settlement tank takes the shape of a pit of 0.5 m deep and 20-30 square meters area. When it rains,
the speed of the rainwater slows down in the tanks. As a result, mud and sand settled down. At the
outlet side, geotextile is used to catch mud and sand for one more time. On completion of subgrade, the
tanks will be filled. Around earth dumps and at sections prone to soil erosion, geotextile will be used to
catch mud and sand. The structure of geotextile enclosure is: the width is 65 cm; a pillar of 5 cm in
diameter 3 meters apart is posted; textile is fixed onto the pillar which goes underground 30 cm. 15 cm
of textile is pressed with earth. The location needed settlement tank are following:
K96+500, K104+000, K109+850, K112+250, K132+050, K149+200, K150+530, K165+100, K168+460, K171+300, K174+600, K177+900,

K261+300, K264+800, K269+700, K273+550, K276+440, K286+250, K289+850, K294+540, K303+400, K316+500, K320+480, K325+300,
K329+000, K334+600.
(2) Schemes to dispose of waste earth and stone
There is cutting at heavy rolling areas, most waste earth at which will be used for filling. The surplus
waste earth will not be heaped at will or dumped onto flood-land. Instead, it will be stored up in the
waste earth sites. It can also be used for rehabilitation. In selecting and designing the waste earth sites,
the following will be considered:
'The sites will not be located upstream of villages and large public utilities, neither will they
be located downstream of dangerous areas of collapses or slides;
'The height of the dump will not be higher than the adjacent ground level;
'On either side of the highest dump, drain ditches will be dug;
'If the height is above 5m, there must be a terrace of 1.5-2.Om with every 5m increment, the
slope of which will not be greater than 1: 1.0;
'To remove seepage, blind pipes will be installed. The diameter of the pipe will be 250 -
300mm buried with pebbles of 500mm depth.
'The surface of the waste sites will be planted with trees or grasses.
(3) Preventive works
Large scale of cutting, filling, excavation of mountains will lead to exposure of slopes resulting in
soil erosion, collapses or slides. The slopes at roadsides and newly cutting will be protected. In the
preliminary design, the concrete requirements have been suggested about preventive Works:
a) Embankment of filling
To protect the slope of embankment of filling, when the magnitude of the slope is less 8m, the design
cut slope is 1: 1.5; when the height is more than Sm, the cut slope is 1:1.5 at top part, 1:1.75 at lower
35



part. For embankment of stone filling, when the magnitude is less than 20m, the design cut is 1:1.3 at
8m; 1:1.5 below 8 m. When the magnitude is more than 20m, 1:1.3 at 8m above. Below that
magnitude, the ratio varies every 12m. The slopes are in turn: 1:1.5, 1:1.75 and 1:1.2. A Im high terrace
is provided every two stages.
b) Sections of cutting
The construction in heavy rolling hilly areas, exposure of slopes of large areas is resulted from
cutting and excavation. As a result, soil erosion, collapses and slides occur. Therefore, the exposed
slopes need to be protected. The work amount of protection is in table 3-1. For enmbankment slope
protection, see Table 3-2. When the height of slope in more than 10m, there is a terrace every 10 m the
width of which is 2m or Im depending on their geological conditions. On the terrace a rectangular
drain ditch of 40 x 40cm is dug.
c) Protection of embankment
According to the landform, geological conditions and properties of filling, the following measures
are proposed:
-Sodding for the slope less than 1.5m of earthl;
Diamond-shape frame protection for slopes between 1.5 - Sm. A square is provided 2m apart, and
in the square grass is planted.
-Arc frame protection for slopes of earth more than 5m in which grass is planted;
,Stone masonry slope for slopes exposed to flood or near outlets of bridges and culveits;
-Stone masonry toe for half-cutting half-filling embankment. The toe will not be higher than Sm, and
7.5 mortar bond.
-Stone retaining walls for steeper natural slopes, the height of which will not be more than 20m.
(4) Drainage works
Rain seepage and artesian aquifer contributes to slope collapse and slides to great extent. Therefore,
at slopes of large cutting, drain ditches will be provided to ensure that the runoff on both sides is
discharged more smoothly and faster. The followving requirements will be met in designing of drainage
facilities.
a) The side ditches will be placed parallel to the road to remove the runoff of the pavement or from
upstream. The side ditches will be dug in the following way:
-The minimum longitudinal slope will be above 0.5%;

* Lining ditches will be dug at the sections vulnerable to erosion; at other sections earth ditches dug.
Lining side ditches will be dug;
*The cross sections will be rectangular or trapezoid, and the width and depth will be no less than
30cm. However, at the sections prone to be blocked, L-shaped cross sections will be fit.
b) Transverse drainage facilities
The transverse drainage facilities are used to remove the runoff from natural gullies or pavement.
The design requirements are as follows:
-The alignment will be placed in cross cut way with natural gullies and irrigation channels;
The drainage culverts and pipes will be orthogonal with the road. To prevent from eroding subgrade
or the lower part of slopes, the outlets of culverts will be provided with.drainage ditches to guide the
runoff to safe places. The longitudinal slope of the drainage will not be less than 3% and at the inlets,
catch facilities will be provided.
c) Restoration of vegetation
*High trees and bushes will be planted on either side within right-of-way, at crossings or in the
vicinity of residential areas(within 50m);
-Subgrade slopes and cutting slopes of mountains will be sodded or grassed;
-The permanent waste sites will be compacted and covered with surface soil to restore vegetation;
-It is suggested to plant fast-growth trees like masson pine, acacia rachii, Chinese sweet gum,
cypress, camphor tree, camplotheca acuminata and oriental white oak; grasses are ciliate desert-grass,
caloglossa, asparagus and yellow couchgrass etc.
C. Implementation Management of Schemes
(1) Institutional arrangement
Water and soil conservation programs will be in the charge of Guangxi Communications Division
and the highway construction commission agencies. Their responsibilities contain: construction
drawing design the contents and requirements of which will be specified in tending documents as
contracts; the facility quality and schedule will be monitored by experts; the acceptance staff will be
include experts from EP units and water conservation units. In operation phase, specialized staff will be
assigned by Guangxi High-class Highway Agency to take care of highway environmental protection
and water conservation works. Their work also include routine and maintenance work..
(2) Technical measures
-In inviting tenders, the traits, awareness of environmental protection and water conservation of the
workers will be taken into account;
-Qualified technicians water and soil conservation will be assigned for supervision;
-Fund will be set aside by both employer and contractor for training or monitoring of soil erosion etc.
