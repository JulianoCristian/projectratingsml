PREFACE
Shuiren-Duan-Nanning Highway (called Shui-Nan Highway) is the main section of Chongqing-
Zhanjing National Artery Highway, serving as an easy access to the seaports. It is one of the three main
sections of "The National Artery Highway Configuration Planning "approved by the state council. The
total length of the proposed highway is 237.588km, including 140.733km of expressway, 97.182km of
class-two highway. The total estimated cost is 4,117,000,000 RMB yuan with inclusion of
1,660,000,000 RMB yuan of the World Bank Loan.
In recent years, the regional economy in the study section grows rapidly and commodities in inland
provinces of Southwest are put into the world markets more and more through seaports. In addition, the
poorer regions in the northwest of Guangxi need to get rid of poverty and become rich. However, the
existing Shui-Nan Highway is operating well below an acceptable level of service for the above
mentioned purposes. Therefore, a new high class highway is urgently needed. Wuming, Mashan, Duan
and other counties require that the proposed highway pass through their territories to bring the
advantages of the fast efficient and comfortable high class highway into full play. The projected
highway will also promote the regional economy to overcome poverty and get better off.
In July 1993, Xian Highway University, entrusted by Guangxi Communication Division (GCD)
compiled the EIA of the project. In August and September 1996, the EIA panel made the first field
reconnaissance and survey and collected the data concemed, based on which the outline of EIA was
compiled. In June 1997, the assessment center of the State Environmental Protection Administration
(SEPA) evaluated the outline from technology perspective. Afterwards, a reply on the review of the
outline from the SEPA was received. In September 1998, the Identification Mission of the World Bank
offered technical guidance about the outline of EIA. In the same month, the panel made the second
survey and investigation. Late November, 1998, the panel of assessment, based on the comments of the
specialists of the Bank, introduced the outline of the EIS to the public along the study area, pointing out
the major potential impacts of the construction on the environment, and also had the hearings of the
public, and based on it the panel worked out the EIA.
Early December, 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency of the MOC held a prereview meeting
on the EIA in Nanning. In the end of December, 1998, the panel made an introduction to the EIA to the
public in the areas affected by the proposed project. As a result, the public concerned was informed of
the mitigative measures as well as the potential impacts resulting fiom the projected highway. After
collected the opinions from the masses again, and based on the co,mments of the specialists of the
prereview meeting and the new edition of the "Project Feasibility Study Report of the
HechiFJ(Shuiren)ODuanONanning Highway" of Dec. 1998, the panel of EIA completed the Statement
of EIA (Edition for Review & Approval)in January, 1999 to submit to the State Environmental
Protection Bureau and the World Bank for examination. In March and August, 1999, We have received
some good recommendations in contents from The World Bank EP experts before our new revision. We
have had generous help from various departments or local govemments for which we express our
genuine thanks.

CHAPTER 1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
1.1 Declaration and Preliminary Work
Shuiren3Nanning Highway is one of the three major sections of ChongqingiJZhanjiang Artery
Highway in the National Highway Configuration Planning approved by the State Council. The
Prefeasibility Study Report was compiled by the Guangxi Communication Planning & Design Institute
(GCPDI) in June 1996. n December 1996, the GCPDI and BCHBC compiled the Project Feasibility
Study Report.ln December, 1998, the Project Feasibility Study Repoit "was recompiled to comply with
the "New Specifications for Highway Construction Projects" issued by MOC and Document No
1368 1998 issued by SPC. In August and September 1996, the EIA panel made the first field
reconnaissance and survey, based on which the EIA outline was compiled. In June 1997, the SEPA gave
a reply on the review of the outline. In July 1997, Guangxi Environmnental Protection Bureau identified
the standards for the project. In September & November, 1998, the Identification Commission of The
World Bank offered technical guidance about the outline twice, and accordingly, the panel made an
extensive propaganda about the outline of the EIA and the EIA itself among the masses in the sensitive
areas for two times. The panel also introduced the potential impacts and mitigation measures to the
masses concemed,and conducted survey of public involvement. In March, 1999, The WB EP expert
showed some recommendations for the first draft. After their discusion with the El team, the new draft
was achieved in May, 1999. In August, 1999, the project was pre-estimated by WB and the
environmental measures for the large excavation sections have been made in helping of WB EP and
Eng. Experts. After those, the final draft is achieved in September, 1999.
1.2 Purpose of Assessment
Through the survey and investigation of existing situation of the physical environment, ecosystem
and social surroundings, the potential impacts of the projected highway will be analyzed quantitatively
and qualitatively for the purpose of the following aspects.
(1) Predicting and proving the impact scale and extent to provide basis for selecting the alignment;
(2) Providing viable protective measures and suggestions for design, construction and operation
management; to mitigate the impact resulted from the development;
(3) Providing scientific bases for the zonal development and environmental management.
1.3 Policy and Regulations
The EIA was compiled based on the following laws and regulations or documents conceming the
projected Shui[Nan Highway

1.5 Contents, Class and Objective of Assessment
1.5.1 Contents of Assessment
The impact matrix of the project is coming of the proposed highway engineering and local
environmental features, listed in Table 1-9.
Construction phase: machinery noise, construction dust and vibration, domestic sewage and garbage,
soil erosion, farming irrigation, vegetation, water conservancy facilities, safety, resettlement and
landscape.

Operation phase: vehicular exhaust gases, traffic noise, runoff, traffic safety and highway scenery.
Based on the engineering features, the environmental and social conditions, the following is
identified as the contents of assessment:
(I) Impact analysis of social surroundings; (2) Impact assessment: of ecological environment; (3)
Impact assessment of environmental noise; (4) Impact assessment of water enviromnent; (5)lmpact
assessment of ambient air; (6) Impact analysis of roadside landscape and tourism.
Among those, impact analysis of social surroundings, impact assessment of biological environment
and impact assessment ofenvironmental noise will be focused on.
1.5.2 Class of Assessment
The total length of the alignment is 237.915km. Originating at Shuiren, it is destined at Nanning. The
alignment goes close to the edge of Yungui Plateau, through the center of Guangxi Basin, mountainous
areas, hills and other topographical features. There villages and towns are with dense population.
Considering the important role the areas play and the complex geological conditions, the class of
assessment has been identified as Category A*.
1.5.3 Main Sensitive Spots of Environmental Impact (the main route)
The analysis on the sensitive contents can ensure the environnmental protection targets as the
following:
-Soil vegetation, soil and water conservation, land resources of Duari - Mashan Section;
-Noise pollution to schools, hospitals and residential areas;
-Water environment of rivers and reservoirs, Chengjiang River in particular;
-Scenery resources.
The major environmental locations are displayed in Tables 1-10, 1-11, 1-12. Other villages are
shown in Annex 1. There are 17 schools, I clinic, 100 villages (about 7,400 household with 36,000
people), 6 rivers and 3 reservoirs in the study scope along Shui ONan.
Note: * By the WB OP4.01Environmental Assessment Operational PFolicies ", Category A means the
proposed projects causing possibly some singificant adverse environmental impact.

1.6 Phases of Assessment
The Shui7Nan Highway is proposed to comnmence in May, 2000 and complete in May, 2004 with a
4-year construction phase.
Based on the time limit, prediction of traffic volume and the memorandum of the talk with the World
Bank, the phases are determined as follows,
Highway construction phase (2000 7 2004);
Short-tern of operation phase (2006);
Medium-term of operation phase (2014);
Long-termn of operation phase (2024).
CHAPTER 2 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
2.1 Significance of the Project
1. The Shuiren-Nanning Highway is one of the important parts of the naitonal trunk
lineflChongchen-Zhanjang Highway, one of the three key highways in the "National Trunk Line
Configuration Planning" approved by the State Council. Therefore, il: is essential toachieve the general
planning target in the general highway planning configuration.
2. The existing Shuiren-Nanning highway is of lower technical standards resulting in low passing
capacity. In addition, it passes through cities and towns frequently with many level crossings and mixed
traffic leading to lots of traffic accidents. Consequently, it can not meet the need of the economic
growth in Guangxi and Southwest of the country. The construction of the Shuiren-Nanning Highway
will promote the regional economy by providing large and heavy trucks to the seaports with fast and
convenient traffic means.
3. Located on the south border land of the country, Guangxi Region is the combination part
between the south coastal areas and southwest backland, southwest and South China. Both the Central
Govenrnent and Guangxi Region Government have required that Guangxi should serve as an access to
the south seaports. On the basis of careful study, the conclusion cariLe that the construction of Shuiren-
Nannig Highway was the solution to the problem. Its construction will play an important role in
II



economic growth and resources exploitation in the Southwest china.
4. Duan County and Mashan County through which the proposed route will pass are ones of the
poorest counties of both Guangxi and country level which receive assistance. Although these counties
are rich in natural resources, their economy is backward mainly because of poor traffic conditions. The
construction of the highway will provide these areas with a better infrastructure to help them get rid of
poverty and become rich.
5. Wuming, Mashan and Duan through which the proposed route will pass have abundant tourism
resources with favourable vegetation, beautiful mountains, and wonderful karst caves. The completion
of the projected highway will be incorporated into the highway network, thus promoting the regional
tourism by providing travellers with convenient transportatin means and by connecting tourist resorts to
Nanning, Hechi and other cities.
6.All these areas are abundant in mineral resources, forestry resources and specialty resources. The
construction of the highway will play an important role in exploiting these resources.
For the geographical location of the alignment, refer to Fig.2-1.
2.2 Route Alignment and Major Controlling Points
Main line: The total lenghth of the recoimmented scheme (Scheme A) of the planned road is
237.588 km. The road starts at Changhao Village and ends at Sanan where it is connected to the
southlnorth expressway. The alignment is described as follows: Starting at Changhao Village, it
12

goes south to Gonghua and Latang and there it crosses National Road 323. From there, after passing
Banluan, it passes over the Diao River at Nawei 800 meters upstream. And then, it goes through
Jiouhuan, Tangma and Xiaao, there it goes parallel to National Road 210 till Baicai Village of Duan
County via Daxing and Gaoling. At Baicai Village it tums away from National Road 210 southward to
Linjiang Village via Dongpan and Bantan. The route crosses the Hongshui River there, and then goes to
the Xijiang River of the upstream of the Mingshui River through Leyu, Badu, Naliang, Neipai,
Fucheng, Wanglu and Luchu. After it crosses Xijiang, it arrives at Wuhaishang Village west of Wuming
County Town. There it intersects Provincial Road 203, then at Xiaolianghou, it crosses over Wuming
River. It, passing through Fuma, Jiouqin and Nawang, heads for Xijing in the north suburb of Nanning.
Afterwards, the alignment tums southeast to Sanan in the east suburb of Nannig via Ou Village and
Ertang, and finally it is connected with the south-north expressway.
The major controlling points are Shuiren, Duan, Mashan, Fucheng , Wuming and Sanan. For the
alignment and major controlling points, refer to Annex maps.
Connecting Line: To play a better role of the proposed highway in the economic growth in the study
area, five connecting lines with a total length of 25.6km are planned at 5 county town sites and a tourist
resort. The connecting lines will be built according to classEitwo starndards. The five lines comprise:
Duan County Town line (1.5 km), Mashan County Town Line (4.0km), Dahua County Town Line
(16.0km), Wuning County Town Line (3.8km) and Yilingyan Line (0.3km).

2.4 Construction Scale and Major Technical Indexes
The total length of the proposed road is 237.588 km. The whole route is divided into two sections for
which three different technical standards will be adopted considering the following factors, concluding
the predicted traffic volume, the level of economical growth of the respective areas, the natural
conditions, construction capital and the state planning for the highway configuration. Which are
specified as follows,
1. Section from Hechi(Shuiren) to Duan K96+0003]KI94+300. The new construction mileage is
97.855 km with standards Class-two, including:
section K96+0000K163+748 with a length of 66.155 km in hilly heavy rolling area; the design
driving speed is 60 km/h and section K163+7480K194+300 with a length of 30.70 km in plain light
rolling area; the design driving speed is 80 km/h.
2. Section from Duan to Nanning K194+3000K335+139. The new construction mileage is 140.733
km. Standards for this section will be expressway in plain light rolling areas; design speed is 100 km/h.
The construction scale, major technical indices and work amount are shown in Table 2-5.
2.5 Cost and Implementation Schedule for the Project
The project is planned to commence in May, 2000, completed and put into operation in may, 2004,
the construction period being 4 years.
As a component of the national artery road, it costs tremendously because of long mileage. Due to
great shortage of capital for the construction, the fund is suggested to be raised in the fol]lowing ways:
allocation by the MOC, loan from the World Bank and some being raised by the regional
Communications Division. The total cost for the recommended plan of the proposed highway is
estimated as 4,117.0172 million RMB yuan including 1,660.00 million RMB yuan from(USD200
million) the World Bank loan, 1 billion RMB yuan appropriated by the MOC. All the others are raised
by the provincial Comrmunications Division and loaned from the national banks.

2.6 Road-Building Materials and Haulage
2.6.1 Road-building Materials
1 .Stones
There are high quality stones along the proposed project that can be excavated mainly at Guanglong,
Leyu, Yilin and Shangqiao. There are more exposed limestone at Shuiren 0 Mashan Section with short
haulage distance. However there are less limestone at Mashan 0 Nanning Section, so the haulage
distance is longer for this section.
2.Sand
Artificial sand quarries are located at the same places as the stone quarries. In addition, the medium-
sized and coarse sand can be obtained from the alluvial layers of the small rivers and streams nearby.
3.Lime
There are currently some lime kilns at Wuming, Shuangqiao, Duan and Hechi where lime can be
available.
4.Cement
There are cement works capable to produce high quality cement at Wuming, Mashan and Duan
where it can be procured. All these factories are not in large size with the limit of poor transport, only if
it can be purchased after testing-during highway construction.
5.Water
There are plenty of water sources for construction project along the alignment. However, there are
lots of dry valleys in the mountanious areas where water is scarce. WVells or long distance haulage is
needed.

2.6.2 Conditions of Transportation
At both Hechi and Nanning there is railway service. Besides, 210 National Highway goes parallel to
the proposed road. The alien materials can be procured either in Hechi or Nanning. The local materials
can be hauled to the construction sites by motor vehicles or tractors except Diaojiang or nearby areas
that detours for transport of the materials.
The sites of quarries and other materials are listed in Annex Table 2 and Fig. 4-1.

CHAPTER 3 GENERAL ENVIRONMENT
IN THE STUDY AREAS
The projected highway lies in the central and northwestern part of Guangxi. It goes from north to
south passing through Hechi, Duan, Mashan, Wuming and Naning with a total length of 237.588 km.
3.1 Natural Environment
3.1.1 Terrain
The terrain of the alignment rises from southeast to northwest. Hechi(Shuiren) where the route starts
is situated in the southern edge of Yungui Plateau with an average elevation of 600 meters above the
sea level. While Duan and Mashang in the middle has an elevation of 400 300 meter, Nanning, the
destination, located in the center of Guangxik,Basin, has an average elevation of about 150 meters. The
terrain through which the road passes takes three kinds of topography. The northwest has a
comparatively great altitude difference with huge mountains, valleys, steep cliffs. While the southeast
has smaller rise and fall with open and flat terrain. Generally, the topography falls into three catogones,
namely plane of denudation, hills, Karst and small alluvial plains.
3.1.2 River Regime
The area of the study section is abundant in rivers, which all belong to the Zhujiang River
System. From north to south the road passes or goes parallel to the following rivers: Diaojing,
Chengjiang, Hongshuihe, Dongjiang and Wuminghe. The Hongshuihe River flows southeast, and it
is the longest river the highway passes through. The water current is swift. Both upper and lower have
terraced structures, and it is used for  navigation. The second largest river is the Diaojing
River,basically going south-north. The Chengjiang River, flowing from underground, has a depth of
over I meter, and the route passes over it nearly at its end. The road goes parallel to it for about 6 km.
Both Dongjiang and Wuminghe go from east to west. All the rivers are of rain -fed rivers affected by
the weather and seasons. The flow resulted from flood in spring and fall may be decades or a hundred
times that in dry seasons.
The study areas are rich in surface water. There are plenty of streams, canals, reservoirs and ponds
for fishery. (See Fig. 3-1.)
3.1.3 Geology and Seism
Geologically, the study area belongs to part of the west wing of the front arc of Guangxi W type
pattern terrain being of Variscan-Indo-China tectonosphere, Jolly's structural area and Duan and
Mashang structural subarea.
The major explosed layers in the, study section are: Quatemary System, Tertiary System, lower series
of Cretaceous System, middle series and lower series of Triassic System, upper series and lower series.
of Permian System, upper series, middle series and lower series of Carbniferous System, upper series
and middle series of Devonian System and last, Cambrian System. Between Shuiren and Guanglong
are found mudstone, sandstone, shale, malm, limestone, siliceous stone of Devonian System; limestone,
dolomite of Carboniferous System; limestone, dolomite of Permian System;

mudstone, silt' sandstone and limestone of Triassic System. Between Guanglong and Leyu are found:
limestone and dolomite of Carboniferous System; limestone and dolomite of Permian System; loan and
gravel layer of Quaternarv System. Between Leyu and Wuming are found: limestone of Permian
System; limestone, sandstone and silty sandstone of Triassic System; calciun rock of Cretaceous
System; clay, loan and gravel layerof Quatemzary System. Between Wuming and Nanning are found:
crag, gravel and packsand of Cambrian System; Sandstone, alieovite, packsand of Devonian System;
limestone of Carboniferous System; gravelly  sandstone of Tertiarial layer; aleuvite with lignic in
mudstone stratum; loan layer and sandy gravel layer of Quaternary System.
According to "Guangxi Earthquake Intensity Map", the intensity of Hechi(Shulren)]Mashang
section is lower than 6, while that between Mashang and Nanning is 6.
The ground water in the study area falls into three types, namely pore water, crevice water and karst
water. Pore water is mainly found in loan, sandy soil layer, and sometimes in limestone and aleuvite of
Quatemary System, such as in the alluvial layer of Quatemary System at Wyming and Shuangqiao.
North of Fucheng and Xijing, muddy sandstone exists in the       phreatic water with free surface.
Crevice water falls into structural and karstal types with the iormer found in the faulty belt and the
latter in carbonas. Karst water, however is fDund in the areas with developed karst, such as at
GuanglngnXiaao, Liziao lWaizhang, DaxingXiangshuiguang and DisuOLeyu. It also exists on both
banks of the Hongshuihe River in the form of underground stream, undercurrent and underground
river.
Both pore water and structural crevice water have slight effect on subgrade and slopes. At plain light
rolling areas, the terrain is flat and open less cut and fill, and the alignment will not be affected by the
geological conditions. But at some partial rice fields; there are some weak soil layers found which
needs some treatment; at the sections in the heavy hilly areas, however, the route will pass through
deep eluvial belts with soft rocks and brokenOout sections. During excavation, there might be collape
or landslide. Near Nanning there is some swelling soil which needs comprehensive protection measures
such as waterproof, moisture keeping, enclosure and slope protection.
3.1.4 Meteorological Features in the Study Areas
(I) Weather
The proposed highway lies north of the Tropic Cancer belonging to humid weather of subtropical
zone. The climate is mild with an annual average temperature of 200 722E. It is steamy and hot with
an average temperature of 24.8 7 El 26.3 C . The annual lowest temperature is 17.5 El. The weather year
around is frostIlfree. These areas are rich in rainfall with an average precipitation of more than 1216
mm. The rainfall is mainly concentrated in April OSeptember accounting for 85% that of the whole
year. Nanning and Wuming are struck by typhoon and storms, while Mashan and Duan is affected not
so severely.
Table 3-1-1 shows the major meteorological elements in the study areas. Table 3-1-2 shows the
average annual and characteristically monthly rainfall in the study areas. Because of the great rainfall,
floods occur very often here resulting in disasters.
Every year in May O December, Guangxi is effected by typhoon with coastal areas and Yulin
Prefecture in particular. When there is typhoon in Nanning, the wind is usually force 5 O 7. Typhoon
brings heavy rainfall affecting highway service.
Table 3-1-1 shows that there are less foggy days in the study areas. The types of fog falls into
radial and frontal ones making up 67 O 100% of t]he total and appear mostly between 4 O llam.

Frontal fog mostly occurs in the mountains of Hechi, Duan and Mashan in late afternoon and at night.
When fog occurs, the visibility is less than lOOOm.
(2) Wind direction and wind speed
Fig. 3-2 shows the average quarterly and yearly wind speed frequency of five meteorological stations
from 1993 through 1997. The figure shows no obvious difference between seasons in wind directions.
The main wind directions in these areas are: Hechi E, Duan NNW, Mashan NE, Wuming SE, Nanning
ENE. There are more calm frequencies at four stations accounting for :21 0 49% except Duan. The high
percent calm frequency is not favorable for diffusion of air pollutants.
Table 3-1-3 shows the average wind speed of the years and characteristic months. The average wind
speed of Duan is 2.6 m, while the wind speed of other stations is slower, (0.9 O 1.7 m/s) which is
unfavorable for diffusion of air pollutants. For detail, refer to Attached Chart 3.

3.2 Ecosystem
The total length of the proposed alignment is 237.588 km. The study areas are rich in biological
resources because of favorable climatic conditions of humid monsoon. However, these resources are
unevenly distributed due to various geographical conditions and population.
3.2.1 Flora
The virgin vegetation in the study area includes tropical evergreen broad-leaved forests, but as the
altitude rises, typical mountain evergreen broad-leaved forests, forests with both broad-leaved and
acicular forests and mountain low forests are found. Secondary vegetation consists of evergreen and
deciduous forests. At those areas where there are more human activities, most high arbor trees have
been cut with only shrubs or bare rocks left. The forest coverage at backcountry mountains is 400500,
while in the central and densely populated areas, in vast karst areas in particular, the coverage is only
5 E10  . The study area is in the area with frequent human activities. T he forests here are evergreen and
deciduous ones mixed with bushes.
There are more than 150 species of high trees in Guangxi including pines, firs, eucalyptus, oak, trees
24



of heaven and erythrophloeum ferdii. Other cash trees including: China fir, Chinaberry, Chinese
mahogany, tung tree, paper mulberry, tea-oil tree, Chinese chestnut, pine, meadow fescue, camphor
tree, silk tree. Medicine plants including: honeysuckles, ninebark, multiflower knotweed, asparagus
fern. The major grain crops including: rice, potatoes, oringe and tangerine, sugar cane, peanut and lotus
root etc.The major fruit trees including: bryony, litchi, longan, sand pear, persimmon, reach and plum
etc.
According to the Names of Rare Plants under Protection in China, erythrophloeum ferdii are under
protection of level three. They are found mainly at the edges of hills of Daming and Xiaoming
Mountains with rich soil. Erythrophloeum ferdii, known as iron trees have many advantages. They are
widely used in ship-making industry, bridges, vehicles, fumiture, and construction etc. No such trees
have been found in the areas along the route because of frequent human activities.
3.2.2 Fauna
In the territory of Guangxi Region there a:re some rare species of animals under protection of
national level such as shinisaurus crocodilurus, white headed laugur, yellow-belly tragopan. Due to
frequent human activities and advanced farmring, large wild animals are rarely found except in the
mountainous areas in Duan and Hechi Counties. Large animals are: monkey, wild dog, boar, paguma
larvata, muntiac, Rrinaceeus earopaeus, Manis pentadactyla, goat, otter and musk deer. Birds are;
magpie, owl, cuokoo, Garrulax canorus, crow, conure and mandarin duck etc. There are some other
wild reptiles and insects. According to the National Wild Animal Protection Species, otters and Manis
pentadactylas ip the study areas are under classOtwo protection.
There is no state-level animals at the site of the proposed road by investigation from the local
forestry institutions.
3.2.3 Soil and Crops
(1) Investigation of current situations
The major soil types in the study areas are recd soil, yellow soil, calcareous soil, alluvial soil, purple
soil and paddy soil. The red soil is the leading one that is found below 700 m of the sea level on the low
hills; the yellow soil is found above 700 m, and the paddy soil is found in the central Guangxi Basin
and valleys and plains. Calcareous soil is found mainly in the northern part of the alignment at
calcareous areas.
According to ETOR, 10 test centers have been set up to determine the lead content in farming soil
and crops. For the results, refer to Table 3-2-1. Selection of monitoring locations, collection and
preparation of samples, analysis methods and meters are all based on the Analysis Methods of
Environmental Monitoring and Quality Standards of Soil (GB 15618 -1995).
(2) Assessment of current situation
Table 3-2-1 shows that the content of lead in soil is 41.576 0 23.083mg/kg, much lower than the
most stnct standards 250 mg/kg. This means that the soil has not been polluted. It still has much
capacity.
The monitoring result of lead content in crops: rice 0.387mg/kg 0 none; in vegetable 0.15 0
0.1 8mg/kg; in corn 0.366mg/kg. All are lower than the standards. The crops have not been polluted so
far.

3.2.4 Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is resulted from both natural and human factors. It is a physical process of soil erosion,
movement and deposition. The soil erosion in Guangxi is caused by the damage to vegetation. Table 3-
2-2 shows the intensity of erosion in Guangxi. The soil erosion of different cities and counties along the
alignment is showed in Tables 3-2-3, 3-2-4, 3-2-5 respectively.
The ground surface is covered with green plants yearE round in Guangxi thanks to its humid and
warm climate that fits growth of plants. If we compare Table 3-2-5 to 3-2-2, we know that the soil
erosion along the alignment is slight. However, the erosion report by the remote sensing techniques
shows that the erosion in the study areas is of intensive or medium degree. See Table 3-2-3 for detail.
Table 3-2-4 shows the potential erosion and the areas of erosion at present. It can be concluded that the
protection and control of soil erosion remains a long-lasting task.

3.2.5 Farming
The advantages in natural and geographical conditions in Guangxi are favorable for crop growth.
There are various kinds of crops and other plants in the study areas taking in rice, beans, potatoes, com,
wheat, sugar cane, tobacco, peanut, tea, fruits and medicine herbs. The land use in the study areas is in
Table 3-2-6.

In Nanning, Wuming and Mashan, rice is grown with a higher yield per unit area  because of
favorable climate. Whereas in Duan, the natural and geographical conditions are much poorer than
those in the above areas. There are lots of mountains and hills. The good farmland is scarce there, so
attention to that must be paid in construction of the road.
3.3 Social Surroundings
3.3.1 Socio-economics in the Study Areass
The proposed project will pass Hechi Prefecture, Nanning Prefecture and the City of Nanning with
five directly impacted counties and cities of Nanning, Wuming, Mashan, Duan and Hechi. The
jurisdiction and subordination are in Table 3-3-1. The project impaction areas see Fig. 3-3.

of
villages
Nanning City: The City of Nanning is located in the central south of Guangxi Region. It is the capital
of Guangxi and the center of politics, economy, culture and transportation. It is also one of the open
cities approved by the State Council. It governs; six districts and two counties covering an area of
.10,029 square km with a population of 281.20 million (1997) including 62% of agricultural
population. There are rich mineral resourses and subtropical plant resourses and tourist resourses being
one of the five tourist resorts. The GNP in 1997 was 17,489 million RMB yuan being in the leading
position of development in the whole region. The ratio of industry, agruculture and tertiary industry
was 5.99:32.77:61.24, which seems reasonable structurally.
Wuming County: Wuming County, located north of Nanning, is under juristication of Nanning. It is
an area where a number of nationalities live togetlher with Zhuangzu being in the greatest number. The
area of the county is 3,366square km with a population of 6.408 million with the agricultural
population making up 85.83, among which the Zhuang people account for more than 860. A new
development formula has been formed. The new formula is described as: industry is promoted by
agriculture, and agriculture, in tum, is offerred help by industry,and industry and agriculture work in
an effective coorperation. This area is abundant in both natural and tourist resources. The Yiling Yan
District is a famous tourist place. 1997's GNP in this county was 199.4 million RMB yuan. Therefore,
it is a county with potentialities.
Nanning Prefecture: Being located in the centraLI south of Guangxi, Nanning Prefecture govems 12
cities and counties. The population in 1997 was 543.84 million with an agricultural population making
up about 900 of the whole  . This area lies in thie subtropical zone enjoying peculiar advantages of
resourses for development of subtropical cash crops such as sugar cane, fruit and tea. In addition, there
are rich mineral resourses, water resourses and tourist resourses to be exploited. Industries here are
based on agriculture, and cement and sugar making is the key industry, the structure of which is not
.27

reasonable. The GNP in 1997 was 141,90 million RMB yuan. The net mean income of farmers and
other people is lower than the average level of the whole province, so the living standard is low.
Mashan County: Mashang County is under jurisdication of Nanning Prefecture. The whole county Is
located in deep rocky mountain area with poor natural resourses and deteriorated biological conditions,
and it is one of the development areas in Honghe River power station reservoir districts. The area of
the county is 2,365 square km with a population of 0.4855 million people, 93  of which is engaged in
agriculture.It is an agricultural county with less farmland for per person. The county is resided by 13
different nationalities including Han, Zhuang and Yao, with Zhuang and Yao taking up 84.6% of the
total population The GNP was 415 million R.MB yuan in 1997. Therefore, we can say that it is a
backward county in Guangxi with slow growth of economy . So far, about 30_ of the population are
under the poverty line. The county is supported by agriculture with industry being in its beginning.
Hechi Prefecture: Hechi Prefecture lies in the northwestern part of Guangxi on the border between
the south slope of Yungui Plateau and Guizhong Basin with an area of 33,508 square km. It is peopled
by 8 nationalities, namely Zhuang, Han and Yao etc. It governs 11 cities and counties having a
population of 3.6757 million. The whole area is characterised by mountainous and hilly land making
up 91 0 of the total. There are different species of plants and local specialties which are well-known.
There are potentialities for forestry and tourism. Besides, there are plenty of water resourses and
mineral resourses. The GNP of the whole prefecture was 100.01 million RMB yuan in 1997 with a
GNP of 2,728 RMB yuan per person lower than that of the whole contry. Agriculture plays an
important role in the regional economy. Major industrial enterprises are mining, machinery, sugar
making, electricity, building materials, chemical industry, and textile etc. The ratio of industry,
agriculture and tertiary industry is 30:38:32, which needs further readjustment.
Duan County: Duan County is a Yaozu autonomous county under jurisdication of Hechi
Prefecture. The total area is 4,095 square km with a population of 0.6217 million people, 94 0 of which
are engaged in agriculture, and 21.7 percent are Yao people. The GNP in 1997 was 464 million RMB
yuan being one of the poorest counties in the country which needs assistance to get rid of poverty. Now,
26 thousand people still live in poverty making up 4201 of the whole population. Agriculture is now
supporting industry in economy. However, the township enterprises are developing fast. There are
favourable natural conditions for developing green food.
Hechi City: Hechi City belongs to Hechi Prefecture. It is the capital of Hechi Prefecture and the
center of its politics, economy, culture and transportation in the prefecture. It is also an access to the
seaports for Guizhuo and Sichuang and other provinces of Southwestern China. The total area is 2,340
square km with a population of 0.304 million in 1997, 640 of which are engaged in agriculture. The
area is rich in mineral resourses,water resourses, forest resourses and tourism resourses.. Economy is
booming fast. Industry includes metallu.rgy, foodmaking, cement, farming tool and other businesses
forming the backbone of economy. Agriculture consists of planting and husbandry. The GNP in 1997
was 1,262 million RMB yuan taking the leading position in economical development in Hechi
Prefecture.

3.3.2 Traffic Transportation at Present
30



The major transportation means in the study areas is highway transportation. The main highway in
operation at present is 210 National Highway. Most sections of the highway are of class three or four or
simple country road except the class-two section between Nanning and Wuming which is 29 km long.
The bad conditions of the road cause frequent traffic accidents. Besides, they can not meet the
economic growth. Therefore, these areas need a high-class highway urgently.
3.3.3 Tourist Resources and Cultural Relics
In the areas directly affected by the project, the main tourist resort is Wulingyan in Wuming County.
Wulingyan scenic zone is the paradise in Nanning tourist areas. The passage of the alignment through
the tourist attraction will add beauty to the scenery, so the tourists can enjoy the pleasure. See picture A
in Chapter 4.
Located 38 km northeast of Wuming Town, Daming Mountains are known as the summer resort in
Guangxi. With its beautiful landscapes, it attracts millions of holiday- makers every year.
Located 5 km east of Wuming County, Qifeng Mountains are another tourist resort with its
wonderful beauty.
In addition, The south Guangxi tourist areas, with Nanning being the center, have very rich tourist
resources attracting numerous tourists from both home and abroad.
According to the site survey and the visit to the institutions of hitorical relics, there is no
important clutural and historical relics in the assessment scope on both sides of the proposed highway.
Fig 3-4 shows the locations of tourism resorts and cultural relics which are far away from the
alignment. Therefore, the construction of the highway will not have any adverse effect on them. Annex
11 shows the comments of the Cultural Relics Agency of Guangxi on the highway construction. By the
investigation of Guangxi provincial Antique Brigade,, no important cultural relics are found within the
assessment area.
3.3.4 Minority Nationalities
Guangxi Region has a long history traced back to 214 B.C. of Qin Dynasty. It has long been a part of
a united nation. Guangxi is a multi-national region peopled by 12 ethmic groups of Zhuang, Han, Yao,
Miao and Maonan etc, with the minority nationalities making up 38.5% of the total population. The
areas in which the minorities live cover about 60 percent of Guangxi's territory. Zhuang is an original
nationality with a long history. The population of Zhuang accounts for 33% of the total one in the
31



Fig.3-4
32



whole region, being the largest minority in the country of 55 ethnic groups. In 1958, approved by the
State Council, the Guangxi Autonomous Region was set up to carry out a policy of autonomy.
Afterwards, some autonomous counties as well as townships were established, e.g. Yao Autonomous
Country through which the proposed highway passes. All the leading organizations of alllevels include
cadres from minorities. In 1957, with the help of the Central Goverrment, the Zhuang Common
Language was founded.
The various nationalitiles of Guagnxi Region have long got along well with each other for ages.
They learn from each other and help each other in cultural and economic deeds. There are no customs
deserving special attention except for some distinctive dress style, landuages, diet etc. They all share
the same festivals with the Han except for some unique festivals as the Zhuzhu Festival observed by
some minorities.
The total length of the proposed alignment is 237.588km. The areas of the minorities and villages
where they live make up above 95 percent of all villages through which the proposal passes. They are
mainly Zhuang, Yao and Maonan nationalities. Zhuang Nationality with the longest history in Guangxi
is engaged in farning mainly. However, it has relatively developed metal casting, ship-making,
ceramics and textile industry, Having its own landuage and letters, the Zhuang is well known for being
good at singing folk songs. The third day of March is its traditional song festival. The Zhuang has long
good relationship with the Han as intennarrying with Han. The Zhuang live at flatter areas in Guangxi,
e.g. Wuming County, Mashan County and Hechi City.
The Yao is spread widely living mostly in mountainous areas., e.g in Duan Yao Autonomous
County. The Yao peoples living conditions are usually not good. They carry out monogamy, seldom
intermarrying other nationalities. They have their own unique festivalO]Zhuzhu Festival. They also
have their own language, but no letters.
The Maonan takes the seventh place in population, mainly in Huanyiagn Maonan Autonomous
County. Very few Maonan people are found along the proposed highway. They are in mixed
communities with the Zhuang and Yao in most cases. The Maonan people are frank and open, speaking
other languages like the mandarin and the Zhuang laguage. They intermarry the Zhuang and the Han
very often.
The areas through which the projected highway passes are very backward because of poor
transport conditions. As a result, the economical and cultural activities have long been limited leading
to poor living conditions of the local people. So, the local people are enthusiatically interested in the
construction of the new highway.

3.4.1.1 Noise Sources
According to the field investigation, there are no other noise sources found except those from the
existing road. The relation of the environment in the study areas and the existing roads in the
assessment scope are shown in Table 3-4-1. Table says that there is no noise pollution basically along
the existing highway.

3.4.1.3 Assessment of Current Situation of Acoustics
The current situation of environmental and traffic noise level has been assessed. The results are as
follows:
l.In general rural areas, the noise level in daytime is LAeq = 38.2 0 44.7 dB; at night L,Aq = 32.1 0
40.9 dB, which satisfy the 0 grade standards in GB3096-93 Noise Level Standards in Urban Areas.
2. The noise level beside the main county highways and near the suburbs of county tovm sites is: at
night 45.9 0 59.0dB which is in excess of the standards; in daytime the noise level is of 4 grade; at the
distance of 20 m or beyond the noice level is 3 0 1 grade. The traffic noise resulting from these
highways do not have significant effect on the acoustic noise due to the fact that the proposed
alignment goes parallel to the existing highway only at a few sections.
3. The noise level in route schools is 44.0dB day and night, which shows a peaceful surrounding.
4. The current traffic volume on connecting lines presents the low level, the noise level as 44.2-
46.2dB day and night.
It can be concluded that the quality of acoustics along the projected highway is fairly good. The
residents and the schools enjoy a quiet environmenit.
3.4.2 Water
3.4.2.1 Investigation of current situation of water
In order to know the current water quality in the water bodies that may be affected by the
34



construction of the project, the water environment has been surveyed. Besides, the water bodies in the
main rivers and reservoirs have been monitored by the Environmental Protection Station of Hechi.
(1) Monitonrng locations
The proposed alignment will cross or go parallel to the following rivers: Diao River, Cheng Riover,
Hongshui River, Dong River and Wuming River. It will pass near sorne reservoirs. On the basis of the
data from the local stations, the water in the main rivers and reservoirs was monitored and analyzed.
The locations of water samples are shown in Table 3-4-4 and annex figure.
(2) Analysis method of samples
The samples are obtained at the three points -upstream, downstream and in the middle of the cross
sections of bridges (100 m apart). They are analyzed after mixed. For the reservoirs, the three points in
the right, left and middle are chosen. Samples are collected 3 days in succession, once a day. See Table
3-4-5.

3.4.2.2 Analysis of Current Quality of Water
1. Assessment methods
Water will be analyzed and evaluated by using the standard classification methods. If all the factors
are below class-one standards, the water quality at this section is classified as class-one type. When one
or more factors are in excess of the standards of class-one standards, but below class- two standards,
the quality at this section is classified as class-two type. The same is true of other classes i.e. class-
three, class-four and class-five.
2.  Assessment standards
To comply with the reply letter on the standards for the projected construction from Guangxi
Environmental Protection Bureau, for surface water Surface Water Environmental Standards GB3838-
88 III will be adopted. See Table 1-4 for the standards.
3. Assessment results
The monitoring results compared with the standards adopted are listed in Table 34-7.

The assessment element PP has been replaced with CODcr due to monitoring limitation.
The results monitored are as follows:
1. All factors in the Diao river exceed class-V of GB 3838-88 showing that the river has been
contaminated by local industrial enterprises, which has been listed as one of the strictly controled river
by the Guangxi EP Agency. It is believed that the water will be bettered due to the strict control
measures adopted by the Guangxi EP Agency.
2. The water quality in other rivers and reservoirs remains almost the same. The index level of PH,
CODcr, and oils mee the standards of class I, while that of Pb meet the standards of class II. Therefore,
the water quality of these watr bodies can be deternined as class II.
It can be summarized that the water quality in the water bodies is good with its existing level in
accordance with class-two.

Hechi Environmental Protection Station was asked to conduct the monitoring of air quality.
Sampling was made for five days in succession on 29/5 of 1997 and 21/6 of 1997. Then the samples
were analyzed according to GB 3095- 1996. The analysis methods given are in Table 3-4-9.

3.4.3.2 Current situation of air quality and its assessment
The monitoring results of CO, NOx, TSP and lead content at the eight locations are shown in Tables
34-10 03-4-13 respectively. From the tables we know:
(1) The hourly average concentrations of CO at all the eight places is between 0.625 0 2.62
mg/Nm3; the daily average concentration is 0.625 O 1.414 mg/Nm3, both below class-two standards in
GB 3095-1996.
(2) The average hourly and daily concentrations of NOx is between 0.003 E 0.032 mgNm3 not
exceeding the class-two standards in GB 3095-1996.
(3) The average daily level of TSP is between 0.017 C 0.228mg/Nm3, below class-two standards in
GB3905- 1996.
(4) The lead concentration at eight locations is between 0.043 El 0.385mg/Nm3. When compared
with the average limit level of 1.5mg/Nm3, it is in accordance with the standards.
It can be seen that along the alignment in the study area the concentrations of CO, NOx and lead are
low, so it still has a great acceptance capacity. The local air quality is fairly good thanks to the humid
air and thick vegetation.

CHAPTER 4 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PREDICTION
4.1 Social and Economic Environmental Impact Analysis
4.1.1 Project Impact Analysis on Minorities
Guangxi has a great concentration of ethics in China. The project area takes one of the most part of
minorities in the region. Some minorities in those places are always living in poor conditions as they
can not make good use of local natural resources only because of poor communication and backward
transportation. The construction of the new highway project will present an entirely new look in traffic,
along with new life. So, the construction of a highway means the further national solidarity.
The proposed highway is located in minority areas. 95% of the villages, according to a survey, along
the line within 200m belong to those of Zhuang, Yao and Maonan ethics. Zhuang, the major one, has its
own language and letters, who are civilized comparatively (intermarry with some other nationalities)
and have a better living conditions. There are not so many Yao and Maonan people along the route,
who are mostly living poorly in isolate mountains. The cross of highway through minority areas will
enhance the communication of the local people with the others and greatly improve the current
situations of the backward areas.
4.1.2 Project Analysis on Social and Economic Benefits
4.1.2.1 Social Benefit Analysis
The project area contains Mashan and Duan counties, the poor region, which is lower in economic
levels. Both people are in poor living conditions and always are key poverty0relief targets from the
state, Guangxi province and local prefecture. The backward traffic conditions are the major restricting
factor for the economic. development of the mountainous areas. That is why the improvement of
highway in local places is very available for the improvement of economy, significantly in reality and
history.
The rich minerals, forest and mountainous products along the highway, especially the industry of
building materials, means a good future. The full exploitation of natural resources depends on
convenient transportation, highway transportation particularly. The irmplementation of the project will
create new conditions for the exploitation and exportation of local goods, in order to further complete
the local economic structure and distribution. That will be a great guarantee for the realization of local
9th five-year plan and the 2010 Long Range Plan as well as a direct acceleration of local economy.
4.1.2.2 Social Environment Benefit from the Project
(1) Social and economic development of the Local Areas
Guangxi, one of the 12 seashore provinces in China, owns plenty of bays and harbors with good
natural conditions. The special geographical location, semitropical climate and rich natural resources
provide a perfect requirements for economy, trade and tourism. The Slate Government made a strategic
point of departure as to make full use of the sea passage for the Southwest. In Guangxi, there have
been some key enterprises on coal, electricity, metallurgy, building materials, electromechanical, light
industries etc., which has formed a big capacity of production. Meanwhile, Guangxi is still a sub-
developing area with its weak infrastructure in transportation and some industries of raw materials in
advantage, in comparison with some other provinces. In years, the advantageous geographic condition
and rich natural resources have not performed generally but in small scope and low economics.
Therefore, the construction of Hechi-Nanning expressway will play a great role both in accelerating
the social and economic development in Guangxi and its project areas, and in smoothing traffics and
decreasing long-distance by-pass.
(2) A Key to Poverty Relief
The project area is not well-developing, which has a large size of poverty and poor population. The
rural and urban differences exist extremely, as some part of local people even don't have enough food
and clothing, some of which, including some minorities, are still under ihe poverty line (income:250-
700yuan /yr. In attached table 1). It is a hard task to relieve local poverty, which is partly due to poor
traffics. The improvement of local transportation will be a vital measure for the conversion of
backwardness.
The construction of the project will be significant in economics and society in enlarging the
exploitation of resources and quickening the steps of poverty relieving.

The compensation for removal will be mainly on cultivation. The local cultivation of sheep, hares,
dogs, etc. will be available for its rich nature, which is one of the special way for local peasants to get
rid of single dependence upon little farmland.
4.1.3 Project Economic Assessment
4.1.3.1 Project Expenses
The project costs contains that of construction, mid- & large-sized maintenance and overhaul. The
investment estimate shows that the total cost from the recommended plan covers 4,117.0172 million
RMB yuan, with a road length of 237.588km, 17.32 million RMB yuanAkm. There are 4 channels for
the funds consulted by the concemed agencies, a: to be applied as subsidy from the Ministry of
Communications, I billion RMB yuan; b: loan from foreign agency, US$200m (1660 million RMB
yuan), by the interest of 7%/yr.; c: self-raise by the Guangxi Dept. of Communications, 1,342 million
RMB yuan; d:Loan from domestic banks, 115 rnillion RMB yuan. After the operation, tolls are to be
used to clear off the loan and its interests.
4.1.3.2 Economic Benefits from the Project
The direct economic benefit means all profits received by all highway users in sociiety, including
the following aspects,
(1) Leveling benefits from the lowering transport cost as the proposed highway in higher grade;
(2) Diverging benefit from the reduction of congestion and from the then speeding;
(3) Saving benefit from the shortening of distance;
(4) saving benefit from the transport time decreasing because of higher speed;
(5) saving benefit from the decreasing of passengers traveling time
(6) benefit from the reduction of traffic accidents.
It is estimated that in the 20 years of 2004-2023, the economic benefit totals to 52,296 million yuan
in 20 years of operation.- Meanwhile, a great deal of gasoline can be saved.
4.1.3.3 Project Economic Evaluation
The national economic evaluation can be proceeded on the base of expenses and benefits. By
calculation, the index of project economic evaluation are shown : the value of EIRR reaches 22.50%,
larger than the conversion rate of 12%. On the condition of current 12%, the net increase of value
reaches 4,981.57 million yuan. The financial recovery period is 7.66 year. That all shows the project is
feasible and beneficial.
The analysis on project sensibility shows that the benefit is lower by 20%, when expenses 20%
upward, at this time the EZRR still up to 17.38%, larger than the social conversion rate 12%. That is to
say, the anti-risk of project reveals strong.
4.1.4 Analysis on Social Environment Impact from the Project
Highway construction offers large-sized scope, which will inevitably bring some restrictions and
impacts to existing roads, farmlands, irrigation works, electric and comnmunications. Sometimes, it will
have a great influence on the farm work and local life. The social environment sure can be impacted
along the route from the highway construction.
4.1.4.1 Land Requisition and Removal
By survey, the proposed highway construction will occupy all land of 24250 mu, including 2643.59
mu irrigated land, 6172.66mu dryland, 7547.54rnu forest, 1859mu orchards, 5334.14mu waste and
other 14mu. The whole fannland totals to 11676.81mu. The removal of all buildings will be 57104 M2
and 1253 wire poles. Seen in Table 4-1-1 and Table 4-1-2.

Land acquisition and removal are first taken in account when the design unit ensure the aligninent
as that has direct and inmnediate interests with local people. To make all relevant principles and laws
public should be stepped first before fulfillment. The agreement presents that the land acquisition,
removal and resettlement will be carried out by the local governmenit, which will be running smoothly
and available for some other preparations for the operation. The local government and people are active
and looking forward to the improvement of local transportation and living levels. It is not a problem for
them to supply a good construction environment, but the highway units need to have a good
cooperation with the local government, to harmonize the resolution occurred in highway construction,
so as to assure the easy operation of the construction.
In the section from Duan to Mashan, they are very short of farming land in some villages,
averaging 0.3[:0.6mu/person, (referred in attached table 1). All the land are infertile, rather low in
production. While in removal, they will be supported with cultivation for a better life.
4.1.4.2 Impact of Disruption
The section between Shuiren to Duan will be built by grade two criterion, Duan-Nanning section by
grade one, all of which adopt level crossing, not enclosed under full access control. As the control will
bring some inconvenience to local production and life on both sides, mitigative measures as the
designing of separation is considered in the feasibility plan are shown in table 4-1-3.
The toal length of DuanONanning Section is 140.733km. All the passing bridges are not considered
in the table, on the route, almost one passage exists every 700m lon,g, which will ensure the regular
production and living for local people. The operation after construction will surely be convinent for the
local communications and going out. The ShuirenODuan Section will be designed according to class-
two standards. Since most of the villages are located at the foot of slopes or mountains, the villagers
will be disrupted by the high dams of highway embankments. (Bama village & Xiata village). So, all
the impacted villages are designed with passages and culverts in order to ensure local production and
flood discharge.

4.1.4.3 Function of Highway for Local Economics
The completion of the highway project will add another south-north corridor in transportation and
economy in Guangxi province. That will be a strong foundation to realize the local development plans
of the counties along the route. The highway will be one part of the national highway network, linking
up the main cities, economic centers, traffic hubs and extemal ports with that of Guangxi. The further
information and commercial exchange will enhance the national economic and social development in
such poor areas as Mashan and Duan.
4.1.4.4 Coordination Analysis between the Proposed Highway and Town Planning
The design unit was heeding the opinions of the local governments when locating, and tried their
best to fit in with the local town planning. The recommended plan agrees to the local suggestions on
the whole after the consultation of local governments and people. Because of that, the highway
planning has little disturbance to local town planning.
(1) The proposed highway will go at the section of Hechi city along mountain slopes or hills. It
connects the currently building high-grade expressway of Liuzhai-Liuzhou via Shuiren. Both the
42



highway plans and the Hechi town plan are conformed with, which means that the highway
construction meets the need of its general development planning.
(2) The highway goes at the edge of mountains and the Duan Economic Exploitation Zone. After the
consultation with local government, the Duan interchange will be located approaching the Zone, which
will promote the economic development and minimize the ill impact to the town planning.
(3) There will be an interchange at Badu, connecting with the Mashan town proper by 5km in
distance. It is accepted by Mashan County.
(4) The highway avoids its economic exploitation zone. At the edge of it, there will be a interchange,
which is active for the local development.
(5) The sections crossing Nanning City have been involved in the city planning, fitting in with the
overall development program of Nanning.
Accordingly, the proposed highway construction agrees basically with the local planning along the
route. It is perspective for the further economic development.
4.1.4.5 The Agreement and Impact Analysis on both the Highway and the Current Roadwork
The overall arrangement presents that the northOsouth highway meets in the south the rotary road
around Nanning city (Xijing-Sanan section as one of the rotary part), Liuzhai-Liuzhou road in the north
and cross the national trunk line No 210 many time along the road. In this way, the distance between
Liuzhai-Nanning via Liuzhou will be reduced some 100 kin, which will complete greatly the local
roadwork and decrease the serious traffic accident rate on No 210. The highway will better the traffic
environment and bring evident social benefit.
4.1.4.6 Impact Analysis on Agriculture
1. Permnent land-taken influence
It is a complex impact on agriculture from the highway project, involving in social economics and
ecology. First, the highway construction will take some farming land etemally, impacting the irrigation
system. The land occupation will deprive of production capability, which will be a great loss to the
local agriculture. The total farmland will be taken by 11676.81 mu (in the recommended plan). Seen in
table 4-1-4 about the land varieties.

Guanxi province has a suitable geography and climate for crops of many varieties. Along the route,
irrigated and rice lands are dominant with high per hectare yield. In Duan County, more hills the flat
land occur, mostly arid land in poor quality on slopes. It averages 0.4C10.6mu land per pelson in some
villages. The lost land taken by the highway means a great loss of local productivity. The yearly
damage in agriculture will be 7.473m RMB yuan if accounting for 400kg per mu yield by 1.6 yuan/kg.
2.Temporary land-taking influence
The temporary land-taking influence only occurs at the phase of construction. Some land will be
used as carrying bypass, camps, spoil and borrovv sites, mixing sites etc. Mostly wastlard are first
choice to be taken, 3222.75mu in total along the route, including 399.47mu farmland, 1295.28mu
dryland, 228.4 mu sugarcane field, 61.85mu orchard, 2.5mu vegetable plot, 605mu forest, 610.8mu
wasteland and 19.45mu fish pond. The temporary land-taking will also bring out some impact on
business along the route.
The land to be taken will be lasting for 4 years before its fully fimction recovery. At that time, the
local land economic income can be retumed.
The only lucky thing is that most spoil sites are chosen at waste velleys, where is always short of
farmland at the sections between Shuiren and Daxing. New farmland can be invented by the filling of
spoil in velleys, all of which can be carried out at the first stage of designing and construction.
43



Accordingly, there is a slight impact for the temporary land taking, and some waste land to be
spoiled will supplies some new farmland for the local areas.
After operation, the road dust will be reduced for the grading road level, which will regulate the
growth of crops instead of previous influence on crops and photosynthesis of leaves because of dusting
from general roads. Lead particles out of tail gas will accumulate to some extent. But, the non-lead
gas usage will change totally the feature factor of lead particles as one of road pollution.
4.1.4.7 Impact on Local Income and Living Conditions
The external land to be taken will be 24250.1 mu, The highway erLgineering will take the farmland of
11676.81 mu. The agricultural loss can be counted as: the total 3926t crops of 400kg per mu yield on
9814.46mu farmland will be lost, nor will 7.473m yuan for the loss of selling by 1600 yuan/t. Also the
loss in ponds of fish, lot us root and forest -land will be proportiona]l in the total. It is shown in table 4-
1-4.
The temporary use of land for borrow sites, construction camps, mixing sites and detour roads will
last for about four years until it is used for reclamation to the farmers. The buildings for temporary use
will also be granted to the farmers to help them in increasing their income.
The area along the route is rich in agriculture and stock breeding. The improvement of traffics and
investment environment for the construction of the highway will increase the values of the land, which
will irritate local commercial development and promote unit yield. The construction of highway will
enable the timely export of agricultural and subsidiary products as well as fresh aquatic products. The
benefit received by local peasants will exceed the output values from land occupation.
During construction, some local peasants can be employees, organized by the local governments.
That brings them some more income.
After operation, the cultivation, supported from removal in the project, will be on the process of
gaining, which will play a role in local poverty relief
4.1.4.8 Impact Analysis on Scenery and Cultural Relics
The highway area has a long history, with beautiful mountains and rivers. The construction of
highway will influence local tourism on both sides. Advantageously, the fast highway transportation
will promote local tourism; disadvantageously, some possible resorts and relics approaching the
highway will be in damage.
Within 200m, no key relics signs have been found during surveying and exploration, which means
no obvious ill impact on local resorts and relics along the route. If some new remains or relics,
particularly some cultural relics underground, are discovered during surveying and construction,
protection measures must be taken as the first step before timely report to local units of cultural relics
preservation. They will deal with it according to the law of the state relics protection.
Neighboring the Yilingyan, there is an exit to be left on the proposed highway for the convenient
access of more visitors to the resort.
4.1.4.9 Removal and Resettlement Analysis
(1) Adverse impact of Removal:
1) Most houses to be removed are living houses of local people, who have been in their hometown
for years. They will move to approaching villages because of the highway construction. The conversion
of surroundings, including the relationship among neighbors, drinking water, shopping etc., will bring
them some inconvenience and disturbance.
2) The removing households maybe not satisfied with the new houses or the compensation sum not
as they expected, all of which will lead to some increase of instability factors.
In the recommended plan, the main buildings to be removed along the line will cover 57104 in2, the
removal of 443 households, about 2099 personel, all of which will be resettled in their own villages.
That is in step with the willing of local people.
(2) Suggestions for Resettlemen and Removal
The resettlement in the project can be organized under the provincial Communications Dept. while
the local city and county governments as well as the traffic bureaus in charge of land acquisition,
settlement, removal of buildings etc. In principal, all the removing households will be resettled in their
own villages, 200m out of the highway. All the removing households will be under compensation in
accordance with relevant rules, and resettled under the criterion of local plan.
44



According to the public participation and inquiry, the resident removal and resettlemLent can be well
arranged with the.effort of both the construction units and local governments.
(3) Measures and Impact Analysis on Project Removal and Resettlement
The removal and resettlement in the project will take the following principles.
1) All people to be impacted participate in the whole procedure and their willings will be taken into
account fully.
2) The house compensation will be counted by resettlement prices instead of replacement.
3) The buildings to be impacted will be demolished and rebuilt by their owners, while special
labour help and subsidies are provided.
4) Try to resettle at their own villages.
5) Resettlement plan will be drawn out and carried out strictly.
All the measures are indentical with we have surveyed along the route, which are suitable for the
local needs. Furthermore, The implementation of the speical removal and resettlement operation plan
will surely reduce the impact to a minimum
4.1.4. 10 Safety
The safety impact presents in two phases of construction and operation.
1. Impact in phase of Construction
Workers and local people are most concerned for the safety influence during construction. The main
unsafe factors for workers lie with bridge building, cliff blasting. On the process of tender invitation, all
the units to be invited for such sections as bridge building and cutting sections at heavy hilly areas must
be with high quality and rich experience. Stricl operation rules are to be defined in the contracts. In
doing so, the safety of workers can be ensured.
Local people, mostly pedestrains, are easily harmed when passing through the blasting site or
walking on unbuilt bridges. Supervision during blasting and prohibition of entrance in bridgeObuilding
sites are needed. The second group of local people means such living approaching the blasting sites, as
they donot resettle because of no impact of land taking. When blasting, they are in danger, most people
at Hechi- Daxing section. The construction unit are determined to give them some temporary allowance
for their living in their relatives only in blasting period. At such period, their houses will be supervised
to ensure its completion before they can go back home after the dangerous days.
2. Impact in phase of Operation
The existing Shuiren-Nanning section is one part of No.210 inside Guangxi province, lasting 283km.
Most of the part are in class 3 or 4 or out of class except the 37km class 2 section between Nanning and
Wuming. The most part, with steep slopes and sudden turns, turning into crowded towns, are frequent
for traffic accidents. When we were surveying at the spot, two severe accident occured. The local
traffic institutions told us that there would be more accident in rainy days. The completion of the
highway, with good quality and detour of crowded towns, will decrease surely the traffic accidents as
well as the economic damage from them.
One thing must be taken a notice that the Shuiren-Duan section will be in class -2, no enclosed,
vehicles on this road are possibly speeding, which will increase the possibility of accidents at
neighbouring towns and villages. They can be avoided by the following management and publicizing:
1) set up obvious sign boards, especially at some school sites; 2) give public along the route, not
acrossing the road; 3) strengthen the basement. 15m basement instead of common 12m for class 2
highway can play a role in reduction of traffic accidents.
In 4.3.4, some chemical risks are analysed on Shui-Nan highway, which shows that the accident
probability from dangerous articles (including oils, fertilizers, insecticides etc) in year 2024 is forcast
as 0.19 times annually. It is a very low probability.
4.1.5 Summary
Above all, the highway project contains good social and economic benefits. In the preOconstruction
phase, the construction units will do a good job, cooperating with local planning units in dealing with
all policies .of removal and resettlement, so,cial and economic impacts on land acquisition,
interinfluence with the economic zones and destruction of vegetation and scenery. During construction
and operation, management and publicity will be strengthened in order to ensure the easy transport and
less traffic accidents. In a word, the giant social and economic benefits of the project present the
necessity and feasibility of the highway construction.

4.2 Prediction and Assessment of Ecological Environment Imipact
4.2.1 Prediction and Assessment of Soil and Crops Quality Impact
4.2.1.1 Calculation of Annual Lead Emission Source Strength
The annual lead discharge source strength obtained from the followiing fornula:
365qP
F =;I;, -N   b, J,                  (4.1)
G
where: J,- average gas assumption for i-typed vehicle(L/Km);
Pb,-lead content in vehicle gas (average value:0. 14g/L);
fl- pipe emission rate, generally as 75%;
N,- day traffics for i-typed vehicles;
P-lead particle settlement within the assessment scope on both sides of the highway,
generally as 60%;
G- quality of farming layer soil within I km of both sides, generally as 8.96* 107kg;
i-small, med- and large-sized vehicles;
365- number of a years.
4.2.1.2 Prediction Calculation of Lead Concentrations in Soil
The lead content prediction at measuring sites follows the above formula (4.2), the results of
which are shown in table 4-2-1.
n
W.= Bo + K  Rji-tK''                   (4.2)
1=1
Where: W,-lead accumulation at layer A in year i after operation, (mg/kg);
K-lead residue (%) in soil, taking K=0.95;
Bo-lead content background value at layer A of soil (mg/kg);
Ri-lead import in soil in year i (mg/kg);
Table 4-2-1 shows the predictions of soil lead contents at different sections, under different traffics
and in different prediction years. All illustrate that lead contents on both sides of soils increase with the
increase of traffics after operation, at Duan-Hechi section, for examlple, the current lead background
value as 40.584mg/kg up to 41.025mg/kg in 2006, 43.118mg/kg in 2014, 44.26mg/kg in 2024. The lead
particles from exhaust gas will bring some pollution to the soil along the route. Meanwhile, the
increase of traffics accumulates soil lead very slowly and it will be even slower with the improvement
of non-lead vehicles in wide use. In comparison with the predictions and assessment standard values
(250-350mg/kg), a conclusion can be made that the increase of traffics in operation phase will not lead
to lead pollution on soil and crops on both sides of the highway.
One thing to make clear is that in China non-lead gas is in use. In the operation year 2004, nonlead
gas will be very popular, which means a very slight impact from lead exists .

4.2.1.3 ImpAct Analysis on Crops
By the experiment of pot rice and wheat planting in 1987-1988 at Xiashu and Yutan of Jiangsu
province, the lead input from 125 to 4000ppm leads to no evident influence on rice yield as well as
wheat yield from 125 to 2000ppm. The experiment also shows that the lead adoption for rice and wheat
increases with the higher Pb concentration in soil. When its kernels reach Ippm, the soil lead content
takes 2000-3000ppm. Therefore, the proposed highway construction will not lead to lead pollution on
46



crops along the highway and even less impact with the wide spread and use of non-lead gas.
The grape and pomegranate sampling analysis by Xian Highway Univ. at the National Trunk No
310 and at Guanting-Lingtong section of Xi-Ling Expressway in Shaanxi shows that the lead content in
fruits are lower than 0.2ppm, which means the light lead impact on fruits along the route. The test also
points out that the dust on leaf of neighboring plants are evidently lower than that of general roads,
which means the less impact on plant growth from traffic dust. Therefore, the proposed highway will
have slight influence on the fruit output and quality such as banana and longan.
4.2.2 Soil Erosion Prediction Assessment
4.2.2.1 Soil Erosion Prediction Model
The highway area is under sub-tropic monsoon climate, with rich rainfall and mild temperature. In
general, it has less soil erosion and following destruction in the highway counties and cities. But, the
proposed highway will under construction lasting 4 years (200022004), with large stone and earth
works, the roadway excavation taking 24250 mu of farmland. Soil erosion in some degree will occur in
rainy seasons before it can only be controlled and recovered in completion of drainage system, bank
protection and vegetation works. The soil erosion during construction can be predicted by the current
equation, addressed by the US Ministry of Agriculture as the following model:
A= R-K Ls C P                   (4.3)
where: A-soil erosion volume, t/km2.a;
R- rainfall erosion factor;
K-soil erosion factor;
Ls-grade length, grade factors;
C-:cover and management factors;
P-soil conservation factors.
4.2.2.2 Summary of Soil Erosion Impact
R in the formula 4.3 means the water erosion dynamic factor, having something to do with rainfall
and rain precipitation and rainfall intensity. It varies none before and after the highway construction. K:
soil susceptibility against erosion, which has some relation with soil particles and organic contents.
There are some crumb structure and medium percolation rate for the surface layer of farming land, then
its K value less than 0.4; the surface-under soil presents as blocky and laminated structure, with a
medium-lower percolation, the then K value between 0.42 and 0.46. Ls as grade length and grade
factors are called together geographical factor, calculated as the following way.
LS=(A/22.13)m(65.4Asin29+4.56sinB+0.065)
where:A-grade length from runoff point to where the slope sank to be sediment of sand or
runoff into wateir courses (m). Prior to construction: A= 50m, generally embankment
3-4m high andA=6m from pavement to drainage.
6-slope angles, e=I0Obefore the construction and e =34°after for the
embankment angels;
m-empirical parameters. When 8 =10°, m=0.5; when6=34°, m=0.8
By calculation, LS=4.574 prior to construction, LS=8.621 at embankment after construction.
The surface coverage factor C are taken from table 4-2-2 and 4-2-3. When no coverage on the
surface, C=1.0 as continuos free land, C=0.5 prior to construction and C=1.0 during construction, the
vegetation-destruction period. P values at work sites takes from table 4-2-4, P=0.7 for the farmland and
terraced field prior to highway construction, P=1.0 for the irregulated face by bulldozer and scraper
dozer.
The calculation of soil erosion are shown in table 4-2-5. It is 5.7 times larger than that before the
construction and the potential erosion intensity will reach the extreme level (80-150tlha.a). The 4-year
lasting construction will pass through several rainy seasons, resulting in unavoidable soil erosion. In
pavement construction phase, 3372.95x 104 m3 earth and stone works will be in use, which will damage
surface vegetation as well as the previous ground grade, disturbing the original stable surface.
Meanwhile, the vegetation to be damaged can not be recovered immediately at the early stage of
operation. The prevention and harnessment of soil erosion in highway construction must be taken into
account. The construction units must follow the demands in PRC Water and Soil Conservation Law, to
recover the vegetation at the same time of construction, to build up bank protection, drainage and
retaining banks etc. during highway construction. In doing so, the control of soil erosion from highway
47



construction can be realized earlier. The concrete practice can be seen in chapter 5.
3-5 years after operation, thanks to the recoverage of vegetation and improvement of drainage, the
soil erosion can be back to the former level as before construction. The grading of pavement and
vegetation of highway both will minimize the soil erosion. TherefFore, the heavier erosion during
construction is temporary.

The prediction of soil erosion in the construction phase is shown in Table 4-2-5. From the table we
can see that the extent of erosion during the construction is five times that before construction. The
existing erosion module in Nanning, Wuming and Mashang is 200 t per squire km, but during
construction, it is expected to be more than 1000 t per squire km. The module in both Duan and Hechi
can reach as high as 2000 t per squire km (moderate erosion). TherefDre, it is essential to prevent and
control the erosion during the construction. On completion of the alignment, the drainage systems and
slope protection works will contribute to mitigation of the erosion. The erosion will be restored to the
original level in two or three years time after it is put into operation. The erosion level will be alleviated
due to the upgraded pavement and plantation on both sides of the highway. Therefore, the serious
erosion during construction is temporary, and in the long-term, it will nmitigate the erosion in the areas.
The erosion mentioned above is resulted only from subgrade construction. The erosion resulted
from borrow and spoil sites is not predicted, which is estimated to be the same or less than the former.
4.2.2.3 Earth and Stone Works for Subgrade
The topography is complex with basins, plain light undulate areas or heavy hilly areas. In basin
and plain light undulate areas, filling is more than cutting. The elevation of subgrade is expected to be
about 3.5 m. There is both filling and cutting in heavy rolling areas with cutting in the lead. The
construction will utilize material excavated from cut within the road-right- of-way for embankment
fills. The amount of filling, cutting,utilization and borrow is shown in Table 4-2-6. When there is
48



shortage of earth and stone, they will be excavated from borrow pits and quarries nearby. It is not
permitted to excavate earth or stones at both sides of the alignment sporatically. To do so will use much
farmland or damage vegetation resulting in soil erosion.
4.2.3 Analysis of Impact of Borrow on Environment
4.2.3.1 Distribution of Material and Haulage
According to Chapter Two (See Annex tables), the areas along the proposed alignment are rich in
road-making material with high quality of different kinds. All material except steel, timber and asphalt
can be available in the construction areas. Earth pits and stone quarries are shown in Fig. 4-1.
Earth is less along the proposed highway, especially at the section of Shuiren [Duan, so the earth
for subgrade will be pitted on the site, but not from farmland.
4.2.3.2 Environmental Impact from Highway Borrowing
Soil amount is sizable for the basement, especially for expressways. Shuiren-Duan section is
under class-two and Duan-Nanning the expressway.
All the spots the expressway passes at Mashan, Wuming and Nanning etc. are distributed with some
mounds or small hills, with barren bushes on. All the mounds and hills can be sources for soil
borrowing and they can be farmland after borrowing. It is favourable to local agriculture.
The Shuiren-Duan section is mountainous, lack of soil. Only hills can be places for borrowing and
no allowance of farmland borrowing is acceptecl. This section under class 2 is not badly needing soil,
the plan soil amount as 200,000 m3, which will take 90m farmland, 95% of which are slopes, dryland,
grassland and forestry land. It leads to slight impact on local agriculture.

4.2.3.3 Environmental Impact from Highway Spoils
The spoil occurs mainly at Shuiren-Daxing section. The class 2 highway has its plan spoil of earth as
210,000 m3, of stone as 350,000 m3' all of which are to be put at suitable valleys and troughs with
design of soil and water conservation.
There is less, spoils of earth and stone at Daxing-Nanning section. Some low-lying places are chosen
as spoil sites with design of water and soil conservation.
Therefore, the spoil sites along Shui-Nan highway will bring slight environrental impact. The filling
of velleys and low-lying places with spoils is a good way to change the wasteland into farmland. The
construction unit have made such plans in operation plan for the reduction of ill-impact from land-
taking.
4.2.4 Impact on wild Animals and Plants
4.2.4.1 Analysis of Impact on Wild Animals
In the territory of Guangxi Region there are some rare species of animals under protection of
national level such as shinisaurus crocodilurus, white-headed laugur, yellow-belly tragopan. Due to
frequent human activities and advanced farming, large wild animals are rarely found except in the
mountainous areas in Duan and Hechi Counties. Large animals are: monkey, wild dog, boar, paguma
larvata, muntjac, Rrinaceeus earopaeus, Manis pentadactyla, goat, otter and musk deer. Birds are;
magpie, owl, cuokoo, Garrulax canorus, crow, conure and mandarin duck etc. There are some other
wild reptiles and insects. By investigations, the project area are crowded for local people activities, that
is why there seldom is wild animals, nor rare animals under state-level protecton. The proposed
highway at Duan and Hechi sections adopt class 2 degree, not enclosed, which means a slight influence
for local animal activities. So, nearly no impact exists to local wild animals. The construction workers
will be trained to protect local animals and hunting is prohibited, although there are little influence on
wild animals.

4.2.4.2 Short-term and Long-term Vegetation Change
The most obvious change of vegetation will occur during the construction due to damage to
vegetation because of using large amount of land. In addition, within 20 m of the right-of-way will be
damaged by human construction activities. The damage to vegetation varies due to different factors
such as cutting, filling, ways of construction of bridges and subgrades.
(1) Sections of filling
Because the most sections are filling ones, the earth and stones mainly come from sections of cutting
by transferring longitudinally. The rest comes from the local pits and quarries with a distance of 1 krm
or more. At the filling sections, the damage to vegetation is resulted from construction machinery,
transportation vehicles and human activities. In general, this kind of damage is considered destructive.
But when the outside damage stops completely, the vegetation on either side will be likely to be
restored to the original level. As a whole, in two years time in operation, the vegetation wrill be restored
basically. In fifteen years time, the vegetation cover will be much better than it used to be.
(2) Section of cutting
Most parts of the alignment of Hechi-Shuiren section from the north of Mashan county town to Duan
County is mainly of heavy rolling areas. To build the embankkment, either filling or cutting is needed
with the latter causing disturbance to the slope. As a result, vegetation will be destroyed, and large
areas of exposure will occur. Thus the soil erosion will become more severe. Therefore, i.t is suggested
that drainage ditches and mortar stone protection slopes be built at the places where the height of the
cutting slope is above 8 m, and plantation will be made at smoother slopes. The vegetation is expected
to be restored in second year after plantation.
4.2.5 Impact on Ecosystem
From the angle of biomass, 1,020,000 trees of different kinds will be cut down; 7797 mu of land will
be used (excluding orchards), which will reduce the biomass along the alignment. However, the
physico-chemical properties will not change for the worse due to many factors such as extensive
farming, developed artificial ecosystem, complete irrigation systems, etc.After the highway put into
operation, the plantation at the dividers and on the slopes will make up for the loss of the biomass. At
some enclosed sections, both the native and artlificial grasses will grow well, thus providing small
animals and birds with habitats to increase biodiversity. The plantation will not only add to beauty to
the scenery but also increase biodiversity to encourage farming production.
Because of the fact that the alignment goes along hilly and high areas with w'ell developed
vegetation, the construction will not have significant impact on the ecosystem along the road.
4.2.6 Impact of Poor Geology on the Project
There are some weak soil layers in the rice fields at low lands. In addition, at the heavy undulate
areas, the alignment passes through the areas with weak rocks and deep relic layers. Collapse and slide
may happen during cutting. Besides, near Nanning, there is some expansion soil. To guarantee the
quality of the project, appropriate engineering measures will be taken. See Table 4-2-7 for detail.

4.2.7 Summary
(1) From the result of analysis we know that the contents of lead in soil, com and vegetables is below
the standards, which means that they have not been polluted by lead.
(2) According to prediction, the lead contents in 2024 (long-term  phase of operation) will reach
about 39mg/kg with traffic volume increases. But it is still much below the assessment standards
(250mg/kg).
(3) 11,676 mu of farmland will be occupied for the project, and this will have certain adverse impact
on farming causing direct loss of 7.473 million yuan, especially in the mountainous areas of Duan
County.
(4) The project is expected to have certain impact on the natural landform and topography due to the
construction of embankments and tunnels disturbing the runoff and irrigation system.
(5) The geologically poor sections will have certain impact on the quality of the proposed project
which must be paid attention to in designing and construction.
4.3 Prediction Assessment of Impact on Water Environment
The pollution to water environment during operation comes mainly from vehicular exhaust
emissions as well domestic and oily sewage from the service centers of the high-class highways.
During the construction phase the pollution mainly comes frorn the domestic sewage of the
construction workers.
4.3.1 Pollution Prediction of Surface Runoff
(1) Analysis of pollution sources of surface runoff
1 Pollutant concentrations of surface runoff
There are lots of factors affecting pollution of runoff taking in precipitation, period of rainfall,
pollution extent of air related to the pavement, width of pavement etc. All these factors vary greatly.
Based on the data collected and results monitored, the pollutant concentrations are shown in Table 4-3-
1.

(2) Pollution Prediction of Pavement Runoff
52



Based on the related locations of highway to the surface water (crossing or going along), the run-off
will be predicted using different models respectively.
C Diaojiang River and the Hongshui River
The relationship of the proposed project to the two rivers is vertical crossing. Most runoff from the
bridge pavement runs into the water bodies with some drained into the drainage ditches at the two ends
of bridges. The pollution of the pavement runoff in the early period can be predicted by using the
completely mixed model considering the less degradation of the pollutants in the runoff.
The model is as follows:
QICI+QoCo
C =                                  4(4.4)
Qi+Qo
where: C-concentrations of pollutants at prediction cross sections, mg/I;
Q -River capacity m3/s in dry season;
Qo-Polluted runoff, m3 /s;
C,-Background concentrations of certain pollutants in the river, mg/I;
CO- Concentrations of certain pollutants of pavement runoff,mg/l.
The results are in Table 4-3-3.

Note: unit mg/I. The capacity of the Diao River in the dry season is 3.24 m'/s; that of Hongshui River is 203 m' /s.
C The Chenghe River
The alignment goes on either side of the river from Jioutun to Jiangpo (K 165 +000 OK170 + 700) in
the vicinity totaling eight km (Kl 63 - 171). The model for pollution of runoff is as follows:
QtCI + nqoC0
C =                =_(4.5) _
Q1nqo
where: C- Pollutant concentrations at prediction cross section, mg/I;
Qr- River capacity in the dry season, m3/s;
Qo-Runoff of i outlet on the parallel section, m3/s;
Co-Pollutant concentrations in the rain on pavement, mg/I;
n- Number of outlets in use; (the number of outlets in two hours in the river)
The model shows the general effect of n outlets on the completely mixed section when the alignment
is parallel to the river. (Applies to the narrow rivers)
According to Electri.city Book of Duan County, the max. Capacity of Cheng River is 790 m3/s, while
the min. one is 1.31 m3/s; the speed is I m/s. The effect of effective outlets of runoff on downstream is
shown in Table 4-3-4.

Table 4-34 shows that in the early stage, the runoff has very significant impact on the water quality
in Cheng River in a very short time, and lasts for a short while (4 hours). The data in Table 4-3-4 is its
peak level with the concentration variation distributed evenly.
Table 4-3-4 also shows that at the early stage of runoff, the water quality is about Class 4 in GB
3838-88. Although the Cheng River is the water source for Duan County, the proposed highway will
not have noticeable effect on the water quality due to the fact that the runoff outlet is 20 km apart, and
that the river has its own effective selfOpurification ability.

Depth of diffusion is taken as 2m; distance of outlet as 200m. The effect of both reservoirs on water
quality is shown in Fig. 4-2 OFig. 4-5. From Fig. 4-2 and 4-3 we can see that in Shuiren Reservoir at
the early period of runoff (within 2 hours), within 50 m from either side the water is polluted by COD;
within 100m polluted by oil. Fig. 4-4 and 4-5 show that in Nada Reservoir in the early period of runoff
within 100 m the water is polluted by COD; within 200m by oil. The lead emitted by motor vehicles
deposits along with mud and sand. Leadifree petrol will be used in thie near future, so it will be of no
problem. The effect of runoff on the water quality in both reservoirs is expected to be shortlterm and
intermittent.
4.3.2 Impact Analysis of Sewage from Service Center
There will be two service centers according to the feasibility study report. For the lack of the data of
the auxiliary faci]ities, it is difficult to calculate pollution extent at the service centers. Therefore, what
we can do now is just to estimate the pollution extent based on the information available and our
experiences.
1) One service center is supposed with stores, hotels and restaurants. There supposed to have: 35
management staff members, 25 workers of filling stations and repair shtops and 400 passengers (most of
them stay only for a short time). Counting with the sewage volume as 200L per day per capital, the
total domestic sewage will be 92m3 taking in sewage from restaurants, offices, bathrooms and faeces.
Suppose the concentrations of COD = 500mg/l, BOD5 = 220 mg/l, oil = 100 mg/I, then the source of
pollutants: COD = 46kg/d, BOD5 = 20.4 kg/d, oil = 8.8 kg/d.
2) Car washing water: In 2020 in operation phase, the predicted traffic volume is 16200/d. The
number of cars that need washing is supposed to be 2%, 292 cars will be washed every day. If 400 1 of
water is used with 70% recycled, the drainage will be 35m3/d. The pollution emission rate will be:
COD = 7 kg/d, BOD5 = 2.3 kg/d, oil = 1.05 kg /d.
3) The pollution emission at the filling stations and repair shops is estimated: COD = 12kg/d,
BOD5 = 5kg/d, oil = 4kg/d.
Put together, the pollution resource extent: COD = 65/d, BOD5 = 24.7kg/d, oil = 13.82kg/d. The
annual emission: 23.73t of COD, 9.02t of BOD5, 5.06t of oil. Therefore, the sewage can not be emitted
before dealt with. It is suggested that the sewage at the centers be treated comprehensively. Car
washing water must be recycled to satisfy class-one emission standard in GB 8978088. Sewage
treatment procedures at the service centers will adopt secondary biological treatment procedure.
The procedure is as follows:
sewage      I septic tank        small sewage processor
4.3.3 Analysis of Water Pollution in Construction Phase
The pollutant sources during the construction may be:
1) The water in the river may be turbid due to mud excavation and material washing during bridge
construction. To prevent it from happening, drop shaft sinking and cofferdam methods and other
advanced techniques will be used in construction.
54



Fig. 4-2,4-5
55



2) The domestic sewage dunrng the construction will be dealt with properly. Feces, after treated, can
be used as manure for farming. Both the sewage and feces will not be allowed to be emitted into the
river without disposal.
3) Leakage of oil and waste oil will not be discharged into the river.
4) Material such as asphalt, oil, chemicals will be kept in a proper way to prevent them from running
into rivers with rain.Because it is difficult to make qualitative prediction of the effect factors,
preventive measures will be carried out, and management will be strengthened in advance to reduce
potential impact on water bodies.
4.3.4 Risk Analysis of Hazardous Material Spill
It is inevitable to transport toxic and hazardous goods by using the new highway when completed. Its
risk analysis is as follows:
n
P  n Qi =QIxQ2xQ3XQ4XQSXQ6                    (4.7)
where, P-Probability of risk in the water areas in the predicted years;
Ql- Probability of severe accidents at present, (time/million v.km);
Q2- Absolute annual traffic volume in the predicted year,(million v./y)
Q3- Reduction rate of accident of expressway, (%);
Q4- Ratio of trucks to total traffic volume (%);
Qs- Ratio of trucks carrying hazardous goods (%);
Q6- Length of section along the river, km.
The value of parameters in the model:
Q,- With reference of the probability of the traffic accidents in the similar Areas;
Q,=0.17 time/million v.km;
Q2- According to the predicted traffic volume, the traffic volume in 2010 is 2.6
million/y, in 2020 it is 5.8 million /y;
Q3-According to the American data, the rate of accident reduction of expressway is 75%;
Q3 = 25%;
Q4- According to the OD investigation of the feasibility study report, Q4=59%;
Qs-According to the OD investigation of the feasibility study, the vehicles carrying
hazardous goods accounts for 6.5% of the total
Q6-Length of sections close to rivers and reservoirs, Q6=17.0km
The results are in Table 4-3-5. Table 4-3-5 shows lower probability of the traffic accidents that can
cause water pollution, i.e. 0.085 times in 2014, 0.19 times in 2024, but the slight possibility may occur.
Therefore, some necessary protective measures will be taken to protect the water bodies.

year                           probability of traffic accidents (time/year)
2014                                         0.085
2024                                         0.19
4.3.5 Conclusions and Suggestions
The assessment results demonstrate that the water quality in all these rivers and reservoirs is similar.
Except COD in Diao River exceeds class-three standard, the other iterms of indexes all satisfy Class-II
standard. Therefore, the water quality belongs to Class-II, wich is fairly good.
The results also show that the runoff in the early stage has minor impact on the water quality. But the
runoff has certain effect on the water quality in Cheng River which is of short-term (for 2 hours), but
with great increment. The runoff has certain effect on the water in both Shuiren and Nada Reservoirs.
During the first two hours, within 200 m from the bank CODcr and oi[l in the water is in excess of the
relevant standards of surface water. However, this kind of effect is decreased with time by natural
diffusion and degradation.

this prediction, the model developed by Xian Highway University through many tests and analyses on
high-class highways is adopted. See Table 4-4-2. No revision will be made in coarseness and slope

4. The additional attenuation varies with types of embankment, elevation of pavement to ground
level, landform  on either side of the highway and other factors. Therefore the attenuation will be
calculated section by section.
4.4.2 Prediction of Traffic Noise
The predicted traffic level of various section has been calculated in the light of traffic flow and flat
type of embankment (without additional attenuation). See Table 4-4-3 which directly reflects the noise

4.4.3 Assessment of Impact of Traffic Noise
4.4.3.1 Prediction Level of Environmental Noise at Sensitive Locations
The environmental noise in the operation phase at sensitive spots is obtained by counting
the predicted traffic noise with attenuation and its background level. The environmental noise
predicted at the residential quarters is shiown in Annex table 6. The schools, villages and
hospitals with great excess of noise are listed in
Table 4-4-4 and 4-4-5 respectively.

4.4.3.2 EIA of Traffic Noise
1. Residential areas in villages
The ambient noise level in the operation phase in Table 4-4-4 shows:
(1) The noise level at the residential centers in both short terrm (2006) and long term (2024) operation
in daytime is consistent with class-four standards except for a minor places. No obvious impact on the
acoustic environment has been found in daytime.
(2) At night, however, the noise level exceeds to some extent. In short-term, 4 places are in excess by
5dB with the greatest being 7.0 dB; in medium-term, 13 places will be in excess by 5 dB with the
greatest being 9.5 dB; in year 2024, 14 places will be in excess by 5dB with the greatest being 10.4 dB.
We know from Table 44-4 that the noise will disturb the residents with sleep.
2. Schools and hospitals
From Table 44-5, we can see that
(1) In operation phase in daytime, the traffic noise will have some impact on teaching in the schools
at Lintang, Daxing, Keyang, Baishe, Linjiang, Gucai and Qide, and Duan Hospital. 1Therefore, it is
necessary that appropriate preventive measures be taken at these places. Yongning primary school is
seriously beyond the standards, reaching 15dB in year 2006, mainly from the Nan-Wu class-two
highway. At present time, it is under large impact on its teaching surroundings. Some prevention
measures must be taken.
(2) Although the noise level exceeds the standards at night, it does not interfere with the teaching
61



because there are not teaching activities at that time.
(3) The project does have impact on one hospital (Duan), so engineering measures are needed.
(4) Weizou(K168+400) Primary School is Seriously beyond the standard in prediction, but it will be
removed because the land is acquired by the project.
(5) Noise pollution extent
The percentage of the population affected by the traffic noise to the population as a whole is called
noise pollution extent. Table 4-4-4 shows that in year 2024, 35 villages are in excess, from which 21
villages exceed the standards by more than 3.0dB conceming 4948 people of 1547 households. The
actual people affected by noise are only about 1/8 that of the whole population in these villages (about
620 people). Based on calculation, the pollution extent is 1.7%. We can conclude that, as a whole, the
proposed project has minor noise impact on the environrment. However, in order to minimize the
impact, some noiseOmitigate measures are essentially needed at the sensitive locations suffering from
noise pollution severely.
4.4.4 Impact of Noise during Construction Phase
4.4.4.1 Analysis of Noise Sources
Noise sources mostly come from construction and haulage machinery including excavators,
bulldozers, levelers, mixers and rollers. For their noise levels, see Table 4-4-6.
Table 4-4-6    Noise Levels of Machinery at Different Distances unit:dB(A)

mixer              87     81      75      69    65.5    63    61    57.5    55         51.5
Note: The levels at a distance of 5 m are the actual levels monitored.
4.4.4.2 Impact analysis on Acoustic Environment in Construction phase
According to the noise standards for construction site borders, i(GB12523-90), the noise limit in
daytime is 70-75 dB, 55dB at night. Table 4-4-6 shows:
1. The noise levels of the machinery at 40 m beyond in daytime can meet the standards; at 200 m
beyond at night.
2. Most villages in the study sections are beyond 40 m. So construction in daytime will not have
noticeable impact on residents; however, at night it does.
3. 9 schools are located within 100m from the proposed alignment. The construction will affect these
schools in their teaching.
4.4.5 Vibration Impact Analysis of Construction
Vibration impact occurs in construction phase mostly. In construct:ion activities, mechanical vibration
will occur inevitably causing annoyance or even harm to people.
1) Vibration in road construction
Mechanical vibration in construction comes from vibrating type rollers, levelers, loaders and
spreaders. At filling sections, both people and buildings at the sensitive spots near the alignment will be
affected by mechanical vibration. The brick farmhouses are not like'ly to be vulnerable to the vibration
(75dB in daytime, 73dB in nighttime).
2) Vibration in bridge construction
Drilled gout piles will be adopted for pier foundation. The noise levels within 45.2m in daytime and
55.Om at night exceed the standards according to GBJI1- 89 (Design Criteria for Construction
Vibration)..
4.4.6 Summary
1) During operation phase the noise levels meet classOfour standlards in daytime at villages; exceed
the standards at night to certain extent: 5 places beyond 5dB in shortOterm; 15 places in
mediumOterm; 16 places in longOterm. Seen as a whole, the traffic noise has minor impact on the
62



acoustic environment in the studv areas.
2) In operation phase the traffic noise has significant effect on six schools in Badu and Naliang. The
effect extent increases with the traffic volume, so to sound proof measures must be taken.
3) Afforestation along the proposed highway should be promoted. With the growth of more
vegetation and plantation of trees, the noise levels will be lower than predicted along the alignment.
4) Noise impact in construction phase is of short-term. By strengthening management and
monitoring, the impact will be reduced to a minimum.
To summarize, from the view of point of environmental protection noise pollution problem can be
controlled by strengthening mitigation measures. Therefore, the project is viable environmentally.

2. Calculation result
The concentrations of CO and NOx at the cross sections of Ping Village, Jiou Village, Batan,
Badu, Lingquan and Ou Village are predicted. Refer to 4-5-3 for the results.
Table 4-5-3 demonstrates:
1)In 2024 after it is put in operation, the average daily and hourly concentrations of CO at six cross
sections will not exceed class-two standards with their highest levels of 1.699 mg/m:3 and 3.077
mg/m3 individually.
2)In 2024, the average daily concentrations of NOx at six cross sections will not exceed the limit
level with their highest levels of 0.080 mg/M3; hourly concentrations are also adhere to the standards
except for a few locations which exceed the standards by 0.17 times. However, beyond 2
5m, they are all in consistent with the second class in GB3090- 1996.
In conclusion, the construction of the project will not have significant adverse effect on the air
quality.
4.5.2 Quality Assessment of Ambient Air at the Sensitive Locations
The concentrations of CO and NOx calculated according to existing enviromnent, traffic volume
and climatic conditions and Table 4-5-3, are showri in Annex Table 7.

It shows that thev are all comply n,vith class-two standards in. GB3095-1996. Therefore, the
operation of the highway uwill have no obvious inmpact on the air quality.

4.5.3 Environmental Impact Analysis of Construction Dust
Dust coming from earth and lime mixing sites and machinery contributes to air pollution during
construction. It pollutes the air to a great extent.
Monitoring of TSP shows that at 50m from the earth and lime mixing sites, the TSP are as high as
1.00 mg/m3; at 100m apart from earth and mixing stations near storage sites the TSP are 1.65 mg/m3; at
150m they are 1.00mg/m3.
TSP is resulted mainly from the secondarv dust of transport vehicles. To prevent dust,, water will be
sprayed.
4.5.4 Summary
1) CO, NOx and TSP in the study areas are generally comply with class-two standards of GB3096-
1996. The air is clean and clear.
2) In 2024 the average daily concentrations of both CO and NOx do not exceed the standards. The
hourly concentrations, however, exceeds the standards near roadside at a few locations wvithin 25m. No
significant impact will occur on ambient air.
3) The predicted levels of pollutant concentrations are all consistent with class-two standards of
3096-1996. During the operation phase, it does riot have significant impact on ambient air.
4) Construction dust has noticeable impact on air, so preventive measures will be taken.
4.6 Engineering Analysis and Aesthetics
4.6.1 Engineering Analysis
4.6.1.1 Impact on Existing Local Roads
In construction, the haulage of road-building materials will have impact on local and country roads
in the following ways:
(1) Increase of dust and noise;
(2) Damage to pavement of the roads;
Therefore, rational haulage routes will be chosen for material haulage to minimize the impact.
The proposed highway will have 50kn long paralleling the National HighwayNo.210, which means
No.210 will be transport passage in construction phase and will lead to problems as traffic jams and
road damage etc.
4.6.1.2 Interfere with systems of irrigation
The proposed highway will cross densely irrigation systems and webs on the way, crisscrossing
plenty of irrigation canals, although the design unit has detoured some major canals to ensure the
regular operation of irrigation. At some sections, there are enough culverts(980) to be built up. In
doing so, the runoff drainage and canal circulation are no more a problem. In highway engineering, the
construction at possible channelOdisturbance section will be in priority, and proceed at non-irrigation
seasons as far as possible. Then the construction of highway will be less influential to local irrigation.
4.6.1.3 Influence to the flood-discharge system
Along the Hechi-Mashan section, it is a high-flood area. Single spans over rivers are commonly
accepted there. The discharge capacity of the bridge design for occurrence of 100 years basically meets
the anti-flood needs in courses. The Jiutun-Jiangpo section, along with Chengjiang river for 6km,
proceeds at hills. It will not impact much on local flood prevention. Still, management and organization
will be strengthened during construction in case ol-subgrade construction in flood season (July-Sep.).
4.6.1.4 Impact on the sources of water supply
The highly mountainous villages along the route in Duan County drink water from the reservoirs,
which are easily polluted by the highway, even it will be easily destroyed. Before the construction,
suitable sites will be reselected for rebuilding of new reservoirs and pipes for local people.
Chengjiang River is the water source of Duan County. The proposed highway will have 6 km length
of parallel section along the river. However, the location of water intake is beyond 20m in the middle of
67



the river. Based on the impact analysis on the w ater environment, the proposed highway will not impact
much on the water quality of the water source. To prevent the unfavourable impact, measures must be
strengthened in the construction.
4.6.2 Aesthetics Analysis and Suggestions
No cultural relics of both national and local level are found.
4.6.2.1 Aesthetics Analysis along the Highway
The route alignment is smooth with wide view, rolling hills, numerous rivers and beautiful
farmhouses which are a particular scenery. Comparison of scenery prior to and after the construction is
shown in Picture A and B.
1. Scenic view
1) The topography falls into alluvial plains between low hills and valleys among heavy rolling areas.
The near scenery consists mainly of beautiful farmland, villages, rivers and hills. The long scenery
consists of undulate mountains with clear outlines showing peculiar landscape of landform and
topography.
2) The humane landscape includes country roads, bridges, electricity networks etc.
3) The scenic zone of Yilingyan has peculiar beauties with rolling mountains of different shapes. It is
known as small Guilin. See Picture A.
2. Seasonally scenic view
The study areas belong to subtropical, humid and monsoon climate with no frost year around. The
four seasons remain green with plenty rainfalls, thick forests and nurnerous rivers. Riding along the
highway, the passengers feel they are in landscape paintings.
4.6.2.2 Environmental Impact Analysis on Large Cutting Sections
Shuiren-Nanning Highway is located in the central and northem parts of Guangxi. On the edge of
Yungui Plateau, section from Shuiren to Daxing is 66.4232m long, it passes through large mountains
and deep valleys where clawed topography is well developed, with narrow gullies and high ridges.
According to the topography and the high-class of this section, it is impossible for the highway to
detour the above mentioned unfavorable topography and large excavation is inevitable. As the

section from Daxing to Nanning, it passes through slightly rolling plain. There are a lot of low hills,
and their peaks hinder the layout of the alignment. Especially at Gaofeng Forest where there are rolling
hills, high ridges, steep slopes, deep and wvide gullies, though advantageous topographical spots have
been chosen as many as possible for the alignment of the highway, it is still impossible for the highway
to detour all the above mentioned unfavorable topography and large excavation is also unavoidable.
From repeated investigation, statistical data obtained for the sections requiring large excavations along
the proposed highway are as listed in the table below.
The WB EP experts and engineers, with design unit, construction unit and EIA unit, have made a
precise survey in order to reduce the areas of cutting hills and large cutting sections. Especially the
design members have made a great deal of work on it. Step by step, a best plan out of 3 altematives is
chosen out after a detailed study on such items as reducing cut hill amounts, land acquisition amounts
and removement, route lining and construction disturbance etc.
1. Different Technical Standard was Taken in Design
As Shuiren-Nanning Highway has a total length of 236.492km, to which different technical
standards have been adopted according to the predicted amount of traffic and actual topography.
Shuiren-Duan section is 97.153km long and its subgrade is 15m wide. It is to be constructed according
to class 2 highway standard. Of the section, Shuiren-Daxing section is 66.637km long, and is to be
constructed according to the standards of class 2 highway in heavily rolling hills, with a designed
vehicle speed of 60km/h, usual minimum planar curve of 200m, ultimate minimum curve of 125m and
maximum longitudinal slope of 6%, which can be relaxed at some spots where the standards are too
difficult to be adopted because of the actual topography; Daxing-Duan section is 30.680km long, and is
to be constructed according to the standards of class 2 highway in slightly rolling plain, with a designed
vehicle speed of 80km/h, usual minimum planar curve of 400m, ultimate minimum curve of 250m and
maximum longitudinal slope of 5%. Duan-Nanning section is 139.339km long, and is to be constructed
according to the standards of expressway. Its designed vehicle speed is lOOkm/h, usually its minimum
planar curve is 700m, ultimate minimum curve is 400m and maximum longitudinal slope is 4% to
which 1% can be added at some spots where it is too difficult to be adopted because of the actual
topography or other reason after verified by technical and economic studies.
2. Selection of the Best Route
According to the requirements of the above itechnical standards, the alignment of the highway has
been determined on the topographical maps in scales of 1/50000 and 1/2000, with the alternative ones
taken as many as possible for comparison. in situ investigations have been conducted to check the
actual conditions and opinions from the local govermments have been solicited. According to the local
topographical, geological, meteorological and environmental conditions, the preliminary alignmnent
scheme was determined, reported to the responsible leaders and was discussed and analyzed by the
organized personnel concemed. The final alignment scheme was worked out based on the agreement
between every side concerned. Afterwards, the surveying personnel carried out the in situ layout of the
alignment, investigation and collection of various data, and compiled the preliminary design document.
The optimum alignment scheme has been taken as the preliminary alignment scheme based on the
comparison between the recommended scheme and the 12 altemative alignment schemes whose length
is 151.64km, making up 64.08% of the total length of the section.
3. Comparison of the Selected Route with Feasibility Study Route
The designers compared the selected route with feasibility one late. The data of comparison in
study can be seen in the following table 4-6-1.
Table 4-6-l comparison between the preliminary design and engineering feasible design

Preliminary scheme          236.491           66           28226127         2426677
Amount decreased             1.424    |       16           6994949           502911
It can be seen from the table that after the adjustment of the alignment and optimization in the
preliminary design phase, the amount of earth/stone work is reduced by 6,994,949m (about 20%) and
the area of side slopes is reduced by 502,911m2 (about 17%) respectively, in spite of increase of
subgrade width from 12 meter up to 15 meter, which is certainly beneficial to environmental protection.
The decrease of earth/stone work is resulted mainly from the careful comparison and opttimization in
7:3



the design. It may also be caused bv the different scales of maps used in the engineering feasible design
and preliminary design for the prediction of earth/stone work because in the former the scale is 1/1000
whereas in the latter the scale is 1/2000.
4.Adjustment the Road Location
It has less resources in the project area, especially at the cutting hills and mountainous sections,
where the land is arable, I mu less farmingland per farmer. It is an important factor in the project not to
take more land in route design. The researchers have done great work on those excavating places as the
following:
scheme 1: too much land taking
1:1
sche e 2: too much excavation work
and large earth erosion
1:0.75
scme 3: less land taking,
1:1   less excavation of hills,
1:0.3  as the rec         e
The deeper survey, the lesser amounts f excavations, cutting height, areas, and earth/stone work.
After adjustment of the overall alignme t and careful design, the number of sections where large
excavation is to be carried out is reduced rom 68 (attached 8 for its spots and works) to 61 so that the
impact on the environment is also reducek. The location of 61-cutting points are showed in Fig.4-6.
The detailed data can be found in the following table.

Note: Large excavation is defined as a cutting point which heigth is over 10 meter and length is over 80 meter.
Because all the excavation will be carried out at passes, spurs or ridges where the living condition is
poor and fewer people are inhabited, so the construction will cause less impact on the local people.
5. Environmental Considerations Taken in the Selection of the Best Route
The recommended alignment scheme and all the 12 alternative ones have been chosen on the basis
of layout of the alignment in plan and elevation, excavation, amount of work involved, land to be
acquisitioned, houses to be demolished and people to be resettled and environmental impact.
A. Comparison of investment.
B. Comparison of earth/stone work in subgrade.
C. Comparison of exposed area of side slopes.,
D. Comparison of least filled side slopes.
E. Various slopes are designed according to Chinese Specifications of the maximum and minimum
longitudinal slopes and corresponding lengths. Though the longitudinal slopes may be large or small,
-short or long in view of the actual topography, the amount of excavation and fill, the national
specifications will always be followed so as to reduce the amount of work and investment. As to the
super long slopes, they have not been encountered in the preliminary design so that there are no data
available. Based on the data of trapezoid longitudinal slopes and straight long slopes, there are little
differences in the quantities of construction work between them, and as to which is superior, there are
no test data available, so the corresponding data cannot be provided so far.
74



H. Comparison of resettlement.
6. Elimination of Platform (mitigation measure 1)
To reduce the width of excavation in rocks so as to mitigate the environmental impact, for sections
where the rocks are so sound that no pieces of rocks can fall down, platforms to collect them will no
longer be provided, which results in a decrease of the cross sectional area of excavation, the amount of
exploded earth/stone work and the exposed area of slopes, which is beneficial to environmental
protection.
7. Typical Mitigation measures for environmental protection
For the 61 sections where large excavation is required, the actual conditions can be divided into
two cases based on preliminary investigation. In the first case, the excavation is to be carried out in
sound limestone, such as at sections K117+000-KI21+096, K138+150-K138+264 and
K139+906-K209+804, which contain 15 sections of large excavation, with a total length of 4.913km,
total exploded volume of stone of 1703223m3 and total exposed area of 119139m2. The side slopes of
the exploded cross section are taken as 1:0.5 for the first layer and 1:0.3 for the following lower layers,
at every lOm excavation from the bottom, a platforrn. as wide as 1.5m will be provided. After
excavation, the original gray mountain will be tumed into white slopes, resulting in the damage of the
original landscape. In order to mitigate the impact on the landscape caused by excavation, on each
platform, bricks or stone plates will be used to build troughs, into which fertile soil will be put so as to
grow evergreen vines and climbers that can make the surroundings green in the vertical direction and
restore the original landscape. In the second case" mudstone, shale, sandstone, marls, limestone,
siliceous shale, dolomite, fine sandstone, sandy mudstone, calcium sandstone, etc. in the Devonian
Period are encountered, the surface soils mainly consist of clay, sand and gravel, etc. in the Quaternary
Period. According to the actual geological and meteorological conditions, most of the side slopes for
the other 46 sections of larger excavation are taken as 1:1 for the upper layer, and 1:0.75 for the
following lower layers, with few taken as 1:1.25 for the upper layer and 1:0.5 for the following lower
layers respectively. All the exposed slopes are protected by inverse V shaped or arch shaped frame
made of stone plate cemented with mortar, with grasses or flowers planted in them, so that all the
exposed slopes will be covered by vegetation, resulting in beautiful landscapes on both side of
highway.
8. Impact Analysis
It is inevitable for a large excavation at lime sections. The reduction of excavation and areas have
been done, as well as the landscape consideration at those sections. The further effort will be made in
the detail design to further lessen the impacts on the landscape of limestone mountains, so the impacts
on the landscape of limestone will be limited in minimum.
4.6.2.3 Analysis of Impact of Project on Scenery
It is unavoidable to have certain adverse impact on vegetation because of cutting at hilly areas
leading to exposure of slopes, thus effecting the scenery along the alignment.
By statistics, there are 61 larger cut slopes. Statistics of Cutting Sections along Shui-Nan Highway.
Mostly the slope spots are situated at Shuiren-Daxin section, 46 spots. As the area is mainly of lime
stone mountains, white in colour after cutting, which doesn't fit in with the existing grey in scenery.
The traffic bureaus in Guangxi province are very much experienced for mitigating the influence of
scenry from cutting. Turf can be covered on gentle slopes,(as on Nan-Liu and Nan-Bei expressways) to
recover and beautify the route landscape, as that in the Picutre E.F.G
To decrease the amount of cutting, some cutting slopes have to be steep, on which turf can not be
planted. It will lower the landscape quality. To solve such a problem, we have got an examination, and
found that,
1) The cutting slopes of quarries will grow grass naturally after a half or one year. The recovered
view can be seen in Picture H. Picture H is a quarry, a new excavation spot in the rmiddle and an
previous one on right side of the hill (a little grey) with green grass in four month of excavation.
2) The investigation on the current National Highway 210 some steep cutting slopes are changing its
colour by weathering from white to grey, which fits in with the surrounding colour. The colour
recovering period can be 3-5 years long.
3)In cracks of lime stones, grass or bushes grow naturally.
75



4) Because of therich rainfall in the project area, some climbing plants can grow well, such as
Bonston ivy, which goes up 20m higher. Therefore, some artifical methods can be adopted to deal with
the steep slopes to fasten the natural scenery recovery.
The highway construction will lead to some impact to local landscape, mostly at the phase of
construction. 3-5 years (or shorter) after operation, the route scenery will return.
Besides the technical standards in linear designing, aesthetic function is alsotaken in account for
combination of perfect linear design and natural landscape.
4.6.2.4 Suggestions on Scenery Design
Suggestions are divided into two parts:
a. Scenery design related to cities and towns
The connecting parts with cities and towns should be coordinated with the city scale. The
interchanges and the road border marks will be the symbols of the city or towns. Therefore, it is
suggested that the interchanges and road border marks be designed as scenic design to beautify these
cities and towns.
b. Scenery design remote from cities and towns
It is required to coordinate with the natural landscape when to do so. It is important to center on
three 0dimension view design to satisfy the requirement of smooth lines. The natural scenic resources
will be made good use of to ensure that the design is rich in varieties and the natural environment is
protected. The marks left in construction will be repaired and trimmned to restore its natural appearance.
The suggestions are as follows:
I. Artificial concrete structures will be organized
The natural scenery must an organic integrate. Therefore, the highway, bridge and interchange
must merge with the nature. The interchanges have obvious impact on the environment with their areas
and remarkable visual effect. So, they should be coordinated with neighboring buildings in their size,
shape and style. Another factor taken into account in the design is plantation. To set off the beautiful
outline of the interchange is one of the purposes of plantation. Low bushes will be the best choice
because high trees hide from view of the road users. At the access of ramps, plants with view-induction
will be planted. The plantation around the interchange will be associated with the environment
organically.
2. Finishing of earth works
Earthwork in construction has significant effect on scenery, in suburban areas in particular. Building
of bridge approaches, interchange ramps and road on the slope do damage to existing landform. So on
completion of these works, it is necessary to do finishing to restore the original form as much as
possible.
1) The slope of cutting and filling should be connected with natural ground surface smoothly by
using arc slope to improve visual effect.
2) The slope should keep certain coarseness to protect or plant sod. On gentle slope flowers with
pattems can be planted to better the environment.
3) Retaining walls can be covered with evergreen bushes and climbers to improve visual effect. The
exposed parts of retaining walls or protection slopes should be painted according to the environment.
3. Road-marking scenery close to rivers
The study areas are rich in surface water, so the natural water bodies are valuable scenic sources that
should be made use of as much as possible to make the road users feel the nature.
1) The alignment design should go with river courses and plane properly.
2) The major plants for plantation are bushes, flowers and evergreen trees. The trees should not hide
from view of the road-users. Intervals should be kept in the case of high trees for the viewers to look at
water.
3) In design of the bridges close to the water bodies, coordination with the neighboring environment
should be taken into account.
4. Scenery of road close to mountains
76



The scenery close to the mountains will be made use of. The construction activities close to
mountains will damage to the natural surface, so on completion of the work finishing will be made to
guarantee natural connection with road edges.
5. Beautification of road facilities
In addition to the functional elements, the aesthetic function will be also taken into account in
designing road facilities such as residential buildings or tolling stations.
4.6.2.5 Suggestions on Protection of Visual Resources in Construction
The topography along the proposal is of typical karst one with mainly limestone which appears gray
due to weathering, It is in harmony with the green plantation. Therefore, it is very important to take
mitigation measures to repair the misharmonism resulted from excavation of highway construction
1) Borrow sites will be located at the smaller sidehills. When the sidehill is excavated, it is better ro
cut off the whole hill head to make full use of. If the full use can not be made, it is suggested to
excavate at the back side of the hill.
2) The gentle slopes or borrow sites resulted from excavation or cutting will be treed or grassed.
3) At steeper slopes of limestones, it is impossible to tree or grass. In this case, it is proposed to
spray colorful paint with key sections with gray color to mitigate impact of exposed limestone on visual
resources.
4.7 Analysis of Irnpact of Connecting Lines on Environment
4.7.1 Impact of Construction of Connecting Lines
Five connecting lines will be built with a total length of 25.6 km. They will be built according to
classOtwo highway standards. They are all of improvements to existing roads. See table 4-7-1 for
details and table 4-7-2 for Environmental Sensitive Spots on Both Sides of Connecting Lines. The
sensitive spots at 5 connecting lines are mainly schools and villages, 4 schools and 16 villages or other
units within 80m. There are about 230 households with 1000 in population.
Based on the traffic volume in Table 2-4, the analysis of the connecting lines on the enivironment is
as follows:
1) Ecosystem: No obvious impact on ecosystem is expected due to the fact that all the connecting
lines are of improvements to existing road, with less earth stone works or occupation of farmland.
2) Acoustics: The connecting line traffics forcast the traffic noise to be seen in Table 4-7-3.

As the environrental noise  at the connecting lines comes of traffic noices, the traffic noise can
show a current noise situation.
Table 4-7-3 shows that:
(1) At the connecting lines of Mashan and Dahua in year 2024, the night noise value reaches to the
GB3096-93 Class 4 standards.
(2)The distances between schools and the road in table 4-7-3 shows that the 4 schools with its noises

(3) 20 households in two villages at Wu-Ming connecting line are located within 50m, where the
first row has some impact from traffic noise, none for the outer 50m. The analysis shows that there is
little impact at connecting lines from traffic noise, and some measures must be taken for the households
neighbouring Wu-Ming connecting line.
3) Atmosphere: Compared with the predicted concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, the
atmoshpheric environment meets the concerning standards of GB 3095-1996 in the year 2024 (long-
term operation).
4) Safety: When in operation, there will be more traffic accicdents because of increased traffic
volume, speedy driving while with no dividing facilities. So, there will be some safety problems, the
solution to which is to install dividing facilities. when in operation.
5) Economic growth: The connecting lines will connect the expressway to the out world. So, it will
certainly promote the local economy.
Above all, the main problem existing at connecting lines are of safety, which must be seriously
concemed.

4.7.2 Impact of Crossings on Environment
1) There is a small traffic volume for Shuiren3Duan Section, which have less impact on
environment. The crossings are of level ones.
2) Duan7Nanning Section is expressway on which six interchanges are designed. They are far from
residential areas, thus having no effect on them. There will be traffic hubs at the interchanges producing
some noise. So, it is suggested not to construct buildings requiring high environmental standards in the
close vicinity
to the interchanges.

CHAPTER 5 MEASURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
5.1 Measures in Design Phase
These measures have basically been determined, and should be optimized as necessary in design
phase.
5.1.1 Route Selection
(I) The alignment xvill be selected considering minimizing land acquisition, relocation and
resettlement, and impact of air pollution and noise on environmnentally.
(2) The alignment will avoid cities, towns and other sensitive locations as much as possible.
(3) The alignment will be selected considering reducing cutting mountain to protect the resource
of landscapes.
5.1.2 Social Disruption
168 passes (average every 700m) and 24 grade separators will be constructed to facilitate the
crossings of the expressway by local people, animals and vehicles.
5.1.3 Soil Erosion and Land Resources
(l)Trees and grasses will be planted in the side slopes and other parts within the occupied slopes.
The slopes in the mountainous areas will be stabilized by various techniques including retaining and
protecting walls in order to avoid flooding of the slopes.
(2) Subgrade drainage system will be installed.
(3) 980 culverts will be constructed to retain the irrigation function.
5.1.4 Noise
A combination of measures such as resettlement, installation of noise barriers and afforestation will
be undertaken to mitigate the short and medium term noise problems. Before the operation of the
highway, 13 villages and 2 schools (I school will be removed because the land is needed by Highway)
2
will be relocated and approximately 3450 m  noise barriers will be built at sensitive locations.
In Table 5-1 are listed the villages exceeding the standards by more than 3 dB at night in 2014; in
Table 5-2, the schools exceeding the standards by more than 3 dB in :2024 in daytime are listed. Based
on the existing conditions of a particular place, the following measures are proposed to take:
(1) It is suggested that in construction the housing in the residential centers within 40 m from the
road center be demolished, considering the fact that the noise level at night in 2006 or 2014 exceeds the
standards by more than 5.0 dB. See Table 5-1. There is much less demolition in mountainous villages
because the houses are located sparsely. Besides, the slopes of ShuirenELDuan Section is very steep, so
40m of land in width is used for embankment. Therefore, there will not be more removal due to impact
of traffic noise.
(2) In the villages where the level exceeds the standards by more than 4.0 dB in 2024, the noise
preventive measures and implementation time will be determined according to the monitoring level
behind 2014. See Table 5-1.
(3) Noise preventive measures will be taken at the schools where the excess is more than 3dB in
2024 in daytime. See Table 5-2.

Refer to  5-3 for the analysis. It shows that the measures proposed  in the EIA  are  technically
rational. So the impact from  environmental noise pollution (noise, vibration and tail gases) will be
solved thoroughly.
To see Fig.5-1, Fig.5-2 and Fig.5-3 the main sensitive spots.
5.1.5 Landscape Protection
(1) The detail alignment will be determined to minimize spots, volume and areas of cutting limestone
mountains. In the preliminary design, elabration has made and the amount of earth/stone work in
relation to limestone mountains has been reduced by 9%, the areas o,f side slopes by 8%, and thus the
number of cutting sites by 7 to 61, compared with those in the feasibility study. Further efforts will be
made in the detail design to further lessen the impacts on the landscape of limestone mountains.
(2) On all of cutting sites, appropriate mitigation measures inclucling the restoration of vegetation
will be taken. All plantable cutting slopes will be covered with turf. Cutting at some low and steep
slopes will be a little expanded so as to turm the slopes gentle for grass plantation. A 50 cm-wide
planting belt on shoulders at some I Om and higher steep slopes will be designed to allow such grass as
Boston Ivy to grow on the slopes. The sections requiring large excavation along the highway and
protecting measures show in Table 5-4.
(3) Trial sections would be set up  in  an early stage of construction, where   the environmental
mitigation measures against the cutting of limestone mountains addressed in the EA reports will be
examined in order to identify the most effective and practical measures.
5.1.6 Water Pollution
Sewage treatment facilities will be set up at the service areas and toll stations. Secondary biological
treatment is recommended.
5.1.7 Cultural Relics
Cultural relics survey was carried out and no important cultural relics were found out in the working
area of the project.

5.2 Measures in Construction Phase
5.2.1 Ecological Measures and Suggestions
5.2.1.1 Ecological Resources
(1) Temporary settlement tanks will be dug at the locations where there is runoff in construction of
subgrade to catch mud and sand. The tank is usually 0.5 m deep, and the size depends on the area of
catchment. Geotextile will be provided at the outlet where necessary. These places will be rehabilitated
on completion of the work..
(2) Borrow earth will be planned, and it is required that borrow, leveling, rehabilitation and
plantation be implemented at the same time. In the plain areas, the borrow pits will be suggested to be
used as fishing pools. Before excavation the maisses will be consulted about locations of borrow pits.

5.2.1.2 Land Protection
(1) Temporary land taking will be to the minimum.
(2) The road will be accepted together with works of plantation, slope protection and drain ditches.
(3) When land for temporary use is concemed, the top fermented soil will be collected for
rehabilitation after the work is completed.
(4) No borrow will be allowed to excavate from farmland at will.
(5) Workers will be educated to protect animals and no poaching will be allowed.
5.2.1.3 Sewage and Wastes
Working wastes and sewage will be under good treatment in case of pollution.
5.2.2 Noise
(1) In order to reduce the time exposing loud noise, it is suggested that the workers operate
noise3producing machines on shift basis. Besides, the machinery will be maintained properly to keep
it in lowest noise level. The workers will wear earplugs and helmets.
(2) When the construction sites are 200m within the residential areas, no noise producing
construction activities will be allowed between 22:00 - 6:00.
(3) Interfere with teaching activities will be minimized at the sections of schools by consultation
with schools in order to ensure the suitable time of high noise machinery working.
5.2.3 Air Pollution
(1) The storage site and mixing stations will located at least 300 m from residential areas on the
leeward side and haulage roads will be sprayed regularly to reduce dust.
(2) The construction sites also will be sprayed regularly, mainly on sunny days, twice a day in the
moming and in the aftemoon.
5.2.4 Water Pollution
(1) Muddy water caused by mud excavation and material washing pollutes water. Cofferdams and
caissons will be used in bridge construction with the former applying to the construction in the river
with smaller flow and wider surface and the latter applying to the river larger flow.
(2) Waste water at worker' camp will be properly treated by septic tank, etc. and disposed of.
(3) Oil leakage from machinery and ships or waste oil will not be discharged into the river. They
should be collected and recycled as appropriate.
(4) Asphalt, oil and chemicals will not be stocked at the places close to the water bodies, and they
will be covered with mufflers to avoid them running into the water bodies.
5.2.5 Traffic Management and Safety
(1) The proposed alignment goes parallel to the 210 National Highway and crossing it several times
at Section Honglong - Duan, so it is very important to guide the traffic. It is suggested to construct the
road section after section. Wardens will be posted to guarantee smooth traffic and safety. Detours will
be built at crossings prior to the construction.
(2) Wardens will be posted at crossings, school sections and residential areas to ensure that they are
safe.
(3) The working time must be in schedule at some blasting sections. At blasting, no vehicles and
pedestrians are allowed to cross. The neighbouring villagers can be subsided for their temporarily
leaving at blasting.
(4) No crossing of pedestrians is allowed when building up bridges.
5.2.6 Cultural Relics
Construction works will be stopped inmmediately if any cultural relics are discovered as a result of
road construction or excavation activities. The local cultural relics authorities will be informed.
Excavation will not be resumed unless the authorities approve of it.
5.2.7 Vibration Monitoring
When vibrationOproducing construction (compaction of piers or operation of vibrating rollers) is
carried out, the impact on neighboring adobe houses will be supervised. Reparative measures will be
taken if they are exposed to severe vibration or blasting and likely to suffer from damage.
98



5.2.8 Visual Resources
It is suggested to locate borroNv sites at smaller hillsides. In excavation, it is better to cut off the
whole hill head to make use of. If it is impossible to make full use of, it is better to excavate at the
backside.  hen hills are used as borrow sites, empty holes can not be left but a slope so as to the
restoration of vegetations.
5.3 Measures in Operation Phase
5.3.1 Zonal Planning on Either Side of the Road
The prediction of traffic noise reveals that in the long-term of operation (2024) the noise levels
within 100 m of the road are below class 4 of GB 3096- 93 (Standard levels on both sides of artery
road). Therefore, no villages (within 50m) and schools (within lOOm) or other sensitive locations will
be built.
5.3.2 Traffic Noise
(1) No Homing Marks will be posted at the sections near schools.
(2) At accesses of road, noise:monitoring stations will be installed, and the vehicles with loud noise
will not be allowed to run on the road.
(3) Noise barriers or other appropriate noise prevention measures will be taken at locations where
noise exceeds the standard, based on the result of monitoring.
(4) With the necessary prevention measures, the excess levels can be controlled below 5dB at
villages; below 2.0 dB at schools in daytime.
5.3.3 Air Pollution
(1) Afforestation by planting trees on both sides. The natural conditions along the alignment are
good for growth of trees, it is required that high trees and bushes should be planted where possible on
either side to absorb pollutants and beautify the environment.
(2) The vehicles on the road will be tested ad hoc in emitting pollutants. Those in great excess of
pollutants will not be allowed to run on the road.
5.3.4 Potential Risk of Water Pollution
(1) Sewage treatment facilities will be set up at the service centers. The sewage will not be
discharged unless is disposed of properly. For it, secondary biological treatment procedures are
suggested.
(2) Different kinds of leakage and material spill will be avoided to prevent water bodies from being
polluted.
(3) Public Security Departments will be informed about the transportation of hazardous materials,
and they can be transported only with their approval, especially at the section of water protection of
Chengjiang River, i.e. K163 - K171.
(4) At section K163 0 K141, five settlement tanks will be dug to catch the runoff from the
road lsides to alleviate the impact on water quality.
(5) In case of foggy weather, the speed of vehicles will be controlled, and no transportation of
hazardous materials will be allowed.
(6) Driving will not be allowed when drunk, tired, or overtaken.
5.3.5 Aesthetics and Plantation
(1) The school and village areas will be treed and sodden to create scenic belts.
(2) Highway management areas will also be treed and sodded to make the environment more
beautiful.
5.3.6 Vehicle Management
(1) Better vehicle maintenance/management will be enhanced to keep vehicles in good conditions.
Vehicle noise and emission inspection will be strengthened. If a vehicle does not comply with the noise
and/or emission standards, the vehicle will not be allowed to pass until the problem is rectified.
Periodical and random exhaust gas emissions inspection will be undertaken.
(2) Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize people with the problem of air
pollution and noise from vehicles and with related regulations.
99



5.4 Suggestions
To decrease traffic accidents at connecting lines, it is suggested to install dividing facilities after the
highway is put into operation according to the increase of traffic volume.

When the excavation takes place where there is runoff, temporary earth settlement tanks will be dug.
The settlement tank takes the shape of a pit of 0.5 m deep and 20-30 square meters area. When it rains,
the speed of the rainwater slows down in the tanks. As a result, mud and sand settled down. At the
outlet side, geotextile is used to catch mud and sand for one more time. On completion of subgrade, the
tanks will be filled. Around earth dumps and at sections prone to soil erosion, geotextile will be used to
catch mud and sand. The structure of geotextile enclosure is: the width is 65 cm; a pillar of 5 cm in
diameter 3 meters apart is posted; textile is fixed onto the pillar which goes underground 30 cm. 15 cm
of textile is pressed with earth. The location needed settlement tank are following:
K96+500, K104+000, K109+850, K112+250, K132+050, K149+200, K150+530, K165+100,

(2) Schemes to dispose of waste earth and stone
There is cutting at heavy rolling areas, most waste earth at which will be used for filling. The surplus
waste earth will not be heaped at will or dumped onto flood-land. Instead, it will be stored up in the
waste earth sites. It can also be used for rehabilitation. In selecting and designing the waste earth sites,
the following will be considered:
'The sites will not be located upstream of villages and large public utilities, neither will they
be located downstrean of dangerous areas of collapses or slides;
-The height of the dump will not be higher than the adjacent ground level;
-On either side of the highest dump, drain ditches will be dug;
-If the height is above Sm, there must be a terrace of 1.5-2.Om with every 5m increment, the
slope of which will not be greater than 1:1.0;
To remove seepage, blind pipes will be installed. The diameter of the pipe will be 250 -
300mm buried with pebbles of 500mm depth.
'The surface of the waste sites will be planted with trees or grasses.
(3) Preventive works
100



Large scale of cutting, filling, excavation of mountains will lead to exposure of slopes resulting in
soil erosion, collapses or slides. The slopes at roadsides and newly cutting will be protected. In the
preliminary design, the concrete requirements have been suggested about preventive works:
a) Embankment of filling
To protect the slope of embankment of filling, when the magnitude of the slope is less 8m, the design
cut slope is 1: 1.5; when the height is more than 8m, the cut slope is 1:1.5 at top part, 1:1.75 at lower
part. For embankment of stone filling, when the magnitude is less than 20m, the design cut is 1:1.3 at
8m; 1:1.5 below 8 m. When the magnitude is more than 20m, 1:1.3 at 8m above. Below that
magnitude, the ratio varies every 12m. The slopes are in turn: 1:1.5, 1:1.75 and 1:1.2. A lm high
terrace is provided every two stages.
b) Sections of cutting
The construction in heavy rolling hilly areas, exposure of slopes of large areas is resulted from
cutting and excavation. As a result, soil erosion, collapses and slides occur. Therefore, the exposed
slopes need to be protected. The work amount of protection is in table 5-5. For embankment slope
protection, see Table 5-6. When the height of slope in more than 10m, there is a terrace every 10 m the
width of which is 2m or Im depending on their geological conditions. On the terrace a rectangular
drain ditch of 40 x 40cm is dug.

c) Protection of embankment
According to the landform, geological conditions and properties of filling, the following measures
are proposed:
-Sodding for the slope less than 1.5m of earth;
101



Diamond-shape frame protection for slopes between 1.5 - 5m. A square is provided 2m apart, and
in the square grass is planted.
Arc frame protection for slopes of earth more than 5m in which grass is planted;
'Stone masonry slope for slopes exposed to flood or near outlets of bridges and culverts;
,Stone masonry toe for half-cutting half-filling embankment. The toe will not be higher than Sm, and
7.5 mortar bond.
'Stone retaining walls for steeper natural slopes, the height of which will not be more than 20m.
(4) Drainage works
Rain seepage and artesian aquifer contributes to slope collapse and slides to great extent. Therefore,
at slopes of large cutting, drain ditches will be provided to ensure that the runoff on both sides is
discharged more smoothly and faster. The following requirements will be met in designing of drainage
facilities.
a) The .side ditches will be placed parallel to the road to remove the runoff of the pavement or from
upstream. The side ditches will be dug in the following way:
'The minimum longitudinal slope will be above 0.5%;
'25 year floods design;
'Lining ditches will be dug at the sections vulnerable to erosion; at other sections earth ditches dug.
-Lining side ditches will be dug;
'The cross sections will be rectangular or trapezoid, and the width and depth will be no less than
30cm. However, at the sections prone to be blociced, L-shaped cross sections will be fit.
b) Transverse drainage facilities
The transverse drainage facilities are used to remove the runoff from natural gullies or pavement.
The design requirements are as follows:
'The alignment will be placed in cross cut way with natural gullies and irrigation channels;
'The drainage culverts and pipes will be orthogonal with the road. To prevent from eroding subgrade
or the lower part of slopes, the outlets of culverts will be provided with drainage ditches to guide the
runoff to safe places. The longitudinal slope of the drainage will not be less than 3% and at the inlets,
catch facilities will be provided.
c) Restoration of vegetation
'High trees and bushes will be planted on either side within right-of-way, at crossings or in the
vicinity of residential areas(within 50m);
'Subgrade slopes and cutting slopes of mountains will be sodded or grassed;
'The permanent waste sites will be compacted and covered with surface soil to restore vegetation;
'It is suggested to plant fast-growth trees like masson pine, acacia rachii, Chinese sweet gum,
cypress, camphor tree, camplotheca acuminata and oriental white oak; grasses are ciliate desert-grass,
caloglossa, asparagus and yellow couchgrass etc.
5.5.3 Implementation Management of Schemes
(1) Institutional arrangement
Water and soil conservation programs will be in the charge of Guangxi Communications Division
and the highway construction commnission agencies. Their responsibilities contain: construction
drawing design the contents and requirements of which will be specified in tending documents as
contracts; the facility quality and schedule will be monitored by experts; the acceptance staff will be
include experts from EP units and water conservation units. In operation phase, specialized staff will be
assigned by Guangxi High-class Highway Agency to take care of highway environrnental protection
and water conservation works. Their work also include routine and maintenance work..
(2) Technical measures
'In inviting tenders, the traits, awareness of environmental protection and water conservation of the
workers will be taken into account;
'Qualified technicians water and soil conservation will be assigned for supervision;
'Fund will be set aside by both employer and contractor for training or monitoring of soil erosion etc.

CHAPTER 6 ALTERNATE\VES
The contests of this chapter have been worked out through careful discussion between the EIA
team  and  designers. Limited by the landform  of the origin and destination, the general alignment has
already been identified. The alignment is 100 km shorter than the one originating from Hechi via
Liuzhou to Nanning. Therefore, it has remarkable advantages. Under the general scheme, the alignment
has three sectional alternatives namely Diaojiang alternative, Duan7Wuming and WumingONanning
altematives. See Fig.6-1 and Annex Figure for their alignments.
6.1 Comparison between Construction and Non-Construction
The current Shuiren-Nanning road is one part of No21O in Guangxi province, lastng 283km in
length. Except the 37km class two Nanning-Wuming section, the others are in class three or four even
out of class road. Before the highway project, the traffic volume on Shuiren-Nanning section are
predicted as in table 6-1.

If the current road is reformed, the prediction traffic volume will be higher than in table 6-1. the
traffic volume by prediction in table 6-1 have exceeded their transportation capabilities with its relevant
road levels. The advantages for the construction to be or not to be can be compared in table 6-2.
The comparison tells that the advantages from highway construction are superior to the
nonconstruction. It is very necessary to built up the highway.
6.2 Alignment of Alternatives (See Fig. 6-1)
1) Diaojiang Section (reconmmended scheme station K107 + 000 D K128 + 000):

alignment (20.90 km).
Scheme A: Originating from K107+000, it goes down to the Diaojiang River, and it crosses it at 800
m upstream of Nalao Village. Then after passing Fanyalou of Jioubei, it is connected to the
recommended alignment (22.47km).
The Straight scheme(R line) has been chosen as the recommended scheme in the project feasibility
study report for its shorter alignment (and one culvert less than A)and smaller work amount.
2) Duan:iJWuming Section (recommended scheme K168+850 OK226+050) Straight Scheme (R
line): Oroginating from Banyao Village K168+850, it goes on till Jiangpo and there it crsosses The
Chengjiang, the via Gaoling, Batang, and it crosses the Hongshui River near Linjiang Village, at last it
destines at Dongji through Leyu and Naliang (total length is 57.2 km'i.
Scheme B: Originating from Banyao village, via Tangjiou, east of Duan Town and Yangan, it crosses
Hondshui River at Xiaye Village of Mashang. Then it is connected to the straight alignment at Naling
after passing through Liouhe and Mashan County Town.( total length is 59.555 krm).
The straight scheme(R line) has been chosen as the recommended one for its shorter mileage and
small work amount. In addition, it is also beneficial for the local ecorLomic growth avoiding the densely
populated areas through which R.210 passes. It occupies less farrnland, needs less demolition and
removal. It is also convenient for the traffic of Dahua County.
3) WumingONannung Section (station of recommended line K300+780]K320+100) Straight
scheme (R line): Origination from Leiwang, it is destined at Ou village via Nawang K307+650, west of
Zhi village Reservoir, north side of Jiantang Hills and Xijing. The total length is 19.320Km.
C-line scheme: Originating from Leiwang, it heads for the nortlh of Weiyanling Tunnel, there it is
connected with the existing class[3two highway. They share the same line for 7.1km. The it leaves the
class-two highway at Gokou at the mountain foot by means of grade separation. It is connected to the
Straight line at Pingle west of Ding village (K320+100). The total length is 17.064km.
Considering the function of Nanning City as a satellite city, the Straight Scheme(R line) has been
recommended by the Project Feasibility Study Report.
Landscape Protection is a very important factor in selecting route. To minimize spots, volume and
areas of cutting limestone mountains, the designers and experts have done follows:
1. Different technical standard have been adopted according to the predicted amount of traffic and
actual topography.
2. According to the requirements of technical standards, the best route has been selected.
3. Further adjust the alignment location, to reduce the amount of cutting mountain.
By studying, the amount of earth/stone work is reduced by 6,994,949m3 and the area of side
slopes is reduced by 502,9 1 lm2 respectively, which is certainly beneficial to environmental protection.
4.The recommnended alignment schemes have been chosen on the basis of layout of the alignment
in plan and elevation, excavation, amount of work involved, land to be acquisitioned, houses to be
demolished and people to be resettled and environmnental impact.
In the preliminary design, elabration has made and the amount of earth/stone work in relation to
limestone mountains has been reduced by 9%, the areas of side slopes by 8%, and thus the number of
cutting sites by 7 to 61, compared with those in the feasibility study. Further efforts will be made in
the detail design to further lessen the impacts on the landscape of limestone mountains.
6.3 Comparison of Schemes (See Table 6-3)
Comparison has been made from the perspective of factors of engineering, economics,

6.4 Conclusion
1. By the comparison, the advantages are superior obviously in environmental protection.
2.The partial section comparisons reach the following conclusions:
(1) Alternative of Diaojiang Section
The table displays that the number of the villages, schools and towns exposed to traffic noise and air
pollution remains the same in both schemes. However, the Straight Scheme(R line) takes less land and
there is less work amount and soil erosion. The local governnents and public are in favor of the
Straight Scheme. Besides, environmentally it superior to Scheme A too. For this reason, the Straight
Scheme(R line), is recommended in the Assessmient just like in the Feasibility Study Report.
(2) Alternative of Duan 0 Wuming SectionFrom Table 6-3 we know that the number of the villages
and schools affected by air and noise pollution in the straight scheme is less than that in Schemes B.
The route goes by Gaoling Town,where population is concentrated and crowded, as well as by many
schools. Besides, the straight scheme is superior to Scheme B in the following aspects: the length,
land use, demolition and removal, work amount, soil erosion and traffic flow. For this reason, the
straight alignment is recommended in the Assessment just like in the Feasibility Study Report.
(3) Alternative section of WumingONannling Table 6-3 shows that the C-line has less work
amount and shorter &  mileage. Besides, the two schemes have almost the same environment factors
and work amount of removal. Therefore, it is suggested to decide in preliminary design phase through
detailed comparison of factors of engineering and economics.
6.5 Further Route Optimizing
When the reconmmended scheme is chosen, the design unit take all factors as excavation amount,
noise etc into consideration before their optimizing the recommended route. 24 schools along the line
has been reduced to 11, 68 large excavations to 61 and less cutting slopes. The impact reduces more.

CHAPTER 7 ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT/COSTANALYSIS
7.1 Estimated Cost on Environmental Protection
7.1.1 Nonrecurring Cost on Environmental Protection Works
Based on the measures suggested in this assessment, the nonrecurmrng cost on the environmental
protection works is listed in Table 7-1. The cost of some other items on environment protection is
10.885m RMB yuan. Expenses for plantation of expressway is expected to be 100,000 RMB yuan/km,
of class-two highwayl50,000 RMIB yuan/lkm, totaling 16,9364 m  RMB yuan. Put together with the
nonrecurring cost, the total is 27.9994 m RMB yuan, which accounts for 0.67 of the total cost of the
project (4,197.8222 m RiMB yuan).

7.1.3 Comparison of Cost on Environmental Protection Works VS the Total Cost
The total estimated cost for the project is 4,197.8222m RMB yuan. The nonrecurring cost on EP
works is 27,999,400 RMB yuan with the total annual working fund being 10.80m RMB yuan. The
whole cost will be 38.7914m RMB yuan taking Up 0.92 of the total cost of the project. Thiis means that
the cost on EP is not a principal fund compared with the total cost. It reveals that there is less pollution
in the study areas.
7.2 Environmental Benefit/Cost Analysis
7.2.1 Beneficial Analysis of Environmental Cost
Impact of dust and noise on the environment is expected to occur in operation due to great traffic
volume leading to disturbance to the local residenis. Therefore, environmental preventive rmeasures will
be taken to minimize the adverse impact. The preventive measures would retrieve an economic loss, i.e.
the direct benefit resulting from the cost. The benefit includes, otherwise, the possible losses resulted
from illness of labor and devaluation of land because of traffic noise and air pollution.
Without these efficient preventive measures, the projected highway would result in some negative
effect that could not be expressed in terms of money, for example deterioration of teaching, normal
communication and other social problems. All theses would be the indirect benefit of the cost.
7.2.2 Economic Benefit Analysis of Impact on Environment
The economic analysis can be expressed in temis of the economical benefit resulted from the annual
cost on EP. The model is as follows:
n
* Ej= i2 O) /H                  (7 1)
i-I Z
where: Ej-Economic benefit of environmental protection cost;
Si -Economic loss retrieved by means of EP measures;
H - Annual cost on EP.
108



The economic loss that could be retrieved every year is estimated to be 0.6 million RMB yuan plus
lots of indirect economic and social benefits, in addition to the improvement of local environment,
smooth economic actions and tourism. Yet the annual capital on EP is only 1.93 million RMB yuan. So
the benefit/cost ratio is Ej= 1.04. It shows that, the benefit is significant. For these reasons, the highway
construction departments should implement these measures stage by stage according to the plan.

Further efforts will be made in the detail design to further
lessen the impacts on the landscape of limestone mountains.
2. On all of cutting sites, appropriate mitigabon measures including
the restoration of vegetation will be taken. All plantable
cutting slopes will be covered with turf. Cutting at some low and
steep slopes will be a little expanded so as to tum the slopes

8.2 Environmental Monitoring Plan
8.2.1 Objective of Monitoring
During  construction, the major impacts on environment are: domestic pollution  resulted  from
construction workers, water pollution from bridge pier construction, noise from construction machinery
or explosion, earth and stone excavation, soil erosion from  pavement spreading and filling and asphalt
smoke etc. In operation phase, the major impacts come from noise, dust and waste gases caused by
high:speed vehicles. Besides, contingency accidents may also cause severe pollution. So it is required
that the dynamics of pollution should be known all the time through monitoring.
8.2.2 Surveillance Institutions
In both construction and operation phases, of the Environmental Monitoring Station in Guangxi will
be entrusted to take the responsibilities to monitor the. environment since it is a qualified station in all
respects.
8.2.3 Implementation of Monitoring
The routine monitoring is conducted by the central station to comply with the requirements in Tables
8-3(1I)0(3).
The monitoring will center on atmosphere, water quality and noise. The monitoring will be carried
out at fixed sites, in moving model.
In implementation of surveillance plan, such things as monitoring methods, objective or the training
will be determined through consultation with GCD and the monitors.

8.2.4 Instruments, Cost and System for Monitoring Report
The instruments for monitoring will be provided by the monitors, but the communication
departments will pay some depreciation funds without purchasing new ones. The depreciation cost are
included in the total cost for monitoring which covers 0.40 million RMAB yuan (4 years) in construction
phase; I million in operation phase (20 years) with 0.1 million R1MB yuan set aside for emergent
accidents.
An annual monitoring report would be fumished to the Bank by January 31 of each year starting
in 2001 during the construction phase and each of the first three years following completion of
construction.
The system for reporting is displayed in Fig. 8-2.
8.3 Environmental Training
The program is intended to train the administrative personnel, technicians and supervisors involved in
environmental protection so that they can acquire the knowledge of environmental protection and
ensure the fulfillment of the EPAP.
According to their responsibilities, the trainees fall into the following three groups.
116



Fig.8-2

1. Administrative personnel: they include high-level and middle-level administrative personnel,
who are to be trained to be able to handle issues and emergent situations in environmental
protection. There are altogether 9 persons, with 3 from the Project Office; 3, from DCG; 2, from
CPSDIG and the Research Institute; 1, from the extemal monitoring agency.
2. Environmental supervisors: They will be trained to have a sound knowledge of environmental
protection, control of environmental quality, management of expenses and techniques of
environmental protection engineering so as to ensure the fulfillment of the EPAP. All the
training seminars will be held at home. There are altogether 12 persons, with I from each
contracted section.
3. Working staff: There are altogether 18 persons, with 3 from each country; 3, from each
city/prefecture. They are to be trained to have a sound k:nowledge of the project and its
environmental protection issues so as to cooperate with the other authorities to ensure the
fulfillment of the project.
The training is to be carried out both at home and abroad. Those to be trained abroad will learn the
new methods, techniques and management experience from the advanced countries and to introduce
them to all the personnel in charge of environmental protection. 'Those to be trained at home (in
Nanning City) include administrative personnel and working staff, with the training seminars sponsored
by the Project Office, and lectures given by the senior staff from the 'World Bank, govemment officials
and experts.
According to the trainees and training content, the program is divided into the following three
stages.
1. The training of environmental supervisors is scheduled in March, 2000, with a period of 7 days;
2. The training of high-level administrative personnel abroad is scheduled in March, 2000, with a
period of 21 days;
3. The training of working staff at home (including those from each country, city and prefecture) is
scheduled in April, 2000, with a period of 7 days.

CHAPTER 9 ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
9.1 Scope and Ways of Public Involvement
In September 1996, the EA panel from Xian Highway University conducted social and public
involvemenf investigation in the study areas taking in Hechi City, Mashan County, Duan County,
Wuming County and Nanning City. Hearings into the comments from the masses, the Council
representatives, governments and enterprises (more than 100 people) along the alignment were
convened. Besides, 63 questionnaire forms were handed out to collect the opinions of masses (see
Table 9-1): They also consulted the following departments: agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and
118



communications about environmental protection. In September 1998, secondary investigation was
conducted to collect more opinions of the masses and governments. In the end of November, 1998,
according to the remarks of the specialists of the Bank, the panel introduced the E]S outline to the
public in the villages along the route, pointing out the major potential impacts on environment. The
panel also collected the hearings of the public, and 30 quesionnaire forms were filled out. See Table 9-
2.
In the end of December, 1998, the initial edition of the statement was completed. Based on the
prediction and analysis, the panel introduced on the main contents of the statement anmong the masses
in the study section. The masses have also been informed of the potential impact and the mitigation
measures to be taken. The panel collected their hearings for one more time, and 38 more questonnaire
forms of public participation were filled in. See Table 9-2 for detail.
9.2 Publicizing and Involvement
In the end of Nov. 1998, the EIA team publicized the contents of the EIA Programme along the
route, including 82 persons in 12 villages with such contents as: 1) highway location; 2) possible noise
impact; 3) possible impact from separation; 4) possible influence from land taking etc. The publicizing
was carried out by two methods as door by door introduction and material sending. All the involvers
gave out their opinions actively, which shows an positive attitude to the highway construction as well
as a great concern on landOtaking compensations.
In the end of Dec. 1998, after the completion the primary draft, we had a publicizing and
investigation by face-to-fact discussion at somne seriousO5impacted areas at 16 spots as: Hualongtun
and Gonghuatun of Hechi city; Guanglong village, Noghuatun, Jiutun, Daxing Clinic, Bamatun,
Dongbantun of Duan county; Lingjiangtun, Naliangtun, Tangyatun of Mashan couLnty; Maantun,
Jiuqintun of Wuming county; Xijing village, Ou village, Ertang Coal Mine of Nanninlg city. All the
contents publicized and realized contain the following: 1) ill impact from the highway; 2)EP measures
to be taken; 3) public views on our measures; 4) specific demands from local monorities. As all the
above have great relationship with the local people, they all paid great attention to the project.
Questionnaires were used on the process of investigation.
In August 5, 1999, the Project Officers of GCD introduced the new expressway publicly in Guangxi
Daily and require public opinions. By publicizing with door by door and material sending etc, we are
sure that 95% of the route people have known something about the project as well as the environmental
part of the project.
9.3 Opinions of the Public
1. Analysis of 1996 survey
The reveals in 1996 are as follows:
(I) All the county governments have shown tremendous enthusiasm in construction of the highway
and promised to offer help in acquiring land, resettlement and providing labor power.
(2) The county governments are in favor of the recommended scheme.
(3) 70% of the masses had had knowledge of the construction of the project with the other 24% got
to know the alignment and the significance of the project through the investigation.
(4) 98% of the masses hope that the project be started as soon as possible. "Better road, better life"
is common accepted for the local people.
(5) 95% of the masses support the alignment of the proposed highway considering that the project
will promote the local economy to a great extent.
(6) In soliciting the opinions about resettlement, the common response was to place the state
interests in the first place. 90% of the masses wish to be resettled in the same village.
2. Analysis of 1998 survey
The hearings of the masses in 1998:
(1) Through three year's time of propagada, 96 percent of the public have been informed of the
project to some extent.
(2) 94 percent of the public wish to start the project as soon as possible in order to encourage the
local economic growth. However, there are a few individuals who think that the construction of the
highway will not bring to them any advantages.
119



(3) More than 88 percent of the masses agree with the route alignmrent, thinking it will be for sake of
the economic growth of their own villages and enterprises.
(4) Through propagada, the masses have realized the potential impacts on environment, atmosphere
and their going out. They suggested to take mitigative measures, at schools in particular.
(5) The masses keep a positive attitude towards removal and resettlement. However, they require
that the allowance for resettlement be granted directly to the masses concemed.
9.4 Solutions to the Problems
The public participation and investigation show that all the govermments, Council representatives,
enterprises and masses concerned expressed their wishes that the highway will be put into use as soon
as possible. In resettlement, 87% of the household wish to be resettled in the same village. Those who
wish to remove to other villages also expressed their opinions to obey the state interests.
(1) In requiring land and removement, the compensation will comply with the relevant regulations
strictly without retention or misappropriations. The public will be told about the relevant policies about
compensation.
(2) In resettlement, the households to be removed will be consulted to solicit their opinions prior to
commerce of the construction. Besides, agreements will be signed with the local governments about
resettlement to ensure that the households do not suffer financial losses or low their living standards.
(3) Protection of environment. An EIA has been made, on which the design of EP works will be
based to decrease the impact on environment to a munimun.
The analysis shows that most of the problems in the hearings have been solved in the design
phase. The problems of land acquisition, resettlement etc. expected to appear in construction phase
need to be solved appropriately to minimize the adverse impact.

CHAPTER 10  CONCLUSION
Based on the results of the EIA, the conclusions of the assessment are as follows;
10.1 Assessment of Existing Environment
(1) The soil and crops along the alignment are fairly good not affected by the Pb.
(2) The environmental noise at the schools and villages comply with relevant standards in GB 3096-
93.
(3) The water quality in the rivers and reservoirs complies with classOtwo standards except
Diaojiang River in which COD exceeds classOlthree standards.
(4) The air along the alignrment is quite good meeting classtwo standards in GB 3095-1996 at all
eight monitoring spots.
10.2 Prediction Analysis Conclusion of Impact on Environment
10.2.1 Phases of Design and Construction
(1) The impact in the construction phase is decrease of farmland, damage to vegetation and soil
erosion. These impacts could be alleviated by use of rational selection of alignmnent, plantation of trees,
building catch ditches, protection slopes or earth settlement tanks.
(2) The construction will not have impact on water environment by strengthening management and
adopting advanced techniques in bridge construction.
(3) The noise and dust during construction do have some effect on environment. However, the effect
can be mitigated by means of reasonable construction time and location to reduce impact on school
teaching and other sensitive locations.
(4) No rare plant and animal species occur in the study areas, so there is no impact on them.
(5) No important cultural relics have been found along the alignment within the assessment scope.
(6) The alignment is in favor of masses and governrnents along the route.
(7) The recommended scheme is superior to the alternatives in many respects as environmental
impact, land use, public opinions and urban development. The compaLrison among the highway to be or
not to be construction shows the superiority of construction   for local economy, traffic safety,
environmental protection etc.
(8) In construction phase, the existing roads will be affected severely. But this effect could be
mitigated by construction section by section and control of the traffic.
(9) The Hechi-Duan section is mountainous, that is, large excavation can not be avoidable. A
detailed survey has been made to reduce largely the excavation amounts and areas. Also, some
plantation design will work in order to minimum the impact on local scenery and soil erosion.
10.2.2 Operation Phase
(I) The impact on ecosystem in construction phase is resulted from dust and emitted lead by
vehicles. However, the dust has very minor impact on crops due to the fact that there is plenty of
intensive rain that continues long. There is slight lead impact on the route areas.
(2) The runoff from pavement in the early stage of operation has minor impact on the water quality
except that it has some impact on the water in Chengjiang River (mainly risky accidents). The sewage
from tolling stations could be used as manure for fanming after disposed of.
(3) The risk of spill of hazardous materials will not be neglected, especially at the section of
Chengjiang.
(4) In 2024 in operation phase, the standards at 47 places (35 villages, 10 schools and 1 hospital) will
be in excess. Noise preventive measures will be taken at those locations where noise exceeds the
standards.
(5) The exhaust gases will deteriorate the air quality along the highway in operation phase, but the
extent will not exceed classOtwo standards in GB3095-1996.
(6) The traffic safety on connecting lines must be taken into account.
(7) The benefit/cost analysis shows that the implementation of the preventive measures will bring
about significant socialOenvironmental benefit.
To sunmmary, the construction of Shui-Ren Highway will play a tremendous role in improving
transportation, promoting backward regional economy and tourism growth in these areas. The impact
on environment resulted from soil erosion, traffic noise and earth borrow can be reduced to a great
122



extent if appropriate initiatives are taken. Therefore, from the viewpoint of environmental protection,
the proposed Shuiren-Nanning project is feasible.
