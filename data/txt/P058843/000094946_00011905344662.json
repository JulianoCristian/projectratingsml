During construction of the\n            roads, noise pollution will be mitigated by resettlement,\n            installation of noise barriers, and afforestation. To\n            protect the landscape, detail alignment will be determined\n            to minimize spots, volumes and areas of cutting limestone\n            mountains. Restoration of vegetations will take place on all\n            cutting sites. All plantable cutting slopes will be covered\n            with turf. Because of the fact that the alignment goes along\n            hilly and high areas with well developed vegetation, the\n            construction will not have significant impact on the\n            ecosystem along the road. Trees and grasses will be planted\n            in the side slopes to reduce soil erosion. Temporary earth\n            settlement tanks will be dug to catch runoff from\n            excavation. To mitigate the impact of water pollution,\n            sewerage treatment facilities will be set up at the service\n            areas and toll stations. Culverts will be constructed for\n            irrigation. To reduce air pollution, construction sites will\n            be sprayed regularly. Wastewater will be treated and oil\n            leakage from machinery will be collected and recycled."}, "docdt": "1999-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
