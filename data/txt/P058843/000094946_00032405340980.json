The components include: 1) expansion of the\n            highway capacity, through partial construction of the\n            National Trunk Highway System, connecting the Shuiren, and\n            Nanning provinces, as well as those roads connecting into\n            the corridor; 2) maintenance and rehabilitation of the\n            highway system is included, particularly for those rural\n            roads, in relatively poor areas; 3) highway safety will be\n            improved, through the upgrade of the most dangerous road\n            sections in sub-urban areas of the Nanning, and Wuming\n            provinces, and other selected road segments; and, 4) the\n            Guangxi Communications Department's capacity will be\n            strengthened, through support, and training on project\n            planning, design, construction, and supervision. Further\n            support is included for project management, and monitoring\n            of environmental, and resettlement plans."}, "docdt": "2000-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
