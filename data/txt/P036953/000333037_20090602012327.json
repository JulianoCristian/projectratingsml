Some lessons learned included: the\n            project should have engaged more effectively on health\n            system and policy issues. The Maternal and Child Health\n            (MCH) component was designed as a response to the problems\n            experienced in the rural system of maternal and child care\n            following the economic reforms of the 1980s. Over time, the\n            policy environment became more favorable, with the\n            establishment of the New Cooperative Medical Service (NCMS)\n            and the reduction and elimination program, and with\n            increased government resources and attention flowed to MCH.\n            Up to that point, the project had been primarily focused on\n            supporting training and specific interventions, and was not\n            well positioned to inform policy thinking on health system\n            reform. Similarly, in the case of the Sexually Transmitted\n            Disease (STD) subcomponent, an inadequate government policy\n            and institutional framework is widely believed to have\n            undermined the impact of the project. The project could have\n            done a better job on evaluation and lesson-learning.\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) traditionally has not\n            been well integrated into project design and implementation\n            in health projects in China. Given the lack of an\n            'information culture,' as described by a number of\n            technical experts, the focus for project management is more\n            often on input rather than on expected functional capability\n            or on the results/impacts. More attention could be devoted\n            to process evaluation and lesson learning during project\n            implementation, and measurement of capacity building could\n            be more explicitly considered."}, "docdt": "2009-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
