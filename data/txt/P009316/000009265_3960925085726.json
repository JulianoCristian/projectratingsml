The terminal date of\n            credit effectiveness was extended four times due to delays\n            in meeting conditions of effectiveness, especially in\n            signing project documents with cofinanciers. Two major\n            problems were associated with the International Fund for\n            Agricultural Development loan/grant and the appointment of\n            key staff for the implementing agency. Then, IDA suspended\n            disbursement under all credits made to Afghanistan in April\n            1980 due to country conditions. The credit agreement was\n            ultimately terminated on January 1, 1982. The report finds\n            that the Bank's concern with reducing environmental\n            degradation and improving productivity and income of small\n            farmers in an area with a high level of absolute poverty was\n            justified. Nevertheless, the project's institutional\n            complexity, inherent to the area development approach\n            typical of the period, would probably have made\n            implementation difficult. The project is not rated and will\n            not be audited."}, "docdt": "1993-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
