         and standards of living of the rural poor in an area of\n            Afghanistan where some 60 percent of the people live in\n            absolute poverty with per capita incomes below $85. The\n            project includes: (a) agricultural investments in minor\n            irrigation rehabilitation, agricultural extension and\n            applied research, credit, veterinary and cooperative\n            services, range management, and cadastral survey; (b)\n            investments in rural infrastructure including minor road\n            improvements and village water supplies; (c) project\n            planning, coordination, and evaluation; and (d) related\n            technical assistances, and feasibility studies. Some 62,000\n            farm families including about 3,000-4,000 nomad and\n            transhuman families would benefit directly from the project.\n            In addition some 100,000 people would benefit indirectly."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
