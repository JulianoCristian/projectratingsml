the incomes\n            and standards of living of the rural poor in an area of\n            Afghanistan where some 60 percent of the people live in\n            absolute poverty with per capita incomes below $85. The\n            project includes: (a) agricultural investments in minor\n            irrigation rehabilitation, agricultural extension and\n            applied research, credit, veterinary and cooperative\n            services, range management, and cadastral survey; (b)\n            investments in rural infrastructure including minor road\n            improvements and village water supplies; (c) project\n            planning, coordination, and evaluation; and (d) related\n            technical assistances, and feasibility studies. Some 62,000\n            farm families including about 3,000-4,000 nomad and\n            transhuman families would benefit directly from the project.\n            In addition some 100,000 people would benefit indirectly."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
