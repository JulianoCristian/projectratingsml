It will consist of a 20,000\n            ha plantation program as part of a 68,000 ha program on four\n            estates. It will include clearing 20,000 ha of logged-over\n            high-forest by force account and planting and maintaining\n            short to medium rotation hardwood species. Risks of the\n            project stem from its innovative nature and its scope.\n            Although the species that will be grown have been\n            successfully established over the past decade, this will be\n            the first time that they will be grown in plantations. This\n            is not expected to raise extraordinary difficulties;\n            however, attention will have to be given to the technical\n            operations, quality of the timber and promotion of the products."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
