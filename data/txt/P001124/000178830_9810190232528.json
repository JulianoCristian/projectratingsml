It\n            would consist of a 20,000 ha plantation program as part of a\n            68,000 ha program on four estates. It would include clearing\n            20,000 ha of logged-over high-forest by force account and\n            planting and maintaining short to medium rotation hardwood\n            species. Risks of the project stem from its innovative\n            nature and its scope. Although the species that would be\n            grown have been successfully established over the past\n            decade, this would be the first time that they would be\n            grown in plantations. This is not expected to raise\n            extraordinary difficulties, however, attention would have to\n            be given to the technical operations, quality of the timber\n            and promotion of the products."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
