Lessons learned included: (a) given the\n            complex nature of technology development activities, it is\n            critical that flexibility is incorporated into the project\n            design, to enhance its effectiveness and to reduce the\n            bureaucracy involved in implementation and to permit\n            adaptation of the project to changes in the institutional\n            and economic environment; (b) ITP introduced a rigorous and\n            independent Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system that\n            included indicators chosen in consultation with implementing\n            institutions on the basis of the respective project inputs,\n            conceptual relevance to project objectives, ease of\n            calculation and practical considerations of collecting\n            relevant data; (c) continuity in the skills and teams at\n            both the Bank side, Borrower and Project Agencies sides in\n            managing these projects is critical to ensure the transfer\n            of knowledge as well as benefit from worldwide experience;\n            (d) in order that research institutions move away from being\n            wholly government-funded and develop self-financing\n            capacity, the government should provide strong incentives\n            for external revenue generating activities and allow the\n            institutions to retain and accumulate their earnings, and\n            determine the use of these earnings with greater flexibility\n            and freedom; and (e) the market deficiencies that hold back\n            technological effort can be overcome by careful market\n            friendly interventions, especially when timed with a\n            liberalization effort that creates the incentives for\n            undertaking such efforts."}, "docdt": "2006-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
