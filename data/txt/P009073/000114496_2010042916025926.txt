Dear Prof. Yetis:

Amendment to the TUBITAK/UME Project Agreement 
 
We refer to the TUBITAK/UME Project Agreement between the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknik Arastirma Kurumu

the reallocation dated  December 17, 2002, and the request made by the Undersecretariat of 
Treasury on March 3, 2004, to reallocate additional US$7.45 million from the unallocated 
Category in the table in paragraph A.1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement between the 
Republic of Turkey and the Bank dated August 2, 1999, to metrology services, TUBITAK/UME 
component of the Project, and the Bank’s letter dated March ---, 2004 agreeing to such 
reallocation, provided that 
TUBITAK/UME
 shall agree to 
proportionately increase the 
institutional renewal account contribution to a  total amount equal to US$11.3 million.
.
Based on the above, paragraph 2 (c) of Schedule to the TUBITAK/UME Project 
Agreement is hereby amended as follows:  
 
”(c) deposit into said institutional renewal account at least eleven million and three 
hundred thousand dollars (
$11,300,000) equivalent from its revenues during the 2001 and 
2012 period; and” 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing, dating and 
returning to us the attached copy of this letter.  This amendment will become effective as of the
