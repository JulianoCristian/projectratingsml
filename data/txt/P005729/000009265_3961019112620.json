The project's objectives were to provide\n            the basis for increasing the rate of discovery and\n            development of Tunisia's hydrocarbon resources through:\n            (i) attracting further private sector participation in\n            exploration of prospective open areas; (ii) strengthening\n            Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit\u00e9s P\u00e9troli\u00e8res,\n            ETAP's  (Tunisian Petroleum Activity Company)technical\n            capabilities to assess hydrocarbon potential; and (iii)\n            providing, through state-of-the-art exploration data\n            acquisition techniques, \"leads\" to induce\n            international oil company (IOC) activity in open areas\n            currently left unexplored.  Bank's performance was\n            deficient. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) lend only when all\n            aspects of the institutional framework are satisfactory\n            (managerial and technical capacity, administrative and\n            regulatory framework), or the operation itself addresses the\n            problems directly; (ii) rigorously evaluate borrower and\n            guarantor commitment to small projects where the loan\n            carries little leverage, and consolidate such small projects\n            into a coherent sectoral operation; (iii) rigorously enforce\n            critical covenants; (iv) use retroactive financing only\n            under justified circumstances and under highly satisfactory\n            institutional arrangements; and (v) make discussions of new\n            projects contingent on resolution of problems on ongoing\n            projects. Management should enforce early action to resolve\n            issues appropriately."}, "docdt": "1995-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
