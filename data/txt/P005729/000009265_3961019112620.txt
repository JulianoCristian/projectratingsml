IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT (LN 3023-TUN)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project in Tunisia, for which Loan 3023-TUN in the
amount of US$ 5.5 million equivalent was approved on February 21, 1989 and
made effective on December 21, 1989.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1993, compared with the original
closing date of June 30, 1993. Effective November 3, 1992, US$ 2.5 million had
been cancelled. Final disbursement took place on February 9, 1994, at which
time a balance of US$ 1.6 million was cancelled. There was no cofinancing for
the project.
The ICR was prepared by Nichola Dyer Cisse of the Private Sector
Development, Finance and Infrastructure Division of the Maghreb and Iran
Department, Middle East and North Africa Region and reviewed by Amir Al-
Khafaji, Division Chief, and Francois Amiot, Acting Project Adviser. The
borrower provided comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was based on material in the project file. It
was agreed with the Department that no completion mission would take place on
the grounds of: (i) the small loan amount; (ii) poor project execution; and
(iii) current budgetary constraints. The borrower contributed to preparation
of the ICR by providing some of the requested data and commenting on the draft
ICR.

Petroleum Exploration Promotion
Loan 3023-TUN
TUNISIA
Evaluation Summary
Introduction Within the ten years prior to this loan, the Bank supported five
energy sector projects in Tunisia (Table 2). Two power loans continued the
expansion of the subsector: (i) the Third Power project in 1981 for USS 41.5
million, of which US$ 5.4 million were cancelled (loan 2003-TUN); and (iii)
the Fourth Power project in 1984 for US$ 38.7 million, of which US$ 17.2
million were cancelled (loan 2455-TUN). The Second Natural Gas Pipeline
project in 1980, originally for US$ 37 million and reduced to US$ 27 million
(loan 1864-TUN), financed pipeline construction. The 1982 US$ 5 million
Technical Assistance loan (loan 2197-TUN) contained a US$ 700,000 energy
component that financed energy audits and efficiency studies. The 1986 Energy
Conservation and Demonstration project (loan 2735-TUN) for US$ 4 million
financed energy audits and demonstration projects.
Project Obiectives The project's objectives were to provide the basis for
increasing the rate of discovery and development of Tunisia's hydrocarbon
resources through: (i) attracting further private sector participation in
exploration of prospective open areas; (ii) strengthening ETAP's technical
capabilities to assess hydrocarbon potential; and (iii) providing, through
state-of-the-art exploration data acquisition techniques, "leads" to induce
international oil company (IOC) activity in open areas currently left
unexplored. [Para. 1]. The project had three components: (a) exploration
promotion technical assistance and training, consisting of development of
promotion packages and presentations to the oil industry; (b) geological and
geophysical data acquisition, processing and reprocessing, which included new
seismic data; and (c) procurement of laboratory equipment and material, which
comprised acquisition of geochemistry laboratory equipment, computer hardware,
and software packages for reservoir engineering and log processing. [Para. 2].
The project objectives were unrealistic given the need to strengthen and
restructure ETAP. Also, the third objective is essentially a restatement of
the first two. Project design was inadequate because the small loan size
provided insufficient leverage to achieve the objectives. [Paras. 3, 4].
Implementation Experience and Results The project did not have a substantial
impact on petroleum exploration in Tunisia. The acquisition of specialized
geophysical/geological equipment and training strengthened ETAP'B technical
capabilities somewhat. fPara. 4]. The project is unlikely to be sustainable as
it has not achieved any of its major objectives. Future energy sector
operations must squarely address the deep problems of institutional
inadequacy, weak management, and lack of borrower commitment. [Para. 15].
Implementation progress was poor from the outset. The government had
sufficient reservations that in 1992 the Minister of Planning requested the
cancellation of the loan, and in May 1992 ETAP and the Bank agreed that it
would be advisable to cancel the uncommitted funds. Effective November 3,
1992, US$ 2.5 million were cancelled and the closing date extended by six



- iii -
months to December 31, 1993 to permit completion of ongoing procurement.
[Para. 9]. Total project cost of US$ 1.93 million was markedly lower than the
expected US$ 9.0 million. Expenditures on each component were less than
forecast: (i) exploration promotion, US$ 0.71 million versus US$ 1.5 million
(main output was a videotape); (ii) data acquisition and processing (not
implemented, original estimate US$ 3.9 million); and (iii) equipment and
material, US$ 1.22 million versus US$ 2 million. Once the loan closed the
remaining balance of USS 1.6 million was cancelled effective February 9, 1994.
Only US$ 1.44 million (26.2%) had been disbursed. [Para. 10].
The outcome of this operation is highly unsatisfactory because it failed
to achieve its major objectives, yielded no substantial development results,
and had significant shortcomings. [Para. 26]. Key factors that interfered with
the achievement of the project's objectives were: (i) Bank weakness in
approving and supervising the operation without redressing basic institutional
inadequacies; (ii) lack of government commitment and support, with excessive
government control over ETAP; and (iii) inadequacy and ineffectiveness of ETAP
management and staffing. [Paras. 12,13,14]. The Bank did not adequately
address institutional issues; the loan was too small to foster borrower
commitment (exploration activity was already rebounding in Tunisia) and should
have been a component of an energy sector adjustment loan. [Para. 16]. During
preparation, the Bank provided strong technical support, but did not allocate
resources efficiently. [Paras. 6,17]. At appraisal, the Bank failed to address
the well-known institutional issues. [Para. 18]. Supervision was poor as the
Bank did not enforce covenant compliance or tackle ETAP's inadequacies.
[Paras. 20,21]. Except for highly satisfactory revisions to the petroleum law,
guarantor commitment to the project during preparation was weak; it did not
adhere to important agreements with the Bank, particularly with respect to the
state/ETAP relationship. [Para. 23]. The borrower and guarantor did not comply
with key covenants (adequate staffing, procurement, audit). [Paras. 24, 251.
Summary of Findings. Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned Despite
commendable legal and regulatory changes by the borrower and high Bank
involvement in preparation, the project's fundamental design flaws created
irremediable problems. [Para. 28]. Implementation problems were exacerbated by
the lack of borrower and guarantor commitment to the project, and the lack of
Bank leadership in addressing critical issues. [Para. 29]. Most of the planned
outputs were unrealized, and the Bank's soft stance with respect to
conditionalities and covenants undermined its credibility. The project was
inefficient on the part of the Bank and the borrower; this type of operation
should not be repeated. (Para. 26]. There is neither an ongoing operation nor
a plan for a future operation. [Para. 27].
The lessons learned from these problems are that the Bank should: (i)
lend only when all aspects of the institutional framework are satisfactory
(managerial and technical capacity, administrative and regulatory framework),
or the operation itself addresses the problems directly; (ii) rigorously
evaluate borrower and guarantor commitment to small projects where the loan
carries little leverage, and consolidate such small projects into a coherent
sectoral operation; (iii) rigorously enforce critical covenants; (iv) use
retroactive financing only under justified circumstances and under highly



- iv -
satisfactory institutional arrangements; and (v) make discussions of new
projects contingent on resolution of problems on ongoing projects. Management
should enforce early action to resolve issues appropriately. [Paras. 28, 29).

A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    The project's objectives were to provide the basis for increasing the
rate of discovery and development of Tunisia's hydrocarbon resources through:
(i) attracting further private sector participation in exploration of
prospective open areas; (ii) strengthening ETAP's technical capabilities to
assess hydrocarbon potential; and (iii) providing, through state-of-the-art
exploration data acquisition techniques, "leads" to induce international oil
company (IOC) activity in open areas currently left unexplored.
2.    To achieve the objectives, the project had three components: Ci)
exploration promotion technical assistance and training; (ii) seismic data
acquisition, processing, and reprocessing; and (iii) procurement of laboratory
equipment and material. The exploration promotion component consisted of
development of promotion packages and presentations to the oil industry in
major oil capitals. The data component included both geological and
geophysical data. The equipment component comprised acquisition of: (a)
geochemistry laboratory equipment; (b) computer hardware; and (c) software
packages for reservoir engineering and log processing.
3.    The objectives were overambitious because ETAP confronted significant
and well-known administrative and managerial hurdles that impeded achievement
of the technical objectives. In addition, the third objective (providing leads
to induce IOC activity) is essentially subsumed by the first two (attracting
private participation and strengthening ETAP's technical capabilities). These
issues were not raised during the review process; the project was justified on
the grounds that the objectives fit well with the Tunisian government's policy
to rely primarily on private risk capital to finance exploration and
development and restrict its own role to promotion and regulation.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.     There is little evidence that the project itself had any substantial
impact on exploration, although it is difficult to isolate the project's
contribution and the Bank's endorsement may have nudged some IOCs to
participate. The project design was inadequate because the small loan size did
not provide sufficient leverage to ensure the objectives would be achieved; to
do so would have required a substantial component to restructure and
strengthen ETAP. The acquisition of specialized geophysical/geological
equipment and training strengthened ETAP's technical capabilities somewhat. No
rate of return was calculated for the project, which is appropriate for this
type of project because actual prospects cannot be evaluated in advance.
5.    Several indicators were mentioned in the Memorandum and Recommendation
of the President and earlier project documents. Tracking these would have
helped to assess the project's impact on exploration activity in Tunisia: (i)
number of exploration wells drilled, considered to be fairly high given the
oil slowdown in the mid-1980s (17 in 1987, up from 10 in 1986, and an average
of 14 from 1983-85); (ii) number of permits issued to number of licensed IOCs
(in April 1988, 50 permits had been issued to 18 licensees, and the government
was negotiating further with newcomers and established producers); and (iii)
new exploration investment commitments due to the project (estimated at
appraisal at US$ 30 million). Another set would have helped to assess the
project's impact on Tunisia's hydrocarbon reserves: Ci) reserve/production



2
ratio (estimated at 12 in 1988) and (ii) increase in life span of total
reserves resulting from recent discoveries (estimated at 6 years in 1987).
However, these indicators were not tracked within the project.
6.    A total of 94.4 staff-weeks was allocated during the entire project
cycle (Table 8) and 11 field missions were carried out (Table 9), of which 7
took place prior to effectiveness. Roughly equal time was devoted to the
project before it became effective (about 42 staff-weeks over a little less
than 2 years) as to its supervision (about 44 staff-weeks over a period of
about 3 years). The preparation mission to Tunisia consisted of 2 staff for 2
days, while the followup mission to Houston to hold discussions with oil
industry representatives involved 3 staff for 4 days. A more appropriate use
of Bank time and resources would have been a longer mission to Tunisia, and
conference calls to industry representatives (or a single staff member
travelling to Houston). Also, it would have been desirable to have ETAP
directly involved in the discussions with industry representatives.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
7.    Before effectiveness, some equipment and software purchases were
financed retroactively to make it possible for ETAP to hold its first bid
round of the Gulf of Hammamet area by March 1990, before oil companies'
budgets were fixed. Delays in procurement occurred because the Ministry of
Energy and Mines was directly involved in the details of the preparation of
bidding documents. A study of ETAP's software and hardware needs, which formed
the basis for later equipment purchases, was also carried out before
effectiveness. The loan became effective December 21, 1989, after a delay of
about nine months because of slow Tunisian legal procedures (Table 3).
8.    After effectiveness, two aspects of government involvement continued to
impede procurement progress: (i) requiring ETAP to use international
competitive bidding (ICB) for all purchases, although the loan agreement
specified that less rigorous procedures could be used for specialized
purchases; and (ii) cumbersome approval procedures. In early 1990 ETAP
attempted to hire a consultant to conduct a two-year geophysical and
geological survey, but procedural delays impeded signature of the contract
until late that year. By May 1991 the project was essentially stalled: (a)
ETAP had not prepared the bidding documents for the airmag survey, as
previously agreed with the Bank, to accommodate the Ministry of Energy and
Mines' interest in substantially increasing the survey to acquire mining data;
and (b) although tendering procedures for procurement of gravimeters had been
completed, the government's procurement committee raised an objection that
postponed acquisition of the equipment. In view of such problems, the Bank and
ETAP agreed in May 1991 on the need to restructure ETAP. However, although
ETAP had already commissioned a consultant to prepare the terms of reference
for the reorganization study, no further concrete action took place.
9.    In view of the extremely poor implementation progress (less than 20% of
the loan had been disbursed), the government had sufficient reservations that
in 1992 the Minister of Planning requested the project's cancellation. In May
1992 ETAP and the Bank agreed it would be advisable to cancel the uncommitted
funds of the loan; US$ 2.5 million were cancelled effective November 3, 1992.



3
The closing date of the loan was extended by six months to December 31, 1993,
on the grounds of ETAP's progress on procurement of: (i) specialized
geological/geophysical instruments and (ii) promotional tools to attract IOCs.
10.   The loan closed on December 31, 1993, and the balance of US$ 1.6 million
was cancelled effective February 9, 1994. Only about one-quarter of the US$
5.5 million total had been disbursed (US$ 1.44 million or 26.2%), as a result
of the overwhelming delays. Total project cost of US$ 1.93 million was
markedly lower than the expected US$ 9.0 million (Tables 6A & 6B). The most
significant change in the project's cost structure was the complete lack of
activity on the data acquisition and processing component, which at US$ 3.9
million had originally been expected to account for over one-quarter of the
total project cost. Less than one-half of the amount originally expected was
spent on the exploration promotion component (US$ 0.71 million compared to the
estimate of US$ 1.5 million). Expenditures on equipment and material were
roughly 60% of the original forecast (US$ 1.22 million versus US$ 2 million).
11.   Implementation of this project was stymied by ETAP's lack of financial
and administrative autonomy, which was well-known before the project was
implemented. Previous experience with loans 2197-TUN and 2735-TUN and
discussions with oil industry representatives had indicated the potential for
delays arising from the government's procurement guidelines and cumbersome
procedures. The 4-year implementation schedule was not realistic in view of
this institutional environment (the Memorandum and Recommendation of the
President did not mention Tunisia's average disbursement profile).
12.   Factors beyond government control  The major factor beyond government
control was the Bank's weakness in approving an operation with low potential
for success and in providing inadequate supervision. In not ensuring that the
project redressed basic institutional deficiencies, the Bank failed to provide
the leadership that would have helped the project to achieve its objectives.
13.   Factors within government control  Government control over ETAP's
finances and its staffing, procurement, and administrative procedures hampered
ETAP's operations and prevented it from fulfilling its obligations under the
loan agreement. The lack of government commitment and support was the most
important factor that prevented the achievement of the project's objectives.
14.   Factors subiect to ETAP control  ETAP management, particularly project
management, accounting and reporting, was not effective. Timetables were not
respected, training programs were not undertaken as agreed, and report
deadlines slipped without appropriate followup. Project Unit staffing was
weakened during the project. Lack of familiarity with Bank procedures also
hindered ETAP's effectiveness. ETAP's institutional inadequacies substantially
interfered with the achievement of the project's objectives.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
15.   The project is unlikely to be sustainable as it has not achieved its
major objectives. Tunisia's sound energy policy is a positive factor for
sustainability of any future energy sector operations there. However, it is
highly unlikely that any followup project will be sustainable if it does not



4
squarely address the deep problems of institutional inadequacy, weak
management, and lack of borrower commitment.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
16.   Identification  While the project was consistent with the government's
development strategy and priorities, and with the Bank's overall strategy for
Tunisia, the Bank did not adequately consider institutional issues. The loan
was too small to foster borrower commitment, when exploration activity was
already rebounding in Tunisia despite the sluggish world oil market; it would
have been more effective as a component of a comprehensive energy sector
adjustment loan. As the stand-alone operation it was, the project should have
included assistance to ETAP to develop aspects of corporate management, in
particular project management, accounting, and reporting.
17.   Preparation Assistance  The project design, based on a small technical
assistance loan with insufficient leverage to tackle the well-known
institutional hurdles, was flawed. Otherwise, the Bank provided satisfactory
aBsistance with preparation, particularly with strong technical support. The
skill mix of mission members was appropriate for that design, including an
energy specialist and a geologist (Table 9). The time spent on preparation was
minimal, however, given the emphasis being placed on speed. Given the marginal
fields to be explored, it would have been appropriate to determine the size of
the smallest discovery that could be put into production with a satisfactory
financial return, and evaluate the likelihood of prospects exceeding this
minimum size. However, such an exercise would have required resources out of
proportion with the size of the project, and the Bank performed only a rough
assessment of the commercial potential of Tunisia's remaining oil fields.
18.   Appraisal  Bank performance at appraisal was deficient, on the grounds
that at this point the institutional problems could still have been addressed
through a redefinition of the objectives and appropriate changes to project
design. The deficiencies in ETAP's capacity and the time-consuming procedures
were known to the Bank and stressed by oil industry representatives, but the
proposed Project Implementation Unit was, unrealistically, expected to resolve
them. The Bank appraised the project positively despite questionable borrower
commitment, as illustrated by ETAP's lack of firm commitment to a schedule for
exploration promotion activities. The appraisal thus failed to identify the
factor that ultimately proved to be the greatest risk to the project.
19.   Other elements of the appraisal were also poorly carried out. Recent
Bank experience with other technical assistance operations in Tunisia's energy
sector was not taken into account although it indicated the potential lack of
borrower commitment, particularly with the small amounts involved. Also,
although required by Bank procedures, the Memorandum and Recommendation of the
President did not contain a discussion of the retroactive financing used for
the seismic data bank update.
20.   Supervision  The Bank's supervision performance was deficient, primarily
because it did not use the tools at its disposal to address ETAP's lack of
financial and administrative autonomy and capacity, even before the loan
became effective. Tunisia's procurement regulations were changed in April



5
1989, and the Bank was aware of the problems these new regulations caused, yet
the Bank did not enforce the covenants in the loan and guarantee agreements
during the lifetime of the project. On the contrary, in 1990 the Bank pursued
a dialogue with Tunisian officials about a future petroleum exploration
project. Bank reports on covenant compliance were incomplete and poorly
prepared; the reports cited only the financial covenants and failed to show
non-compliance. Only at the end of the project did the Bank communicate any
lack of compliance (with the financial covenants) to the borrower.
21.   Although implementation problems occurred early, the project's ratings
for both overall status and project development objectives remained 1 until
1991, when the overall status rating was downgraded to 2 (Table 9). In 1992,
with no significant progress achieved or expected, the project's overall
status rating fell to 3 but its development objectives rating was still
unrealistic at 1. The project closed with both ratings, appropriately, HU.
22.   The unsatisfactory implementation progress was the major issue addressed
in the May 1992 supervision mission, resulting in the agreement between the
Bank and ETAP to cancel the uncommitted funds of the loan. The supervision
strategy was then radically altered, with supervision reduced to contact from
headquarters alone (no missions) to ensure proper progress of procurement but
avoid any further wasteful allocation of Bank and borrower resources.
F. BORROWER AND GUARANTOR PERFORMANCE
23.   Preparation  The guarantor's contribution to project preparation was
mixed. With respect to the legal and regulatory framework, borrower
performance was highly satisfactory. The guarantor enhanced the attractiveness
of marginal fields to IOCs by revising the petroleum law in 1987 to: (i)
simplify permit procedures; (ii) provide special incentives for gas
development; and (iii) provide a more liberal tax regime for foreign
investors. These measures reinforced the positive effect of a 1985 law that
made special provisions for prospecting and producing hydrocarbons. On an
institutional level, however, the guarantor was deficient in not substantially
revising the state/ETAP relationship to allow ETAP the necessary autonomy to
carry out its functions as a national oil company. Weak borrower commitment to
the project is illustrated by its non-adherence to important agreements with
the Bank, such as the timetables for exploration activities and for the setup
of the Project Implementation Unit within ETAP's Exploration Department.
24.   Implementation  Borrower performance during implementation was also
deficient. The Project Unit was weakened by a change of staff. ETAP had little
autonomy, either financial or administrative, and remained poorly organized.
ETAP was required by the guarantor to use ICB for all procurement, even
specialized purchases, notwithstanding the less stringent conditions in the
Loan Agreement. The process, involving the procurement committee, was too
complicated. Timetables were not respected. The lack of guarantor commitment
substantially interfered with the progress of the project.
25.   Covenant compliance  The guarantor did not comply with covenants
requiring the autonomy and freedom of ETAP to conduct its activities, although
the Bank did not raise the issues with the authorities (Table 7). The



6
weakening of the staffing of the Project Unit violated Covenant 3.01 of the
Loan Agreement. The stringency of the government's procurement regulations was
not in accordance with Covenant 3.02. The financial covenant 5.01(b) was
complied with only partially and with delays: only one financial report was
ever submitted (for 1989), and audit reports were sent late. Further, the
borrower never complied with Covenant 5.01(c), which stipulated that the audit
reports were to contain a separate opinion on the use of statements of
expenditure.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
26.   The outcome of this operation is highly unsatisfactory because it failed
to achieve its major objectives, yielded no substantial development results,
and had significant shortcomings. Most of the loan was cancelled and little of
the project was implemented. The major output of the promotion component was a
videotape that was produced three years later than originally planned, while
the other exploration promotion activities were not carried out as envisioned.
Only one of the studies was completed, and only some of the planned equipment
purchases were finalized. For the Bank's part, its soft stance with respect to
key conditionalities and covenant enforcement significantly undermined its
credibility. The project was inefficient on the part of the Bank and the
borrower; this type of operation should not be repeated.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
27.   There is neither an ongoing operation nor a plan for a future operation;
therefore no monitoring scheme is necessary. It is not recommended that OED
conduct a future impact evaluation of this project because it was small,
poorly executed, and by design was neither innovative nor a pilot.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
28.   Despite commendable legal and regulatory changes by the guarantor and
high Bank involvement in technical aspects of preparation, the project was
destined to fail because it did not appropriately address key issues. The
lessons learned from this failure are that the Bank should: (i) lend only when
all aspects of the institutional framework are satisfactory (managerial and
technical capacity, adm.inistrative and regulatory framework), or the operation
itself addresses the problems directly; and (ii) rigorously evaluate borrower
and guarantor commitment to small projects where the loan has little leverage,
and consolidate such small projects into a coherent sectoral operation.
29.   Implementation problems were exacerbated by the lack of guarantor and
borrower commitment to the project, and by the lack of leadership shown by the
Bank in failing to address problems it had identified. The main lesson from
the experience is that the Bank must use the tools at its disposal to send a
credible message to the borrower by: (i) rigorously enforcing critical
covenants; (ii) using retroactive financing only under justified circumstances
and under highly satisfactory institutional arrangements; and (iii) making
discussions of new projects contingent on resolution of problems on ongoing
projects. Management should enforce early action to resolve issues
appropriately.

Comments of the Exploration Division
After review of the Implementation Completion Report for Loan 3023-TUN
from the World Bank, we were surprised to discover that almost all of the negative
technical conclusions are unfounded and arise from a simple extrapolation of the non-
disbursement of the original loan amount.
In fact, the technical component has been largely executed and did have a
positive impact on petroleum exploration in the country. It is thus, and to cite only
the principal works, that we have been able to characterize and evaluate the petroleum
potential of our country and identify unexplored areas. Furthermore, new geologic
horizons with good reservoir potential and containing appreciable hydrocarbon
reserves have been added to the list of classic oil reservoirs known in Tunisia. Two
regional studies, one concerning the Gulf of Hammamet and the other the south of
Tunisia, were completed with the technical assistance of a foreign consultant and
allowed us to stimulate exploration in these regions as well as in surrounding areas.
The presentation of the results of these studies completed by ETAP encouraged
firms to invest more in petroleum exploration in Tunisia and to show interest even in
areas considered geologically difficult to explore and whose potential had not yet been
proven (for example, the north of Tunisia).
The promotion actions that we led and that were, among other things, based
on the technical program had a direct impact in focusing the interest of oil companies
on our country. We have thus been able to go from:
- 25 exploration permits in 1989 to 40 in 1994
- 15 operators in 1989 to 26 in 1994
- 24 companies having shares in permits in 1989 to 43 in 1994
It is now clear that the World Bank's negative evaluation, in contradiction with
reality, may be due to the fact that the authors of this draft report did not monitor the
evolution of the situation in the domain of petroleum exploration in Tunisia. This
state of affairs may be the consequence of frequent changes on the part of the World
Bank with regard to the team members following the project.
Comments of the Financial Direction
The ICR put the emphasis essentially on administrative and procurement
procedures as well as the financial autonomy of ETAP and its organization although
the respect for legal procedures did not substantially hinder the realization of the
program.



In fact, application of the administrative procedures relative to procurement
seems long, but it is aimed mainly at optimizing the price/quality relationship in order
to minimize ETAP's costs.
Furthermore, although it has enjoyed financial autonomy since its creation,
further clarified in June 1991, ETAP holds to respect governmental institutions, such
as the supervisory ministry or monetary authority, for coordination at the national
level.
Regarding accounts management, ETAP enters records relative to the project
in accounts appropriately opened on its books. These accounts are audited and
certified annually by an independent expert. A copy of this expert's reports is sent
regularly to the Bank.
Several organization missions have been carried out within ETAP to guarantee
the efficiency of its actions and to achieve its strategic objectives. For the project in
question, a department was created solely for the achievement and monitoring of the
project.
