The main\n            components of the project are as follows : (i) a seismic\n            program, which involves the reprocessing of existing data\n            and the acquisition and processing of a further 1,000 kms of\n            new data; (ii) consultants to conduct gravity and airmag\n            surveys in the north of the country; (iii) equipment for\n            extensive geologic and geochemical surveys; and (iv)\n            computer software for seismic data processing and a systems\n            analyst to introduce the new software packages. The project\n            will also provide technical assistance for the preparation\n            of a promotional package, the organization of promotional\n            meetings, and to arrange meetings with potentially\n            interested companies. Finally, the project will provide\n            training to staff from ETAP (Entreprise Tunisienne\n            d'Activities Petrolieres) in advanced exploration technologies."}, "docdt": "1988-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
