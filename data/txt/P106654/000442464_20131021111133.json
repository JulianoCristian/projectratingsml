Some lessons learned\n            included: it is hard to avoid the impression that the\n            project was seen as a means of adding funds to emergency\n            power rehabilitation project (EPRP) for rehabilitation\n            investments, based on needs identified, feasibility, and\n            implementation arrangements prepared earlier. Yet a rigorous\n            appraisal of the project on its own merits may have revealed\n            its design shortcomings. The proposal to provide for an\n            obligation of operation and maintenance of the\n            infrastructure rehabilitated under the contracts did not\n            prove effective because contractors demobilized and\n            enforcement of legal remedies to complete works or correct\n            defects now needs to be sought. In countries with a history\n            of conflict and poor capacity, consideration should be given\n            to relative or incremental indicators, for example the\n            number of households connected and metered, and the project\n            development objective (PDO) framed around these simpler and\n            more easily measured metrics. Some flexibility in design is\n            essential, including the early identification of alternative\n            activities to finance. Similarly, the inability to travel on\n            site should be considered at inception, including by\n            exploring alternative options through modern technology. It\n            is, important that coordination between Ministry of Energy\n            and Water (MEW) and Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) be\n            considered together at project design, especially if it is\n            known that further sector development is planned during the\n            project's lifetime."}, "docdt": "2013-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
