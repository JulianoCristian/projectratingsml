                         The development objective of the project is to help provide reliable and quality power to the consumers in the target areas of the cities of Kabul, Aybak, and
                         Mazar-e-Sharif.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was extended for a second time on September 19, 2011, bringing the cumulative extension period to 30 months, to provide adequate time to complete the remaining
                         project activities and thus allow full completion of the Project Development Objective (PDO). The activities have been delayed for several reasons, some of which have been outside
                         the control of the project implementing entity.

                         Review of the indicators for Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif elements of the project suggest that the project has achieved its intermediate objectives and that only Aybak remains to be
                         achieved and that the main focus for the remaining implementation period will be on completing the Aybak substation and medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) distribution
                         networks. Nonetheless, contracts for both Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif electrification work must be completed and formally closed in the coming months.

                         The project management firm (PMF) demobilized in July 2011 and selection of a new consultant is under way but the project has suffered significant delays as a result of the absence
                         of the consultant, particularly in certification and handover of physical works, reporting and disbursement.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The ARTF closing date of June 30, 2012 will not be further extended. Focus is therefore on ensuring all contracted work is completed by that date, or where it cannot be completed
                         to bring contracts to a close in an orderly way while ensuring the PDO is met.
