                         Review of the indicators for Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif distribution elements of the project suggest that the project has achieved its intermediate objectives. All remaining equipment
                         for further work by DABS at Mazar-e-Sharif has been delivered. The Mazar-e-Sharif and Aybak substations have been energized but have not been commissioned or handed over to
