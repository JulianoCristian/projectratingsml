                         The development objective of the project is to help provide reliable and quality power to the consumers in the target areas of the cities of Kabul, Aybak, and Mazar-e-
                         Sharif.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was extended for a second time on September 19, 2011, bringing the cumulative extension period to 30 months, to provide adequate time to complete the remaining
                         project activities and thus allow full completion of the Project Development Objective (PDO). The activities for which the extension was granted have been further delayed for several
                         reasons, some of which have been outside the control of the project implementing entity.

                         Review of the indicators for Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif elements of the project suggest that the project has achieved its intermediate objectives and that only the Aybak indicator
                         remains to be achieved. The main focus for the remaining implementation period will be on completing the Aybak substation. Nonetheless, contracts for both Kabul and Mazar-e-
                         Sharif electrification work must be completed and formally closed in the coming months.

                         Selection of a new consultant to act as Project Management Firm (PMF) was completed in January 2012 and is under way. The consultant has focused on ensuring certification of
                         physical progress and invoices to allow contractors to continue (and in some cases restart) work, with the resulting in pickup of project activities. Some of the lost time has been
                         regained but overall implementation is delayed.
