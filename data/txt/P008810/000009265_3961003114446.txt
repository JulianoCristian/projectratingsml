MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR A PRIVATIZATION IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
loan to the Russian Federation for the equivalent to US$90.0 million to help
finance a Privatization Implementation Assistance ?roject. The loan would be
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen1
years, including five years of grace.
2.    Background.  Russia has embarked on an ambitious and courageous program
to transform its centrally-planned economy to a market economy. The initial
stages of reform, begun in early 1992, focused on freeing prices and trade and
on stabilizing the economy. Government recognizes that stabilization and
enterprise reform is crucial to the success of both its stabilization and
adjustment programs and that privatization is the ke, to enterprise reform.
Therefore it has recently launched a national privatization program of
momentous proportions, the largest one ever attempted. The program centers
around a mass privatization scheme for some 25,000 medium and large industrial
State Owned Enterprises (SOE). The program also comprises the privatization
of the some 1,000 largest and most complex enterprises. It further includes
the privatization of about 200,000 small manufacturing, retail, and service
businesses, mostly under regional and municipal ownership. The program is
based on a consistent framework for quickly privatizing large numbers of
firms. It grants well defined incentives to all participants in the process
and provides for widespread ownership through the use of vouchers. The program
will be implemented at the level of government responsible for the enter-
prises, i.e. federal, regional or municipal, but with a maximum degree of
decentralization to encourage enterprise managers to initiate privatization.
Vouchers are being issued with a face value of 10,000 Rubles, one for each
citizen, with the announced intention of subsequent tranches. The vouchers
can be used directly to buy shares in enterprises or to buy shares in invest-
ment funds which serve as financial intermediaries in the privatization
process. So far much of the Government's privatization work has been devoted
to putting in place rapidly the legal and policy framework for mass privat-
ization, and to carrying out initial implementation design. Urgently needed
now are the physical, financial and human resources for implementation, which
the Project would help provide on a substantial scale during the initial
critical period of the privatization program.
3.     The privatization program will be undertaken in an economy which
continues to experience considerable instability, which in all probability
will complicate enterprise decision making and impede restructuring and
1.    Starting with this loan, the Russian Federation will be treated as a
lower middle-income country for IBRD borrowing on the .asis of the per
capita estimate of GNP for 1991 (about US$3,220) and the faster than
expected decline in GNP forecast for 1992 (currently projected to be at
least 22%). GNP estimates for economies of the former Soviet Union are
subject to more than the usual range of uncertainty, and they should be
regarded as very preliminary and subject to revision.



-2-
investment. Institutions needed to support privaLization are at a very early
stage of development and do not presently have the capacity to support the
Government's privatization objectives. Moreover, the disintegration of
central control has created a fundamental ambiguity about the ownership of
enterprises that has led to uncontrolled spontaneous privatization sponsored
by the various stake holders, including central and local governme.Lt agencies,
enterprise managers, and workers. In the absence of clear ownership, the
enterprises have little incentive to improve efficiency and undertake
productive activity. At the same time, the entrance of new private sector
activity is stifled by the unstable economic environment, a legal and
regulatory framework that is frequently overly restrictive and the lack of
institutions to foster entrepreneurship. Significant steps are needed to
resolve these difficult problems so that a supply side response to the more
liberal economic environment can take place.
4.    Under the Technical Cooperation Agreement, the Bank, since late 1991,
has provided assistance for the preparation of the mass privatization program,
the definition of private sector development policies and programs and advice
on the legal framework for a market economy. Together with the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Bank also helped put in place
and guide a large European Economic Commission (EC) funded consortium, which
assisted the State Committee for the Management of State Property (GKI) in the
designing of many of the detailed implementation features of the Russian
privatization program. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) financed the
first review and analysis of several areas of policy design, i.e. corporate
governance issues, anti-monopoly and pro-competition policies, and inter-
enterprise arrears. IFC is actively working alongside the Bank, undertaking
pilot privatization transactions in small scale privatization (Nizhny
Novgorod, Volgograd, Tomsk), and designing the privatization of a number of
medium size transport enterprises in Nizhny Novgorod. Several other Bank
activities, in addition to the Droposed Project, address related systemic
reforms. The first one is the Rehabilitation Loan, approved earlier this
year, which sets out the framework for systemic reform. Second, the
Employment Services and Social Protection Project addresses social safety net
issues and labor market policies. Thirdly, a Financial Sector Review, is
helping to develop the financial sector reform agenda. Fourthly, the proposed
Oil Sector Loan includes restructuring and corporate governance aspects in the
oil and gas sectors.
5.    Proiect Design.  The Privatization Implementation Assistance Project is
tailored to the needs and the timetable of the Russian privatization and
enterprise reform program. Its design reflects the decentralized, regional,
"bottom-up" approach of the Russian program, by making available to the
agencies charged with implementation a central pool of critically-needed
technical assistance and equipment resources on which they can draw. The
Project design also responds to the multi-agency nature of the Russian program
by supporting the creation of the Russian Privatization Center (Center), which
will be owned by GKI, the Federal Property Funds (FPF) and the State Committee
for Anti-Monopoly Policy and New Economic Structures. The Project is further
designed to provide policy advice on enterprise reform aspects and to begin to



-3-
address business development and promotion needs. Flexibility for redesign
does exist, should the experience with the privatization program or other
factors warrant this. A mid-term review is planned.
6.    Lessons from Experience.  The Russian Government, when designing its
privatization program, systematically reviewed and took into account the
privatization experience from Eastern Europe and elsewhere, drawing on Bank
and EBRD staff, extensive consulting services and direct input from a numbc:
of key Eastern European and other privatization officials. The proposed
Project, itself, is the result of a key lesson learned, nar.iely that privat-
ization on a significant scale demands intensive institutional and technical
assistance support. While Russia has drawn upon the lessons from other
countries, its size and complexity have demanded unique solutions. One of
these solutions, for example, is the highly decentralized and regionalized
nature of the privatization process.
7.    Project Objectives.  The central objective of the Project is to provide
timely, comprehensive assistance to all important aspects of the Russian
privatization program, including support for the development of the insti-
tutional capacity of the Russian Privatization Center and other relevant
agencies; implementation of the mass privatization program, public infor-
mation, various forms of transactions and enterprise restructuring in
preparaticn for or pursuant to privatization. A second objective is to
continue to assist Government in policy formulation and design in key areas
complem_nzary to privatization. A third objective is to assist in facil-
itating business entry and to provide pilot business and infrastructure
services.
8.    Project Description.  The Project has four components:
(a) Policy Design Component (US$3.3 million). Technical assistance will be
provided to support policy analysis in areas complementary to
privatization, specifically corporate governance and portfolio
management, inter-enterprise liabilities, competition policy, and
environmental issues associated with privatization;
(b) Privatization Implementation Component (US$147.6 million). Technical
Assistance and equipment will be provided to ,upport: (i) the mass
privatization program (US$26.4 million); (ii) a public information
campaign (US$16.2 million); (iii) large scale privatization transactions
(US$60 million); (iv) small and medium scale privatization transactions
(US$14 million); (v) provision of equipment to regional offices (US$10.4
million); (vi) training (US$5 million); and (vii) the establishment of
the Russian Privatization Center (US$15.6 million);
(c) Business Development and Promotion Component (US$7.0 million).
Technical assistance will be provided to build the public and private
sector's capacity to understand and address the needs of the emerging
private sector; and
(d) Refinancing of the PPF (US$1.5 million).



-4-
9.    Project Cost and Financing Plan.  Total Project cost is estimated to be
US$159.4 millinn, with a foreign exchange content of US$118.5 million. The
Project would be financed in parallel from (i) the proposed IBRD loan of US$90
million; (ii) an EBRD loan of US$43.4 million; and (iii) Government contri-
bution of US$26 million. Detailed costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Russia are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
10.   Project Implementation.  A Russian Privatization Center will be
established as the principal agency for implementing the Policy Design and
Privatization Implementation Components of the Project over a three year
period. The concept for the Center grew out of the neee to set up an entity
which can freely operate and recruit highly quallfied staff without being
subject to civil service employment restrictions for salaries and wages. The
Center is also a vehicle for bringing together the different agencies involved
in privatization. The Center would be established as a not-for-profit state
organization of the Russian Federation and formed principally by public
foundert including the State Committee for the Management of State Property,
the Federal P:operty Fund, and the State Committee for Anti-Monopoly Policy
and New Economic Structures, which will appoint their representatives to the
Center's Board. Private founders will co-found the Center. The Center will
make Project resources available in several ways. First, it will directly
support the mass privatization program, the public information campaign,
training, and program logistics through provision of office and communications
equipment to implementing agencies. Second, it will respond to demand for
transaction related services from any of the agencies charged with imple-
menting the privatiz- .ion program. Third, it will take a proactive role in
subsector analysis, the defensive restructuring of very large and complex
firms and/or sectors and policy design work. The Working Center for Economic
Reform (WCER) would be the principal agency for implementing the Business
Development and Promotion Component, assisted by the Center in procurement,
disbursement and accounting functions.
11. Agreed Actions. The principal agreements reached during negotiations
are that (i) Government will cause the Privatization Center to perform in
accordance with all agreements and statutes; (ii) the Government will enter
into subsidiary Project Management Arrangements with the Privatization Center,
acceptable to the Bank; (iii) the Privatization Center will operate under an
annual budget, with an organization and staffing plan, and with salary ranges
for each position, all acceptable to the Bank; (iv) selection of candidates
for management positions will take place under procedures acceptable to the
Bank; (v) compensation and other terms and conditions of employment of the
management of the Privatization Center will be subject to approval of the
Center's Board; (vi) for each enterprise being prepared for privatization
under the Project, an environmental review will be carried out under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, or, in cases acceptable to the Bank, the
Center will ensure the issuance of appropriate disclosures, representations
and warranties or other information acceptable to the Bank in lieu of such
review; (vii) large-scale enterprise candidates for privatization under the
Project will be selected in conformity with criteria formulated by the
Privatization Center and in consultation with the Bank; and (viii) equipment



and services will be made available to the beneficiaries under standard
agreements between the Privatization Center and the recipients on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. Prior to Loan Effectiveness (i) effec-
tiveness of the EBRD loan agreement is required; (ii) the Subsidiary Project
Management Arrangements between Government and the Privatization Center have
been concluded; and (iii) tl;e Privatization Center has appointed the chief
executive officer, chief fi:nancial officer, chief procurement officer, chief
operating officer, and manager for vouchers and capital markets.
12.   Environmental Aspects.  The Project is in Category C.  Environmental
policy work and environmental reviews and audits, pursuant to privatization,
will be carried out under the Project.
13.   Benefits.  The Project would pruvide critically needed assistance to
implement the Government's privatization program, a key element of the overall
reform program, which, if successful, would create the basis for a market
economy. The Project would also provide a strong vehicle for continued policy
formulation and design on the overall direction and policies in enterprise
reform, privatization, corporate governance and anti-monopoly activities. The
Project would further help the emergence and development of new businesses.
14    Risks.  The Project faces several significant risks.  First, economic
instability in Russia could undermine privatization and the entire reform
effort. While this risk cannot be actively managed under the Project,
successful privatization would contribute towards macro-economic stability.
Second, the sheer magnitude of the program makes uniformity and strict compli-
ance with the Privatization Law doubtful and large regional differences can be
expected; therefore the project design is predicated on funding those regions
and enterprises that are committed to privatize and provide reasonable privat-
ization plans. Third, several agencies with overlapping responsibilities are
involved in the process, creating the potential for conflict. The Russian
Privatization Center, brings them under one umbrella, establishing a forum for
inter-agency coordination and conflict resolution. The Center also creates
the institutional capacity to manage the large amount of technical assistance
provided under the Project, reducing general implementation risk. Fourth, an
uninformed public could sell vouchers at a steep discount, discrediting the
privatization program. The Government has moved to mitigate this possibility
by implementing a public information campaign, to which the Project will
contribute funding. Fifth, the risk of a major political redirection of the
program is not insignificant. This risk cannot be managed under the Project,
but privatization has the potential to provide assets to the general public
thus giving them a stake in economic reform and contributing to overall
stability.
