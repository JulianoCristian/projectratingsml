    SUMMARY

    1. The major changes and rationale to the Colombia: Second Student Loan Project, Loan 7515-
       CO (the Project) are as follows:
      ·    The closing date has been extended by eighteen months, from December 31, 2010 to June
           30, 2012, to enable the Instituto Colombiano de Crédito Educativo y Estudios Técnicos en
           el Exterior (ICETEX) to fully achieve the objective of diversifying its funding resources
           while it continues scaling up the provision of student loans to students from the lowest
           socioeconomic strata.

        · All but four targets have been made more ambitious to reflect the extended
          implementation schedule and a larger resource envelope than originally anticipated. The
          other four targets have been made less ambitious to reflect the impact of the financial
          crisis, and realistic operating environment and costs. Additionally, two indicators have
          been modified to address current monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data shortcomings and
          to acknowledge ICETEX's funding diversification efforts to include non-private sources
          and better capture results.
        · The financing plan has been revised to reflect a larger commitment of resources from the
          Government of Colombia.
    PROJECT STATUS


2. The Project is the first phase of a planned two-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to the
   Instituto Colombiano de Crédito Educativo y Estudios Técnicos en el Exterior (ICETEX), a
   public special-nature1 financial institution linked to the Ministerio de Educación Nacional.
   ICETEX's mission is to promote access and retention in tertiary education mainly through the
   provision of student loans to needy but academically talented students. The Project is also the
   follow-on of a previous project financed by Loan 7155-CO and implemented between 2003
   and 2008, under the name Acceso con Calidad a la Educación Superior (ACCES), and is
   officially referred to in Colombia as ACCES II.


3. Because of the global financial crisis ICETEX has pursued a more conservative financial
   leverage strategy, using a higher share of fiscal resources than originally foreseen. Therefore,
   six months prior to the closing date only USD 173 million of the USD 300 million approved
   by the Bank have been disbursed.



1
    As ICETEX cannot be considered a commercial financial institution or a Bank.

                                                          4
4. Meanwhile, project implementation has progressed well and ICETEX is likely to meet targets
   for key Intermediate Results/Implementation Indicators. As of June 30, 2010, six months prior
   to the original closing date, 73,375 new students had benefited from an ACCES II student
   loan (73 percent of the original target). In addition, the number of students from the two
   lowest socioeconomic strata that received an ACCES II student loan was 62,226 (78 percent
   of the target). To date, 82 percent and 97 percent of ICETEX beneficiaries come from the two
   and three lowest socioeconomic strata,2 respectively. In addition, ICETEX has managed to
   significantly reduce operating costs during the last few years, mainly through synergies
   related to the centralization and virtualization of operations.

5. Diversification of ICETEX resources has proved more challenging than anticipated, for
   reasons beyond ICETEX's control. To date, ICETEX has only been able to generate 4.4
   percent of its resources for student loans through external sources, against an original target of
   9 percent by the end of the first phase of the APL. ICETEX's initial plans to diversify its
   funding sources through capital market mechanisms were strongly affected by the global
   economic and financial crisis.3 The securitization of a sub-portfolio of its loans became
   unrealizable amidst the crisis, as Colombian capital markets have not carried out any
   securitization in the last two years.


6. Given the expected improvement in the local financial markets for the period 2010 to 2012,
   ICETEX is finalizing plans to raise an additional COP 150,000 million in three tranches over
   the next two years through the issuance of Títulos de Ahorro Educativo (TAE), a fixed-
   income security that enables parents to save today to cover their children's future costs of
   higher education enrollment. A portion of the funds raised through TAE will be earmarked to
   finance new student loans. In addition, ICETEX is exploring alternatives to further increase
   the financial contributions received from sub-national entities and higher education
   institutions and to sell a portion of its past-due portfolio, among other funding diversification
   strategies.


7. ICETEX has also developed an alternative plan to diversify funding sources mainly through
   additional non-capital market mechanisms. These plans include alliances with private and
   public sector entities or the creation of a reserve fund to cover default with contributions from
   participating higher education institutions. Agreements have been recently signed with 206
   higher education institutions, due, among other things, to ICETEX's recent efforts to develop
   an integrated support model to higher education students with the goal of preventing drop-out.
   The number of agreements significantly exceeds the original target, and is expected to lead to
   increased funding diversification.

    PROPOSED CHANGES




2
  As measured by the government Estrato classification, based on the dwelling location and access to services.
3
  Nevertheless, ICETEX's role in helping contain student drop-out during the recent global financial crisis was
significant, unlike in the crisis that took place towards the end of the 1990s.

                                                          5
8. Revised indicators. One of the 5 PDO-level/Impact Indicators and one of the 6 Intermediate
   Results/Implementation Indicators have been modified. The new, proposed indicators, the
   original indicators they substitute and the rationale behind the proposed changes are presented
   below and further detailed in Annex 1:


         · Increase in the percentage of students enrolled in tertiary education whose
           income is below twice the minimum salary.4 This new indicator has substituted for
           the indicator Increase in the net enrollment of students in quintiles 1 and 2. The reason
           for this change is that there have been difficulties in reporting information on the
           original indicator by ICETEX, due to data limitations in the Household and Standard
           of Living surveys carried out by the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de
           Estadística (DANE), which was at Project inception expected to be the main data
           source for M&E.


         · Percentage of total resources available for student credit generated from new
           external sources (other than ACCES credit, government/public funding for
           tuition or interest rate subsidies or equity resources). This revised indicator has
           substituted for the indicator Percentage of total resources available for student credit
           generated from external private sources (other than ACCES credit, government/
           public funding or equity resources). The reason for this change is to reflect ICETEX's
           current strategy to diversify its funding sources through both private sources and non-
           private sources such as public sector alliances. This change will also enable to better
           capture Project results.

9. Revised targets. Targets have been revised for all of the PDO-level/Impact Indicators and
   Intermediate Results/Implementation Indicators, and are detailed in Annex 1. All but four of
   the revised targets have been made more ambitious in light of the extended Project
   implementation schedule and increased resource availability. Less ambitious targets in the
   reduction of ICETEX's annual administrative costs, number of new upgraded management
   and IT systems, portfolio at risk and diversification of funding sources have been agreed. This
   is because most of the cost synergies from the centralization and virtualization of ICETEX's
   regional operations have already been achieved and have required investments not originally
   anticipated, leaving little space for further improvement beyond the already significant
   improvements made. In addition, the current financial crisis suggests that the ongoing
   improvements in portfolio quality will require a longer timeframe to materialize.


10. With the rebounding capital markets and ICETEX's alternative plans for funding
    diversification, ICETEX should be in a position to increase the percentage of total resources
    from external sources but only at a less rapid pace than originally envisioned. The plans for
    diversifying resources mainly through the issuance of TAE have been found acceptable by the
    Bank.

 Minimum salaries would be defined according to the official definition of Salario Mínimo Legal Mensual Vigente
(SMLMV) by the Colombian government. For 2010, it was fixed at COP 515,000.

                                                        6
11. Extension of closing date. The closing date has been extended by eighteen months, from the
    original closing date of December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2012. This has been the first
    extension. The extension will enable ICETEX to: (i) fully achieve the objective of
    diversifying its funding resources; and (ii) continue scaling up the provision of student loans
    to students from the lowest socioeconomic strata.

12. Revised financing plan. The financing plan has been adjusted to reflect the larger
    commitment of fiscal resources by the Government of Colombia (GoC) (see Table below). By
    June 30, 2012, the GoC is expected to have committed USD 238 million equivalent in
    Colombian Pesos, significantly exceeding the original plan of USD 88 million.5 These
    resources will continue to finance new loans and renewals of loans to financially needy, but
    academically talented students who are seeking to enroll in Colombian higher education
    institutions.

13. Triggers. The triggers for advancing from APL I to APL II remain unchanged. It must be
    noted that the five triggers have already been met.
