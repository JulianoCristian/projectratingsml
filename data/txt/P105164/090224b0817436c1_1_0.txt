                         The development objectives of the proposed program are to (a) improve coverage by increasing the enrollment and graduation rates of students in tertiary education; (b)
                         improve equity by increasing enrollment and graduation rates of tertiary education students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds; and (c) increase and
                         diversify the sources of alternative funding available to ICETEX in order to increase ICETEX's sustainability.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is on track to achieve its development objectives. Coverage and equity of the tertiary education system have increased since the program began in 2008. In 2008, 65
                         percent of students graduating from secondary education enrolled in tertiary education.By December 2011, this number had increased to 75% percent, exceeding the end target of
                         71.5% estimated for June 2013. The net tertiary education enrollment rate for students whose income is below two times the minimum wage increased from 45.6% in 2006 to 54.5%

                         2008 and June 2012, 146,907 new students had benefited from an ACCES student loan. 83.7% of these students came from the two lowest socioeconomic strata.
