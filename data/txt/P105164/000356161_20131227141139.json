moderate; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO) should be expressed in a\n            way that the objectives are expressed upfront, followed by\n            project results which are expected to contribute to their\n            achievement. Including PDO indicators in the PDO as a means\n            of achieving project objectives should be avoided to prevent\n            confusion and clarify aims. The financial terms of the Bank\n            loan under the project were developed in close collaboration\n            between the Bank and ICETEX (Instituto Colombiano de Credito\n            Educativo y Estudios Tecnicos en el Exterior - Colombian\n            Institute for Educational Credit and Technical Studies\n            Abroad) were important to reduce ICETEX's financial\n            risk. The agreements with Higher Education Institutions\n            (HEIs) and more specifically the implementation of\n            affirmative actions to reduce dropout rates have proved to\n            be effective and should be pursued and monitored carefully.\n            The collaboration between the Ministry of National Education\n            (MEN) and ICETEX is critical to ensure that a plan including\n            the implementation of quality standards and incentives be in\n            place to increase the number of accredited HEIs. Leveraging\n            ICETEX resources with funds from other sources, including\n            municipalities, universities, and/or departments, through\n            alianzas and through the sustainability funds has been more\n            successful than raising financing from the private market.\n            It is possible, through incremental changes to the formula\n            used to allocate student loans, to reconcile the different\n            methodologies used to target students from low income\n            families to improve the targeting and make it compatible\n            with the reduction of risks."}, "docdt": "2013-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
