                         The development objectives of the proposed program are to (a) improve coverage by increasing the enrollment and graduation rates of students in tertiary education; (b)
                         improve equity by increasing enrollment and graduation rates of tertiary education students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds; and (c) increase and

                         contributed towards these improvements by increasing the number of loans available to academically talented but needy students. Between June 2008 and December 2011, 125,531
                         new students had benefited from an ACCES student loan; 84 percent of these students came from the two lowest socioeconomic strata.
