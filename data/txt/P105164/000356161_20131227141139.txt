Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objectives of the Program are to (a) improve coverage by increasing the enrollment
and graduation rates of students in tertiary education; (b) improve equity by increasing
enrollment and graduation rates of tertiary education students from economically
disadvantaged backgrounds; and (c) increase and diversify the sources of alternative
funding available to Borrower in order to increase the Borrower's financial sustainability.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)

The Project’s PDO remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context at Appraisal

1.      Since the 1990s, the Government of Colombia (GoC) strategy has been to develop
human capital to improve competitiveness, diversify the economy, and sustain growth.
Colombia has achieved nearly universal enrollment at primary education level and has
significantly increased access at secondary level. However, the GoC could not afford to
increase tertiary education supply on its own. Private institutions have sprung up to meet
the rising demand for higher education, but the market was failing to adequately finance
demand. Thus, the GoC decided to increase access to tertiary education through student
loans, provided by the Instituto Colombiano de Crédito Educativo y Estudios Técnicos en
el Exterior (ICETEX). The Bank had provided support to the GoC through a preceding
2002 “Higher Education Improving Access Project”, which contained the original
ACCES loan program. This Project has been designed to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of ICETEX student lending while working with the GoC to achieve its
broader sector goals of reaching 35 percent of enrollment rate by 2010, as established in
National Development Plan 2006-2010 (PND, Plan Nacional de Desarrollo).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

2.      The objectives of the program were to (a) improve coverage by increasing the
enrollment and graduation rates of students in tertiary education; (b) improve equity by
increasing enrollment and graduation rates of tertiary education students from
economically disadvantaged backgrounds; and (c) increase and diversify the sources of
alternative funding available to the Borrower in order to increase the Borrower’s financial
sustainability.

3.     Key indicators for rating Project outcomes were:

       •   Increase in the transition rate between secondary and tertiary education.
       •   Increase in the number of tertiary education graduates.
       •   Increase in the net enrollment rate of students in quintiles 1 and 2.
       •   Decrease in the annual administrative costs of ICETEX as a percentage of
           total annual income.
       •   Decrease in portfolio at risk over 30 days as a percentage of total portfolio.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

4.      The PDO remained unchanged. One Key/PDO Indicator was modified in the first
restructuring; due to the lack of data, the original PDO indicator “increase in the net



                                            1
enrollment of students in quintile 1 and 2” was replaced by “the percentage of students
enrolled in tertiary education whose income is below twice the minimum salary”. 1

1.4   Main Beneficiaries

5.     The Project was intended to serve the following beneficiaries: (i) an estimated
100,000 new qualified students who would have, for the first time, received an ICETEX
loan to enroll in tertiary education; and (ii) an estimated 432,000 tertiary education
students who have already received ICETEX loans and would renew those loans to
advance toward completion of a tertiary education program.

1.5   Original Components

6.      Component 1 - Expanding equity and access to tertiary education (USD 293.70
million; 100% of total Project cost): (i) to extend new student loans and renew existing
loans to qualified students from economically disadvantaged families; (ii) to form new
alliances with tertiary education institutions to increase support and services to low
income students, foster a culture of repayment among students, support collection efforts
after graduation and co-finance tuition.

7.       Component 2: Institutional strengthening (USD6.3 million; 100% of total Project
cost): (i) to strengthen ICETEX loan administration, portfolio management and collection
procedures and upgrade its data technology hardware and software; (ii) to expand
ICETEX funding base to ensure long term sustainability; and (iii) to monitor the Project
and to perform impact evaluation studies.

1.6   Revised Components

8.      The original components were not revised.

1.7   Other significant changes

9.      A first restructuring was approved on October 20, 2010, due to slower
disbursement than originally intended. Six months before the original closing date
(December 31, 2010) only USD173 million had been disbursed of the USD 300 million
approved, for two main reasons: (i) ICETEX had chosen to pursue a conservative
financial leverage policy; and (ii) a slowdown of students’ loans demand and
improvement in the management of the portfolio had contributed to a budget surplus in
2010.The restructuring allowed to adapt the Project to the changing context since the


1
 Using minimum wages as an indicator has the following advantages: (i) the indicator is comparable over
time; (ii) the data is available from the MEN (there was a lack of data on income quintiles); and (iii) the
universe of those whose family income is below two minimum wages includes all the individuals that fall
under SISBEN. In 2010, Students in quintiles Q1 and Q2 represented 23.1% of total enrollment while
students whose family income is below twice the minimum enrollment represented 38%.


                                                    2
financial crisis prevented the initial objective of diversifying ICETEX funding through
private sector investment and to present a more realistic assessment of the operating
environment and costs. For ICETEX to fully achieve its objective of diversifying its
funding sources and scaling up the provision of student loans, the closing date was
extended from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2012. All PDO and intermediate indicator
targets were made more ambitious to reflect the extended implementation schedule and a
larger resource envelope than originally anticipated (with the exception of PDO indicator
5 “Decrease of the portfolio at risk” and intermediate indicator 5 “Diversification of
ICETEX resources”). Additionally, one intermediate indicator was modified: the
percentage of total resources available for student credit generated from new external
sources was substituted by the percentage of total resources available for student credit
generated from external private source, to reflect ICETEX’s strategy to diversify its
funding sources through public sector alliances (Alianzas).

10.     A corrigendum to the first restructuring was approved on March 29, 2011 to
revise the definition of Conversion Date in par. 20 of the Appendix to the General
Conditions.

11.     A second restructuring was approved on April 25, 2012, to extend the closing date
from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to ensure the Project could fully meet its
development objectives and to enable the continued scaling up of the provision of student
loans to students from the lowest socio economic strata, in a rapidly changing context for
higher education. There was no re-allocation of funding.

12.    A third restructuring was approved June 14, 2013 to reallocate $6.3 million from
Category 2 (Component 2) to Category 1 (Component 1). This reallocation was justified
since Component 2 was financed with ICETEX’s own resources. Therefore these funds
were used to finance additional student loans under Component 1.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strengths

13.     Responsiveness of the Bank: The Bank was able to respond to ICETEX’s and
GoC’s demands in six months because of: (i) the exemplary cooperation between IFC,
the Treasury(BDM) and LAC (a memorandum of understanding was signed between IFC
and the Bank for the preparation of the Project); (ii) the knowledge accumulated during
the previous Higher Education project in Colombia; and (iii) the strong collaboration
between the Bank, ICETEX and GoC due to the past experience of several members of
the Bank’s team in Colombia. To respond to the needs of ICETEX and GoC, the Bank
Treasury innovated by: (i) extending the duration of repayment period of the Bank loan to
22.5 years – including 6 years of grace period - (and 5 years after the repayment period of
a student loan); (ii) making a disbursement linked repayment (the 6 years grace period
starts with each disbursement, instead of when the Bank commits the funds); (iii) making

                                            3
the loan to ICETEX with a guarantee of GoC; and (iv) converting the loan to pesos
(COP)on disbursement so ICETEX did not take a foreign exchange risk. The flexibility
of financial terms allowed ICETEX to adapt to new circumstances.

14.     Relevance of PDO objectives and strong ownership of GoC and ICETEX: The
Project was fully aligned with: (i) the GoC objective to increase access to tertiary
education by supporting demand from students from the lower socio-economic quintiles;
and (ii) ICETEX goals to expand ACCES lending and to improve its management
practices and financing alianzas to support a publicly guided loan program. More broadly,
the Project was conceived as the first phase of a six year APL Program consistent with
the GoC long term objective (Visión Colombia 2019) and the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) under development to sustain economic growth while also ensuring a
more rapid reduction of poverty.

15.     Technical quality of Project design: The Project design was simple and perfectly
adapted to ICETEX needs. While short, the Project preparation process brought some
technical improvements to ICETEX's ways of operating: (i) the pricing differentiation to
target the ACCES student loans to strata 1 and 2; and (ii) the methodology to calculate
the portfolio at risk. The Project design benefited from: (i) lessons learned from the
Bank’s broad experience with student loans in five LAC countries and in Indonesia,
ICETEX past experience, and strong analytical work; (ii) carefully considered
alternatives for Project design; (iii) good quality economic and financial analysis; and (iv)
a sensitivity analysis carried out to analyze the behavior of the student debt burden under
various interest rates and tuition levels. Finally the fact that the Bank’s loan was made
directly to ICETEX created a strong incentive: (i) to manage seriously the repayment and
default risk of student loans; and (ii) to increase and diversify the sources of alternative
funding to increase its sustainability.

Weaknesses:

16.     Incomplete risk assessment: The risk assessment did not anticipate the conditions
that led to a slow disbursement of Bank loan and implementation delays. At preparation
time, the Bank’s team could not have foreseen the severity of the global financial crisis,
which reached its peak in October 2008. The exposure of ICETEX to currency risk with
an arrangement consisting in negotiating the loan in USD and then doing the conversion
to Colombian Pesos (COP) through a series of currency swaps immediately after
disbursements was well described in the PAD.

2.2   Implementation

Factors outside the control of the Government and the implementation agency

17.    Deterioration of economic conditions with the 2008 global financial crisis: The
Project took place in a difficult macroeconomic context. The global financial crisis had
three main consequences: (i) it limited the options for carrying out the underlying SWAP
for the conversion of the loan into COP; (ii) it became more difficult to diversify

                                             4
ICETEX’s funding base through capital markets (the Colombian Capital Markets had not
carried out any securitization for two years 2009-2010); and (iii) in January and February
2009, due to the uncertain economic context there was a surge in delinquency associated
to drop outs.

Factors generally subject to Government control

18.    Difficulties to diversify ICETEX resources: Law 1328, approved in July 2009, set
a more favorable regulatory framework for the issuance of Educational Saving Securities
(TAE), but a report commissioned by ICETEX in 2011 reached the conclusion that TAEs
were not a feasible funding alternative due to a lack of market demand. Instead, ICETEX
chose to make strategic alianzas with municipalities and local government to finance
students.

19.     Low quality (lack of accreditation) of HEIs being attended by ACCES
beneficiaries: Only 28 HEIs are accredited of the 159 HEIs participating in the ICETEX
student loan program. The MEN did not have enough resources to provide the incentives
that could have put non-accredited HEIs on the path to accreditation. In 2009, ICETEX
increased the weight given to accreditation and academic results in the ACCES algorithm
from 7% to 12% and from 62% to 75%, respectively, in order to weed out low
performing and poor quality HEIs from the assignment of new loans. However, this had
limited incidence on quality improvement among non-accredited HEIs. As a result,
beneficiaries attending high quality accredited HEIs or academic programs account for
28% of new ACCES beneficiaries (2013), slightly up from 25% in 2011 when data
started to be monitored.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

20.     Surge in the delinquency and default rates associated with dropouts: Since 2009,
to combat drop out and delinquency, ICETEX implemented agreements with HEIs which
included: (i) a plan of affirmative actions to prevent dropout; and (ii) a sustainability fund
to cover the losses derived from dropouts during the school period (ICETEX deducts a
variable percentage of student loans proceeds wired to HEIs to combat default associated
with dropouts).

21.    ICETEX overestimation of its financial needs: ICETEX followed a conservative
policy toward financial leverage until 2012. ICETEX had a surplus in resources in its
2010 budget that was transferred to its 2011 budget, which obviated the need to use loan
resources. The main causes of this surplus were: (i) a slowdown in student demand in
2010 for new loans occasioned by the rising real cost to students due to several
successive years of declining inflation without a corresponding adjustment to the interest
rate on ICETEX loans; and (ii) some improvements in the management of portfolio
leading to an increase in repayments and decrease in defaults.

22.   Change in Government higher education policy: The new GoC in its
“Development Plan 2011-2014” put a greater emphasis on increasing higher education

                                              5
coverage and through the 2011 Law 1450 and 2012 Law 1547 introduced much more
favorable conditions for student financial assistance. As part of this policy shift, ICETEX
introduced the following changes to the ACCES loan terms and conditions starting
January 2011: (i) the reduction of the interest rate for strata 1, 2 and 3 to IPC (Consumer
Price Index or Índice de Precios al Consumidor) (0% real interest rate); (ii) the
cancellation of the mandatory monthly “culture of repayment quota”; (iii) the possibility
of paying off debt through higher repayments at any point in time; (iv) an increase in the
size of the subsidy of COP 630,000 (USD330.4) per semester for living expenses indexed
to inflation and an expansion of coverage to all beneficiaries falling under levels 1 and 2
of SISBEN (version II); (v) the implementation of a 25% write off of the loan principal
for all students falling under levels 1 and 2 of SISBEN (version II) who take a new loan
starting January 2011 and onwards and who successfully completed their degree; and (vi)
the cancellation of the 25% tuition subsidy that was previously allocated to beneficiaries
falling under levels 1 and 2 of SISBEN.

23.     Disbursement: the Project disbursed behind the original schedule from
effectiveness to the third quarter of 2012, with no disbursement from September 2010 to
September 2012. In addition, the options for converting the loan into COP were limited;
as a result, the first and second disbursements were only made on April 2009. A plan to
make disbursements smaller and more frequent, as preferred by ICETEX, was prepared
but never implemented. Additionally, an amendment to the loan agreement was
introduced in May 2011 to allow spot currency conversions.


2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.      The PDO was not correctly formulated and the PDO and the outcome indicators
should have been better aligned with each other. This led to some ambiguity and
difficulties during the supervision and evaluation process. To fully reflect the PDOs,
outcome indicators should have included: (i) the enrollment rates and the graduation rates
for all students and for students whose income is below twice the minimum salary; and
(ii) the increase in the amount and percentage of alternative sources of funding available
to ICETEX, which is an intermediate indicator in the PAD. Conversely, the decrease in
ICETEX administrative costs selected as a PDO indicator could have been an
intermediate indicator. In fact, at preparation stage: (i) the team decided not to include
the graduation rate because the duration of the studies (8 semesters) exceeded the initial 3
years duration of the project; and (ii) the graduation rates of students whose income is
below twice the minimum salary were not available. As such, increase in graduation rates
should not have been part of the PDO.

25.     The outcome and monitoring indicators could have been better defined. The
methodologies to calculate the PDO and monitoring indicators were not included in the
PAD and in the operations manual. There are some minor discrepancies between the
indicators selected in the evaluation and monitoring framework and the ones contained in

                                             6
the operations manual. More precision would have dispelled ambiguities and facilitated
the supervision and evaluation process. 2

26.     At inception, it was not possible to build and select one single indicator of equity
to capture the multiple methodologies used to target the beneficiaries from a vulnerable
background. ICETEX used strata 3 to allocate loans, the GoC used SISBEN to target
subsidies for vulnerable families, and the MEN used family income when students took
their exams (SABER11) to access tertiary education. In these circumstances, various
indicators have been used and not all the relationships between them were stated clearly
in the PAD to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of equity issues. 4At preparation
stage, a clear comparison of these methodologies and their relation to the socio economic
conditions of student families was not available. The comparison in the 2012 “Tertiary




2
  For instance, since the definition of the indicators was not included in the PAD, a confusion was created
at the 10/20/2010 restructuring: the percentage of students enrolling in the first year of tertiary education
whose income is below twice the minimum salary was reported and monitored instead of the percentage of
students enrolled in tertiary education whose income is below twice the minimum salary.

3
  Socioeconomic strata or estratos socioeconómicos, based mainly on the location of the families, were
originally created to distinguish which households would get subsidized access to public services and
utilities. There are six strata (1-6, from poorest to richest), of which the first 3 receive a subsidy. However,
this system has been shown to be overly inclusionary, so that 90% of the population lives in areas classified
as strata 1-3.

4
 The relationship is particularly difficult between the intermediate indicator to monitor loan renewals, the
“students from strata 1 and 2” to measure the number of ACCES loans, and the students in quintile 1 and 2
considered in the PDO indicator to measure the net enrollment rate.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Implementation

27.     ICETEX closely monitored and evaluated the progress of activities carried out
under the Project. ICETEX responded to the Bank’s demand for specific data, prepared
thorough semi-annual reports and adapted its content and timing to the needs of the Bank.
Substantial efforts were also made by ICETEX: (i) to make an in-depth monitoring of
repayment trends and to identify and reach students in default to improve the quality of
its portfolio; (ii) to monitor the main indicators at HEI level and the implementation of
affirmative action plans; and (iii) to conduct all the studies initially planned to improve its

Note: Shares are calculated for population aged 17 to 21; this explains why equalized income quintiles are
not each equal to 20% of the total population. Note that each measure is independent; therefore, for
instance, households in estrato 1 are not all in equalized income quintiles 1 and 2. Although minimum
wage intervals and equalized income quintiles both use income as the underlying variable, note that the
former uses total household income and the latter uses income per capita, adjusted for household size and
composition.

management and additional studies related with the Sustainability Fund, the perception of
beneficiaries and the dropout and risk analysis to understand the causes affecting
ICETEX middle and long term sustainability.

28.     With the 10/20/2010 restructuring, all but four targets were made more ambitious
to reflect the extended implementation schedule and a larger resource envelope than
originally anticipated. The other four targets were revised to reflect the impact of the
financial crisis, and a more realistic assessment of the operating environment and costs.
Finally, PDO-level/impact indicators and intermediate results/implementation indicators
were modified.

Use of Monitoring and evaluation data

29.     ICETEX efficiently used the monitoring and evaluation framework to redefine its
relationship with HEIs and improve its portfolio; the reduction of dropouts among loan
beneficiaries and the improvement of the graduation of students particularly from
families of low socio economic status have been at the center of the contracts made with
HEIs. In addition, by linking HEI contributions to the Sustainability Fund to the dropout
rates of students, ICETEX created an incentive for academic achievement improvement.
Unfortunately, the planned impact evaluation was not concluded timely and therefore
could to provide inputs for this ICR.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

30.     Indigenous peoples: As planned in the PAD, ICETEX has included ethnicity in
the application form for student loans since 2008. Since 2010 ICETEX has gone beyond
this commitment and implemented a new policy to provide a 50% subsidy to students of
indigenous descent. From 2008- 2013, the Alvaro Ulcue Fund for Indigenous Peoples
and the Scholarship-loan Program for Afro-Colombians complemented ACCES resources
with COP 41.17 billion and COP 59.87billion, respectively. In addition, (i) the
participation of indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians show a positive trend: in 2013
they represented 9.8% of the total number of ACCES loans while in 2008 they
represented only 2.7%; and (ii) 18,828 indigenous students and 15,731 Afro-Colombians
benefited from loans and grants.

31.      FM arrangements were appropriate. A thorough FM assessment was well
documented in the PAD, and FM risks were properly identified. ICETEX complied with
all its contractual fiduciary obligations. Only the 2009 audit was qualified because an
internal control issue was detected. Difficulties with the reconciliation of accounts
became more acute when ICETEX decentralized the management of student loans to
HEIs in 2009. ICETEX implemented the 9 key corrective actions (of which 8 were
related to reconciliations) recommended in the 2010 audit improvement plan with a
moderate delay. The 2011 and 2012 audit reports were unqualified and no internal control
deficiencies were identified. ICETEX financial control improved following up on the
recommendations from the auditors.



                                           9
32.    Procurement: Procurement arrangements were appropriate. Since component 1 is
procurement free and component 2 had been executed with fiscal and ICETEX resources
there was no procurement financed by the Loan.

33.    Covenants: all covenants stipulated in the loan agreement were met.

2.5   Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.      A Third Student Loan Support Project SOP Phase II is under preparation to
pursue the expansion of access to tertiary education through ICETEX student loans. The
objective of the Project to increase student enrollment, graduation and equity in higher
education, by: (a) increasing the number of ACCES Student Loans and the ACCES
Program’s focus on students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds and in
quality higher education institutions and programs; and (b) enhancing the ICETEX’s
institutional capacity.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objective: High

35.     Increasing coverage, graduation and equity in tertiary education mainly through
private services, catalyzed by expanded student aid and loan programs remains the
priority of the MEN’s National Decennial Education Plan 2006-2016 (PNDE, Plan
Nacional Decenal de Educación). Likewise, Project objectives are fully aligned with
outcome 2 - Increase in tertiary education enrollment of students from poor households-
of the activity “Improve opportunities in education” under the strategic theme
“Expanding opportunities for social prosperity” in the current Country Partnership
Strategy for Colombia for FY12-16, approved on June 12, 2011.

Relevance of Design: High

36.     The expansion of targeted student loans remains a suitable global practice to
increase coverage, graduation and equity in tertiary education. The GoC continues to be
fully aligned with this strategy: while GoC expenditure on higher education has increased
from 0.86% of GDP in 2007 to 0.98% in 2011, the share of national transfers to HEIs in
the budget has declined over the past decade from 82.6% in 2000 to 54.9% in 2011. On
the other hand, Government funds allocated to ICETEX rose from 7.4% of the total
public expenditure on higher education in 2000 to 20.1% in 2011.The ICETEX approach
is to expand ACCES student loan coverage through collaboration with HEIs, while
increasing support and services for low income students, encouraging graduation and
fostering a culture of repayment among students. The GoC will pursue this policy, as it
plans to provide 240,000 ACCES loans from 2013 to 2018, of which at least 70,000 will
benefit students from vulnerable backgrounds, as defined by the SISBEN III
methodology.

                                           10
Relevance of Implementation: High

37.     The restructuring of the Project helped maintain the relevance of the Project by
adapting it to the context of the financial crisis. ICETEX was able to diversify its funding
through alianzas with municipalities, universities and departments rather than private
sector financing.

cohort based methodology. The cohort based methodology consists in calculating the percentage of
students who graduate with a tertiary education degree within the typical duration of the studies.

  The gross graduation rate is the number of graduates in a given year divided by the population in the
typical graduation age group for the specified level. The typical age refers to the age of the students at the
beginning of the school year; students will generally be one year older than the age indicated when they
graduate at the end of the school year. For undergraduate study in Columbia the typical age will be 22.

tertiary education, exceeding the targets established for the Project before and after the
restructuring. Enrollment in tertiary education increased from 1,306,520 in 2008 to
1,841,264 in 2012; enrollment rate went from 31.7% to 42.4% during the same
period.This corresponds to the targets established in the National Education Plan.

(ii)   Improve coverage by increasing the graduation rate of students in tertiary
education. The outcome is substantial

The number of graduates increased from 146,810 in 2008 to 241,049 in 2012. From 2008
to 2012, the graduation rate for all students enrolled in tertiary education increased from
19.4% to 33.8%.While the graduation rate of students with ACCES loans improved
dramatically from 29.2% to 50%. This difference is consistent with: (i) the dropout rate in
tertiary education in Colombia remains very high; (ii) academic merit is the main factor
in the selection process of ACCES beneficiaries; (iii) ICETEX signed contracts with
HEIs to substantially reduce dropouts among loan recipients and HEIs implemented
Affirmative Action Plans required by these contracts; and (iv) students who took a loan
tended to be more committed to finishing their studies. These results confirm that the
contracts between ICETEX and HEIs, which include the implementation by the HEIs of
plans to lower dropouts and a more careful monitoring of students with ACCES loans,
can be an effective way to reduce dropouts and improve graduation.

(iii) Improve equity by increasing enrollment of tertiary education students from
economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The outcome is substantial

39.     Through the targeting of strata 1 and 2, ICETEX contributed to the expansion of
student loans to students whose family income is below twice the minimum salary (from
39.3% of total students enrolled with ACCES support in 2006 up to 49.5% in 2012).
Enrollment in tertiary education of students whose family income is below twice the
minimum salary increased from 239,216 in 2008 to 301,645 in 2012 while their
proportion of total first year enrollment went from 45.6% to 58.1% respectively,
exceeding the target established after the first restructuring. In terms of geographical
distribution ICETEX ensured a better coverage of the poorest areas by distributing
resources among departments according to the share of secondary education graduates.

(iv)   Improve equity by increasing the graduation rate of tertiary education students
from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The outcome is substantial

40.     The graduation rate of students whose family income is below twice the minimum
salary increased slightly from 20.9% in 2008 to 21.6% in 2013, while the graduation rate
of those who benefited from an ACCES loan increased substantially from 11.8% to
39.4% in the same period. The agreements between ICETEX with HEIs contributed
significantly through Affirmative Action Plan to reduce drop outs, increasing graduation
and fostering a culture of loan renewal and repayment among students.

(v)     Increase and diversify the sources of alternative funding available to ICETEX in
order to increase ICETEX sustainability. The outcome is modest

                                            13
41.     ICETEX pursued a very pro-active policy to increase its sustainability by: (i)
establishing the Sustainability Fund in 2009, through contracts with HEIs; (ii) leveraging
funds through alianzas with 89 local government, districts, departments and
municipalities; (iii) exploring the possibility to tap into the private capital market by
issuing TAEs and other options (bonds, securitization) on the private equity market,
although the results were not successful; (iv) managing about 300 targeted funds and
donations. However, the total amount of funds rose through alianzas amounts to just
1.3% of ICETEX resources.

42.     According to the definition of sustainability included in the PAD, the assessment
of the outcome is also based on the following: (i) ICETEX was successful in
demonstrating that it could operate in a more sustainable manner by reducing its
administrative costs, since the cost for administering the student loans program should
normally be covered by the interest rate paid by students; (ii) ICETEX was successful in
reducing the proportion of the portfolio at risk over 30 days from 19% to 17.4%; (iii)
ICETEX was less successful in minimizing its dependence on GoC subsidies considering
that GoC transfers tripled since 2008; and (iv) it is not possible to reach a conclusion on
the ability of borrowers to meet loan repayment installments under variable economic
conditions (third dimension of sustainability considered in the PAD), since no new
sensitivity analysis has been done.

43.     ICETEX achieved all the activities and sector works dedicated to the
improvement of portfolio management and collection processes, financial management
and evaluation and monitoring management. These activities contributed substantially to
the reduction of the administrative costs and the portfolio at risk. 9

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

44.     The cost-benefit analysis performed for the appraisal (2007) 10 provided a sound
basis to estimate the economic results of the operation. Based on the same assumptions
used in 2007, the economic analysis was carried out for the ICR using actual data for the
different variables (Annex 3). The results, measured as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR),
were calculated for the perspective of three distinct agents, namely: (i) the Colombian
economy as a whole or the “Project”, (ii) the Government of Colombia (GoC) and; (iii)
the average ICETEX student loan recipient. A summary is as follows: (i) Colombian


9
    A list of these activities and sector works are detailed in annex 2 Outputs by component.

10
  The 2007 calculations were adjusted since there were some technical errors. Thus, the values shown for
2007 are based on the revised assumptions made during appraisal. Therefore, the IRRs for 2007 differ from
the IRRs mentioned in the PAD as follows: (i) Economy as a whole: 10.9 % adjusted (14.9% PAD); (ii)
State: 12.2 % adjusted (15.3% PAD); (iii) Student: 28.5%, no changes.


                                                       14
economy: The IRR derived is 19.67 percent, comparing to 10.7 percent in 2007: the
actual result is higher due to the actual higher number of graduates vis a vis the estimated
value at appraisal; (ii) Colombian Government: The IRR derived is 12.2 percent,
comparing to 14.1 percent in 2007: the return decreased mainly due the higher default
rate (30 percent vis a vis 20 percent at appraisal) ; (iii) Private benefits: The IRR derived
is 29.2 percent for the 2008-2010 period and 35.1 percent for 2011-2013, comparing to
28.5 percent at appraisal. The individual returns increased for the period 2008-2010 due
to higher salaries and increases in the tuition subsidies, and for the period 2011-2013 due
to subsidies for living costs, partial debt cancellation and reduction of real interest rate to
0%.

45.     ICETEX made high efficiency gains by reducing its administrative costs
substantially from 6.1% in 2006 to 2.6% in 2013. This is the result of several managerial
decisions: (i) to decentralize to HEIs the management and monitoring of student loan
disbursements; (ii) to computerize and simplify administrative processes; (iii) to improve
information systems; (iv) to develop a very comprehensive interactive web site to provide
information to students; and (iv) to maintain the permanent staff levels at 200 individuals,
while the volume of transactions of student loans was multiplied by 6.

3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

46.     The relevance of the objectives, design and implementation at the date of
evaluation are high. The outcomes of the Project are substantial in terms of improving
tertiary education coverage, and graduation rates including those whose family income is
below twice the minimum salary. The outcome is modest in terms of diversifying the
sources of alternative funding available to ICETEX. The efficiency rating is Substantial.
The combination of these ratings yields an overall satisfactory.

3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

47.    Of the 187,610 ACCES student loan recipients, 83% come from strata 1 and 2 and
34% from stratum 1. Therefore, the Project was able to target the students from lower
socio-economic backgrounds. This will certainly lead to a positive long term
intergenerational impact on poverty reduction. However, the results of the impact
evaluation and the graduate long term tracking survey of graduates would demonstrate
more accurately how ACCES graduates progress after-graduation, including evaluating
income differences related to socioeconomic origin.


48.     There is no specific gender issue of tertiary education coverage and no indicator
was considered in the PAD. Girls represent 56% of the portfolio of ACCES loans, and
they represent 52.5% of total tertiary education enrollment.
                                              15
Institutional change/strengthening

49.    In addition to the continuous expansion of student loans, the main institutional
change was to decentralize part of the processes to the HEIs through contracts.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

50.    None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

51.    The risks that the outcomes achieved under the Project might not be sustained are
moderate. ICETEX is strongly backed by the GoC and HEIs, responds to a strong
demand for student loans, and has robust and efficient processes. However, student loans
policy has faced some resistance from some students groups demanding for free public
education, grants and/or lower interest rate. There are still considerable gains that can be
achieved with student loans in terms of coverage, graduation, and equity in tertiary
education. The main limitation is its funding base, which is still highly dependent on
public resources and is insufficient to satisfy the demand. If the gap between student
demand and ICETEX lending capacity widens, there is a risk of expansion of students
support to protests against loan policy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

52.     The Project benefited from a simple design, capitalized on the lessons learned
from the preceding operation and incorporated state of the art international experiences.
The collaboration between the GoC, ICETEX and the Bank was exemplary, and the
Project was prepared swiftly. The Bank agreed: (i) to financial conditions that responded
to the needs of the GoC and ICETEX; and (ii) to implement the Project through ICETEX
and to dissolve the PIU. The Bank’s performance had some minor shortcomings: (i) the
choice and definitions of key performance indicators (KPIs) could have been more
clearly aligned with the Project PDO and target population; (ii) the target population
could have been more precisely defined and only one definition could have been chosen
for the results framework;; and (iii) the expectations of expanding the funding base
through the private capital market were too high/unrealistic.



                                            16
Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

53.     Project supervision was satisfactory, benefiting from strong support from the
Colombia country office. The Bank carried out a minimum of two field missions per year
and provided additional technical assistance, particularly in the area of financial
management. Aide memoirs and Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) provided detailed
accounts of progress as it was being made. Close collaboration between ICETEX and the
Bank helped to address several challenges such as: (i) the reduction of the administrative
and financial costs; (ii) the emission of TAEs; (iii) hedging options to limit the exposure
to exchange risks; and (iii) delinquency and default associated to dropout issues. The
Bank worked closely with the GoC and ICETEX and provided the flexibility needed to
achieve the successful implementation of Project activities, including processing three
restructurings. Bank supervision had one minor shortcoming: the restructuring could have
made a more profound revision of outcome indicators to align them with the PDO. Since
the objectives of the Project were nonetheless clear all along, the Bank took the right
decision not to change the PDO even though it did not follow best practices in its
formulation.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

54.     Overall Bank performance is considered satisfactory since quality at entry and
quality of supervision are satisfactory.

5.2   Borrower Performance

Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

55.     Student loans remain at the core of GoC policy to increase coverage of higher
education and the Project and ICETEX benefited from a continuous support from the
MEN and MoF. The loan penetration rate increased from 13% of total tertiary education
enrollment subject to ICETEX loans in 2006 to 20% in 2013. The government that came
into power in August 2010 increased its commitment to this policy by taking several
steps: (i) Law 1450 approved by the Congress in 2011 and Law 1547 in 2012 liberalized
the policy toward student loans and boosted demand; and (ii) GoC transfers to ICETEX
tripled from 2010 to 2013.


Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

                                            17
56.     ICETEX exhibited strong ownership of the Project and its preparation. ICETEX is
staffed with highly qualified professionals and demonstrated its experience, maturity and
effectiveness in the assignment and disbursement of student loans. ICETEX was reactive
to the necessity of improving the management of the student loan portfolio and reducing
the portfolio at risk even in the context of the economic downturn. In particular ICETEX
was very dynamic in engaging in collaborative actions with HEIs to address the issue of
dropouts among student loan recipients, which is the main source of repayment
delinquency and default. ICETEX introduced new eligibility criteria and numerous
innovations in the financial conditions of ACCES loans. ICETEX and the Bank worked
in a very collaborative way and ICETEX was always very responsive to
recommendations during supervision. When the management of student loans was
decentralized to HEIs and the issue of reconciliation of accounts arose, ICETEX
implemented the necessary measures to strengthen its financial management.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

57.    Overall, the Borrower’s performance is deemed satisfactory given the satisfactory
performance of both Government and the implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

   a) Lessons of wide general application

58.     PDO and indicators. The PDO should be expressed in a way that the objectives
are expressed upfront, followed by Project results which are expected to contribute to
their achievement. Including PDO indicators in the PDO as a means of achieving Project
objectives should be avoided to prevent confusion and clarify aims. PDO indicators
should measure progress toward achievement of objectives for the target population, and
should be defined in the Results Matrix. When appropriate, it is better to use indicators in
absolute numbers rather than rates or percentages which are more difficult to monitor if
they depend on census data which is beyond the scope of the Project (i.e. number of
students enrolled in tertiary education rather than enrollment rate or number of graduates
rather than graduation rates).

59.    Implementation Arrangements. A transfer of responsibility in 2011 for
implementing the Second Student Loan Support Project Phase I from a PIU (Project
Implementation Unit) to ICETEX improved efficiency and continuity. The absorption of
all PIU staff into ICETEX’s operational and financial units increased ICETEX’s
commitment to that project and its sustainability.

60.    Financial Terms. The financial terms of the Bank loan under the Project were
developed in close collaboration between the Bank and ICETEX were important to
reduce ICETEX’s financial risk:(i) an extended repayment period of 22.5 years, including
a 6 year grace period, reduced cash flow risk, (ii) loan maturity tied to the timing of Bank

                                            18
disbursements rather than commitments helped ICETEX further manage its cash flow
risk; and (iii) conversion to COP (Colombian Pesos) at the time of disbursement
minimized exchange rate risk.

   b) Project specific lessons

61.     Agreements with HEIs. The agreements with HEIs and more specifically the
implementation of affirmative actions to reduce dropout rates have proved to be effective
and should be pursued and monitored carefully. The 2012 intermediate evaluation of the
Sustainability Fund demonstrated that student loans can be associated with lower dropout
rates in most HEIs. All the HEIs complied with the obligation of having an action plan to
improve graduation rates. The agreements with tertiary institutions and more specifically
the implementation of action plans should be encouraged and carefully monitored in
order to ensure further improvement of graduation rates. Such monitoring could
eventually be done through score cards. This collaboration between ICETEX and the
HEIs has permitted the introduction of a more result oriented culture

62.     Collaboration with MEN. The collaboration between the MEN and ICETEX is
critical to ensure that a plan including the implementation of quality standards and
incentives be in place to increase the number of accredited HEIs. The MEN should
engage in complementary actions to the Project and coordinate with ICETEX to improve
quality in tertiary education. The Phase II PDO and project design can remain similar and
focus on student loan management and ICETEX efficiency if the MEN is committed to
engage in these complementary actions on quality.

63.     Funds Diversification. Leveraging ICETEX resources with funds from other
sources, including municipalities, universities, and/or departments, through alianzas and
through the Sustainability Funds has been more successful than raising financing from
the private market. Despite ICETEX’s repeated efforts and its good credit rating, the
expansion of the funding base through private capital markets has not been as successful.
ICETEX has securitized parts of its portfolio through TAEs in the past but government
regulation and market conditions have so far prevented bond issuances from being large
enough to raise funds inexpensively and efficiently.

64.    Allocation Formula. It is possible, through incremental changes to the formula
used to allocate student loans, to reconcile the different methodologies used to target
students from low income families to improve the targeting and make it compatible with
the reduction of risks. Further improvements to the formula could still be done to
improve the targeting while reducing the risks. This formula could avoid further
competition between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

new students from
strata 1 &2

1.      The ACCES loans has enabled about 187,610 new students to access tertiary
education of which 156,170 come from strata 1 and 2. (49% of the beneficiaries are from
strata 2 and 34% from strata 1). This outcome far exceeds the targets set up.

2.      ICETEX made several changes to the model and eligibility criteria used to
allocate ACCES loans (i) an increase in the weight of accreditation in 2009 to give more
importance to quality; (ii) the inclusion in 2012 of the eligibility criteria of the contracts
with HEIs; (iii) an increase of the weight of the academic merits; and (iv) the reduction in
2009 of the weight of the socio-economic origin in the eligibility criteria (STRATA was
reduced and SISBEN dropped). The objective of ICETEX was to improve the
relationship between the allocation of ACCES loans and the probability of the
beneficiaries to graduate. These changes slightly affected the targeting; the percentage of
beneficiaries from strata 1 and 2 went down from 84 % in 2010 to 82% in 2013 of the
ACCES loans that were approved during the period. Under ACCES, new student loans
are distributed twice a year based on a formula that first allocates funds by department to



                                             22
cover all of the demand in the apartados 11 , and for the remaining departments
proportional to the number of secondary school graduates. ICETEX then allocates funds
within each non-apartado department based primarily on student merit (weighted 73%)
and to a lesser extent based on accreditation of the program or HEI that the student plans
to attend (12%), the student’s socioeconomic strata 12 (12%) and the existence of an
ICETEX contract with the HEI that the student plans to attend (4%).

Evolution of the targeting of ACCES loans

3.      ICETEX made several changes to the terms and conditions of the loans
which benefit the students: Following the Government 2011 Law 1450 and 2012 Law
1547, the following improvements were made and became effective on January 2011 for
new ACCES loans and loans renewal; (i) the interest rate for borrowers from strata 1, 2
and 3 was reduced to IPC and for borrowers from strata 4,5, and 6 to IPC plus 4% during
their study period, and for their repayment period IPC plus 4% in Technological
Institutes and IPC plus 8% in Universities (prior to 2010 it was 14% and IPC plus 8% for
students from SISBEN 1 and 2 and 16% for all the other students) ; (ii) the forgiveness
of 25% of the outstanding balance of the loans for students of SISBEN 1, 2 who
successfully completed their degree; (iii) the forgiveness of the totality of the debt for
students of SISBEN 1, 2, 3 in the first decile of the SABER PRO; and (iv) an increase in
the size of the subsidy of COP 630,000 per semester (adjusted every year for inflation)
for living expenses and an expansion of coverage to all beneficiaries registered at
SISBEN 1 or 2.

4.      In addition, ICETEX introduced in 2012 (i) a more flexible model for students’
loans repayments with the introduction of an optional amortization system with staggered
repayments (as opposed to fixed premium), as an intermediate step towards income-


11
  9 departments in Colombia are considered zonas apartadas (remote areas) or apartados due to their low
income levels and geographic inaccessibility. They are granted special status for loan allocation purposes.
The following departments are apartados: Amazonas, Arauca, Caquetá, Guainía, Guaviare, Putumayo, San
Andres, Vaupes, Vichada, and more recently Chocó.

12
  Socioeconomic strata or estratos socioeconómicos were originally created to distinguish which
households would get subsidized access to public services and utilities. There are six strata (1-6, from
poorest to richest), of which the first 3 receive a subsidy. However, this system has been shown to be
overly inclusionary, so that 90% of the population lives in areas classified as strata 1-3.


                                                       23
contingent loans; (ii) the suspension for a period of up to 12 months, of a loan’s entry into
the repayment period (or the suspension of the obligation to repay, if the loan is already
in the repayment period) when the borrower is unemployed; (iii) the cancellation for the
mandatory monthly payment ; (iv) the possibility to make repayments toward the loan in
excess of the agreed repayment at any point in time; and (iv) the cancellation of the 25%
subsidy for tuition fee which was previously allocated to beneficiaries with SISBEN
1replaced by the new maintenance subsidy.

5.    These reforms were beneficial to both current and future borrowers by making
ICETEX loans more attractive and the repayment easier. This contributed to increase
demand for ICETEX loans and to improve repayment ratios.

Impact of student loans on completion of study and employment

6.      The impact evaluation should be available in January 2014 and was not available
for this ICR. Student loans have generally a positive impact on completion of study and
employment. The 2008 impact evaluation shows that the dropout rate of students with an
ACCES loan is 9.4% compared to 34.4% for the students without a loan. And the 2010
employment study shows that 77% of the students with an ACCES loan have an
employment compared to 75% for students without a loan.

*First semester 2013

7.     The numbers by year are not fully comparable: (i) in 2008 and 2009 there was a
substantial duplication of applications due to an unrestricted access of HEIs to Credit
Committees; (ii) in 2010 to 2012 the reduction of duplication of applications led to an
increase of the approval rate; and (iii) in 2013 since only the first semester is considered
the demand and approval will certainly exceed 2012.

10.    The fund Alvaro Ulcuè Chocuè was created in 1990 to facilitate the access of
indigenous people to higher education. Since 2008 about 10,227 loans have been
approved for a total amount of 41,171,815,826 pesos. In addition, 8,601 new ACCES
loans have been approved for indigenous population representing about 4.5% of the
187,610 ACCES new beneficiaries during the period 2008-2013 while the indigenous
population represents 3.43% of the total Colombian population. This fund is managed by
ICETEX according to the following: (i) the beneficiary should belong an indigenous
community; (ii) the credit is for undergraduate and graduate studies; (ii) the credit can be
forgiven if the student graduates and does community service in his/her community
during his/her period of study.

11.    The Scholarship- Loan Program for the Afro-Colombian population was created
more than 20 years ago to facilitate the access of the Afro-Colombian population to
higher education. Since 2008, about 11,444 loans have been provided and 1181 debt have
been forgiven for a total amount of 59,868,688,636 pesos. In addition, 4557 ACCES
loans have been approved for Afro-Colombian representing 2.42% of the 187,610
ACCES new beneficiaries during the period 2008-2013 while the Afro-Colombian
population represents 10.62% of the Colombian population. This fund is managed by
ICETEX according to the following parameters: (i) the beneficiary should belong to the
Afro-Colombian community and should belong to a low income family; (ii) the credit is
for undergraduate and graduate studies; (ii) the credit can be forgiven if the student
graduate and do community service in his/her community during its study period.


                                             25
12.     In total, ACCES loans to students from indigenous and afro-Colombian groups
represented 7.01% of the total number of new ACCES loans during the period 2008-2013.
Participation of indigenous and afro-Colombian groups show a positive trend: in 2013,
they represented 9.8% of the total number of ACCES loans while, in 2008, they
represented only 2.7%. Importantly, with the support of the Government, ICETEX went
beyond its commitment and since 2010 has given these students a subsidy of 50% of their
tuition fees.

13.     In addition, the GoC approved a law 1448 in 2011 in favor of the victims of the
conflict. This law compelled educational institutions to adapt their requirements, cost,
and admission criteria to ensure that victims of violence have equal access to higher
education, with a special focus on single mothers, teenagers, and the disabled. It
additionally compelled ICETEX to create separate credit lines and subsidies for victims.
As a result, ICETEX established a separate Fund for Victims of Violence (Fondo de
Reparación para el Acceso, Permanencia y Graduación en Educación Superior para la
Población Víctima del Conflicto Armado), offering loans (eligible for 100% forgiveness),
biannual subsidies for students equal to 1.5 minimum salaries, and a subsidy for HEIs
that adopt differentiated academic and mentoring programs for victims.

1.2.   Form alliances with higher education institutions: Achieved

ICETEX signed 233 contracts with tertiary education institutions in 2010, 14 in
2011 and 12 in 2012. The total of 259 contracts exceeds the target of 206 that was set up.

14.     The content of these contracts represent a substantial improvement
compared to the previous agreements done with HEIs. The main improvements are
the following: (i) the inclusion of a set of affirmative actions to reduce drop outs and a
plan to implement them; (ii) the provision of information every six months about students
with a low economic achievement; and (iii) the contribution of HEIs to a Sustainability
Fund.

15.    Through these contracts, ICETEX encourage institutions to: (i) increase support
and services to low income students; (ii) help students manage education loans; (iii)
foster a culture of repayment among students; (iv) support collection efforts after
graduation, and in some cases; (v) co-finance tuition. ICETEX monitors contracts and the
plans every 6 months but there is not yet a full analysis of the impact of these contracts
on students’ academic achievement.

Component 2: Improving ICETEX management practices: achieved

2.1 Strengthen loan administration, portfolio management and collection
procedures and upgrade data technology hardware & software.

16.    ICETEX financed its Institutional Strengthening component activities exclusively
with its own resources to concentrate financial leverage to support ICETEX’s core
business the origination of student loans.

Activity               Implementation                                     Achievement
2.1 Improvement        The following activities took place:               achieved
of portfolio           - The partnership contract with the credit bureau
management and         allowed ICETEX to be permanently informed on
collection processes   the (i) credit check processes; (ii) borrower
                       localization actions; and (iii) repayment
                       behavior. As outcomes, the risk profile of the co-
                       debtors and collection improved.
                       - With regard to the data migration of the new
                       portfolio management system for ACCES loans,
                       the following is completed: (i) the migration of
                       COBOL to C&CTEX in 2008; (ii) the
                       implementation of the software design project
                       since 2008 onwards.
                       - The Business Impact Analysis realized in 2010
                       leaded to the implementation of a Business
                       continuity plan which is permanently updated.
                       - Development of six software for (i)

                                          27
                 information security; (ii)     business process
                 management; (iii) quality; (iv) risks; (v)
                 customer relationship        management;     (vi)
                 documents and files management. The software
                 related for TAE management was cancelled and
                 the software for collection management was
                 studied but not implemented.
                 - The information technology upgrade consisted
                 of: (i) the data warehouse licensing (2008); (ii)
                 the upgrade of the WAN server (; (iii) remote
                 control management (procurement of 450
                 licenses) of computers; (iv) computer renewal
                 (100% of ICETEX computers have been
                 upgraded to windows 7 and office in 2010); and
                 (v) renewal of the UPS system for power safety
                 in ICETEX headquarters and its 23 regional
                 branches (procurement in 2010 and 2011).
                 (v) to ensure data confidentiality ICETEX took
                 significant steps in 2011-2012 to re-engineer
                 security processes like encryption and actions
                 against hacking .

2.2 Prepare to expand funding base to ensure long-term sustainability: Partially
Achieved

17.     From 2008 to 2013, ICETEX more than doubled its funding base from 545, 097
million COP to 1,181,230 million COP. However, these resources are still insufficient to
address current demand for student financing (only 46% of student loans are approved).
The main source of external funding is the government subsidies which increased its
share from 24.16% in 2008 to 35.22% in 2013 of ICETEX total resources. The increase
of Government participation is the consequence of the implementation of the 2011 Law
1450 and 2012 Law 1547. ICETEX own resources are growing slowly and steadily to
represent 48.33% of total resources.

18.     ICETEX explored the possibility to tap into the private capital market by issuing
Educational Savings Certificates (TAE) on the private equity market. This would be
feasible with the credit rating AAA received by Fitch in 2011, its increased financial
transparency and better collection performance. A consultancy firm has been hired to
carry out a study on alternatives for balancing the financial mix of the institution. But the
2011 study was not conclusive: (i) the potential of investors interested in the Bogota
Stock Exchange would have been very small and that only about 19,500 million pesos
could have been raised; and (ii) the cost would have been too high.

19.    ICETEX started diversifying it resources in 2009 through strategic alliances with
89 local government, districts, departments and municipalities. The four main
contributors “Gobernación de Cundinamarca Plan Primavera, Gobernación de
Cundinamarca Opción de Vida, Distrito de Cartagena, Departamento de la Guajira”
represent more tan 50%. Despite the number of strategic alliances, the amounts in 2013
COP 15,196,760,219 remains modest and represents only 1.28% of ICETEX funding.
Nevertheless, from 2009 to 2013 the strategic alliances financed about 23000 students.

20.     In addition, ICETEX diversified its resources through contracts with HEIs and the
establishment of a Sustainability Fund as an independent trustee in December 2009. The
contribution of each HEI to the Sustainability Fund is based upon its dropout rate. The
dropout rates serve to establish an indicator of risk for each HEI.14 ICETEX matches the

14
  The indicator of risk is the number of student drop out who default divided by the number of
beneficiaries of student loans. The value of this indicator was 7.9% in 2011.

                                                                29
contribution of the HEI on a 1-for- 1 basis. The dropout rates on average in HEIs was
7.9% in 2011 and 6.6% in 2012. ICETEX Board decided to use 6% on average to define
the respective contribution of ICETEX and HEIs to the Sustainability Fund. A new
evaluation of the dropout rates will be done before the end of 2013 to define the future
contributions of HEIs to the Sustainability Fund.

undergraduate level. This represents 7.59% of total resources, slightly above the target of
7.5% set up after restructuring and below the target of 9 % set up initially. 2010 was a
year to estimate the resources for the Sustainability Fund, the rules for the respective
contributions of ICETEX and HEIs were only effective in 2011. The resources of the
Sustainability Fund accounted in 2012 represent the total of 2011 and 2012.

2.3Project monitoring & impact evaluation: Achieved

23.     Planned monitoring has been undertaken regularly, using the implementation
indicators agreed upon with ICETEX. Specifically, these indicators were measured and
reported by ICETEX every six months and progress was assessed by comparing the
actual performance of the indicators against predefined targets, as described in the PAD.

24.    In the October 20, 2010 restructuring it was agreed to revised all but four targets
and to revise two indicators (Increase in the percentage of students enrolled in tertiary
education whose income is below twice the minimum salary and Percentage of total
resources available for student credit generated for new external sources (other than
ACCES credit, government/public funding for tuition or interest rate subsidies or equity
resources).

25.    In addition ICETEX developed several new indicators and in particular:

       •   To monitor dropouts, credits’ defaults and the main causes of decline of the
           portfolio quality under the guidelines discussed with HEIs
       •   To monitor non-performing loans

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Cost-Benefit Analysis: The cost-benefit analysis performed in 2007 for the
appraisal (CBA 2007) 16provided a sound basis to estimate the economic results of this
operation. The methodological approach used was the standard, comparing whether the
Project’s benefits, namely higher wages and probability of employment for graduates,
positive spillovers for society, and higher tax revenue for the state, outweigh the
opportunity cost (forfeited wages, tuition and loan interest, living costs, amongst others).
The results, measured as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), were calculated for the
perspective of three distinct agents, namely: (i) the Colombian economy as a whole or the
“Project”, (ii) the Government of Colombia (GoC) and; (iii) the average ICETEX student
loan recipient.

2.     Based on the same assumptions used in CBA 2007, ICETEX was carried out the
economic analysis for the ICR using actual data for the different variables for the period
2008-2013. The results are summarized as follows: (i) Colombian economy: The IRR
derived is 19.67 percent, comparing to 10.7 percent in 2007: the actual result is higher
due to the actual higher number of graduates vis a vis the estimated value at appraisal; (ii)
Colombian Government: The IRR derived is 12.2 percent, comparing to 14.1 percent in
2007: the return decreased mainly due the higher default rate (30 percent vis a vis 20
percent at appraisal) ; (iii) Private benefits: The IRR derived is 29.2 percent for the 2008-
2010 period and 35.1 percent for 2011-2013, comparing to 28.5 percent at appraisal. The
individual returns increased for the period 2008-2010 due to higher salaries and increases
in the tuition subsidies, and for the period 2011-2013 due to subsidies for living costs,
partial debt cancellation and reduction of real interest rate to 0%.

Summary

Cost-benefit for the economy as a whole

3. This calculation attempts to capture the overall cost-benefit of the Project for
Colombian society as a whole. It includes four components: i) salary increases for
ACCES student loan graduates derived from the additional years of education, ii) private
cost (for individuals) of attending an HEI, iii) the cost of the program for HEIs, and iv)
administrative costs for ICETEX. The IRR derived from this cost benefit analysis from

   The CBA 2008 calculations were adjusted since there were some technical errors. Thus, the values
shown for 2007 are based on the revised assumptions made during appraisal. Therefore, the IRRs for 2007
differ from the IRRs mentioned in the PAD as follows: (i) Economy as a whole: 10.7 % adjusted (14.9%
PAD); (ii) State: 12.2 % adjusted (15.3% PAD); (iii) Student: 28.5%, no changes.

1.88. The net present value is found to be COP 3.59 million.

4.      A number of assumptions were made when evaluating the NPV of the Project: (i)
the discount rate for future income and spending is set to 10%, as used in the previous
analysis; (ii) the unemployment rate is assumed to be 9.7%. This is the result of
averaging the unemployment rate for higher education graduates reported by DANE from
2008 to September of 2013. For the previous analysis, this rate was 11.5%; (iii) the
counterfactual scenario for students is assumed to be the following: 70% of ACCES new
student loan recipients would not have managed to find alternative funding to pursue
their studies, and 40% of those who already have ACCES student loans (and are due to
renew them) would not have found alternative funding either (remains unchanged from
the previous analysis); (iv) the salary of graduates were estimated based on OLE survey
data up to 2007 and then on OLE PILA data thereafter, and are shown in Table 1). The
effects of graduating with a higher education degree are estimated based on the Mincer
methodology as used by Núñez and Sánchez (2000), who concluded that the return to
each year of higher education is around 22%. For graduates from levels one or two of
SISBEN, the returns were estimated based on OLE data; (vii) the career length of the
average graduate is assumed to last from graduation (aged 22, thus having entered an HEI

at age 18) to retirement (aged 60); (viii) the dropout rates used are shown in Table 3, and
are lower than forecast in the 2007 analysis.

5.     Additionally, the figures for total investment and loan placement were drawn
from ICETEX administrative data, and are shown in Table 2. The Project involved a total
investment of 1.03 billion dollars from 2008 to 2013, of which 300 million were provided
by the Bank. ICETEX was able to place more than 205,000 new loans and to renew
almost 892,000.

higher education graduates and total years of education gained are higher than forecast in
the 2007 evaluation (by 9,274 and 41,942, respectively), as shown below.

 education gained.

7.      The private cost for individuals was assumed to be COP 500,000 per semester,
based on ICETEX estimates using administrative data for its graduates for the previous
exercise and corroborated by the DANE Living Standards Survey (2003) where it was
stated that the maintenance stipend of a higher education student was, in average, COP
434,670 (USD 260 with the average FX rate). The cost for HEIs was calculated using
data from the 2007 HEI Financial Sustainability Report (Estudio de Sostenibilidad
Financiera de Instituciones de Educación Superior), prepared by Econometría for MEN.
The weighted average per student and semester is equal to COP 2,500,000 (USD 1,301 at
the average FX rate). Administrative costs were calculated using ICETEX administrative
data.

Cost-benefits for the state

8.     Three types of income were included in the calculation: (i) Bank loans, (ii)
ICETEX loan repayments (under the assumption that collection parameters remain the
same), and (iii) higher tax revenue, extra revenue due to decreased informality, and
increased social security contributions. The cost component of the analysis included: (i)
Bank loan repayment, (ii) new and renewed loan disbursements, (iii) cost for public HEIs
of supplying education, and (iv)ICETEX administrative costs. The IRR derived from this

ratio of 1.13. The net present value is COP 247,366.

9.       The assumptions are the same as for the previous evaluation, despite the fact that,
according to OLE, informality amongst college graduates is well below 30% (13% in
2007, based on 2006 graduates). Additionally, repayment rates were assumed to be 80%
of the total value of the loans, whereas for the additional income from taxes and
contributions, the following figures were taken: a 12% average income tax, a tax evasion
rate of 30%, and an 8% average social security contribution. The maturity of the loan was
assumed to be 20 years, as in the original analysis. New and renewed loan disbursements
are based on ICETEX loan growth projections for the next 30 years. Based on historical
data, it was assumed that about 5% of student loan recipients would pursue their degrees
in public universities. As previously mentioned, the cost per semester per student is
assumed to be COP 2.5 million.

Cost-benefits for the average student loan recipient

10.    NPVs and IRRs for the average student loan recipient were calculated in two
separate groups due to the changes introduced to loan requirements and regulations
during 2010. Loan interest rates and requirements to apply for subsidies changed. Interest
rates were set to inflation (as measured by the CPI) for more than 96% of ACCES student

                                                                                   37
loan recipients (those in strata 1, 2, and 3). Similarly, living stipends and more generous
loan forgiveness programs were also introduced (conditional on graduation). The benefits
to the student are: (i) the cash inflow derived from student loans and direct subsidies, and
(ii) the increased wages, perceived as a result of the additional years of education
received due to the student loan. On the cost side, the analysis included the present values
of (i) the repayment of the student loan, (ii) tuition, (iii) living costs, and finally
(iv)higher taxes and social security contributions due to increased salaries.

11.     The IRR derived from this cost benefit analysis from the perspective of the credit
recipient was 29.2 percent for the 2008-2010 period, for a benefit/ cost ratio of 1.89. For
2011-2013, the IRR was 35.1 percent and the benefit-cost ratio was 1.93. The net present
value is found to be COP 43.5 million and 46.6 million, respectively.

12.    Average tuition costs were assumed to be COP 3,086,984 per semester per student
during the 2008-2010 period and COP 3,819,092 per semester per student during the
2011-2013 (see table 5 below). Based on these figures, the income derived from ACCES
student loans was assumed to be, on average, COP 1.5 million per semester for tuition (to
be repaid) and COP 771,000 as a living subsidy from 2008 to 2010, based on the same set
of assumptions used in the report prepared by Econometria. From 2011 to 2012, policy
changed the set of assumptions to COP 1.9 million per semester for tuition credit, COP
520,000 per semester for maintenance subsidy, and COP 477,386 per semester for the
25% debt forgiveness upon graduation. The loan and subsidies were assumed to last for
an average of four years (based on the length of the different HEI programs, assuming a
proportion of 70% college and 30% T&T students).

13.    To calculate the loan repayment costs, an interest rate of 13.2% and a total of 96
payments were assumed from 2008 to 2010; these include payments while the student is
studying and the full repayment after the one-year grace period once the student
graduates. From 2011 onwards a 3% yearly interest rate is assumed, with no study period
payments. Social security contributions are assumed to be 4% of the salary increase
associated with graduating from an HEI.

     ICETEX Final Evaluation Report for the Second Student Loan Support Project
                               (ACCES II Phase I)


1.        Project Development Objective and Components

The Project Development Objectives were as follows: i) improving coverage through an
increase of enrollment and graduation in higher education institutions (HEIs), ii)
improving the equity conditions by increasing the coverage and graduation rates of
socioeconomically vulnerable groups, and iii) increase and diversify the alternative
sources of financing of ICETEX to improve sustainability.

The Project had two components: 1) the provision of educational loans to students based
on academic merit and socioeconomic status, 2) the consolidation of management
practices of ICETEX to improve efficiency and sustainability. Component 1 has
contributed to the expansion and equity of the Colombian educational system through the
disbursement of educational loans and the creation and management of alliances
(alianzas), to ensure and strengthen the support for student loan recipients. Component 2
included the improvement of the management and administration systems of ICETEX,
through the strengthening of the information systems and the technological infrastructure
of ICETEX, in order to strengthen the management and monitoring of the portfolio. It
also included the expansion of alternative financing forces and, finally, the impact
evaluation of the Project.

2.        Measuring of Results

During the implementation period, ICETEX achieved the Project Development Objective.
ACCES II has provided loans to 190,000 new students, of which 83% belong to strata 1
and 2, the most vulnerable. ACCES II has also helped financially strengthen ICETEX.
The disbursement calendar of Phase I of ACCES II, including the extensions provided by
the Bank, show that the closing of the loan in June 2013 was necessary due to the
improvement of collection and the creation of alliances with other institutions. As a result
of the efficient use of resources, the objectives for both phases of the Project were
achieved in Phase I (167,000 new student loans in 2013), whereas the original target for
Phase I was 100,000 new loans in 2010.

The student loans were given to a population that did not have an alternate source of
financing for the costs of attending higher education. According to the latest impact
evaluation, carried out by Econometría, 94% of the population polled answered that they
would have had to work to finance their studies, postpone them or give up the possibility
of attending an HEI if they had not had access to an ICETEX student loan.

Additionally, equity conditions have also been improved through increased retention and
graduation rates. Impact assessments have shown that having an ICETEX loan is
associated with a lower dropout: The overall average dropout rate for students who have
received an ACCES loan is 9.4 %, while the figure for non-recipients is 34.4 %.
(ICETEX - CEDE 2008, p. 54). During their first semester, loan recipients attending
public universities have pass rates that are 15 percentage points above those of non-
recipients (the difference is 9 percentage points for private schools). Despite the fact that
this difference fades off as semesters pass, loan recipients graduate one semester before
non-recipients, on average (ICETEX - CEDE 2008, p. 15).

In terms of job performance, 77% of ACCES graduates were contributing to health
insurance and pension schemes at the time of the last assessment of impact (Econometria
2010), compared to 75% of the group of students without student loans. This implies that
ACCES loans have the potential to mitigate the correlation between socioeconomic
background and poorer employment prospects, since a higher proportion of ICETEX loan
recipients come from vulnerable socioeconomic backgrounds.

The situation is similar when comparing the earnings of college graduates. The
Contribution Base Income (IBC) of ICETEX loan recipients (2003-2009) reported in
2008 was COP 1.65 million (3.57 minimum salaries) and for non-recipients it was COP
1.78 million (3.86 minimum salaries (ICETEX - Econometria 2010, p. 22). Two factors
explain this: the higher socioeconomic level of non-recipients and their higher
participation rate in graduate degrees, linked to higher salaries. Graduates from the lowest
socioeconomic stratum earn, on average, COP 1 million, whereas those from the highest
stratum earn COP 2 million, and 90.4% of ACCES loan recipients belong to the three
lowest strata (ICETEX – Econometria 2010, p. 23).

The analysis of the current situation of higher education indicates significant progress in
terms of access, equity and efficiency, as evidenced by the evolution of coverage, and the
impact evaluations previously mentioned. A final evaluation of the impact of the Project
is scheduled for the second half of 2013. The following section will discuss the main
lessons learned in the implementation of Phase I of ACCES II.

than 30 days (a total of COP 339.5 billion). Non-performing ACCES loans add up to
COP 225.2 billion, equivalent to 12.4% of total loans given under this line. For the rest of
the lines, non-performing loans amount to COP 114.3 billion, or 16.1% of the total.

Subcomponent 2.2: Financial sustainability of the Project

Educational Savings Bonds (TAEs)

To evaluate the feasibility of the third issuing of educational savings bonds, the Vice-
presidency for Finance hired an independent firm, Correval, which presented the results
of the study in December 2011, with the following conclusions:

- Although the bonds generate acceptable returns, the decision to issue a third round of
bonds should also take into account commercial aspects, as well as risks: risk of
placement (high), reputational risk (medium-high), cost risk (middle) and interest rate
risk (medium).

- Correval estimated that the market for ICETEX educational savings bonds would
amount to only COP 19.5 billion; for amounts below COP 30billion, fixed costs amount
to a sizable amount of total costs, which is problematic.

Given the low probability of placement as well as the risks associated with it, Correval
found that a third round of educational savings bonds is not the best alternative for
ICETEX financing at this time.


                                                                      52
Securitization of the ICETEX portfolio

To evaluate the feasibility of a securitization of the ICETEX portfolio, the Vice-
presidency for Finance hired an independent firm, Multiactivos, which found that:

- It would only be possible to issue securities up to 65% of the principal balance of the
initial portfolio (under A and B ratings).
- The issuing of senior securities rated AAA is only feasible using an external guarantee
(the Government of Colombia).
- The securities would be sold at a high discount, especially for overdue student loans,
where discounts would reach almost 100%.


Subcomponent 2.3: Management and evaluation of the Project

Risk management models and systems

During the second half of 2012 ICETEX hired a firm to build a new statistical model of
expected loss for the loan portfolio with historical information from ICETEX from 2008
to June 2012. The main limitation of previous models is that they did not consider the
true risk profile of the portfolio, obviating the characteristics of the population and the
loan, and instead relying on models traditionally used in consumer banking.

The main objective of the new model is to estimate portfolio provision based on the
actual behavior of ICETEX loan recipients, using the PROVISION scoring methodology
for the calculation of expected loss. This tool allows for the forecasting of an expected
default rate. The model seeks to evaluate portfolio risk, develop differentiated by student
profile, and ultimately improve the efficiency of provisioning

Financial management

With the funds received from the previous disbursements (the last being June 21) along
with the resources obtained from a successful operational performance, ICETEX
estimates that it will be able to maintain its operations and meet loan targets until the
second half of 2013.

The entirety of the Bank loan ($300 million) has been disbursed and implemented,
following the scheduled completion date of June 30, 2013.

Monitoring and evaluation

The actions agreed upon in the aide memoire of March 2013 have been either carried out
or rescheduled.

3. Lessons Learned

The Role of HEIs

One of the aims of the Project was to create partnerships with HEIs to strengthen the
support received by students and enhance the benefits of student loans by giving HEIs an
active role in terms of accompanying and mentoring the student. Firstly, the use of the
infrastructure of HEIs means easier access to students, thus allowing HEIs to provide
advice on financial support programs, including ICETEX student loans. Additionally,
support and mentoring programs to increase retention, improve academic performance
and graduation can enhance the effects of the student loan.

The Comprehensive Model of Student Support (Modelo de Atención Integral al
Estudiante) was designed precisely to achieve this, and was piloted in 20 HEIs during the
implementation of the Project. This model aims to provide opportunities for students at a
physical, social or economic disadvantage to continue pursuing their degrees and avoid
dropout. At the same time the Model eases the transition of graduating students to the
labor market by helping them find a job that is suited for them. HEIs, territorial
education departments, private companies, NGOs and other state agencies may develop,
at least, three types of actions to help students maximize the benefits of student loans:

   a. Preparation for access: Many students from the lower socioeconomic strata,
      especially those in marginal areas, plan to enter the labor market as soon as they
      finish their compulsory education. This highlights the need for mechanisms to
      smooth the transition between secondary education and higher education,
      including, at least three dimensions: (i) vocational counseling, (ii) improved
      academic results, to allow them to compete for spots in the top schools and (iii)
      financial planning skills and literacy.
   b. Inclusion - targeted access: Intended to generate real opportunities for access to
      higher education for disadvantaged youths in good academic standing but who do
      not have all the skills and financial resources required to enroll in and pursue a
      higher education degree. This requires focusing on the HEIs’ admissions process,
      providing stipends for educational and everyday spending, and strengthening
      students’ core competencies to allow them to adapt to college life and succeed in
      their degrees.
   c. Effectiveness - retention, academic performance and graduation: This dimension
      is intended to facilitate the progress of student loan recipients throughout their
      program, ensuring they graduate while fostering a culture of credit responsibility
      and repayment.

The implementation of the pilot involved working with HEIs in the following areas: (i)
strengthening the institutional capacity of the HEIs’ student loan coordination offices to
improve management practices, (ii) highlighting the importance of seeking additional
financing sources beyond ICETEX, (iii) training HEIs for the implementation of the
comprehensive model of student support (MAIE), and (iv) providing technical assistance,
monitoring, and support.

                                           54
As ICETEX student loans gained relevance for HEIs, the role of these in the financial
management process led to the creation of Student Loan Sustainability Fund (Fondo de
Sostenibilidad del Crédito Educativo, created under Agreement 045, December 2009),
intended to mitigate the large risks for loan sustainability derived from student dropout.
This also led to the creation and renewal of partnerships between ICETEX and the HEIs.
As of the closing of the Project, 255 HEIs have an active agreement with ICETEX.

Tailoring Educational Credit to the Needs of Students

The conditions offered to students at the time of the creation of the ACCES long term
credit line and subsidy have been improved over the years, most recently when Law 1450
of 2011 and Law 1547 of 2012 were passed. These laws raised the level of support
offered to students by including interest rate subsidies, loan forgiveness and stipends for
students from vulnerable backgrounds, in order to avoid the risk of dropping out for
financial reasons and to improve affordability at the time of repayment.

In addition to the interest rate subsidies and living stipends, ICETEX has also
implemented other policies, such as partial loan forgiveness after graduation and scoring
in the top 10% of the SABER PRO test, tiered repayment (where the amount due varies
depending on the income level of the graduate), or suspension of repayment.

Strategic alliances

Considering that one of the strategic objectives of ICETEX is meeting the needs of higher
education funding while prioritizing low-income and high-achieving students, and that
the resources available for new loans are limited, raising funds through strategic alliances
has been key to reaching a larger share of the population.

Strategic alliances provide greater benefits to students, considering that most finance up
to 100 % of tuition and allow students greater flexibility when accessing debt forgiveness
and subsidy schemes. They additionally allow for a more localized targeting of the
vulnerable population and coordination of actors, including improved synergies between
the private sector, the government, and HEIs.

Strategic alliances have financed the studies of approximately 23,000 students,
contributing to increasing access and retention in higher education. In 2008 there were 24
strategic alliances with contributions totaling COP 32.4 billion. As of first half of 2013
there are 106 existing alliances, and their contributions amount to COP 150.7 billion.

Minimizing exposure to financial risk

Paragraph 2.07 of the loan agreement between ICETEX and the Bank allowed for a
currency conversion of the loan at any time, in order to ease debt management. These
conversions were to be made in accordance with the provisions in Article IV of the
General Conditions and Rules for Conversion.

                                            55
In this regard, the World Bank had determined that the effective yearly date of
disbursement conversion were April 15 and October 15 (semiannual interest payment),
the date of interest settlement. This means that from the date of disbursement until the
date of effective conversion, the conversion rate was calculated based on the interest rate
agreed upon in the loan contract (6 months LIBOR + 5 basis points) up to the
aforementioned dates, and, thereafter, interests were settled at the fixed interest rate
negotiated in the conversion.

To diminish the exchange rate risk when repaying the loan, ICETEX requested to have
the option to carry out the conversion as soon as the repayment request was issued. This
change was studied and approved by the Government and the Bank. In March 2011 the
loan contract was amended.

This gave ICETEX greater flexibility, effectively having two options for conversion.

Accounting and financial management of resources

In order to facilitate financial monitoring of the project and establish control mechanisms
to oversee Bank resources, ICETEX designed a tracking system that simplified reporting
to the Bank. Among other things, this system ensured that Bank disbursements were
reflected in the balance sheet and in internal accounting as a separate element. This
monitoring system allowed ICETEX to assess implementation, impact, and results,
thereby providing useful input for decision-making.

Disbursement methods

In accordance with the Bank guidelines on disbursements, the ICETEX agreed on
disbursements in advance, with the possibility of using reimbursements, having
previously informed the Bank. ICETEX chose the latter option, which was undoubtedly
satisfactory, as it eased ICETEX’s cash flow. Student loan disbursements were carried
out with counterpart funds, which were reimbursed afterwards.

Collection Management - Standardization Brigade

In terms of portfolio management, the Normalization Brigade, by rewarding the
collection firm with the best results with a larger contract, promoted competition, thereby
improving practices and efficiency. Strengthening ties with collection firm has also been
useful in terms of gathering information on the repayment performance of loan recipients,
which will be vital when designing new policies to improve portfolio collection.
