                         The development objectives of the proposed program are to (a) improve coverage by increasing the enrollment and graduation rates of students in tertiary education; (b)
                         improve equity by increasing enrollment and graduation rates of tertiary education students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds; and (c) increase and
                         diversify the sources of alternative funding available to ICETEX in order to increase ICETEX's sustainability.

                         The Project has met its development objectives. Coverage and equity of the tertiary education system have increased since the program began in 2008. The number of tertiary
                         education graduates increased from 195,440 in 2008 to 229,080 in 2012 (the end-of-project target in 2013 is 199,828). The net tertiary education enrollment rate for students whose
                         income is below two times the minimum wage increased from 45.6% in 2006 to 54.5% in December 2012 surpassing the end-of-project target of 49.9%. The Project has contributed
