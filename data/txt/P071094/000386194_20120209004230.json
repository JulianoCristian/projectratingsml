Some lessons learned includes: participation.\n            Substantial levels of participation can be achieved on a\n            large scale in government-led projects if sufficient\n            attention is paid to ongoing capacity building and learning.\n            Participation requires a process-oriented approach with a\n            long-term view on learning, and this was achieved in the\n            project through a flexible approach, focusing on a deep\n            understanding of basic participation principles and ongoing\n            learning from practice.
