facilitators at county and\n            township levels on how to implement and monitor the\n            participation approach in Poor Rural Communities Development\n            Project (PRCDP). PRCDP aims to improve livelihoods and\n            capacities for sustainable self development of the poorest\n            groups in provinces within the project. Effective\n            cooperation between the government, project and target\n            groups has become the key condition for success of PRCDP. To\n            achieve this, PRCDP is working to ensure sustained and\n            effective participation of poor groups, women, ethnic\n            minorities and marginalized groups throughout the whole\n            project cycle: from poverty analysis and development\n            planning to implementing, monitoring, evaluating and\n            revising project activities. Poverty alleviation projects in\n            China are increasingly using participatory approaches.\n            However, there are wide differences in understanding of\n            participation with no guidelines or manuals covering areas\n            such as poverty assessment, limited relevant practical\n            experience, and a shortage of facilitators. As a result, the\n            use and impact of genuinely participatory approaches\n            throughout the project cycle have been severely limited. The\n            most serious problem has been the failure of poor groups to\n            participate effectively, particularly in decision making,\n            which has directly impacted on the success of development projects."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
