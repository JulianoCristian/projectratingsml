                         All three project provinces have expedited quality project implementation and will be able to complete the project on a timely basis. The October/November 2010 World Bank and
                         DFID final supervision mission found that Xuyong County (in Sichuan) and Menglian County (in Yunnan) have each done an excellent job of quality project implementation. In

                         particular, the mission observed the following three indicators of successful project implementation:
                         . Strong participatory process with all stakeholders having a good understanding of the project and fully engaged in the project design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation;
                         . Excellent outreach to the poorest and most disadvantaged ethnic minority people. This had been a major challenge in Menglian County (as was observed by the Fifth Supervision
                         Mission in December 2007), but has been successfully addressed by the County Government and County Project Management Office over the last twenty two months; and,
                         . Capable project institutions at the county, township and village levels comprising sufficient and (for the most part) adequately trained staff. The effectiveness of the Project
                         Management Office system greatly benefitted from the strong support and leadership of the county, municipal and provincial governments.
