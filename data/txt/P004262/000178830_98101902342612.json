and well-being of 7,500 low income rural\n            households in the State of Kelantan by: (a) assisting 5,700\n            existing settlers on Kelantan Darul Naim Land Development\n            and Rehabilitation Corporation (TAKDIR) land settlement\n            schemes to complete the development of their holdings and to\n            replant or rehabilitate their existing perennial crops\n            (principally rubber); (b) settling and assisting about 1,800\n            households to develop landholdings on the schemes; (c)\n            completing basic infrastructure on the schemes; and (d)\n            strengthening TAKDIR to provide adequate support to settlers\n            and to coordinate its activities with other agencies. About\n            75% of the beneficiaries would be rural households whose\n            present incomes fall below the poverty line. At full\n            development, the project would enable these beneficiaries to\n            more than double their incomes."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
