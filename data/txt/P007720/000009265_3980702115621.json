Employees). The reform will 1)\n            improve the financial management of the health insurance\n            system to ensure financial transparency; 2) introduce new\n            resource allocation and financial mechanisms to improve\n            efficiency and limit the fiscal impact of the proposed\n            reforms; 3) strengthen the institutional and regulatory\n            framework for health insurance to extend coverage to the\n            self-employed and informal sector workers; 4) ensure greater\n            transparency and accountability among providers; 5) develop\n            measures for quality assurance and user rights, and to\n            facilitate user choice; and 6) improve the quality and\n            efficiency of the IMSS health delivery system by supporting\n            decentralized decisionmaking, restructuring the health care\n            delivery network around a population-based system, and\n            introducing performance-based incentives for providers. The\n            reform program adopts a two-pronged approach. It develops\n            and implements health insurance financing reforms and the\n            necessary regulatory framework by a) separating financing\n            from service provision, increasing user choice and extending\n            coverage, and developing and implementing purchasing\n            mechanisms; and b) institutionally strengthening IMSS by\n            changing its corporate structure for health services\n            administration, and strengthening its health care delivery network."}, "docdt": "1998-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
