strengthening\n            two key institutions in the sector.  Specifically, it would\n            provide:  credit to artisanal and commercial fishermen for\n            fish production; credit for fish marketing facilities;\n            foreign exchange assistance for the manufacture of fishing\n            nets; and technical assistance.  The implementation of the\n            project would increase fish production by about 10 percent\n            and raise incomes of about 3,500 fishing families from an\n            average of K 1,400 to about K 2,800 per family. Technical\n            assistance would strengthen ZADB and the Department of\n            Fisheries (DOF)."}, "docdt": "1984-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
