were satisfactory; risk\n            to global environment outcome was low or negligible; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: land use\n            and management planning need to be incorporated into the\n            Communal Development Plans (PCD). The initial five land use\n            and management plans prepared under this project have\n            demonstrated that land use and management planning is a very\n            powerful tool that can be used to produce consensus and\n            limit conflicts among land users. The mere availability of\n            improved technology cannot sufficiently induce farmers to\n            adopt sustainable production systems. Additional economic\n            incentives are necessary to foster technological change.\n            Measures to ensure the sustainability of Sustainable Land\n            Management (SLM) micro-projects need to be included in the\n            project design. Institutional capacity needs to be\n            developed, for example through the creation of farmer\n            organizations, marketing cooperatives, and trade associations."}, "docdt": "2012-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
