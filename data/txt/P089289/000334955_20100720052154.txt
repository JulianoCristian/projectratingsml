F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) is the first phase of
the program. Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in setting up and
implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community
development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system for channeling funds to rural
communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii) strengthen the capacity
of communities and local governments to plan and manage their own development, and
(iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development.
  Communities and communes would be engaged in a participatory appraisal of their
needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project.
Efforts would be made to clarify procedures and build local governance capacity for
communes so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred
to them. Special efforts will be undertaken for enable marginalized people (indigenous
communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project.

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The global environmental objective of the proposed project is to enhance the sustainable
land and natural resource management components of the PAPNDP project by
complementing the local and national benefits of SLM with key global benefits such as:
  1. Conservation of globally significant above and belowground biodiversity.
  2.    Reduction of carbon emissions via improved land management activities,
rehabilitated degraded lands, and increased carbon sequestration.
  3. Stabilizing riparian zones and reduction of sediment discharge into critical trans-
boundary water bodies such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of Guinea.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Stretching from the hot, dry Sahelian zone in the north to the moist, tropical
rainforest zone in the south, Cameroon covers an area of 475,440 km2 that features highly
variable landscapes and extremely diverse ecosystems. The human population is also
very diverse, featuring more than 200 ethnic and linguistic groups in a population of
about16 million. The macroeconomic environment has been relatively stable in recent
years, although the pace of much needed economic reform remains slow. Politically,
Cameroon plays a critical leadership role in the turbulence-prone Central African region.
Poverty remains widespread, with about 40 percent of the population living under the
poverty threshold of US $l per day. At least 80 percent of the poor live in rural areas,
suggesting that rural areas must be the primary focus of poverty reduction interventions.
Except the primary school enrolment goal, the country is still far from meeting most of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

2.      One of the major obstacles to rural poverty reduction, as identified at Project
appraisal, was the inadequate and inefficient provision of basic social services (such as
education, health, clean water and sanitation, rural energy, and rural roads) to rural
populations. The appraisal document shows that educational levels were very low in
Cameroon, particularly in rural areas, mainly due to long distances between home and
school (more than 10 kilometers for some communities), poor quality of education, and
high student-teacher ratios. At the same time health services failed to address all the
population's needs and expectations, due mainly to the weak financial situation of the
population and the public health system, the poor quality of service delivery of the
system, and the excessive centralization and inadequate coordination of public services.
Access to clean water was a major problem in the rural areas where an estimated 58% of
the population was affected. Limited and dilapidated rural road networks were also
contributing factors in rural poverty. Up to 40% of agricultural production is estimated to
be lost due to lack of available transport facilities. Road maintenance was under-funded
with available funds covering only a third of rural road maintenance needs. In addition,
the Government had no policy for ownership of community roads and did not provide
adequate support to community regarding periodic maintenance.

3.     At appraisal in June 2003, the World Bank Group had just approved a Country
Assistance Strategy that was aligned on the country's Poverty Reduction Strategic Paper.
The PRSP aims to achieve poverty reduction with focus on improved basic service
delivery, private sector-led growth and better governance. The CAS was founded on two
main pillars: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for pro-poor economic
management and service delivery; and (ii) reducing selected constraints to, and directly
supporting, private sector development. The Bank also completed a Rural Sector Review
(RSR) January 2003, which highlighted among others the need for a nation-wide local
development program with focus on community support and capacity building.




                                            1
4.      The CAS was structured to address key constraints to rural poverty reduction, as
identified in the PRSP and other Government strategies, particularly on rural
development and decentralization. Key obstacles that were identified included: (i)
inadequate and inefficient provision of basic services to rural populations; (ii) technical
and financial weaknesses of the communes and communities; and (iii) lack of
coordination between donors at the local level.

5.      Although the Government of Cameroon signaled its strong interest in
decentralization more than three decades ago, when the creation of communes was
initiated under Law 74/23 of December 1974, progress has been slow. The situation at
appraisal was characterized by lack of a common vision for local development, lack of
appropriate planning and budgeting tools, and weak technical, financial and procurement
management capacities at local level. Communal elected officials were not sufficiently
empowered to manage local development, but these officials also had limited
accountability toward their constituents. Most of the communes were overstaffed with
inappropriate personnel in regards to the critical competence needs of the communes. In
addition, investments channeled to local communities were influenced by the "elite" and
did not necessarily take into account local priorities. Finally, the flow of resources to the
local level was inefficient due to lengthy and non-transparent administrative procedures
and poor tracking system, leading to important delays in implementation of investments
at local level.

6.      The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP) was designed
to support decentralization and local development by removing or reducing some of these
obstacles, including improving basic social services delivery and establishing a
decentralized financing mechanism for local development. In this respect, three options
for channeling resources to the local level were considered at appraisal: (i) using the
existing budget transfer system through the public Treasury; (ii) channeling resources
using the Special Council Support Fund for Mutual Assistance; and (iii) transferring
resources directly to communes as envisioned under the decentralization framework. The
first option was rejected because of the inefficiencies of the administrative system in
place, as indicated above. For the second option, there was a common understanding that
there is need to further clarify and simplify the missions of FEICOM, and improve its
governance administrative, technical and financial management. Therefore, development
partners and the Government of Cameroon decided to launch a prior audit of FEICOM.
The proper implementation of the recommendations from the audit should guide the use
of this channeling mechanism. In light of the above, the third option was selected as the
most appropriate mechanism to be supported under the Program.

7.      Given the shortcomings of the above options (i) and (ii), the Project elected to
transfer resources directly to communes through a phased process designed to set up a
sustainable mechanism for channeling funds to rural communities to finance prioritized
collective infrastructure. Setting up and implementing a sustainable and decentralized
financing mechanism to ensure participatory community development in rural areas was
perceived at Project concept as a long term objective, to be achieved over a twelve year
period. Once in place, the new financing mechanism was expected to address the



                                             2
widespread financial weaknesses of communes. Despite the fact that (i) communes have
been in place since 1974, and (ii) some treasury rules have been relaxed since 1998 to
increase resource mobilization opportunities for communes1, at appraisal the revenues
under direct local government control were insufficient to cover operating expenditures.
Consequently, most communes did not have sufficient resources to finance local
development activities. It therefore became critical to address this financing problem
once and for all through a long-term commitment to setting up a sustainable mechanism
for channeling funds to communes. Establishment of the funding mechanism would need
to be complemented by capacity reinforcement of actors and institutions to ensure
efficient and transparent management of these funds. The first phase of the Project was
designed to set up the funds channeling mechanism in selected Provinces, and subsequent
phases were expected to consolidate and extend the system to cover the entire country.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

8.     The Community Development Program Support Project (PAPNDP)2 is the first of
three planned four-year phases of the Community Development Program (PNDP).
Therefore, it is useful to distinguish the long term vision of the Program from the shorter
term objectives of the first phase Project. During the first phase of the Program, the
acronym PAPNDP is used to designate the IDA-financed part of the Project whereas
PNDP represents the entire Project (financed by IDA, other donors, and the country's
own resources).

9.      The Program's long-term vision is that communes would collaborate with
communities in the planning and control of local development in rural communes, as
defined by Law 74/23. Rural communes would achieve this vision by: (i) identifying and
managing infrastructure and service needs, (ii) managing the resources needed to
establish and maintain community infrastructure, and (iii) promoting good governance.
This vision could not be achieved quickly because it called for fundamental changes in
local development planning, budgeting, financing and execution. The ultimate purpose of
the Program was to reduce poverty and to promote sustainable rural development by
improving the legal, regulatory and governance frameworks, setting up a sustainable
financing mechanism, and building the required capacities for local development. The
first phase of the process initiated the Program and refined its mechanisms in 5 out of 10
provinces. The second phase aimed to extend the program to all 10 provinces and ensure
that financial resources are channeled to communes through a transparent and sustainable
mechanism.

10.    The development objective of the Community Development Program Support
Project (the first phase) is to assist the Government of Cameroon in setting up and
implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community

1
 For example, the "single treasury" principle (unité de caisse) was abolished since 1998 for communes.
2
  A Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grant was approved in June 2006. The GEF grant was partially
blended with the IDA-financed PAPNDP. This ICR concerns only the IDA component of the Project. A
specific ICR will be prepared for the GEF grant, which is scheduled to close in March 2011.


                                                  3
development in rural areas. It would (i) establish a system for channeling funds to rural
communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructure, (ii) strengthen the capacity of
communities and local governments to plan and manage their own development, and (iii)
improve the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural development.
Communities and communes would be engaged in a participatory appraisal of their
needs, culminating in the implementation of subprojects cofinanced by the project.
Efforts would be made to clarify procedures and build local governance capacity for
communes, so that resources and local development responsibilities could be transferred
to them. Special efforts were to be undertaken to enable marginalized people (indigenous
communities, nomads, women, etc.) to participate in the project. The following (17) key
PDO indicators were agreed:

 1.    500 subprojects have been implemented;
 2.    Local Development Plans of at least 50% of targeted CBOs within the 38 targeted
       communes have been approved;
 3.    Communal Development Plans of at least 75% of targeted communes have been
       approved;
 4.    50 health centers have been rehabilitated or built;
 5.    150 classrooms have been rehabilitated or built;
 6.    30 rural roads improvement subprojects have been completed;
 7.    150 water supply infrastructure have been rehabilitated or built;

       higher than 50% as compared to the baseline;
 12.   Implementation ratio of the training plans established by the Provincial Project
       Units (PPU) to the benefit of CBOs reaches 55%;
 13.   At least 70% of infrastructure carried out under the subprojects are maintained and
       operational;
 14.   80% of the reports to be prepared by NCU under the Project Monitoring and
       Evaluation Manual have been issued on a timely basis;
 15.   80% of contracts signed by NCU have been executed on time;
 16.   50% of targeted communes have a rate of tax covering higher than 50% as
       compared to the baseline;
 17.   A properly grounded decision has been rendered on at least 95% of subprojects
       submitted to Communal and Provincial Decision Committees.

In addition to the PDO indicators, nine triggers were identified for the second phase:

1.     50% of targeted communities have defined and adopted a local development plan
       and elected a local committee;
2.     50% of these communities have fully and successfully implemented one



                                             4
       subproject;
3.     50% of targeted communes have defined and adopted a communal development
       plan;

       PAPNDP funds;
6.     25% of the [resources allocated to] component 1 have been disbursed;
7.     50% of targeted communes have profited from training programs;
8.     Legal texts on decentralization have been drafted;
9.     Status and organization charts of communes have been prepared.




1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.      At midterm review, the above italicized PDO indicators (12, 14 and 15) were
dropped from the results framework because they were considered to be too process-
oriented. At the same time, two sets of indicators were added to track the geographic
coverage of the Project as well as the impact of the Project on improved basic services
delivery in the country. These include: (i) the number of communes covered under the
Project, and (ii) the number of additional people having access to improved basic social
facilities--education, health, water and sanitation, transportation and electricity--as
compared to the baseline. There was no change in the PDO.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

12.     The project covered 155 communes and contributed to empower rural
communities in planning, implementing and overseeing priority activities defined in their
development plans. Efforts have been made to directly target vulnerable groups,
including women, indigenous communities, and nomads. The targeted populations have
benefited from reinforced interest in their development, improved rural infrastructure
(roads, bridges, schools, dispensaries, wells), and improved service delivery (education,
health, extension, road maintenance, HIV/AIDS prevention, drinking water). Other
benefits have included improved economic and social infrastructure, such as markets,
livestock parks, storage facilities, and rural community centers.

13.      In addition to providing assistance to communities for the development of local or
communal development plans, the Project also contributed financial resources to finance
activities or subprojects contained in these plans. Thus, the PAPNDP plays a didactic role
in engaging communities in the decentralization process. Local plans are developed
through broad consultations between community stakeholders, and in accordance with


                                            5
sectoral priorities set at national level. Local development support agencies (Organismes
d'Appui Local or OAL) are hired by the project to provide technical support to
communities in preparing development plans and subprojects. The process has involved
participation of NGOs, decentralized technical ministries and communal staff. Communal
agents have benefitted from capacity strengthening under the Project, which helped them
play a more active role in the local development processes, by improving the recovery of
local taxes and overall budget preparation and execution.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1. Supporting local development (US$53.07 million; IDA Credit: US$10
million)

14.    Component 1 supports local development by channeling grants to rural communes
and to rural community-based organizations (CBOs) with legal status. The grants are
used to cofinance subprojects (community and communal), which are proposed by the
rural communes and CBOs and aimed at addressing their priority needs. Beneficiary
contributions varied from 5 percent to 15 percent depending on the type of subproject.
These contributions may be made from the facility set under the Special Council Support
Fund for Mutual Assistance (FEICOM). Cofinancing is done using three mechanisms: (i)
Community subprojects, (ii) Communal subprojects, and (iii) the Special Council Support
Fund for Mutual Assistance (FEICOM).

15.     The Project provides technical assistance to communities which allows them to
conduct a participatory assessment of their needs and prepare a local development plan
spelling out local development priorities. Decentralized staff from technical ministries
(health, education, water and sanitation, energy and transport), and communal authorities
are involved in the planning process to ensure that local development plans are consistent
with national standards and policies and with planned activities and infrastructure in the
commune. In addition, the Project provides technical assistance to rural communes to
prepare communal development plans, which focus on intervillage issues and address
specific communal and intercommunal needs. Communal development plans are
approved by the Provincial Decision Committee (PDC), and local development plans are
approved by the Communal Council extended to sectoral ministries. These committees
and councils ensure that approved subprojects are consistent with national standards, are
technically and financially feasible, and respect social and environmental safeguards.

16.    Finally, the Project works with the Special Council Support Fund for Mutual
Assistance (FEICOM), which was established in 1974 for channeling financial resources
to communes and them with technical assistance. FEICOM participates in the
implementation of PAPNDP in several ways, including: (a) mobilizing tax revenues
(Centimes Additionnels Communaux) as contributions to communes to cofinance
subprojects, (b) contributing to the monitoring of the implementation of commmunal
subprojects, and (c) cofinancing the implementation of communal development plans as a
donor (FCFA 1.7 billion).




                                            6
Component 2. Supporting the decentralization process (US$5.56 million; IDA
Credit: US$0.86 million)

17.    Component 2 supports the decentralization process, with the aim of strengthening
local governance to give accountable decentralized authorities the legal authority and
human and financial resources needed for local development. It includes three
subcomponents: (i) support to the finalization of the legal and regulatory framework for
local governance, (ii) capacity-building for communes, and (iii) sensitization on
decentralization.

18.    The first subcomponent is designed to support studies and technical and advisory
services toward improving the legal and regulatory framework for decentralization and
local governance, including fiscal decentralization. These include, in particular, support
for a mechanism, such as the FEICOM, to channel funds to municipalities. It was
expected that the Project may support implementation of recommendations from
FEICOM audit results.

19.     The second subcomponent is designed to support capacity building for communes
through: (i) studies to assess communes' capacities and develop capacity-building
programs; (ii) training for elected decentralized authorities and commune staff in
communal accounting, decentralization, conflict resolution, and local development; (iii)
staffing communes with accounting agents whose costs will be progressively borne by
communes; and (iv) equipment, mainly information technology, to allow adequate
financial management and monitoring and evaluation.

20.    The last subcomponent aims to support the Ministry of Territorial Administration
and Decentralization (MINATD) in its outreach and communication campaigns for
administrative decentralization. Under this subcomponent, the Project financed (i)
workshops on decentralization, (ii) trainings, and (iii) cross field visits on local
development for communal authorities in Cameroon and in other countries where
decentralization is more advanced.

Project Component 3. Capacity-building at the local level (US$ 10.22 million; IDA
Credit: US3.59 million)

21.     Component 3 aims to strengthen and empower communities to get involved in
decision-making and have an active role in local development. It includes two
subcomponents: (i) support for the preparation of local and communal development plans
and the preparation and implementation of community and communal subprojects; and
(ii) specific training and outreach campaigns to improve communities' livelihoods and
reduce poverty.

22.     Through the first subcomponent, NGOs or technical agents are contracted to
strengthen the beneficiaries' capacity to implement subprojects by providing training in
community-based procurement, financial management, and project management. The
Communal Decision Committees and Provincial Decision Committees are strengthened



                                            7
to enable them to appraise and approve subprojects. The Project covers part of the
operating costs of PDCs and CDCs, including regular field missions to supervise
implementation of approved subprojects. Provincial and communal committees are also
trained in such areas as local development, Cameroonian sector policies, strategic
planning, safeguard policies, and participatory monitoring.

23.     The second subcomponent builds on the participatory planning process to design
specific training and outreach programs, which are implemented by specialists contracted
by the project. Themes addressed by trainings and outreach campaigns include literacy,
HIV/AIDS prevention, hygiene, nutrition, community-based integrated environmental
management, community forestry, microcredit and savings, and safeguard issues.

Project Component 4: Supporting project management and coordination,
monitoring and evaluation, and communication (US$13.97 million; IDA Credit:
US$5.55 million)

24.    Component 4 aims to allow all actors of the project and the rural and local
development sector in general to share information and tools. This component includes
three subcomponents: (i) management and coordination, (ii) project monitoring and
evaluation and (iii) communication.

25.    The management and coordination subcomponent finances project
implementation, project coordination, and financial management. These include
operating costs, equipments and training activities for National Coordination Unit (NCU)
and the five Provincial Project Units (PPUs).

26.    The project monitoring and evaluation subcomponent aims to build a system for
monitoring and evaluating the financial and technical implementation of the Project, as
well as a knowledge management system for decision-makers. The Provincial Project
Unit (PPU) collects information at the community and commune levels, and this
information is aggregated at national level by the National Coordination Unit (NCU).

27.     The communication subcomponent focuses on: (i) ensuring circulation of
strategic information in the PAPNDP; (b) ensuring circulation of technical and financial
information to beneficiaries, development partners, and key interested groups; (c)
ensuring communication with the public; and (d) supporting the second and the third
component. The communication plan relies on (a) direct communication with
beneficiaries (books, picture, movies), (ii) the support of administrative and local
authorities, and (iii) mass communication (television, radio, website, press briefings and
exposure visits for the media in the Project areas).

1.6 Revised Components

28.    While the number and the headings of the components were not changed during
implementation, the midterm review recommended improving the results framework for
all components by choosing program indicators that are more closely in line with the



                                            8
PRSP and MDGs (see Section 1.3), and by developing an appropriate system to monitor
these indicators, including baseline surveys. The midterm review also recommended
revising the geographical coverage of the project, taking into account institutional
developments, such as the redenomination and creation of new administrative and
communal entities.

1.7 Other significant changes

29.     Two reallocations of Project funds (December 2005 and August 2007) and an
increase in the ceiling of Special Account (March 2008) were approved to facilitate the
timely implementation of the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

30.     Project preparation began in December 2001, six months after the concept review
took place in June 2001. The decision meeting was held one and one-half years after the
beginning of project preparation (May 2003). The project design benefitted from lessons
learned from community development initiatives in Cameroon and other countries. The
project design drew on significant community development experience in Cameroon of
the World Bank and other development partners, including the Programme National pour
la Vulgarisation et la Recherche Agricole (PNVRA), the GEF-funded Biodiversity
project, pilot activities undertaken during project's preparation, and the Programme de
Développement de l'Ouest Bénoué (PDOB, financed by the French Development
Agency).

31.     Lessons learned from previous experience that influenced the project design
included the following: (i) community participation in planning and financing local
investments can yield priority investments that better reflect local needs; (ii) working
exclusively at the community level has raised some concerns regarding the appropriate
selection of the type and size of the investments, the financial sustainability of the
community, political accountability at community level, and the replicability of
development experience beyond the community; (iii) sequencing of activities are
important (in particular, capacity-building at the community level must be addressed
before resources are transferred to communities); (iv) responsibilities assigned to local
governments must be tailored to their level of competence; and (v) adequate follow-up
after the establishment of community action plans is necessary.

32.     Additional lessons came from other community development experiences across
Africa. These experiences emphasized: (i) the importance of a participatory process, (ii)
the possibility to delegate training responsibilities to experienced third parties, (iii) the
importance of recognizing that communities care more about the speed of the service
delivery and accountability than the level of their contributions (financial or in kind), (iv)
the need to reduce bureaucracies and intermediaries; (v) the importance that project
management be close to beneficiaries, with rules and responsibilities of different actors



                                              9
clearly spelled out; and (vi) community empowerment and ownership of local
development activities, including procurement, ensure better governance of the process.

33.     Project design also took into account relevant national strategies, including the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and the decentralization policy framework. By
sustaining local development through financing of education, health, and water and
sanitation facilities, the Project aimed to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. In
addition, by supporting the setting up and financing a decentralized financing mechanism
for local development, the Project was also aligned with the country's long-term
decentralization goals.

34.     A strong coalition of donors was built in the early stage of project design. PNDP
is designed to use financial resources from many sources, including IDA, the multilateral
debt relief funds, the French bilateral debt relief fund (C2D) provided through the French
Development Agency (AFD), German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the German Aid
Agency (KFW), and Japanese Cooperation (JICA). The Special Council Support Fund
for Mutual Assistance (FEICOM) contributed additional resources to communes to
finance their subprojects.

35.     Overall, quality at entry could be improved by strengthening the readiness of the
Project. As detailed in the next three sections, areas of improvement would include: (i)
greater clarity in the terms of reference of the development support agencies (AOL)
which were hired to support communes and their communities in the preparation of
local/communal development plans and related subprojects; (ii) a more efficient
monitoring and evaluation system, particularly in terms of data collection, baseline
determination, and the links between results and disbursed expenditures; (iii) greater
sensitization of deconcentrated sector ministry staffs and setting-up of proper incentive
framework for a more effective participation of sector ministries in the Program; and (iv)
development of more standard metrics for the realization of infrastructure subprojects
financed through the project, including classrooms, health centers, water points, power
lines, and rural roads.

2.2 Implementation

36.     The project initially started with limited geographic coverage, operating in 5 out
of 10 provinces: North, South, West, Center and Adamaoua. The Extreme North became
the sixth province covered under the project, through the support of KfW funding.

37.     The Credit for the first phase of PNDP was approved in March 2004. It became
effective on October 4, 2004 and was initially due to close on December 31, 2008. The
Development Credit Agreement was amended in August 2007 to reallocate the Credit
proceeds and in March 2008, to increase the ceiling of the Special Account. The closing
date of the project was later extended to November 30, 2009. The reallocation of credit
proceeds and the increases in the ceiling of Special Account were needed to facilitate the
timely implementation of the project.




                                           10
38.     Early during project implementation, emphasis was put on capacity building and
participatory elaboration of local development plans. Very soon, however, the stock of
finalized development plans exceeded the financial capacity of the project, particularly
because the counterpart funding expected from the Government was not received on
time. The low level of local resource mobilization led to a situation in which subprojects
were being approved even though there were no funds available for their implementation.

39.     Because subprojects were demand-driven, natural resources management (NRM)
issues usually were not included among the priorities identified in the local development
plans. Special funding was therefore sought from the Global Environmental Facility
grant, which was used to finance NRM activities in the intervention zones of the Project.

40.    Constraints in Project implementation included (i) the limited involvement of
technical ministries, (ii) insufficient quality in subprojects' preparation, (iii) limited use
of development plans in budgetary programming.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.    Project orientation, monitoring and management bodies were created under
ministerial directive No. 002/PM of January 9, 2004. These included the National
Orientation and Monitoring Committee, the Communal and Provincial Parity
Approbation Committees, the National Coordination Unit, as well as Regional
Coordination Units.

42.     The Project's monitoring, coordination and management system was adequate and
functional. The results framework, while relevant, could have been more precise as
regards some key performance indicators. Data quality was limited in the first years.
While data collection systems, baseline determination, and the links between results and
expenditure were initially weak, there were improvements during the implementation of
the project, particularly at the National Coordination Unit level.

43.     Local development support agencies (OALs) played a critical role in the delivery
of project-supported activities, but some of them underperformed, either because of their
lack of professionalism, or because of their limited technical, financial, logistical and
management capacities. In addition, the terms of references for OAL support were not
explicit enough when it came to defining the specific results to be achieved. Also, there
were no strategies for efficient management of OAL contracts.

44.    The lack of a mechanism to monitor communal and community development
plans was noted, as well as the absence of expertise needed to translate strategic elements
of the plans into subprojects. This lack of expertise was also translated into
implementation difficulties of subprojects in communes and communities, although the
problem seems to be more accentuated in communes. A November 2008 assessment3

                                               11
showed that 80% of communal subprojects faced implementation problems, compared to
approximately 40% for community subprojects. This difference is mainly explained by
the larger size of communal subprojects, which have more demanding monitoring and
control requirements. In general, proximity of communal and community authorities to
the subproject realization site improves their monitoring and control.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.     The Project Environmental Category was rated B (Partial Assessment) because it
was expected that most subprojects financed under the Project would be small, and
therefore were likely to have limited direct negative environmental and social impacts.
An Environmental Assessment (EA) was undertaken and an Environment Management
Plan (EMP) was prepared to highlight significant issues and their treatment. The
Environmental Assessment documents included studies on: (i) an Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF), (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF),
and (iii) an Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP). Given the relatively weak
capacity for environmental management, and to ensure that operations are screened for
potential impacts, the ESMF proposed that environmental and social considerations be
fully incorporated into a participatory process for identifying, implementing, and
monitoring activities or subprojects. According to the RPF, resettlement issues would be
identified in the environmental and social screening. The IPDP recognized the need for
specific activities for pygmy communities, to allow them to share in the benefits of the
Project and reduce their exposure to marginalization risks.

46.    Eight safeguard policies were triggered at the PCN or PAD stages: Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Forests (OP 4.36), Pest Management
(OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10),
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12), and Project on International Waters (OP 7.5).
However, actions were taken with respect to the following three policies: Environment
Assessment, Indigenous Peoples and Involuntary Resettlement. Compliance with all
safeguard measures was rated Moderately Satisfactory for the following reasons:

47.     Environmental Assessment. Environmental screening was mainstreamed in the
subproject preparation and approval processes. For each region, representatives of the
Ministry of Environment participated in environmental and social impact evaluation of
subprojects during identification and subsequent stages of subprojects' preparation
process. These representatives are also members of the subproject approval committees.
Simplified environmental and social screening forms were filled in during subproject
preparation and only subproject financing request packages that included a completed
form were eligible for consideration by the approval committee. The mainstreaming of
these forms was successful in almost all cases. In addition, the Project provided training
for members of the subproject management committees on environment safeguard issues
that are most likely to influence activities identified local and communal development
plans. Throughout the life of the Project, significant efforts were made to implement
mitigation measures for identified environmental and social impacts. Mitigation actions
included waste management in markets and health centers as well as construction of toilet



                                           12
and water and sanitation facilities along with the construction of schools, health centers,
and other social infrastructure. However, it was also noted in some cases that the
simplified environmental screening forms were not always properly filled in, and that
mitigation measures were implemented with important delays in other cases.

48.     Indigenous People Development Plan. The Project has supported the
development and implementation of the IPDP. Positive results were obtained in areas of
citizenship, health, education, agriculture and non-forest timber products. Latest figures
in November 2009 indicated that: (i) 1,010 national identity cards and 1,726 birth
certificates have been issued and (ii) 144 traditional midwives have been trained while 11
pygmies were receiving practical trainings in basic health services. These actions
contributed to: (i) increase the number of school children who passed the primary
education exam from 17 in 2007 to 48 in 2008; (ii) allow pygmies to fully enjoy their
civic rights; (iii) facilitate their access to better health facilities and allow more than 300
pygmy women give birth under better conditions; (iv) ignite greater interest in
agricultural production by pygmies (more than 40 hectares exploited) and reduce
incidences of land conflicts between pigmies and the more sedentary Bantou peoples who
now recognize pygmies use rights over some plots. Through the implementation of the
plan, the Project has developed an operational platform, which is increasingly viewed as
a federating instrument for harmonizing all interventions in support to Pygmies.

49.     Involuntary Displacement and Resettlement Plan. Only two cases (out of more
than 300 subprojects) of involuntary displacements were recorded during Project
implementation. Adequate measures were taken to resettle the concerned parties back to
their initial site. For all the other subprojects implemented on private lands, a letters
showing that the land has been donated to the commune or community was attached to
each subproject financing request. Communal authorities have been advised to get in
touch with the launch the process for registering the donated land, in cooperation with
sector ministries and the ministry in charge of land administration.

50.     Overall compliance with fiduciary requirements was rated Moderately
Satisfactory. Both the National and Provincial Project Units were successful in keeping
tight control over funds transfer to communities and communes under very challenging
conditions (recurring problems included low capacity at local level and high turnaround
among Project staff in some Provinces). Throughout the life of the Project, there was only
one case of ineligible expenditures (which were reposted to counterpart financing), and
there were no cases of misprocurement. In addition, the Project successfully passed
several audits (technical audit of realized infrastructure, forensic financial management
audit, independent procurement reviews). The high level of dedication of the Project staff
in respecting pre-established procedures for transferring and monitoring resource flows to
communes and communities was an important determinant in achieving these respectable
results. Under the circumstances outlined above, this must be seen as a considerable
achievement. However, some limitations were also observed in budget management and
record keeping, particularly at the level of Provincial Project Units (PPU). For example at
the time of the mid-term review, it was difficult to determine the level of committed
resources by components, because of the lack of a systematic budgetary control. In



                                              13
addition, record keeping was not always timely, and financial monitoring reports were
often of limited quality, with no links between physical realizations, procurement and
committed resources. Finally, limitations were also observed in the assessment of
financial risks. Some of these issues remained when the Project closed in November
2009, but the situation considerably improved over the life of the Project.




                                         14
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.     Because of the success of the first phase of the Project, which covered communes
in five regions, communes in other regions of the country expressed strong interest in
having the Government move to the second phase and to expand the geographical
coverage. The second phase of the Community Development Program Support Project
was approved in June 2009 and became effective in January 2010. During the second
phase, the Project will scale up to cover the remaining five regions. The design of the
second phase draws on lessons learned from the first phase by streamlining the
elaboration of communal development plans, improving quality control of contracts in
support to communes, improving funds transfer flow to communes, reducing risks of
poor governance, strengthening environmental management capacities, and consolidating
ownership and local governance in project implementation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

52.     The PDO remain relevant and are maintained in the second phase of the program.
The second phase aims to expand the geographical coverage of the program to all
communes and their communities. Under this phase, capacity building will be greatly
intensified at commune level, and local development responsibilities will be more
intensively transferred to well-performing communes. Also relevant are the three specific
objectives set forth by the program since inception. In particular, reinforcing the system
of transferring resources to decentralized rural communes for local development
subprojects remains a priority; so is the need to strengthen the capacities of these
communes to plan and manage their own development. Also important is the necessity
for the Government to continue working to improve the legal and regulatory framework
for decentralized rural development, by further improving the effectiveness of the support
being provided by sectoral ministries.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.    The development objective of the Community Development Program Support
Project (PAPNDP) is to assist the Government of Cameroon in setting up and
implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to ensure participatory community
development in rural areas. Specifically, the Project seeks to: (i) establish a system for
channeling funds to rural communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructure
subprojects, (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and local governments to plan
and manage their own development, and (iii) improve the legal and regulatory framework
for decentralized rural development.

54.    As explained earlier, the Project elected to transfer resources directly to
communes as part of a phased approach to setting up a sustainable mechanism for
channeling funds to rural communities and communes. These funds were to be used to



                                           15
finance priority investments for local development. The design of the Project recognized
that achieving this objective required long term commitments over a minimum of twelve
years. The design also recognized that the sustainability of the funds channeling
mechanism critically depends on building the capacities of actors and institutions to
ensure efficient and transparent management of these funds. For this reason, the
development objective of the Project is not only to set up the funds transfer mechanism,
but also to reinforce capacities and build the legal and regulatory framework for self-
sustaining local development.

55.      Progress achieved against the PDO indicators is summarized in Table 3.1. The
targeted values for the PDO indicators, as revised at midterm, are fully met. In most
cases, the results achieved exceeded the targets, particularly for the IDA financing
targets.

56.     Establishing a system for channeling funds to rural communities to finance
prioritized collective infrastructure. During the first phase of the program, the Project
was successful in transferring nearly US$24 million (of which US$6.62 from IDA) to
communes and community-based organizations for the co-financing of subprojects, with
the goal to address priority needs identified in local and communal development plans.
These resources were transferred securely into the bank accounts of communes and
communities, which have acquired the capacity to prepare local development plans and
realize subprojects from these plans. These resources contributed to finance a total of 691
subprojects (of which 340 were financed by IDA funds), well above the end-of-phase
target of 500 subprojects. More than 1.6 million people directly benefitted from
infrastructure financed under the Project (including more than 670,000 people benefitting
from infrastructure financed using IDA resources). The Project supported the
implementation of 80 improved rural road subprojects and the construction or
rehabilitation of 32 health centers (20 of which were financed by IDA), 247 classrooms
(103 of which were financed by IDA), and 467 water supply infrastructure (190 of which
were financed by IDA). The successful test of the mechanism for channeling resources to
communes encouraged the Government to transfer selected areas of competence and
associated resources of nine (9) ministries to communes.

57.     Strengthening the capacity of communities and local governments to plan and
manage their own development. To ensure efficient management of community
resources, the Project provided support to approximately 3,100 community-based
organizations with legal status regarding the preparation of their local development plans.
Almost all these plans (2,996) were prepared with IDA financing. The Project also
supported the preparation of communal development plans in 135 communes (90 for
IDA). The number of both the local and communal plans prepared with the Project's
support were significantly above the end-of-phase targets (1150 and 115 for the local and
communal development plans, respectively). The Project has strengthened capacity at
local level by providing trainings in several areas, including communal planning,
functioning rules of communal and community subproject approval committees,
familiarization with national and simplified procedures. In addition, a few communal
personnel received trainings in communal income and expenditure management and in



                                            16
the management of communal assets (See details in Annex 2 on Outputs per Component).
These trainings have been provided in more communes than initially planned (161
against 153; 90 against 38 for IDA).

58.     Improving the legal and regulatory framework for decentralized rural
development. The Project financed two studies, which led to significant improvements in
the legal and regulatory framework for decentralization. In particular, the first study on
local taxation and financial regimes of the decentralized territorial collectivities (CTD)
led to the adoption and promulgation of the following two laws and application decrees:
(i) laws on the financial regime of the CTD; and (ii) laws on local taxes. The second
study on institutional diagnostics and standard employment types of communes led to a
decree4 on typical organizational chart of communes. The Project also supported the
preparation of other legal texts and financed several other activities aimed to improve the
decentralization framework in Cameroon. In particular, it contributed to the drafting of
the national and sectoral strategy on decentralization. In prelude to the establishment of
the decentralized collectivity at regional level, a decree on administrative organization of
the Republic of Cameroon was issued with the support of the Project (Decree No.
2008/376 of November 12, 2008). Additional legal texts include: (i) decrees on
deconcentration chart and the use of the deconcentrated public services by CTD; (ii)
general orientation law; (ii) law applicable to regions; (iii) law applicable to communes;
(iv) decree creating the National Decentralization Council; (v) decree creating Inter-
ministerial Committee on local services; and (vi) decree creating and regulating the
functioning of urban communities. All these actions are contributing to enrich the toolkit
for strengthened local governance that would give accountable decentralized authorities
the legal authority and the human and financial resources needed for local development.

59.    Noteworthy is the fact that the design of the Project was conceived around the
notion of action learning, which combines processes with outcomes. Thus, while the
Project was successful in (i) establishing a system for channeling resources to rural
communities, (ii) strengthening the capacity of communities and local governments to
plan and manage their own development, and (iii) improving the legal and regulatory
framework for decentralized rural development, it was also successful in increasing
access to basic social services in rural areas. Infrastructure financed through the Project
permitted improved access to basic social services for an estimated 1.6 million people.
These improved services were delivered across many sectors, including education, health,
water and sanitation, rural electrification, rural transportation, women and gender
promotion, sport and leisure, and economic infrastructure development.

60.    In line with the longer term objectives of the 12-year program, these
achievements would need to be further strengthened, consolidated and extended to other
communes. The achievements would also need to be sustainable. The Project has made
good progress toward the achievement of the overall program goals, as witnessed by

4
  Decision No. 00136/A/MINATD/DCTD of August 24, 2009 made mandatory for communes to plan and
staff their administration taking into account the standard organizational chart and the standard employment
types for communes.

second phase in June 2009 and its effectiveness since January 2010.

3.3 Efficiency

61.     As stated in the Project Appraisal Document, the PAPNDP did not lend itself
readily to ex ante cost-benefit analysis because: (i) all investments would be demand-
driven, and their nature could not be known beforehand; (ii) most eligible subprojects
would be nonproductive, making the benefits difficult to quantify and value.
Nonproductive subprojects aim to deliver basic social services in sectors such as
education (and capacity development), health, water and sanitation, and leisure and
culture. Quantifying and valuing economic benefits in social sectors is generally a
difficult task.




                                                   19
62.     Recent progress in the impact assessment of community driven development
(CDD) projects5 make it possible, however, to assess the efficiency of CDD projects
against cost-benefit criteria. In preparing this report, an ex post economic analysis was
carried out, focusing on (i) the financial returns to productive subprojects (for example,
construction of rural markets), and (ii) the economic returns to social subprojects (for
example, construction of water supply systems, elementary school buildings and rural
roads). The analysis examined returns in major categories of subprojects, including water
and sanitation, education, transport and economic development infrastructure. The
analysis covered just over one-third (33.4%) of all subprojects completed by September
2009, representing 41.1% of total subproject costs.

63.    The ex post economic analysis, which was based on survey data and which used
conservative assumptions (see Annex 3) found that on average PAPNDP subprojects
generated impressive economic benefits. The average economic rate of return was 45.6%,
ranging from a high of 78.1% for rural market construction to a low of 16.2% for
investments in the education sector. The average net present value of Project-supported
subprojects was found to be positive and significant (more than CFAF300 million).

64.     In line with observations made in other countries (such as Burkina Faso)
regarding the cost-effectiveness of social infrastructure and services delivery through
CDD projects, PAPNDP is judged to have been an efficient project. The unit costs of
social infrastructure financed through the Project were much lower compared to the unit
costs of similar infrastructure financed through the Public Investment Budget (BIP). The
difference amounted to a 30% cost saving for an equipped classroom (CFAF6.7 million
on average under PNDP against CFAF9.6 million on average under the BIP). Similarly
average cost savings amounted to 31% for boreholes (CFAF5.5 million against CFAF8.5
million) and 13% for one kilometer of rural road rehabilitated (CFAF1.7 million vs.
CFAF2 million).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

65.     The rating for Overall Outcome is Satisfactory. The Project was successful in
establishing a system for channeling resources to rural communities: it permitted the
transfer of nearly US$24 million (including US$6.62 million of IDA resources) making
possible the construction of more than 690 infrastructure sub-projects (of which 340 were
financed by IDA resources) for the use of more than 1.6 million beneficiaries.
Communities and local governments clearly demonstrated strengthened capacities to plan
and manage their own development, as evidenced by the preparation under the Project of
nearly 3,100 local development plans (2,996 of which were prepared with IDA
financing). The Project also helped to improve the legal and regulatory framework for
decentralized rural development, as demonstrated in the numerous laws and decrees that
have been enacted thanks to the Project. These various legal texts are contributing to

enrich the toolkit for strengthened local governance, empowering decentralized
authorities with the legal authority needed to manage local development.

66.     In addition, the targets for key performance outcome indicators and performance
triggers for the second phase are satisfactorily achieved. In most cases, the indicators are
achieved above target, despite the underperformance in counterpart resource mobilization
and the limited involvement of technical ministries. The Project has established itself as a
credible vehicle for providing resources and knowledge to local communes and
communities in the stewardship of the decentralized local development. The majority of
beneficiaries are satisfied with the Project-supported interventions. This Project is
making a satisfactory progress toward achieving the ultimate goal of the Program. As
stated earlier, the ultimate purpose of the Program is to reduce poverty and to promote
sustainable rural development by improving the legal, regulatory and governance
frameworks, setting up a sustainable financing mechanism, and building the required
capacities for local development.

67.     Overall, the Project was successful in improving the regulatory environment for
decentralization, strengthening the capacities of actors involved in local development,
and securing access to financial resources, thereby serving as an important instrument to
promote decentralization and local development in Cameroon. The Project started within
a national environment characterized by poor delivery of basic social services, resulting
from low technical capacities, inadequate legal and regulatory framework, and lack of a
sustainable financing mechanism for local development. The greatest achievement of the
Project was to create a new environment for local development planning, financing and
management, leading to a greater command of the local development process by
communities, and to an improved delivery of basic social services. The Project used a
systematic approach to support decentralized territorial collectivities in addressing
capacity, regulatory and financing constraints to local development planning and
management.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

68.     Impact evaluation studies that were carried out following the first phase of the
program show that the Project has contributed to improved social outcomes in education,
health, and water and sanitation. It has also provided additional benefits by improving
access to transportation services, extending the rural electricity network services, and
building economic and social infrastructure at communal level for easy access to markets
and community centers. Achievements in the education, health, water and sanitation,
rural infrastructure (such as increased access to electricity and transport) have all
contributed to address some important limiting factors to poverty reduction, poverty
being a multidimensional phenomenon. The development of economic infrastructure
provided more income generation opportunities, which also would contribute to poverty
reduction. Empowerment of women strengthened their voice in community planning and
management, hence providing women with the opportunity to influence resource



                                            21
allocation toward more gender-equitable outcomes. Selected results from an impact study
prepared par the National Statistical Institute in November 2009 are summarized below.6

69.     Education sector. The education sector accounts for about 27% of all the
subproject of the PNDP. Half of these education sector subprojects have been completed.
During the first phase of its intervention, the average growth rate of the number of
students in schools where the PNDP intervened has reached 45%. This relatively high
rate hides some differences. In fact, it represents 40% in the North region, 86% in the
West, 57% in the South and less than 10% in other regions. Globally, the student per
classroom has decreased, varying from 89.8 before the intervention of the PNDP to 84.3
after the intervention. Regarding to the number of students per bench, it has fallen
varying from 2.9 to 2.7 in general.

70.     The various achievements of the PNDP have contributed to improve the net
global enrolment rate of children aged 6 to 11. Indeed, this rate increased from 75.6 to
77.3 in almost all the regions. In addition, the average distance from the household to the
nearest government primary school has experienced a considerable drop in these regions.
It varied from 2 km to 1.7 km on average during the intervention program, thus enabling
students to cover a shorter distance to reach their school.

71.     Health sector. Approximately 7% of subprojects financed by the Project are in
the health sector, and half of them have been completed. The impact evaluation estimated
that 1,800 visits per year were treated in the Project-financed facilities. The construction
of these facilities contributed to reduce the average distance from the household to the
nearest health centers, which varied from 5.6 km to 4.8 km in rural communes during the
intervention period. It also contributed to reduce average costs related to consultations,
which varied from CFAF 857 to CFAF 789 (an 8% reduction) during the same period. In
addition, the annual number of attended births was estimated at 658 in 2009 and the
annual number of consultations related to water-borne diseases averaged 576 over the
same period.

72.     Water and sanitation sector. This sector represents 40% of the total subprojects
financed by the Project. These subprojects are highly concentrated in the South and the
Centre regions. In communities who benefited from hydraulic subprojects, the number of
persons per water point fell from 916 before the intervention to about 644 after the
intervention. This improvement was associated by a decrease in the percentage of persons
suffering from diarrhea from 3.8 to 1.6 during the intervention period. It also led to a
reduction of the average distance from the household to the nearest water point, from 5.7
km to 4.7 km. The proportion of households with access to drinking water also increased
from 20.6% to 25.0% during the same period.

73.     Electricity sector. The electrification sector represents 13% of all the subprojects
realized by the Project. Subprojects were highly concentrated in the Centre region where
nearly two third of subprojects have been solicited. The impact evaluation survey shows
that the percentage of households with electricity in rural areas increased from 50.8% to
6
    When it applies, this section also makes reference to results of earlier impact evaluation studies.


                                                        22
55.1% in regions where the Project intervened. In addition, rural electrification has led to
the creation of other income generating activities, and thereby contributing to improve
the living conditions of populations. In the Center and West regions respectively, 50%
and 47.4% of income generating activities (AGR) were created after electrification, and
the major activities include the establishment of food stores and grinding mills. On the
contrary, the main activities in the north region are hairdressing and food stores, which
constitute about 33.3% of all AGR in the region.

74.     Transport sector. According to the INS survey results, people are generally
satisfied with the realizations of the Project in the road sector because the movements of
goods and people have now considerably improved. Almost three in five (57%) resource
persons interviewed believe that transport costs went down after the rehabilitation of road
sections, but it should be noted that factors other than road improvement (such as reduced
fuel price) could lead to reduced transportation costs. In addition, approximately nine in
ten (87%) respondents found the traveling time on the rehabilitated roads shorter than
before the intervention program. The increase in vehicle traffic on the rehabilitated road
sections is also perceived as an outcome of the Project by more than five persons out of
seven.

75.     Economic development Infrastructure sectors. The intervention of the Project
has contributed to a significant increase in the number of traders operating in markets.
The construction and expansion of markets has facilitated the sales in food crops. For
markets in operation, communal revenues experience a non-negligible rise. The stores
have contributed to preserve food crops against bad weather. The eco-tourism site
contributes to the protection and enhancement of the biodiversity of the Campo Ma'an
Reserve by neighboring communities. The returns generated from this new source of
income amount to CFAF 200,000 per season during the first years of operation of the
site. The average number of monthly tourists stands at 51 tourists.

76.     Capacity building. The Impact Assessment determined that Project-supported
capacity building activities have contributed to a remarkable improvement in budget
management, project contracting, and procurement. More than 79 percent of municipal
leaders indicated that thanks to the training they received under the Project, they now
have independent control over the management of their development plans. The Impact
Assessment also concluded that revenues have increased in approximately 77 percent of
municipalities, and fiscal management was improved in 68 percent of beneficiary
communes. About 81% of communes have seen their method of monitoring the execution
of projects improved, and approximately 48% of communes declared having the capacity
to carry out contract at the commune level.

77.     Gender. Project implementation procedures have stressed gender integration, with
significant results. This has served not only to increase women's opportunities, but also to
enhance the Project's effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Women's groups have
been formed to stimulate interest in issues of concern to women, raise awareness across
the community, and promote social mobilization for greater "voice" for women to play a
greater role in decision making and leadership in local development planning, sub-



                                            23
projects selection process, as well as on the management of the infrastructure. Priority
investments identified by women's groups often relate to water and sanitation, health and
professional training centers. These investments represent up to 41 percent of the
infrastructure portfolio implemented, showing that the procedures introduced under the
Project have succeeded in making infrastructure sub-projects more gender-responsive by
addressing the needs and constraints of women, thereby enhancing women's
opportunities for employment. These actions, which never before received such attention,
have enhanced the social standing and decision making of women in their communities.
However more work remains in consolidating and expanding these achievements. To that
end, the second phase would need to include specific gender indicators to allow close
monitoring of the benefits received by women from the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

78.     In line with the Project development objective, the Project has played an
important role in strengthening the ongoing decentralization process and enhancing the
ability of local governments to carry out their mandated activities, including preparing
and implementing local development plans. The Project has made a significant
contribution to improving the legal and regulatory environment of decentralization thus
providing communes with an adequate framework for improved performance (See
Section 3.2).

79.      Based on the results of the Project's monitoring and evaluation survey (Annex 2)
and of two separate beneficiary surveys (Annex 5), the Project is perceived as a positive
catalyst to the emergence of a local leadership for improved stewardship of local
development. The beneficiary surveys also revealed that there is an increased coherence
in local development planning, including better alignment between sector and territorial
priorities, and a more efficient use of sector's resources. This change was facilitated by
the institutionalization of development plans as investment planning and budget tools. In
addition, as revealed in the results of the beneficiary surveys, the Project has contributed
in some areas to reinforce social cohesion and shared responsibility for local
development.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

80.    The process of preparing local development plans has contributed to build a
development coalition in some communities. Many of these communities have sought to
finance planned activities (from their development plans) by tapping into remittances
from the elite7 and from the community's own resources.

81.    The availability of electricity in rural areas, made possible through Project-
supported investments, has led to the emergence of new income-generating activities for

  Elite are sons and daughters from communities who have greater exposure to the outside world, usually in
terms of greater access to financial and intellectual resources. Some of the elite are intellectual leaders and
benefactors of the communities. Others may be disruptive to communities' social cohesion and progress.


                                                     24
many households, including in areas such as food processing, carpentry, welding,
mechanics, commerce, etc.

82.     Less positively, in some cases the participatory approach adopted by the Project
has created opportunities for inaction and limited accountability, particularly in situations
where the roles and responsibilities of the various actors are not sufficiently clear. In
addition, the availability through the Project of resources for financing the realization of
social infrastructure by local communities has brought increased risk of waste and
corruption. The former can be seen in frequent delays in the delivery and poor quality of
locally implemented projects, whereas the latter manifests itself in the rent seeking. These
risks are exacerbated in an environment of weak local governance.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

83.     Two beneficiary surveys were conducted during the implementation of the first
phase of the PNDP. The first survey was carried out in May 2007 by the Alternative
Consulting Group SA.8 The second survey was completed through an independent impact
assessment study by the National Statistics Office (INS).9 This section summarizes the
results of the two studies, with more emphasis on the INS study, which provides more
up-to-date information on the achievements of the Project.

84.      The May 2007 beneficiary survey revealed that beneficiary communes and
communities: (i) were strongly interested and positively appreciated the Project's
contributions to strengthen beneficiary ownership and improved local governance; (ii)
acknowledged the Project facilitated the creation of fora for effective consultation
between development actors at local, communal and inter-communal levels, thereby
helping to strengthen and consolidate social cohesion; (iii) recognized improvements in
the access to basic social services, including safe drinking water, education, health, rural
electrification, rural transport and rural market facilities; (iv) acknowledged an increase
in their capacities to undertake and develop partnerships to define local and territorial
development priorities and mobilize resources from implementing these priorities (see
Annex 5 for details).

85.     The second beneficiary impact assessment study, also detailed in Annex 5, was
carried out by the country's National Institute of Statistics (INS) and covered 5 regions
(North, West South, Center, and Adamaoua) in which PAPNDP has been implemented
since 2004. The sample consisted of all 237 subprojects financed under PAPNDP in the
155 communes that benefitted from the program. IDA-financed subprojects were divided
into community subprojects (16.3%) and communal subprojects (83.7%). The subprojects
were distributed among the following sectors: water and sanitation (40%), education
(27%), electricity (13%), health (7%), transport (6%), development infrastructure (6%),

and women community centers (1%). At the time of Project closing, approximately 46%
of these projects had been completed and handed over to beneficiaries, and an additional
21% were being finalized. For the remaining 33% of subprojects, contracts had been
signed and were awaiting implementation.

86.     The analysis examined five aspects of performance: (i) the project's relevance to
the beneficiary community; (ii) its effectiveness in meeting predefined goals; (iii) its
efficiency in terms of costs; (iv) its consistency with local development plans; and (v) its
sustainability in terms of the maintenance.

87.     Overall, PNDP subprojects were found to be very relevant, because 88% of all
subprojects had been selected through a dialogue conducted at local level. They were also
found to be consistent with local development plans. Nearly all beneficiaries (97%)
indicated having an effective knowledge of project's contributions to fight against poverty
and improve the living conditions of the population. Specific areas of improvements
noted by beneficiaries included improving health coverage and reducing the distance to
the nearest health centers, building and equipping new classrooms with desks and
textbooks, rehabilitating rural roads, increasing access to electricity and increasing
municipal revenues. In terms of sustainability, the assessment found 3 in 4 (73%)
subproject management committees were functioning efficiently, a necessary prerequisite
to make the realized infrastructure sustainable. Attaining sustainability would be much
more difficult for the remaining quarter of subprojects for which these committees are
dysfunctional.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

88.     The institutional risk to development outcome is judged to be moderate. At
appraisal, three types of risks were identified to potentially affect the achievement of
development objective: (i) the risk of the lack of coordination between the Project and
national sectoral policies, rated substantial; (ii) the risk of the lack of coordination
between communities and communes, rated moderate; and (iii) the risk of the lack of
interest from local populations in the project activities, rated negligible.

89.     Regarding the first risk, efforts were made during project implementation to
improve the legal framework for decentralization. As discussed in Section 3.2, several
background studies have been financed resulting in the preparation, and sometimes the
promulgation, of key legal texts which are contributing to enrich the toolkit for
strengthened local governance. These texts aim to give accountable decentralized
authorities the legal authority and the human and financial resources needed for local
development. Despite these achievements, additional efforts are required, particularly
with respect to finalization of the overhaul of the legal framework of decentralization,
and the effective application of legal texts. Overall, this risk materialized less in terms of
coordination with national policies, because local development planning was consistent
with sector objectives, which are in turn aligned with the country's Growth and



                                             26
Employment Strategy Paper (DSCE). However, the risk materialized more in terms of
achieving effective cooperation with sector ministries regarding the execution of core
control and oversight functions in relation to the implementation of subprojects.10

90.     Regarding the second risk, the coordination of development planning and
subproject realization between the community and commune levels proved difficult, but
it was achieved in most cases. The main issues were in terms of the quality of
development plans and the appropriateness of the community space as an optimal scale
for local development planning, given that the smallest decentralized territorial unit is the
commune. These issues are being addressed in the second phase of the Project through a
simplified process for preparing communal development plans. This process eliminates
the preparation of local development plans (which do not have any legal status) and
ensures that development priorities identified at community level are directly reflected in
the communal development plans. The new process calls for greater coordination
between development planning at community and commune levels.

91.     With regard to the third risk, fortunately it did not materialize, because local
populations have shown strong interest in Project activities. The most serious risk to
potential community disinterest in the Project was the delays in mobilizing counterpart
funding to finance approved subprojects. Such delays, observed in the first years of
Project, were gradually eliminated during project implementation. The risk was
substantially reduced accordingly, which reinvigorated community interest in the Project.

92.    Overall, the institutional risks to achieving the development outcome remained at
the appraised level (moderate) at the end of the first phase of the program. This was due
to close monitoring of these risks, and the improvement of the legal and regulatory
framework for decentralization, which clarified the role and responsibilities of the
decentralized and deconcentrated administrations at local level. However, other risks
emerged during project implementation, which presented additional threats to the
attainment of the development outcome.

93.    The economic and financial risk to development outcome is judged to be
moderate. In addition to standard fiduciary risks regarding financial management and
procurement, two economic and financial risks to the achievement of the development
outcome were identified at appraisal: (i) communities lack resources to cofinance
subprojects (rated moderate); and (ii) lack of a safe financial system for channeling funds
to beneficiaries (rated substantial).

94.    Regarding the first risk, collecting community cofinancing through in-kind
contributions during implementation proved difficult in some communities. This form of
co-financing also posed difficulties to contractors before it was difficult to guarantee the


10
  Many of ministry staff have been employed by OALs and service providers as consultants on subprojects
realized under their jurisdiction. These staff found themselves in positions where they have to control their
own work, weakening the oversight role of these technical ministries to which they belong.



                                                     27
quality and reliability of materials and labor provided by communities as in-kind
contributions to the realization of infrastructure. As a consequence, during the second
phase emphasis is being put on cash contributions, unless in-kind contributions were
available and properly valued during subproject preparation. Despite the difficulties
observed during the first phase, beneficiaries have shown a high level of interest in the
Project. This is reflected in the fact that total contributions far exceeded expectations
(CFAF1.6 billion against the CFAF 0.5 billion expected).

95.      The second risk (lack of safe financial system for fund transfer to communes) was
fully monitored and mitigated during Project implementation because of the recognition
that the transfer of funds management responsibilities to communes increases governance
risks. Despite the low financial management capacity at the communal level, the second
risk has had limited impact, because the Project has closely monitored resource flows to
communities. In addition, the Project recruited an international consulting firm was 2007
to prepare a good governance strategy. The study have identified corruption as a
potentially significant risk and recommended mitigation measures to improve governance
in funds management. On the basis of the good governance strategy, the Project prepared
a code of ethics was prepared, which is now applicable to all parties involved in Project's
activities, including Project staff, partners from decentralized and deconcentrated
institutions as well as service providers. More critically, the Project suffered from the
unanticipated weak performance on counterpart funding at critical stages of Project
implementation. The availability of counterpart financing improved over time, but
continued to represent a major risk to the achievement development outcome during the
first phase of the Project (See Appendix 1). Therefore, the overall economic and financial
risk to development outcome was moderate.

96.     The environmental risk to development outcome is judged to be moderate.
According to the environmental and social assessment, the project was rated as a category
`B' project. Eight safeguards policies were triggered: Environmental Assessment, Natural
Habitats, Forests, Pest Management, Physical Cultural Resources, Indigenous Peoples,
Involuntary Resettlement, and Project on International Waters. However, Project
activities more directly related to the Environment Assessment, Indigenous Peoples and
Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policies. The Project was successful in
mainstreaming social and environmental safeguards into local development planning and
subproject implementation. But the mainstreaming guidelines have not always been
systematically followed by local development actors (public and private) and Project
beneficiaries. The Project also prepared and implemented an Indigenous People
Development Plan (IPDP) and a Population Resettlement Framework during the first
phase. Overall, the compliance with all safeguard measures was moderately satisfactory.

97.     The social risk to development outcome is judged to be low. The risk that
beneficiaries may be unwilling to be involved in a participatory approach was appraised
as negligible. The project has drawn high satisfaction from beneficiaries and this risk has
remained negligible throughout the first phase of the Project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

98.     The design of the first phase of the Project started on strong footing by reviewing
lessons learned from similar operations, not only in Cameroon, but also across Africa.
Emphasis was placed on institutional development and capacity building, on the premise
that in order for decentralized local development to be successful, actors at every level
must be empowered with knowledge and resources to play their role in the development
process. As discussed in Section 2.1, the Project took into account lessons learned from
community development experiences across Africa. Given the demonstrated importance
of including participatory processes in local development planning and implementation,
beneficiary participation was guaranteed in the design of Project activities, and
reaffirmed in Project implementation manuals. Earlier lessons learned also revealed that
communities put a premium on the speed of subproject delivery, as well as on reduced
bureaucracies, and these were reflected in the streamlined procedures for local
development planning, subproject financing and realization. The Project stressed the need
for local ownership of development planning and execution, in recognition that
community empowerment and ownership of local development activities ensure better
governance of the process. However the Project design also tailored the responsibilities
assigned to local governments to their level of competence, as shown by the smaller size
of local development plans and subprojects, as compared to plans and subprojects
prepared and implemented at the communal level. In setting up subproject management
committees at the local level, the Project design also recognized the need to provide
adequate follow-up after the establishment of community action plans and subprojects.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

99.     Throughout the first phase of the Project, supervision was proactive. Emerging
issues were identified promptly, often before they had a chance to negatively impact
performance on the ground. At the beginning of Project implementation, the TTL was
based at World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC, and was supported by
experienced field-based staff. Decentralization of the TTL to the Cameroon country
office in FY07 further enhanced supervision quality. Through continuous field-based
dialogue as well as formal supervision missions carried out every six months, action
plans were drafted that effectively addressed identified issues. The team also benefitted
from regular support from experienced safeguards, financial management, and
procurement staff. The supervision strategy included random visits to subproject sites,
technical audits of realized infrastructure, forensic audits of accounts of beneficiaries, and
independent procurement reviews. In addition to the supervision activities of the World
Bank task team, the supervision quality of the Project was strengthened by the existing
mechanism for donor coordination in Cameroon. This mechanism provided a platform for
regular meetings among donors on rural decentralization. By joining forces, donors were


                                             29
more effective in drawing the attention of authorities and seeking real time solutions to
issues that were hindering or could potentially hinder the performance of the Project

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

100. Overall, the performance of the Bank is rated Satisfactory. The first phase of the
program was well designed and successfully implemented. Substantial results have been
achieved on the ground, and beneficiaries are satisfied with Project-supported
interventions. The Project has fully achieved all performance targets, and triggers for the
second phase have been met. With regard to many indicators, the Project has
outperformed its targets. The Project has contributed to decentralized local development
through its support to the elaboration of the development plans, through its financing of
capacity building activities, and by setting up a system for channeling resources to
implement priority activities in the development plans. The Project has now set the stage
to expand and consolidate these achievements during the subsequent phases, with the
ultimate goal of setting up a sustainable mechanism for channeling funds to communities
and communes for financing local development.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

101. By launching the Community Development Program in the face of challenging
institutional constraints (weak local capacity, high risks of poor governance) Cameroon
not only showed a strong commitment to local development, but took a calculated risk
regarding its success. The country was successful in forging a strong partnership with the
Bank and other donors in preparing and successfully managing this Project. The country
has provided critical support to the Provincial and National Project Units, and directed
deconcentrated sector ministries to work with decentralized local governments in the
planning and management of local development. In this respect, framework agreements
were signed between the Project's line ministry and various sector ministries at central
level. These conventions were implemented at local level through contracts between the
Project and representatives of the deconcentrated technical ministries. The execution of
these contracts, however, suffered in some instances from the inefficiencies of sectors'
technical staff, resulting in a poor quality of services provided. The problem was most
acute in the first two years of the Project, but the situation improved over time thanks to
corrective measures undertaken by the Project toward the end of the first phase. These
measures were reinforced during the second phase and consisted in: (i) providing
adequate means to technical ministries to ensure their mobility; (ii) establishing technical
standards for the construction of infrastructure; and (iii) defining unit infrastructure costs
per region. Following these measures, the quality of services provided by technical
ministries has substantially improved at the end of the first phase, and the situation is
expected to further improve in the second phase.


                                             30
102. The Project benefitted from strong mobilization of counterpart financing from the
Public Investment Budget and the French Bilateral Debt relief fund: more than 93% of
the estimated amounts (at appraisal) from these sources was mobilized through the
Project (see Annex 1 for details). However, Project outcomes would have been stronger
had the Government been able to mobilize and release pledged resources from the
Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) funds when needed. The mobilization of these
resources was delayed by bureaucratic procedures, which have slowed the functionality
of the special committee set up to manage the HIPC funds. The commitment and
disbursement levels of counterpart funds have been rated unsatisfactory three times
during the life of the Project. The non-availability of counterpart funding seriously
compromised implementation of many subprojects from approved development plans and
generated serious risks that threatened the reputation of the Project. Fortunately, the
functionality of the special HIPC committee substantially improved during the last two
years of the first phase, leading to the end-of-Project mobilization of one-third of the
amount estimated at appraisal. These improvements are expected to be further
consolidated during the second phase of the Program to which the Government
committed US$56 million in counterpart financing over the next four years. Overall, the
Program successfully met its objectives.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

103. The National and Regional Coordination Units have performed satisfactorily,
despite the fact that the coverage of the Project was expanded without any increase in
staffing. Effective results have been achieved, and Project beneficiaries are satisfied with
these achievements thanks to the high level of dedication of the Project staff. Given the
identified risks in channeling resources to communities and communes with limited
fiduciary capacities, the Provincial and National Project Units beefed up their oversight
roles. As a result, the Project successfully passed several audits (technical audit of
realized infrastructure, forensic financial management audit, independent procurement
reviews). Under the circumstances outlined above, this must be seen as a considerable
achievement. Nevertheless, Project management could have been stronger, particularly at
regional level, with regard to better monitoring and evaluation of the Project's
performance and outcome indicators as well greater level of fiduciary compliance,
including safeguards, procurement and financial management issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

104. Overall, the performance of the Borrower is rated Satisfactory. In committing to
this Program, the Government of Cameroon embarked on a process to strengthen
financial and technical capacities at the local level, as well as the regulatory framework
for local development, under very difficult conditions characterized by high fiduciary
risks and limited capacities at local level. Despite the difficult conditions, the country has
been successful in launching the process, setting up a financing mechanism to transfer
resources to decentralized territorial collectivities, reinforce capacities of local
development actors, and improve the regulatory framework for a more effective
management of local development. The Government put in place the necessary policy
framework, and the National and Provincial Project Units provided implementation
excellence and effective oversight, which led to successful outcomes for the Project.
Despite these achievements, the oversight function provided by the line ministry has been
limited, as was the coordination with technical ministries in the implementation of
subprojects. In addition, the insufficient and delays in counterpart funding posed some
reputational risks to the Project at the early stage of implementation. The National Project
Unit managed the lack of funding with creativity and flexibility, and this has helped
preserve the earlier faith that communities have put into the process of decentralized local
development.

6. Lessons Learned

105. In communities with limited technical capacities and weak control mechanisms,
financial decentralization should follow a phased approach, which fully capitalizes on
past experience. The first phase of the Project successfully tested a mechanism for
channeling resources to communes and communities. This success gave sufficient
confidence to the Government, which enacted a decision to transfer areas of competence
and associated resources for nine (9) ministries to the communes. Thus, the Ministry of
Education transferred the construction of classrooms and the management of basic
education to communes; the Ministry of Water and Energy transferred its competences in
terms of water point construction, including boreholes; and the Ministry for Women
Promotion transferred the management of the community centers (in charge of women
promotion) to communes. Transfer of other competences will follow in the nine pilot
ministries while other ministries are also in the process of identifying the areas of
competence to be transferred to communes. It will be important to closely monitor this
transfer of competences, and support the process through adequate capacity building.
This would avoid deterioration in service quality that could stem from overloading the
implementation capacities of communes.

106. One of the greatest achievements of the Project was to create a new environment
for local development planning, financing and management, leading to a greater
command of the local development process by communities, and to an improved delivery
of basic social services. The Project used a systematic approach to support decentralized



                                             32
territorial collectivities in addressing capacity, regulatory and financing constraints to
local development planning and management. These interventions are now introducing
transformative changes at local level, resulting in a greater control of local communities
over the process of setting local development priorities and managing these priorities.
Many communities now understand the power of this control, and are working to
strengthen their ability to increase own resources and scale up effective delivery of basic
social services to be benefit of their constituents.

107. Simplicity in the process of preparing local and communal development plans
would strengthen ownership and improve implementation efficiency. A shortcoming of
the Project was the lack of a mechanism to monitor communal development plans, as
well as the absence of expertise to provide operational content to the strategic elements of
the plans. The support provided through OALs was insufficient to ensure a greater level
of local ownership. OALs were contracted for a full year, during which they were
expected to support communities in carrying out several activities, including: (i)
elaborating community and communal development plans; (ii) preparing financing
requests for priority subprojects at community and communal levels; (iii) providing
training on themes such as management of local development, participatory monitoring,
and integration of social and environmental safeguards in local development planning;
and (iv) monitoring and follow-up support to communities. The planning process has
been simplified in the second phase of the project. Diagnostics of constraints and
opportunities will now be carried at local level without a need to prepare local
development plans. Local diagnostics will directly contribute to the communal
development plan, communes being the optimal territorial unit for decentralization
planning.

108. A systematic use of simplified guides and procedural manuals is critical for
quality insurance and greater fiduciary compliance at local level. The Project has
prepared, in collaboration with various partner groups (including donors, sector ministries
and service providers) a Practicing Manual for Preparing Local and Communal
Development Plans. This document served as the basis for the preparation of a local
development planning guide by the Ministry of Planning and Territorial Administration.
This guide has now been made official as the tool for local development planning and
budgeting. The guide ensures that the communal development plans are consistent with
the new poverty reduction framework document, that is, the Growth and Employment
Strategy Paper (DSCE). The Project also permitted the preparation of a Guide on
Simplified Procurement Procedures (for small amounts less than CFAF 30 million). This
procurement mechanism was tested in selected communes, and the feedbacks from that
test were reflected in the Guide. The Project is now working with the Cameroon Public
Procurement Regulation Agency (Agence de Regulation des Marchés Publics) at national
level to reflect aspects of the Guide in the national code, currently being revised.

109. Sectoral ministries have a critical role to play in ensuring quality control of
infrastructure realized through the local development process; situations of conflict of
interest are to be avoided. The capacity to ensure the technical quality of many
subproject proposals was weak at conception, which negatively affected the



                                            33
implementation time and led to non-respect of contractual agreements. The technical
design of subprojects was either the responsibility of OALs (which generally rely on
technical expertise of employees in the technical ministries) or the responsibility of
technical ministries (which sign conventions with PNDP). It was frequent to find
technical ministries as judge and parties, since they work on project design and also sit on
approval committees at the communal and provincial levels (CPAP/CPAC). The problem
was compounded by a general lack of expertise in civil and rural engineering. The
technical quality of realized infrastructure was also weak, because models were lacking
that could be replicated in the design. As a solution, the second phase of the Project will
restore check and balance of subproject design, approval and quality control by
contracting specialized services from consulting companies. In addition, model designs
are being prepared to provide guidance to service providers regarding technical
characteristics of realized infrastructure. Finally, it will be important that each project
provincial approbation committee has skilled professionals for an effective subproject
monitoring.

110. Financing communal agents is a smart investment for increasing communal
fiscal space and tax revenues. The Project piloted the recruitment of communal agents,
mainly accountants, who worked with communal authorities to improve local tax
collection and strengthen budget management at local level. An impact evaluation study
conducted shows that budget execution rate increased by 15 percent on average in 42
percent of surveyed communes. Similarly, in nearly 40 percent of surveyed communes
fiscal revenue increased by an average 49 percent. More than 41 percent of surveyed
communes attributed the improvements in communal fiscal receipts to the interventions
of the Project, particularly the recruitment of communal agents.

111. Using in-kind contributions of beneficiaries provides a greater flexibility in
financing local development; however, this mode of financing is also source of quality
issues and implementation difficulties. Throughout the implementation of the Project,
in-kind contributions of beneficiaries were difficult to mobilize in some communities, but
total contributions exceeded expectations (CFAF1,400 million against the CFAF 500
million expected). Problems noted with in-kind contributions included delays in
providing materials or labor, and the low quality of materials and labor provided. As a
result, alternative mechanisms are being explored to make beneficiary contributions more
flexible (for example, removal of the requirement that beneficiary contributions made in
kind or cash be provided in fixed proportions). Instead of requiring that beneficiaries
make mandatory labor contribution for the realization of subprojects, service providers
could be required to use local remunerated labor following a labor-intensive public work
scheme, without requiring required as part of in kind contributions.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
No written comments were received from the Borrower and from implementation
agencies. The draft ICR has benefitted from direct inputs from the National Project Unit
as well as from discussions at a stakeholders workshop. These inputs are included in the



                                            34
final report, which was revised to highlight the achievements of the Project in terms of
the process of supporting local development planning and management. The focus on
process (in addition to the detailed attention given to Project outcomes) was necessary
because the Project pioneered local development activities at the level of the smallest
territorial collectivities characterized by weak technical capacities and high risk of poor
governance. The final report reflects the agreement between the ICR team and the
national team (borrower and implementing agency) that there was much to be learned
from the process of providing support these collectivities as it was to be learned from
Project's outcomes.

                                Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1:

1.     Component 1 supports local development by channeling grants to rural communes
and to rural community-based organizations (CBOs) with legal status. The grants are
used to cofinance subprojects, which are proposed by the rural communes and CBOs and
aimed at addressing their priority needs. Cofinancing is done using three mechanisms: (i)
Community subprojects, (ii) Communal subprojects, and (iii) the Special Council Support
Fund for Mutual Assistance (FEICOM).

2.      Resources made available through the Project helped to improve the availability
of infrastructure relating to education, health, water and sanitation, transportation,
electricity and markets (Table 2.1). Some of these infrastructure subprojects were
realized in the most remote parts of Cameroon. The Project provided CFAF 14.617
billion in total subproject financing, of which CFAF 4.984 billion came from IDA. For
completed subprojects, these amounts are CFAF 7.880 billion and CFAF 2.167 billion for
PNDP and PAPNDP, respectively. Contributions from communities amounted to CFAF
1.600 billion (CFAF 0.916 billion for completed subproject), of which CFAF 0.506
billion was contributed to IDA projects (CFAF 0.227 billion for completed subprojects).

3.     The unit cost for realizing selected infrastructure subprojects was computed in the
November 2008 survey. The results show that the unit cost was CFAF 8.754 million for
boreholes and CFAF 4.616 million for wells; the unit cost for the construction of two
furnished classrooms was CFAF 13.537 million. While these costs compared favorably to
the costs of realization of similar infrastructure subprojects outside the Project (see
Annex 3 for details), there is room to further reduce these costs by grouping tenders.

Achievements of the Project by sector:

4.      Education. Based on the November 2008 survey, the school attendance rate in
beneficiary communes before PNDP was 92.4 percent; 3 years after PNDP, it had risen to
97.2 percent. Construction of schools closer to students reduced the distance traveled to
school, leading to higher frequentation rates observed after the project. In addition, the
promotion rate improved from 66.8 percent before the Project to nearly 79 percent after
the Project. Similarly, the passing rate for official exams also improved, from 61.2
percent before the Project to 87.7 percent after the Project. In the absence of other factors
known to influence educational achievement, it seems very likely that the improvements
resulted from Project-supported interventions. However, it must be recognized that they
may have been influenced as well by unknown factors unrelated to the Project.

   Most of the information in this section, particularly regarding the before-after changes in impact
indicators, are based on the PNDP annual survey on the performance and impacts of the Project (Rapport
de l'enquête annuelle de mesure des performances et impacts du PNDP), November 2008. Output
indicators are updated based on the latest available information. Overall impacts are likely to be larger than
those indicated here, since the Project closed one year after the November 2008's survey was carried out.

5.      Health. PNDP health interventions focused on the construction and equipment of
health centers. These actions contributed to improved health indicators of beneficiaries.
For example, 773 new births were assisted by medical professional, 11,649 children aged
0-5 were vaccinated, and 8,234 malaria cases were treated in the new facilities, according
to the November 2008 survey. These figures could have been close to zero without the
intervention by the Project. Several training opportunities were offered on sexually
transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases in the newly constructed
infrastructure. In addition, monthly consultations increased between the periods before
and after the Project, from an average of 253 to 279 (based on the November 2008's
survey). These improvements in the performance of the health system were achieved
despite the fact that some health centers built by the Project have not yet received
personnel from the health department.

6.      Water and sanitation. By April 2010, nearly 1,200 water points and sanitation
infrastructure have been constructed or rehabilitated under the Project. These
constructions now make it possible to offer improved access to clean water to more than
391,000 households that did not have access to safe water (formerly these households
were using water from rivers and other unprotected sites). In addition, PNDP contributed
to reduce congestion at water points. The average number of people per water point
decreased from nearly 860 to 382 between the pre-Project and post-Project periods.12
Regional disparities persist, but congestion has been reduced in each area in which the
Project intervened. In addition to facilitating access to water points, the Project has
improved perceptions of the prevalence of water borne diseases. While nearly 9 in 10
people (89 percent) believed water borne diseases were very frequent before the project,
only 1 in 10 (13 percent) believe that the diseases are very frequent after the project.
More than 6 in 10 people (63 percent) indicated that the diseases became less frequent,
and nearly one in four (24 percent) indicated that they had become rare after the project.
Another way of looking at the data is to say that 87 percent of the target population
indicated that water borne disease were infrequent after the project, compared to 11
percent in the period before the project. These positive impressions of the health impacts
of the Project were however offset by the impression among many in the target
population that infrastructure investments designed to improve water and sanitation
frequently suffered from technical shortcomings.

7.      Transportation. The Project has helped to make rural roads more usable by
relieving bottlenecks at critical points through the construction of small bridges and
drainage channels. Roads that had been abandoned for quite a long time have once again
been put back into use. The rehabilitation of rural roads has contributed to reduced
transportation costs. Average transportation costs fell from CFAF 235/km before road
improvement to CFAF 110/km after road improvement (November 2008 figures). These


12
  The most recent survey by the National Institute of Statistics shows similar trends, although the actual
numbers are different.



                                                     39
gains were subsequently reduced because of degradation due to heavy rain water; average
transportation costs increased slightly to CFAF 150/km two years after initial
rehabilitation. The positive impacts of the Project on the transportation sector can also be
seen in terms of increased daily traffic on rehabilitated roads; average daily loads,
according to the November 2008 survey results, increased from less than 2 to more than
11 vehicles between the before and after project periods.

8.      Rural electrification. In November 2008, the Project helped develop the capacity
to connect nearly 200,000 users to the power grid (this number exceeded 230,000 in April
2010). Based on the 2008 figures, less than 5 percent of the population was connected to
the grid at the time of the survey (9,936 users out of 200,000 potential users). Among
them, 3,294 directly subscribed for power usage with company, whereas the rest
benefitted from access to grid electricity through arrangements with neighbor subscribers.
At the time of the survey, 56 areas were electrified, and 92 income generating activities
have been initiated thanks to the availability of electric power. Despite these
achievements, extending the power grid to benefit local development is not an easy task,
due to numerous difficulties, including: (i) obtaining gasoline for generators; (ii) paying
the high and sometimes unaffordable connection fees required by the power company
(AES-SONEL); and (iii) low or even lack of interest on the part of AES-SONEL agents
to connect a rural network and to facilitate connection of users to the grid. As a result of
this lack of interest, some households have chosen to connect illegally to the grid, with
high risks to individuals and communities.

9.      Economic development infrastructure, including markets, ecotourism facilities,
communities centers, animal parks and storage facilities. PNDP contributed to the
construction of 12 markets, each of which features shelters, stores and slaughterhouses.
On average, the constructed markets bring in close to CFAF 200,000 in revenues that
strengthen self-financing capacities of communes. However many challenges still need to
be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of these markets. Ecotourism realizations
are very modest in this first phase of the program, which is demand-driven. The program
has financed the construction of two buildings with a total capacity of 6 beds in a
community near Campo-ma'an National Park. On average, the center receives 4 visitors
per month, generates 5 direct and indirect jobs, and contributes CFAF 50,000/month to
community revenues. In addition to financing markets and ecotourism facilities, the
Project also helped create 3 community centers with an average capacity of 380. On
average, each of these centers generates CFAF 63,125 per month. The Project financed
the construction of two animal parks; these parks contribute CFAF 123,500/month on
average to their respective communities. Finally, seven storage facilities were built under
PNDP; these have directly impacted food security by reducing seasonal variation in food
prices. Price variation between harvest and shortage periods was reduced to CFAF 8,000
per bag of millet after the Project, from the CFAF 18,000 price difference that was
observed before the Project.

10.    Sustainability of Project achievements. Much of the infrastructure financed by
the Project is functional, but not all. A few facilities have broken down, or their use has
been delayed. Most of the non-functional facilities are in the water and electricity sectors.



                                             40
In general, Project-financed infrastructure is well maintained, and most facilities (79
percent) have not yet been repaired. Beneficiary communities have assumed
responsibility for ensuring maintenance, a task that is facilitated by the existence of
infrastructure management committees. Out of the 193 realized subprojects in November
2008, 162 (84 percent) had functional management committees and clearly defined action
plans, held regular meetings, and made regularly monitored contributions.

Component 2:

11.     At the time of this assessment, PNDP provided technical and financial support in
the preparation of 135 communal development plans (PDC). Local elected official have
been heavily involved in the preparation of PDCs. In 72 percent of communes, more than
75 percent of elected officials have participated in the process, allowing a high level of
ownership. Also, two-third of communes declared having taken into account community
needs in their development plans. However, many communities have faced difficulties
implementing PDCs. Among the often cited difficulties are: (i) limited resources (more
than 80 percent of communes), (ii) non-functioning monitoring mechanism of the PDC
(26 percent of communes), (iii) weak ownership of the PDC (13 percent of communes),
and (iv) lack of expertise to implement the plan (4 percent of communes).

12.      Without external support, communes participate in local development through the
realization of subprojects (75 percent of communes), implementation of sensitization
campaigns of various topics (45 percent of communes), providing support to schools and
health centers (20 percent of communes), and paying the salaries of some health center
and school employees. Almost one quarter of communes have not invested their own
resources in the implementation of their PDC. Two-fifths of the participating communes
(40 percent) have invested between CFAF 1-10 million, nearly one-third (30 percent)
have invested more between CFAF 10-50 million, and a small but significant number (6
percent) have invested more than CFAF 50 million. With regard to coordination of
activities within the commune, 9 in 10 communes used individualized meetings with
concerned partners. However, some communes also use group meetings (44 percent) and
engage in regular activity reporting with partners.

13.     The Project has strengthened the capacity of local communities to undertake
procurement activities. Nine in ten communes have received procurement training, and
altogether 105 tenders have been awarded by November 2008 The quality of procurement
could still be improved in many cases, although 4 in 5 communes have not seen their
award recalled. About 15 percent of communes have had to recall one contract due to
procurement issues, and 4 percent have had to recall two contracts. Recalls have been due
to several reasons, including (i) mistakes in the preparation of the tender package (10
percent), (ii) non-respect of deadlines (10 percent), (iii) limited diffusions of tenders (20
percent), (iv) collusion (25 percent), and protests from subscribers (42 percent).




                                             41
Capacity building and trainings

14.     The Project has strengthened capacity at the community level by supporting
various types of training activities. In total, 321 trainings were provided to 2,261 elected
officials from communes in connection of the PNDP project by November 2008.
Approximately one-half of the trained elected officials (48 percent) received training in
communal planning, and more than one-third (36 percent) were trained in the functioning
of communal and community approval committees. Other themes covered in trainings
include procurement, particularly familiarization with the national procurement code (8
percent of the trained officials) and introduction to simplified procurement procedures (8
percent). The training program for communal official did however have some gaps. For
example, no elected official was trained in communal income or expenditures
management, or in the management of communal assets.

15.     Training was provided not only to senior communal officials; training was also
provided to 850 communal personnel. Approximately 28 percent of trained communal
personnel received training in the functioning of communal and community approval
committees, and one-quarter (25 percent) were trained in communal planning. Nearly 17
percent received training in national procurement procedures, and another 17 percent
were trained in simplified procurement procedures. A few communal personnel received
training in communal incomes or expenditures management (4 percent each), or in the
management of communal assets (6 percent).

16.     Another activity financed under PNDP was the recruitment of communal agents
with the mandate to help improve operational management of the communes. As of
November 2008, 28 communal agents have been recruited, but the operation was halted
due lack of HIPC resources. A survey carried out in the 28 communes where agents have
been placed showed positive perceptions of the contributions of communal agents to the
performance of beneficiary communes. It was noted that the presence of communal
agents contributed to: (i) increase the visibility of communal resources (81 percent of the
surveyed communes), (ii) significantly improve incomes (67 percent), (iii) improve the
quality of communal administrative and financial accounts (48 percent and 33 percent,
respectively), and (vi) improve the quality budget preparation and execution (29 percent
each). While these positive achievements may be partly attributed to the presence of
communal agents, other factors were identified as likely to have been important as well.
These include the intervention of other development partners, such as CEFAM and
PADDL (60 percent of cases), trainings given by PNDP (50 percent of the cases),
realization of economic development infrastructure subprojects, such as markets (44
percent of cases), and the implementation of the communal development plan with PNDP
support. The contribution of communal agents to improving the overall management
performance of communes has been directly linked to: (i) the creation of an efficient tax
collection system (74 percent of communes), (ii) increased control over the fiscal base
(57 percent), and (iii) the improved planning of activities (30 percent).

17.  Participation of the population in the budget process. According to the
November 2008 survey results, the vast majority of communes (93 percent) have made



                                            42
the communal budget available to the public. More than 95 percent of mayors have held
public budgetary sessions, and communal advisers have been required to bring the
information to their respective communities. However, knowledge of communal budgets
remains limited at the community level, and this partly justifies the why communities
expectations are out of line with capabilities of the communes.

18.    Improved capacity among community level officials and staff has had a positive
impact on budget execution. The budget execution rate increased by 15 percent on
average in 42 percent of surveyed communes. Similarly, in nearly 40 percent of surveyed
communes fiscal revenue increased by an average 49 percent. More than 41 percent of
surveyed communes attributed the improvements in communal fiscal receipts to the
interventions of PNDP.

Component 3:

19.     Activities financed under Component 3 were designed to reinforce the capacities
of actors to allow them to carry out technical and managerial responsibilities associated
with local development. Beneficiaries included communes, communities, local
development agents (OAL), and the PNDP coordination unit. At communal and
community level, capacity building focused on themes such as development planning,
participatory monitoring, communal and community management, maintenance of
infrastructure financed through the Project, and integration of social and environmental
safeguards into local development actions. Local development agents (OAL) benefitted
from capacity building activities emphasizing methodological and organizational aspects
of local development planning and monitoring. PNDP coordination teams also benefitted
from seminar trainings, as well as specific trainings on the needs basis.

20.     Efforts to improve communal planning processes have had mixed results. Among
the 67 communes surveyed in November 2008, only one in five has elaborated
operational plans based on the communal development plans. The remaining 80 percent
of communes have attributed the inexistence of operational plans to several causes,
including ignorance about the importance of operational plans (26 percent) and lack of
expertise (15 percent). For the majority (59 percent) of these communes, however, the
development plans are in the process of being drafted. One-half of the communes
surveyed (51 percent) have a mechanism for monitoring their development plans.

21.     At the level of local communities and by November 2008, PNDP financed the
preparation of 1,347 local development plans13 in approximately 80 communes (taking
into account the new districting). Twenty percent of the communities have been surveyed
(268 communities). In 81 percent of the surveyed communities, men have been well
represented in the process for elaborating local development plans. Youth have been well
represented in 76 percent of the communes, and women in 64 percent of the surveyed


13
  As discussed elsewhere in this document, the actual number in April 2010 was 3,096 local development
plans.



                                                  43
communes. The general perception is that the elite14were not present in the process, as
less than 20 percent of communes indicated the elite were sufficiently visible during the
elaboration of local development plans.

22.      The preparation of local development plans has been continuous throughout the
life of the Project. The age of PDLs varies from less than a year to more than three years.
About half of the PDLs are between one and two years. Nearly 10 percent are less than a
year, 25 percent between two and three years and 15 percent more than 3 years.

23.      Regarding the community knowledge about the stages of the planning process,
this was assessed through publically held focus groups at the community level. The
community level is also known as a participatory planning unit in which one or more
villages are represented. The "opinion" of the community is the dominant opinion
expressed by the majority of people in the community. Based on the November 2008
assessment results, the majority of people in 66 percent of surveyed communities were
aware of the preparation stage; the majority of people in 92 percent of the surveyed
communities recalled the identification stage; 72 percent were familiar with the planning
stage; and 86 percent knew about the creation of coordination committee. The majority of
people in the surveyed communities also had good knowledge of the priorities contained
in their development plans, as the majority of people were able to cite at least three
priorities from their plan in more than 95 percent of surveyed communities.

24.     The survey found that the monitoring system of local development plans was
functioning satisfactorily in more than 4 out of 5 communities (nearly 82 percent).
However, the turnover of the members of the consultation committees has been limited in
committees that have been in place for more than two years. Only 27 committees have
experienced changes in membership, and in most cases, the renewal process has been
initiated not by the committee itself but rather by the community. An overwhelming
majority of communities (94 percent) have not yet developed operational plans based on
their development plans. This was due to either the lack of knowledge of communities
regarding the importance of these plans, their lack of expertise in developing these plans,
or the relative newness of these plans (less than a year).

25.     The implementation of local development plans has been limited, with only 5
percent of the plans having been implemented at least halfway (as assessed in November
2008). Implementation is at a very early stage for 53 percent of the plans, and has not yet
started for 42 percent of the plans. Communities have invested their own resources in the
implementation of local plans, but the amounts invested have been relatively modest.
Only 27 percent of surveyed communities have invested more than one million CFAF in
the implementation of their plans. Community resources are being kept in savings
accounts, which have been established by more than 69 percent of communities.

26.    Trainings offered by PNDP have reinforced the capacities of communities to
contract and monitor construction of infrastructure (37 percent), improved community-
level knowledge of procurement procedures (35 percent), strengthened planning
14
     See Footnote No. 3.


                                            44
techniques (21 percent) and enhanced community management of resources (18 percent).
Communities have a high appreciation of PNDP's role. Two in three communities
surveyed (66 percent) indicated that the Project has been responsive to their needs, while
nearly 31 percent said that the project responds only partially to their needs. Only three
percent of the communities surveyed indicated that the Project did not respond to their
needs.

27.    The three most important contributions of the Project, according to communities,
have been strengthening social cohesion (48 percent), supporting capacity building (45
percent), and improving access to basic social services (7 percent). While communities
have high appreciation of the achievements of the Project, they also disapprove the
financing delays and the low ceiling of funds for community subprojects (CFAF 15
million).

Service providers (OAL)
28.     OALs are local service providers contracted by PNDP to provide technical
support to communes and their communities in local development planning and
management. The Project financed trainings for OALs to increase their capacities in
delivering services to local communities. A sample of 31 OALs was interviewed in
November 2008 about the types and quality of training they have received from PNDP.
Almost all of these OALs (97 percent) indicated that they are satisfied or very satisfied
with the training received. Themes covered in the training include planning (100 percent
of surveyed OALs), social and environmental safeguards (74 percent), procurement (48
percent), communal management (13 percent), and use of GPS (10 percent). Three in
four OALs have taken advantage of their contract with PNDP to obtain additional
services contracts outside PNDP. However, service providers also indicated that they
faced many problems regarding their contracts with PNDP. Chief concerns include: (i)
delays and red tapes regarding payments (97 percent of OALs), (ii) non-respect of
contractual agreements (48 percent), (iii) difficult collaboration with mayors (36 percent);
(iv) slow validation of documents, including local and communal development plans and
payment requests (19 percent); and (v) limited financial capacities of OALs (16 percent).

Assessment of implementation time efficiency:

29.     In general, subproject implementation by communes and communities took longer
than expected. On average, 5.7 months elapsed between the signature of the grant
convention with PNDP and the receipt of funds by communities and communes--far
longer than the one month deemed acceptable. The delays resulted essentially from
difficulties in mobilizing sufficient funding to finance conventions, particularly from the
HIPC multilateral fund as well as the French debt cancellation fund (C2D).
Implementation delays for C2D-funded projects averaged more than one year (13
months). Implementation delays for IDA-funded subprojects averaged slightly less than 5
months. As a mitigating measure, instruction was given to the regional coordination unit
to sign conventions only when funding was available.




                                            45
30.     Despite predictions that 3 months would elapse on average between publication of
the public tender and signature of contracts with service provider, the actual measured lag
was 3.2 and 6.4 months, respectively, for community and communal subprojects between
2004 and 2008. Over the life of the Project, communities became more efficient in timely
execution of subjects. Up until 2006, nearly 86 percent of subprojects were not completed
on time, but by 2008, this number had fallen to around 50 percent. Electricity subprojects
experienced particularly long implementation delays, partly because of coordination
problems between the Project, the Ministry of Energy, and the electricity monopoly.
Delays in project implementation were also caused by other factors, including: (i) poor
quality of technical design of subprojects; (ii) delays in receipt of in-kind contributions
from communities; (iii) lack of capacity among local service providers; and (iv) lack of
rigor in project execution, with shared responsibility of beneficiaries, technical ministries
and PNDP.

31.     Delays also occurred between the signature of contracts and the beginning of
work. Despite predictions that this would take 2 weeks, the lag averaged 1 month for
community subprojects and 1.5 months for communal subprojects. Finally, completion of
subprojects also took longer than the expected 3 months, averaging 7.2 and 9.7 months,
respectively, for community and communal subprojects.

                              Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Ex-post economic and financial analysis was carried out to determine the returns
to Project-financed investments. The analysis focused on the financial returns generated
by one type of productive subprojects (construction of rural markets) and on the
economic returns generated by three types of social subprojects (construction of water
supply systems, elementary school buildings, and rural roads). These four major
categories of subproject accounted for 33.4% of all subprojects finalized by September
2009, representing 41.1% of total subproject costs.

2.      Costs included in the analysis comprised direct costs (initial investment costs plus
community contributions) and indirect costs associated with community facilitation,
supervision and program management. The valuation of benefits considered both
monetary benefits (e.g., decrease in transport costs) and quantifiable non-monetary
benefits to which an economic value could be assigned (e.g., value of time savings).

3.      Economic rates of return (ERRs) were calculated for the sample of subprojects
using the following assumptions: (i) for every subproject, the full benefit is realized in
Year 1 and in every year thereafter throughout lifetime of the project; (ii) a discount rate
of 8 percent is appropriate for computing the Net Present Value (NPV) and evaluating the
Internal Rate of Return (IRR); and (iii) the expected benefit stream ceases immediately
after the subproject lifetime is complete.

4.      Water supply. The benefits generated by Project-financed investments to improve
access to reliable water supplies (mainly construction of wells and boreholes) include the
time saving (from reduced distance to water sources) and the reduced health spending
(diarrheal diseases). For wells, the average ERR was estimated to be 40.9 percent. In
selected cases, the ERR for wells was found to be much higher (121.5 percent in Awae in
the Central Region, 209.4 percent in the rural council of Yaounde II, and 262.4 percent
in Château Bloc 2, 3 and 5 in Center Region). For boreholes, the average ERR was
estimated to be 43 percent. The estimated ERRs are relatively insensitive to a 20 percent
increase in costs and a 20 percent decrease in benefits.

5.      Education. The benefits generated by Project-financed construction of elementary
schools result from the increase in the enrolment rate of children between 6 and 12 years
of age. The benefits brought by the completion of basic education in Cameroon are based
on estimated returns to basic education. These benefits are measured by salary
differentials between workers who have and workers who have not completed basic
education. Nguetse (2009) estimated these returns in Cameroon to be at 20 percent higher
in the non-agricultural sector and 28 percent higher within the agricultural sector.15
Applied to the annual earnings of workers (as a proxy of income), total earnings over 20
years after completing elementary school were estimated. It appears that, investments in
the education sector are economically beneficial. The average ERR was estimated to be

                                                          47
16.2 percent. The payback time was found to be four years, and the overall NPV was
estimated to exceed CFAF 400 million. All of these results are however sensitive to a 20
percent decrease in benefits.

6.      Transport. The benefits generated by Project-financed investments to construct
new roads or improve existing road include the time savings associated with traveling on
improved roads and the reduced transportation costs. The average ERR to investments in
rural roads was estimated to be 48 percent. The payback time for transport subprojects
was found to be less than two years, and the NPV was estimated to exceed CFAF 240
million. These results are relatively insensitive to a 20 percent cost escalation or a 20
percent decrease in benefits.

7.      Development infrastructure. The construction of rural markets is the key
development infrastructure financed by the Project. The construction of rural market is
associated with increased volume of activities in areas such as, transport, restaurant,
commerce, mechanics, cloth making, and hairdressing. The economic and financial
analysis of the Project-financed rural markets is based on data from the commune of
Ngoulemakong in the South Region, and from the communes of Koutaba and Ndemdeng
in the West Region. The financial rate of return (FRR) on investments in rural markets
construction was estimated at 16.4 percent. The payback time was found to be about six
years, and the financial NPV was estimated to exceed 80 million CFAF. All these
financials returns are sensitive to a 20 percent decrease in benefits. ERRs were also
estimated for rural market construction activities. The overall ERR was estimated to be
80.1 percent. This result is corroborated by a positive and significant NPV (more than
CFAF 800 million) and by an estimated payback time of less than two years. These
results are sensitive to a 20 percent cost escalation or 20 percent decrease in benefits.

8.      These findings based on survey data and made using conservative assumptions
suggest that on the whole, the PAPDNP subprojects generated attractive returns., Despite
some variability between different categories of subprojects (ERRs ranging from 78.1
percent for rural market construction to 16.2 percent for investments in the education
sector), the average ERR for Project-financed subprojects was estimated to be 45.6
percent This result is corroborated by a positive and significant estimated NPV (more
than CFAF 300 million).

1.      A Beneficiary Survey was carried out in May 2007 by the Alternative Consulting
Group.16 The Beneficiary Survey was completed by an independent Impact Assessment
study carried out in November 2009 by the National Statistics Office (INS).17 This
section summarizes the results of the two evaluation exercises. Greater emphasis is given
to the results of the Impact Assessment, which provides more up-to-date information on
the achievements of the Project.

Conclusions of the 2007 Beneficiary Survey

2.      The goal of the Beneficiary Survey was to understand the perceptions and
determine the degree of satisfaction of different groups of program beneficiaries
regarding the support received through the Project and of the quality of the subprojects
undertaken. The Beneficiary Survey was based on a survey of beneficiaries, and it
focused on the relevance of the Project, the implementation arrangements, and the
substantive changes that were attributable to the Project. The Beneficiary Survey used a
qualitative and participatory approach to survey four groups of beneficiaries: (i) direct
beneficiaries, comprising communes and base community organizations; (ii) local
support agents (AOL) and service providers working on subprojects; and (iii) sector
ministries which have signed conventions with the Ministère de la Planification, de la
Programmation du Développement et de l'Aménagement du Territoire (MINPLADAT).

3.      The results of the Beneficiary Survey indicate that 70 percent of those surveyed
were satisfied with the achievements of the Project. They found the Project interventions
to have been relevant because of the alignment between these interventions and priority
needs of the population. About 62 percent of the respondents found the implementation
arrangements of the Project to have been efficient, and an equally important number (63
percent) judged the methodological approach to have been appropriate and sufficiently
innovative. In addition, even though the Beneficiary Survey was carried out in 2007, only
two-and-one-half years into implementation, 82 percent of beneficiaries estimated that
the Project had not only helped to improve the living conditions of the population, but
also that it paid special attention to the needs and concerns of the most vulnerable groups
(86 percent). Fully 80 percent of the respondents thought that the participatory local
development approach promoted by the Project was taking root at local level,
empowering local communities to play a more prominent role in their own development
planning and implementation. Community leaders (mayors) furthermore expressed the
opinion that the Project's interventions had helped to improve the management of local
municipalities.

4.       The Beneficiary Survey generated several key conclusions about the impacts of
the Project: (i) the majority of beneficiary communes and communities positively
appreciate the Project's support to strengthening local ownership and improving local
governance; (ii) social cohesion has been strengthened, because the Project facilitated the
creation of fora for effective consultation between development actors at local, communal
and inter-communal levels; (iii) local capacity has been strengthened to define local and
territorial development priorities and to mobilize resources for implementing these
priorities; and (iv) access to basic social goods and services has been improved,
particularly safe drinking water, education, health, rural electrification, rural transport,
and rural market facilities.

5.      Despite the positive overall assessment, the respondents to the Beneficiary Survey
identified some weaknesses, which if addressed, could significantly improve the
implementation and impacts of the Project. These include: (i) the procedure for
disbursing funds at local level was deemed slow and cumbersome; (ii) required financial
contributions from beneficiaries were excessively high given the limited capacity of
most beneficiaries to mobilize resources; (iii) the supervision and quality control of
realized subprojects was insufficient; (iv) income-generating activities should not have
been excluded from the list of eligible subprojects; and (v) the conventions signed
between MINPLADAT and the sector ministries responsible for selected implementation
tasks were not always observed.

Summary of PNDP Program Impact Assessment

Methodology

6.       The Impact Assessment carried out by INS was intended to generate information
on the outcomes of the Project four years after inception. Emphasis was put on assessing
the cost effectiveness of Project-financed investments and on measuring Project-induced
changes in quality-of-life indicators. The Project was assessed with respect to five
criteria: (i) relevance to beneficiary communities; (ii) effectiveness in meeting predefined
goals; (iii) cost efficiency; (iv) consistency with local development plans; and (v)
sustainability.

7.      The Impact Assessment covered five regions (Adamawa, Center, North, West,
and South) in which PAPNDP has been implemented since 2004. The focus was on
community and communal subprojects. A sample of subprojects was selected from the
population of all 237 subprojects financed under PAPNDP in 155 communes. The sample
was selected using a three-stage, weighted sampling procedure. The first stage ensured
selection in representative proportions of community and communal subprojects. The
second stage involved selection in representative proportions of subprojects from each of
the five regions. The third stage involved selection in representative proportions of
subprojects from each of the four sectors (summary statistics for the sample appear in
Table 5.1).

mayors, village chiefs, beneficiaries, and from the representatives of the consultative and
management committees.

Main results

9.      Subproject implementation. During the first phase, PAPNDP interventions
focused mainly on delivering social goods and services. During this phase, 599
subprojects were implemented (including Pygmy Peoples Development Plan), including
252 supported with IDA funding. IDA-financed subprojects were divided into the
community subprojects (16.3 percent) and communal subprojects (83.7 percent). These
subprojects were distributed among the following sectors: water and sanitation (40
percent), education (27 percent), electricity (13 percent), health (7 percent), transport (6
percent), development infrastructure (6 percent), and women's community centers (1
percent). Approximately 46 percent of these subprojects have been completed and handed
over to beneficiaries, 21 percent are being finalized, and contracts have been signed for
the remaining 33 percent, which are awaiting implementation. The number and type of
completed subprojects varies by region and as a function of the expressed needs of the
beneficiary communities. Demand for classroom construction or rehabilitation was
particularly strong in the Adamawa, West and North regions (around 75 percent of
subproject). Water and sanitation subprojects were more solicited in the Centre and South
regions.

10.     Relevance. The assessment of Project relevance consisted in assessing the
alignment between the interventions financed by the Project and the expectations, needs
or priorities of the targeted population. PNDP subprojects were found to be very relevant,
because in 88 percent of the cases, they were selected through a dialogue at local level. In
the remaining 12 percent of the cases, subprojects were proposed by the local authorities
based on the priorities identified in the Local Development Plan (PDL). However,
beneficiaries think that the choice of subprojects was generally constrained by the limited
amount of funding granted by PNDP and the even more limited amount of the



                                                 54
beneficiaries' own contributions. Funding constraints may have contributed to the choice
of subprojects that were not necessary the first priority for communities.

11.     Effectiveness. Project effectiveness was evaluated by probing the target
population's knowledge of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and eliciting
their views on whether the PDOs had been successfully achieved. Nearly all of those
surveyed (97 percent) indicated having good knowledge of the PDOs, which included: (i)
improving health coverage; (ii) reducing the distance to the nearest health center and
hence the transport cost; (iii) constructing functioning classrooms and distributing
textbooks and desks; (iv) improving the living conditions of people through improved
access to electricity; (v) increasing municipal revenues; and (vi) fighting poverty and
improving the living conditions of the population. Respondents were generally in
agreement that all of these PDOs had been achieved.

12.    Efficiency. Project efficiency was evaluated by measuring the link between the
use of resources and expected results. Satisfying expectations with the least possible
resources is a sign of project efficiency. The Impact Assessment showed that the
construction of social infrastructure under PNDP was less expensive than the
construction of similar infrastructure under the Public Investment Budget (BIP). For
example, every equipped classroom constructed under PNDP cost 6.7 million CFAF on
average, while the same equipped classroom cost 9.6 million CFAF on average under the
BIP. The difference (CFAF 2.9 million per classroom built and equipped) amounts to a
30 percent cost saving (Table 5.2).

13.     Sustainability. Project sustainability depends on the quality of the work done and
the provisions in place for the maintenance of completed infrastructure. Maintenance
naturally leads to additional costs and concerns, such as outages prevention, protection
against destruction, and repairs in case of failure or malfunction. Completed subprojects
financed by PNDP are managed by a committee comprising beneficiaries. The Impact

Assessment revealed that nearly 3 out of 4 (73 percent) of the management committees
are functioning efficiently percent.

14.      Consistency with development plans. The Impact Assessment confirmed that
Project-financed activities have been highly consistent with local development plans. All
of the sampled projects were found to have been part of the local or communal
development plan. These subprojects have been realized either for the first time in the
commune/community, or as a complement to existing but insufficient infrastructure
facilities.

Selected Impacts

15.    Education Sector. About 27 percent of all subprojects financed by the Project
were in the education sector. Of these, 50 percent have been completed. Three-quarters of
all education-related subprojects are concentrated in the North, West and Adamawa
regions percent. In these three regions, average school enrolment has increased by 45
percent in the schools that have benefitted from Project interventions., although this rate
has varied by region (86 percent increase in the West, 57 percent in the South, 40 percent
in the North and less than 10 percent in other regions) (Table 5.3). The Impact
Assessment concluded that 78 percent of the increased enrolment can be attributed to
PNDP interventions.

16.     Health sector. Approximately 7 percent of subprojects financed by the Project
are in the health sector. Of these, 50 percent have been completed. No health sector
subprojects have been completed in the Centre region. The Impact Assessment
determined that the average number of consultations reached about 1,800 visits per year
in 2009. Construction of additional health facilities has helped to reduce the average
distance between households and the nearest health centre from 5.6 Km to 4.8 Km (a 14
percent reduction). The average consultation cost has fallen from CFAF 857 to CFAF
789 (an 8 percent reduction). Both of these achievements have significantly reduced the
cost of health care to local communities.

17.     Water and sanitation sector. About 40 percent of all Project-financed
subprojects were in the water and sanitation sector percent. These subprojects are
concentrated in the South and Centre regions. The Impact Assessment determined that
the number of persons per water point decreased as a result of Project interventions,
falling from 916 to 644 (30 percent reduction). The average distance to the nearest water
point decreased from 5.7 Km to 4.7 Km (18 percent reduction). Improved access to safe
and reliable water supplies has had a pronounced impact on health statistics: the
percentage of people suffering from diarrheal diseases among the target population
decreased by 2.2 percentage points, falling from 3.8 percent to 1.6 percent (Table 5.5).

18.     Electricity sector. About 13 percent of all Project-financed subprojects were in
the electricity sector percent. These subprojects are highly concentrated in the Centre
region, where nearly two-third of these subprojects are located. Electrification has
promoted other activities that significantly improve the living conditions of the target
population. The percentage of households with electricity in rural areas has increased by
4.3 percentage points, from 50.8 percent to 55.1 percent (Table 5.6).

19.     Transport sector. The Impact Assessment established that the target populations
are generally satisfied with PNDP achievements in the transport sector. This satisfaction
is explained by improvements in the movement of people and goods in areas served by
the Project. Approximately 87 percent of respondents found that travel time is now
shorter than before the intervention.

20.    Development infrastructure.         The Impact Assessment concluded that
investments in rural infrastructure have brought significant benefits to the target
population. PNDP interventions, specifically the construction of rural market places, have
helped to increase the number of traders in rural markets, reduce unemployment, and
reduce the number of accidents previously registered in roadside markets in rural areas.

21.     Capacity building of communes. The Impact Assessment determined that
Project-supported capacity building activities have contributed to a remarkable
improvement in budget management, project contracting, and procurement. More than 79
percent of municipal leaders indicated that thanks to the training they received under the
Project, they now have independent control over the management of their development
plans. The Impact Assessment also concluded that revenues have increased in
approximately 77 percent of municipalities, and fiscal management was improved in 68
percent of beneficiary communes.

A stakeholder workshop was help on May 6, 2010, in Yaoundé, Cameroon, to discuss the
initial findings of the ICR. The workshop agreed with the main conclusions of the ICR,
particularly regarding the achievements of the Project, and the lessons learned from its
implementation. The workshop provided additional information and evidence, which were
included in the final report. As discussed in Section 7a, the stakeholder workshop also
recommended discussing process indicators in the final report. Project stakeholders
considered the successful support to local development planning, implementation, and
monitoring as a great achievement that deserves substantial attention in the ICR. The final
report presents both process and output/outcome indicators.

 RAPPORT D'ACHEVEMENT DE LA PREMIERE PHASE DU PROGRAMME
          NATIONAL DE DEVELOPPEMENT PARTICIPATIF

   1. Evaluation de l'objectif du projet, de son montage et de sa mise en oeuvre

L'objectif de développement du PNDP-I était d'appuyer le Gouvernement du Cameroun
dans la mise en place d'un mécanisme efficace de transfert des ressources aux
collectivités territoriales décentralisées afin qu'elles puissent faire face aux nouvelles
missions de développement assignées à leurs localités respectives. Pour atteindre cet
objectif, la première phase du Programme a été consacrée à : (i) l'initiation des
Collectivités Territoriales Décentralisées (CTD) à la planification des actions de
développement dans leurs localités ; (ii) la réception et la gestion des fonds pour la
réalisation des investissements visant à faciliter l'accès aux services sociaux de base ainsi
que ; (iii) l'amélioration du cadre légal et réglementaire pour le développement rural
décentralisé.

Au regard du niveau actuel de pauvreté en milieu rural, des besoins en services sociaux
de base et des avancées significatives réalisées dans le processus de décentralisation,
l'objectif du PNDP est resté pertinent. Ce constat a par ailleurs été confirmé par les
résultats d'un audit technique, d'une évaluation par les bénéficiaires, ainsi que les
conclusions d'une évaluation d'impact conduite par l'Institut National de la Statistique
(INS). L'objectif de la deuxième phase sera dont le même que celui de la première phase,
avec un accent sur la fourniture des services sociaux de base ainsi qu'une plus grande
responsabilisation des communes.

Le montage du Projet axé sur quatre composantes y compris la coordination, a permis
de : (i) tester à travers la première composante, un mécanisme de transfert des fonds
publics aux communes à travers le financement des microprojets ; (ii) appuyer les
réformes institutionnelles nécessaires à la mise en oeuvre du processus de
décentralisation ; (iii) positionner le plan de développement communal comme un outil
important de la programmation des investissements au niveau local.

La mise en place des organes de délibération au sein desquels participent la plupart des
acteurs, notamment les représentants des services déconcentrés des ministères sectoriels,
les bénéficiaires et la société civile a permis de coordonner et harmoniser les actions du
Programme avec les différentes stratégies sectorielles. Cette synergie d'action a ainsi
limité les risques de duplication et de gaspillage des ressources. Le transfert des fonctions
de ces organes aux conseils municipaux élargis aux sectoriels constitue une avancée
considérable dans le transfert des compétences aux CTD, facteur déterminant de la mise
en oeuvre du processus de décentralisation.

   2. Evaluation des résultats à la lumière des objectifs définis

Au cours de la première phase, le Programme a couvert 155 communes et touché plus
d'un million des bénéficiaires directs. Les performances du PNDP se présentent ainsi
qu'il suit :

Composante 1 : « APPUI FINANCIER AU DEVELOPPEMENT DES COMMUNES
RURALES » financement de 689 microprojets (dont 366 sur fonds IDA) desquels 341
sont achevés et fonctionnels (dont 156 sur fonds IDA). Les principaux ouvrages générés
par les microprojets achevés sont 247 salles de classe équipées (103 sur fonds IDA) et
6 611 tables-bancs (2 855 sur fonds IDA) et 16 146 manuels (6000 sur fonds IDA), 467
points d'eau aménagés (190 sur fonds IDA), 32 centres de santé construits et équipés (20
sur fonds IDA), 160 km de piste rurale aménagés (61 Km sur fonds IDA), 237 boutiques
construites (3 sur fonds IDA), 805 comptoirs de marchés (0 sur fonds IDA), 42 hangars et
8 magasins de stockage construits (2 sur fonds IDA).

Composante 2 : «APPUI AUX COMMUNES » S'agissant de l'appui à la
décentralisation, des études commanditées par le PNDP ont débouché sur des textes dont
l'adoption et la promulgation ont permis d'étoffer le cadre législatif et réglementaire
existant. Il s'agit de la loi n° 2009/019 du 15 décembre 2009 sur la fiscalité locale, de la
loi n°2009/011 du 10 juillet 2009 portant régime financier des Collectivités Territoriales
Décentralisées (CTD) ainsi que l'Arrêté n°00136/A/MINATD/DCTD du 24 août 2009
rendant exécutoire les tableaux-types des emplois communaux.

Composante 3 : « RENFORCEMENT DES CAPACITES DES ACTEURS » En ce qui
concerne le renforcement des capacités, sur les 155 communes de la première phase, 125
ont bénéficié d'une formation. Le processus de planification a donné lieu à 3096 Plans de
Développement Local (PDL) et 135 Plans de Développement Communal (PDC).

Composante 4 : « COORDINATION, GESTION, SUIVI EVALUATION ET
COMMUNICATION »
Les principaux résultats concernent les audits techniques et financiers, les évaluations
d'impact sur les bénéficiaires, les activités de renforcement des capacités du personnel,
les missions de suivi, supervision et les charges de fonctionnement.

Le tableau ci-dessous présente la répartition des fonds de la première phase par
composante et par bailleurs.

Les principaux impacts des réalisations physiques du PNDP tels qu'ils ressortent dans le
rapport de l'évaluation indépendante réalisée par l'Institut National de la Statistique en
2009 se déclinent secteur par secteur ainsi qu'il suit :

Impact économique et social :
Une étude d'impact menée par l'Institut National de la Statistique en octobre 2009 a
permis d'évaluer le PNDP en termes d'amélioration du cadre de vie des populations
bénéficiaires et d'évaluer l'efficacité et l'efficience du programme.

L'étude a couvert les cinq régions (Adamaoua, Centre, Nord, Ouest et Sud) dans
lesquelles le programme a été opérationnel depuis le début de la première phase en 2004.
La base de sondage a été constituée de l'ensemble des 237 microprojets achevés qui ont
été financés par le PNDP dans les 155 communes ayant bénéficié de l'appui du PNDP. .
Le plan de sondage retenu a été un plan stratifié à deux degrés et fondé sur deux critères.
Le premier était le type de projet où un taux de sondage de 55% a été appliqué au prorata
du type de projet, le second critère est la commune, ici le taux de sondage est de 48%.
Pendant la phase de collecte, il a été procédé à la collecte des données administratives et
également à des entretiens de groupe de personnes (focus group). Ces groupes de
personnes étaient constitués du maire et/ou ses conseillers ; du représentant du comité de
concertation ; du représentant du comité de gestion ; du représentant du chef de village ;
des représentants des bénéficiaires des microprojets et des bénéficiaires des formations
organisées par le PNDP. Les fiches de collecte ont été saisies au moyen d'une interface
conviviale et sécurisée créée à l'aide du logiciel approprié (CSPRO).. Les données saisies
ont fait l'objet d'un apurement afin de garantir de leur bonne qualité. Les analyses issues
des données collectées ont permis de mettre en exergue les impacts suivants :

  i.   Secteur éducation. Dans les zones couvertes par le PNDP, le taux moyen
       d'augmentation des effectifs dans les établissements a atteint 45%. Ce taux assez
       élevé cache certaines disparités. En effet, il est de 40% dans la région du Nord,
       86% dans la région de l'Ouest, 57% dans la région du Sud et moins de 10% dans
       les autres régions. Cette augmentation serait due à l'engouement des élèves,
       stimulés par la présence des salles de classe équipées des tables-bancs beaucoup
       plus confortables. Le taux net global de scolarisation des enfants de 6 à 11 ans est
       passé de 75,6% à 77,3% dans l'ensemble des régions couvertes. Par ailleurs, la


                                             64
       distance moyenne séparant le ménage de l'école primaire publique la plus proche
       a connu une diminution considérable passant de 2 km à 1,7 km en moyenne ;
ii.    Secteur santé. Dans les centres construits par le PNDP, le nombre mensuel moyen
       de consultation en 2009 a atteint 149, soit environ 1800 consultations par an. La
       distance moyenne du ménage au Centre de Santé le plus proche est passé de 5,6
       km à 4,8 km et les coûts liés à la consultation sont également passés de 857 F
       CFA à 789 F CFA en moyenne dans l'ensemble des régions. Par ailleurs, le
       nombre annuel d'accouchements assistés est évalué à 658 ;
iii.   Secteur hydraulique. Dans les communautés bénéficiaires de ces services du
       PNDP, le nombre de personnes par point d'eau est passé de 916 avant son
       intervention à 644 après. Le nombre de personnes souffrant de maladies d'origine
       hydrique est passé de 3,8 à 1,6. La distance moyenne du ménage au point d'eau le
       plus proche est passée de 5,7 km à 4,7 km et l'augmentation de la proportion des
       ménages ayant accès à de l'eau potable passant de 20,6% à 25% au cours de cette
       même période ;
iv.    Secteur électricité. L'électrification de plusieurs localités a permis la création
       d'activités génératrices de revenus (AGR) pouvant améliorer significativement les
       conditions de vie des populations. En effet, dans les régions du Centre et de
       l'Ouest, respectivement 50% et 47,4% des AGR ont été développées suite à
       l'électrification de certaines de leurs localités. Les principales activités concernées
       sont : la mise en place des boutiques d'alimentation, des moulins à écraser, des
       cybers café et la création des centres multifonctionnels. Par contre, les principales
       activités dans la région du Nord concernent les salons de coiffure et les boutiques
       d'alimentation. Ces activités constituent environ 33,3% de l'ensemble des AGR
       dans cette région ;
 v.    Secteur transport. Les populations sont généralement satisfaites des réalisations
       du PNDP dans le secteur routier. Cette satisfaction trouve sa justification du fait
       que les déplacements des personnes et des biens se sont considérablement
       améliorés. En effet, 57% des personnes interrogées estiment que les coûts de
       transport ont baissé après l'aménagement des tronçons. Il y a lieu de préciser ici
       que la variation du coût de transport ne dépend pas uniquement de l'état des
       routes mais aussi de la variation des prix du carburant, et dont des cours
       mondiaux de produits pétroliers. L'évolution des coûts de transport doit donc être
       appréciée sur la base des prix constants des produits pétroliers. Au sujet de la
       durée des déplacements, 87% des personnes interrogées estime que la durée des
       trajets sur les pistes réhabilitées par le PNDP a sensiblement diminué depuis
       l'intervention du Programme, avec pour conséquence directe un gain considérable
       en temps. L'impact de l'intervention du PNDP dans ce secteur est également
       perceptible au niveau de l'augmentation du trafic sur les tronçons aménagés,
       comme l'affirme 71% des bénéficiaires de ces actions du Programme ;
vi.    Secteur infrastructures de développement économique. L'intervention du PNDP a
       contribué à une augmentation significative du nombre de commerçants exploitant
       les marchés d'où une réduction du chômage ainsi que des cas d'accidents jadis
       enregistrés sur les bordures de routes en raison de l'amélioration des conditions de
       travail des commerçants. La construction, voire l'extension des marchés a rendu
       plus facile l'écoulement et l'approvisionnement en produits vivriers. Pour les



                                             65
        marchés en fonctionnement, les recettes communales connaissent un
        accroissement non négligeable. Les magasins ont contribué à mettre les vivres à
        l'abri des intempéries. Grâce à certains microprojets du PNDP, l'on note une
        réduction de l'exode rural et la réduction des flux migratoires en direction des
        pays frontaliers notamment le Nigéria.
vii.    Gestion du budget communal. Environ 77% des communes soit 117, ont vu leurs
        recettes propres s'améliorer d'au moins 50% et dans 68% de cas, soit 104
        communes, le taux d'exécution du budget des communes dans lesquels le PNDP a
        intervenu s'est amélioré de 50%.
viii.   Rentabilité économique. De l'analyse de l'efficience et de l'efficacité du
        Programme, il ressort que l'ensemble des microprojets analysés sont
        économiquement bénéfiques. Sur la base d'un taux d'actualisation de 8%, en
        référence au plafond de rémunération des dépôts à terme dans les Banques
        commerciales au Cameroun, le taux interne de rendement économique moyen est
        de 45,6% variant de 80,1% pour les investissements sur des marchés à 16,2%
        pour les investissements dans l'éducation. Ce résultat correspond à une valeur
        actuelle nette moyenne de plus 286 millions de FCFA.

    3. Enseignements tirés de la première phase Programme.

Actions à conforter

   i.   Amélioration du cadre législatif et réglementaire de la décentralisation. Au delà
        de la préparation et de la mise en oeuvre des plans de développement,
        l'enrichissement continu du cadre législatif et réglementaire de la décentralisation
        constitue un levier important dans l'amélioration de la performance des
        communes. Il en est de même de l'institutionnalisation du plan de développement
        pour la programmation et la préparation des budgets d'investissement.
  ii.   Transfert des ressources aux communes. La première phase du programme, phase
        d'apprentissage, a mis en évidence la capacité des communes avec l'appui
        d'opérateurs de proximité, à élaborer une vision de développement de leur espace
        territorial, à recevoir et à gérer dans la transparence, des transferts directs de
        ressources. Cependant, compte tenu de leurs capacités encore limitées, il est
        indispensable que ce mécanisme soit accompagné d'un renforcement des
        capacités et d'un dispositif approprié de suivi-contrôle.
 iii.   Arrangements institutionnels du Plan de Développement des Peuples Pygmées
        (PDPP). Il existe dans la zone du Projet, des organismes spécialisés d'appui
        conseil ayant fait montre de leurs capacités à contribuer de manière significative à
        faciliter l'accès des peuples pygmées aux services sociaux de base. Dans un souci
        de subsidiarité et de complémentarité, il y a donc nécessité d'en tirer un meilleur
        profit par l'établissement de partenariats dynamiques dans leurs domaines de
        compétences respectives pour plus de visibilité des actions sur le terrain. A cet
        effet, la plateforme mise en place dans les communes pilotes et qui se positionne
        comme outil de mise en cohérence des interventions devrait être généralisée et
        renforcée.




                                            66
Points d'amélioration à apporter

   i.   Collaboration CTD/Administration. La première phase du PNDP a permis de
        mettre en exergue la complexité des rapports entre les CTD et l'Administration et
        les autres acteurs concernés par les enjeux du développement local à l'aube de la
        décentralisation. Tous ces acteurs devraient être formés à une meilleure
        compréhension et gestion de la complexité du processus de décentralisation (cadre
        législatif et réglementaire) en rapport avec les mutations sociales attendues.
 ii.    Territorialité du développement communal : difficulté de gérer plusieurs plans de
        développement local. Les plans de développement peuvent constituer un outil
        important à condition qu'ils prennent en compte les opportunités et contraintes de
        l'environnement des communes, notamment les aspects liés à l'intercommunalité.
        En conséquence, il est important que le processus de préparation des plans soit
        recentré dans une vision prospective de développement global de l'espace
        territorial de la commune.
 iii.   Qualité des microprojets. La qualité de réalisation des microprojets dépend dans
        une large mesure de la qualité des études de faisabilité technique et
        environnementale, du niveau de transparence dans la procédure de passation des
        marchés et de la qualité de la gestion des contrats de prestation (suivi/contrôle,
        audits périodiques). Il est donc fortement recommandé que ces aspects soient
        soigneusement intégrés parmi les critères qui conditionnent le financement de tout
        microprojet au cours de la deuxième phase.
 iv.    Mécanisme de collecte et de remontée des données. Un système de suivi-
        évaluation reposant sur les unités d'exécution du projet et articulé entre différents
        niveaux (communal et communautaire d'une part et communal et régional d'autre
        part), conjugué avec des capacités appropriées au niveau local, constitue un
        facteur déterminant pour assurer la fiabilité des données collectées.

    4. Implication des partenaires techniques et financiers

Les partenaires techniques et financiers, notamment la Banque mondiale, ont apporté un
appui dans la mise en oeuvre du projet. L'équipe chargée du projet à la Banque mondiale
a été tout au long de cette première phase d'une assistance technique considérable. Elle a
participé auprès du Gouvernement, à l'amélioration du cadre institutionnel de la
décentralisation qui s'est enrichi d'un arsenal législatif et réglementaire depuis le
démarrage du programme avec la loi n°2004/017 du 22 juillet 2004, portant Orientation
Générale de la Décentralisation, la loi 2004/018 du 22 juillet 2004, fixant les règles
applicables aux Régions et aux communes, et la loi n°2009/011 du 10 juillet 2009,
portant régime financier des Collectivités Territoriales Décentralisées (CTD). Ces textes
ont été complétés par des Décrets d'application et des Arrêtés notamment le décret
portant création du Conseil National sur la Décentralisation en janvier 2008, le décret
portant création du Comité Interministériel des Services Locaux, le décret portant
création et fonctionnement des communautés urbaines, le décret n°2009/0248 du 05 août
2009, précisant les modalités d'évaluation et de répartition de la Dotation Générale de la
Décentralisation, le décret n° 2008/0752/PM du 24 avril 2008, précisant les modalités
d'organisation et de fonctionnement des organes délibérants et exécutifs de la Commune,



                                             67
de la Communauté Urbaine et du Syndicat des Communes, l'arrêté
n°00136/A/MINATD/DCTD du 24 août 2009, rendant exécutoire les tableaux types des
emplois communaux et la circulaire n°02305/MINATD/DCTD du 19 octobre 2009,
relative à l'élaboration et à l'exécution des budgets communaux 2010. Par ailleurs,
l'équipe chargée du projet a, par son implication, contribué efficacement à l'amélioration
du taux de décaissement du crédit N°3875-CM qui a atteint un chiffre de 97% à la date de
clôture.

Le bureau local de l'AFD en collaboration avec le STADE-C2D a facilité la gestion des
fonds C2D en contribuant à l'harmonisation du manuel des procédures de la Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) sur ces fonds avec celui du PNDP. Cette
harmonisation a permis le décaissement de 100 % des ressources allouées au Programme
au titre du premier C2D.

   5. Orientation pour la deuxième phase

   ·   L'approche méthodologique

Sur la base des leçons tirées de la mise en oeuvre du PNDP lors de la première phase, le
mode opératoire du programme a été modifié pour conforter les points fort et les
améliorer les points faibles ainsi relevés.

Pendant la deuxième phase le processus de planification gagnerait à être allégé au niveau
communautaire : dérouler les outils du diagnostic avec identification des atouts et
opportunités ainsi que les problèmes prioritaires sans élaboration d'un PDL (document).
Ce travail de diagnostic au niveau communautaire devrait être capitalisé pour contribuer à
l'élaboration du PDC. Les communautés garderont leurs priorités de développement ainsi
que leurs atouts. Une structure de coordination des actions de développement (CC)
pourrait si le besoin s'en fait sentir, être mise en place pour le suivi de la mise en oeuvre.

Pour remédier aux difficultés liées à la qualité des microprojets, il serait opportun que
pendant la deuxième phase, le Programme s'attache les services des bureaux d'études qui
seront chargés du montage technique des dossiers et du contrôle contradictoire. Par
ailleurs, les plans types et les spécifications techniques des principaux ouvrages doivent
être élaborés pour servir de repères pour le montant des avant-projets détaillés. De plus,
ile Programme devrait doter chaque Cellule régionale, d'unun cadre dont le profil permet
d'apprécier la qualité des ouvrages réalisés. Enfin,, un accent particulier devra être mis
sur la formation de tous les cadres chargés du suivi de l'exécution des microprojets sur
les éléments essentiels leur permettant d'apprécier la qualité des ouvrages réalisés.

    · Contribution des bénéficiaires
Pendant la 1ère phase, L'apport en nature des bénéficiaires n'a pas toujours été disponible
à temps et a parfois été de qualité approximative. Pour pallier à cette situation, il serait
intéressant à la deuxième phase de fixer le montant de l'apport du bénéficiaire sans
imposer la proportion en espèce ou en nature. L'apport en nature n'intégrera plus la main
d'oeuvre mais il sera exigé aux prestataires de privilégier la méthode HIMO avec


                                             68
utilisation de la main d'oeuvre locale et rémunérée. L'apport en nature qui comporte
essentiellement le matériel sera estimé en fonction des matériaux disponibles pendant le
montage de la requête. Le reste de l'apport devant être donné en espèce.

    · Condition de mobilisation de l'allocation
Le PNDP ne pourra déclencher le déblocage de l'allocation, à moins que (1) un accord de
subvention lié à la préparation des plans de développement communaux et les
subventions des microprojets (catégories (2) et (3), respectivement) ait été signé entre les
parties prenantes et que (2) la commune qui concernée par l'allocation pour la
préparation de ces plans de développement communaux ait en son sein un comptable
désigné par le ministère des finances.
