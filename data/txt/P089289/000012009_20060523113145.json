the\n            sustainability of land (SLM), and natural resources\n            management under the Community Development Program, by\n            complementing local and national benefits, with key global\n            benefits, such as conservation of globally significant\n            biodiversity, reduction of carbon emissions by improving\n            land management activities and rehabilitating degraded\n            lands, as well as increasing carbon sequestration.\n            Furthermore, the project will stabilize riparian zones, and\n            reduce sediment discharges into critical trans-boundary\n            water bodies, such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of Guinea. The\n            project has three main components: 1) enhanced integration\n            of SLM into local development; 2) institutional support for\n            SLM; and, 3) project management, coordination, monitoring\n            and evaluation, and communication. The first component will\n            co-finance SLM micro-projects, at the request of\n            beneficiaries (communities and communes), within the\n            project's intervention zone. The second component will\n            reinforce the institutional framework at the national level,\n            and strengthen the capacities of beneficiaries to better\n            integrate SLM best practices in their local development\n            plans. It also seeks to improve the mechanism of land\n            conflict resolution, among farmers, foresters, herders,\n            other natural resource users, and traditional chiefs.\n            Finally, the third component will ensure appropriate project\n            management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and communication."}, "docdt": "2006-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
