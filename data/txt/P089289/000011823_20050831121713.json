The indigenous people development plan\n            (IPDP) identified a numbers of risks the indigenous peoples\n            (IPs) could face as result of the implementation of the\n            project, if left unattended. Such risks could include\n            further marginalization; fewer government services; loss of\n            control over land traditionally use by IPs as a source of\n            livelihood and basis for their cultural and social system;\n            less access to education, health services and clean water,\n            and less income from agricultural production. The IPDP makes\n            specific recommendations which have been agreed with the\n            Cameroonian authorities designated to mitigate these risks,\n            as follows : equal legal opportunities to IPs such as the\n            provision of ID cards; establishment of community forests or\n            traditional hunting zones; participation in the elaboration\n            of community development plans and development of local\n            action plans; equal opportunities such as special programs\n            for pygmees to benefit from job creation opportunities;\n            inclusion of IPs in various PNDP committees; provision of\n            training on intercultural communication to civil servants\n            working with pygmy populations; equal opportunities such as\n            assisting Baka and Kola associations in capacity building to\n            preserve the loss of traditional knowledge, culture and\n            livelihood patterns; foster the creation of forums for\n            communication and exchange between pygmies and other ethnic\n            groups; and finally, in an effort to implement these\n            recommendations, hire a consultant to carryout a study that\n            will facilitate the participation of IPs in the\n            socio-economic development activities generated by the project"}, "docdt": "2005-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
