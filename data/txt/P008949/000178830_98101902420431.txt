THIRD TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)
Guarantor:           Republic of Turkey
Amount:              US$163.0 million (including capitalized front-end fee).
Terms:               Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Description:         The Project would support the construction of about 1500
Km of 380-kV transmission lines to accommodate new
generating capacity from plants being commissioned between
1983 and 1986. The Project would also include a technical
assistance component to support: (a) improved
organization and operation of municipal distribution of
electricity, including preparation of feasibility studies
for future investments in distribution; (b) preparation
and implementation of a program of load research, tariff
analysis and formulation, demand management, and energy
conservation; (c) manpower development and training; and
(d) development and implementation of a management
information system.
Project Benefits
and Risks:           The Project is an important part of TEK's system
development program for electricity supply. Construction
of the transmission lines would allow full utilization of
large generation plants now under construction. Benefits
of the technical assistance component would include
strengthening of TEK as an institution, increased
efficiency for the power subsector through improved
operation of distribution activities, the expansion of the
current training program, an improved tariff structure and
introduction of demand management. A physical project
risk would be the possibility that adverse climate and
terrain conditions would delay construction during the
winter. Adequate construction technology is available and
would be used. The possible risk of inadequate local
currency funds delaying the implementation of the project
would be taken account of by the proposed establishment of
a TL account.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
FOR A THIRD TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) with the guarantee of the Republic
of Turkey for the equivalent of US$163.0 million (including the capitalized
front-end fee) to help finance transmission facilities, technical assistance
and training needs required to meet TEK's system growth. The loan would have
a term of 17 years including 4 years' grace at the standard variable interest
rate. Cofinancing of $8.8 million has been arranged from the European
Settlements Fund and a bilateral source.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       A report entitled "Turkey:  Policies and Prospects for Growth"
(No. 2657a-TU) and the Postscript thereto, were distributed to the Executive
Directors in December 1979 and March 1980, respectively. Updating of economic
prospects has since been undertaken through the continuing work on structural
adjustment loans (SALs) to Turkey and several special economic missions. The
report of a mission to evaluate the investment program and entitled "Turkey:
Public Sector Investment Review" (No. 3472-TU) was distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1981.  The report of a mission to review
Turkey's industrialization and trade strategy entitled "Turkey:
Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU), was distributed to the
Executive Directors in March 1982. The report of a mission to review energy
sector policies entitled "Turkey: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector"
(No. 3877-TU) was distributed to the Executive Directors in March 1983.
Missions to review recent economic developments and analyse the medium-term
prospects, and to study the agricultural sector and the financial system
visited Turkey at various times in 1982. Their findings are reflected in this
section.
3.       Turkey is about as big as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 46 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1540.
The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural
land), and about 45 percent live in urban centres. Although population growth
is below the median for middle-income countries (2.2 percent per annum), and
despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as substantial
emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the Middle
1/ Parts I & II are substantially the same as Parts I & II of the President's
Report on the Igdir-Aksu-Eregli-Ercis Irrigation Project (P-3581-TU) dated
May 17, 1983.

East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an unemployment
rate currently about 16 percent. There is, however, little or no absolute
poverty, although income distribution is relatively skewed. There are also
considerable regional differences and large rural-urban disparities. Recent
data indicate a probable worsening in income distribution, especially of wage
and salary earners, and a sharp real decline in the minimum wage.  Educational
enrollments have expanded greatly but the rate of adul;t literacy remains
relative low (60 percent in 1975).
Development Strategy Prior to 1980
4.       Turkish development strategy during the 1960s and 1970s aimed at
rapid growth through high rates of investment with the main emphasis on
industrialization. 'Import substitution was favored over exports, with State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs) playing an important role iin the industrialization
strategy as well as iin regional development. These policies, supported by
agricultural expansion and growing workers' remittances, helped to bring about
a favorable growth record throughout the First and Second Plan periods
(1963-72). A continuation of these policies in the fac:e of the various
exogenous shocks of the 1970s, including the rise in world oil prices and
stagflation in the OECD economies, helped to maintain growth well into the
1970s, but finally proved unsustainable.
5.       To maintain its growth momentum in the Third Plan (1973-77), Turkey
financed a large part of its investment and import requirements through
reserve decumulation and heavy external borrowing, particularly short-term.
The rapid GNP growth, averaging around 7.7 percent per year in 1973-76, came
to an abrupt halt in mid-1977 as the massive external debt burden led to a
sharp deterioration in creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports and
disruptions in industrial production with a rise in urban unemployment; GNP
growth slowed down sharply to 4.0 percent in 1977 and to a negative figure in
1979. At the same time, domestic inflation accelerated from 24 percent in
1977 to an average of 64 percent in 1979.
6.       By the end of 1979, the rate of domestic inflation had reached over
100 percent and had become an issue of critical importance. Although
international price increases and domestic cost-push factors influenced the
inflationary process, a substantial monetary expansion was the main cause.
The monetary imbalances originated mainly from the Government's budget
deficits and the huge financing requirements of the SEEs. Political and
social unrest aggravated the economic difficulties. It was in these
exceptional circumstances that the January 1980 reform measures were adopted.
The Government's New Policy Priorities and Actions
7.       The Government's program for stabilization and restructuring of the
Turkish economy was initiated in January 1980 and is now entering its fourth
year. The program has involved policy measures which have effects both in the
short- and medium-term. In an effort to stabilize the crisis situation, a
series of urgent measures were introduced to restrict domestic demand. These
measures included enforcing tight credit ceilings by the Central Bank,
reducing the budget deficit through expenditure control and increased
taxation, and restraining growth of wages and salaries. Over the medium-term,
the program is designed to restore a better balance between the public and



- 3 -
private sectors of the economy and achieve sustainable growth. The key
elements of this program are: the adoption of a realistic and flexible
exchange rate and incentives to encourage producers to export; deregulation of
interest rates to reflect market conditions and encourage private savings; the
strengthening of public finances through tax reform; measures to improve
institutional efficiency in key sectors; a rationalization of the public
investment program; and a reform of the SEEs designed to reduc:_ their burden
on the budget and improve their efficiency.
8.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
three structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes affecting all
facets of the Turkish economy. It entails substantial changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which take time and
face considerable resistance. In view of the severity of the crisis, and the
urgent need to bring down inflation and stabilize the balance of payments as
quickly as possible, the Government accepted the need for a temporary
sacrifice of growth and social objectives. Drastic structural changes were
made in the operation of the exchange rate regime, the tax system, interest
rate policy, export strategy, the SEE sector and public investment policy.
9.       The implementation of the program is being carried out by a military
regime which assumed power in September 1980 following a period of sustained
unrest, terrorism and deterioration in the parliamentary process.  This
Government, like previous military regimes in 1960-61 and 1971-73, has
emphasized its commitment to restore civilian rule. A Consultative Assembly
was set up to draft a new constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed in a
nationwide referendum in November 1982. New election and party laws are
expected to be promulgated soon, and parliamentary elections are scheduled for
November 1983.
Effects of the Structural Adjustment Process -- 1980-83
10.      The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the program
launched in 1980, and in many cases actual performance has met or exceeded the
Government's own targets. Real GNP, after falling for two consecutive years,
expanded by 4.2 percent in 1981 and 4.4 percent in 1982. Growth has been
mainly export-led, with less than one quarter of the growth in 1982 due to
domestic demand. Demand for consumption increased by 3 percent while fixed
investment grew at a modest 4.1 percent (both in real terms) in 1982, and
depletion of inventories helped to expand supply. Public investment grew
significantly slower than private investment, thus reversing the trend of
previous years. However, unemployment continued to grow in 1981 and 1982, as
employment opportunities did not increase fast enough to absorb the expansion
of the labor force.
11.      Through a combination of fiscal, monetary and income policies, the
Government has been remarkably successful in reducing the rate of inflation.
After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average rate of increase in
the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981 and around 25 percent
in 1982, which was the program target. However, the degree of credit
restraint needed to reduce inflation this rapidly has had a marked effect on
liquidity in the economy and has helped to maintain interest rates at high
real levels.



12.      Commercial bank interest rates which were deregulated in July 1980
have increased substantially; with inflation gradually coming down, they are
now markedly positive in real terms. As a result, total bank deposits
increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981 this trend accelerated,
with total deposits growing by 104 percent and time deposits by 263 percent.
Growth in deposits slowed somewhat in 1982, and the bankruptcy in late June
1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shoolc depositor confidence and
was followed by a shift of funds into the larger banks. While the Government
has averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector, additional actions to
reform and strengt:hen the financial sector as a whole are urgently required.
The Government is at present preparing a new banking law which aims to
strengthen the equity position and management of banks.
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. The current real interest
rate for non-preferential credits is about 28 percent. These high interest
rates, together with the limited availability of credit, have led to
considerable liquidity problems for the private business sector, particularly
for businesses supplying the domestic market. The banks have taken steps to
lower rates on deposits and the Government has reduced the tax on interest
received from banks with the aim of reducing interest on credit. But the
liquidity problem of the private business sector is compounded by
under-capitalization which had been encouraged by easy access to cheap bank
credit in the past. Tax changes and other measures are under preparation to
encourage the corporate sector to raise paid-up capital to levels commensurate
with those in other countries.
14.      There has been encouraging progress in the fiscal area.  The budget
deficit was reduced from 4.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 1.2 percent in 1982.
Government expenditures as a percentage of GNP declined from 22.6 percent in
1981 to 21.5 percent in 1982, but the impact on the deficit was offset by a
slower growth in revenues than programmed. The SEE accounts showed a marked
improvement, with net profits climbing to 0.5 percent of GNP in 1982 from 0.1
percent in 1981 and their financing requirements falLing from 8.8 percent of
GNP in 1981 to 5.7 percent in 1982. Moreover, supplementary appropriations
were cancelled. Public sector borrowing requirements dropped from a level of
6.5 percent of GNP in 1981 to 5.2 percent in 1982.
15.      On the exlternal account, the flexible exchange rate policy under
which the Turkish lira has been adjusted daily since May 1981, together with
the new export-oriented policies, led to an unprecedented export growth in
1981 when exports amounted to $4.7 billion, or 63 percent higher in dollar
terms than the 1980 level.  Increases were concentrated in manufactured goods
which experienced a rise of nearly 120 percent; product groups with the
largest increases included textiles, clothing, cement, iron/steel, and
non-electrical equipment, with the Middle East becoming an increasingly
important market. Exports in 1982 reached $5.75 billion, about 22 percent
increase over 1981, despite a significant decline in export prices,
particularly prices of agricultural products. As in the previous year,
manufactured exports were the major source of expansion, as exporters
continued to make inroads into the Middle East.



-5-
16.      A new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange is income earned
from construction contracts (with a gross value of around $11 billion in 1982)
in the Middle East and North African countries. These activities are also
expected to add to the normal flow of workers' remittances, which remained
strong throughout 1981, although declining slightly in 1982, reflecting the
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis European currencies as well as the
impact of thc recession in Western Europe.
17.      Imports declined in dollar terms by 2.3 percent in 1982 compared to
1981, due mainly to weaker prices of oil and raw material imports, a stronger
US dollar, a reduction in stocks and the elimination of a risk premium
previously paid by Turkish importers. As a result of these developments, the
current account balance showed a significant improvement in 1981 and 1982,
with the deficit reduced from 5.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 3.5 percent in
1981 and about 1.7 percent in 1982, well below program targets. By the end of
1981, outstanding external disbursed debt amounted to W17.5 billion equivalent
or about 30 percent of GNP. Multilateral agencies and official bilateral
sources accounted for about two-thirds of the total outstanding. Of the
total, only 12 percent constituted short-term debt, a marked contrast to the
position in 1978 when short-term debt accounted for half of total outstanding
debt.
18.      A modest pickup of growth (4.8 percent) is anticipated in 1983
concurrent with a slowdown of inflation (to about 20 percent), based on a
slight recovery in private investment and higher capacity utilization rates.
The current account deficit is expected to decrease to $870 million in 1983
from $1 billion in 1982, representing a slight fall in relation to GNP
(1.5 percent as against 1.7 percent). These results are based on a 17 percent
projected growth in exports, a marginal improvement in workers' remittances,
(both predicated on a revival of growth in the industrial economies) and a
13 percent growth in imports (required by the upturn in domestic demand).
Medium-term Prospects
19.      It is expected that the draft Fifth Five Year Development Plan
(1984-1988) will be completed by mid-1983. Projections prepared by the recent
Economic Mission indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization
program until 1985, which can be followed by a growth strategy aiming at about
6-6.5 percent per annum GDP growth consistent with a manageable balance of
payments.
20.      Two basic assumptions on the sustainability of export growth and on
fiscal discipline have guided the projections. The continued growth of
exports is based on the view that conditions that have made possible the
1981-82 upsurge are not temporary. Specifically, it assumes continuation of a
flexible exchange rate policy, export incentives and import liberalization.
Secondly, it also assumes that the monetary and fiscal policy restraints will
not be relaxed to a point that will revive inflation, thus disrupting the
basic shift in development strategy.
21.      The projections of key economic variables for the period 1983-1990
are presented in Table below. Merchandise exports are projected to continue
to grow at 9.5 percent in real terms into the late 1980s on the basis of a
continuation of present policies for export promotion. Such a scenario would
also require improvement in the pace of import liberalization in order to
reduce the profit bias against exports.

22.       Merchandise imports are projected to grow slowly in real terms
through 1984 and then to pick up from 7-8 percent to an average of a little
over 9 percent for the 1985-90 period in line with the growth of demand.
23.       The current account balance, under these assumptions, would show a
decreasing deficit for 1982-85 as stabilization curtails imports while
encouraging exports. As growth sets in, the trend would be reversed for the
1985-90 period, and Turkey's current account deficit would increase again.
The terminal year 1990 would show a deficit of $1.8 billion as compared to a
1985 projected deficit of $485 million.
24.       The projected capital account would remain manageable throughout the
projection period given the need to restrain the growth of debt and maintain a
reasonable debt service ratio. This would permit Turkey to meet the
amortization and interest payments arising from the $9.6 billion of debts
rescheduled between 1978-82 and maintain an exchange reserve equivalent to two
months' imports.
25.       Consistent with this scenario, the projections indicate a GDP growth
of 5 percent per annum for 1982-85 (stabilization period), and a higher figure
of 6.1 percent per annum for 1985-90 (growth period). Achievement of these
growth rates will be necessarily dependent on the growth of the productive
sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing. The achievement of sectoral
growth will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination to
render the public sector more efficient and to create a more favorable
investment climate for the private sector.



- 7 -
26.      The medium-term scenario presented above assumes an increasingly
important role for private sector investment in line with the policy of
rationalizing public sector investment in the manufacturing sector.
Accordingly, private investment is expected to grow at an average annual rate
of 9.6 percent during 1982-85 and 11 percent during 1985-90. As a corollary,
the growth of public investment will slow down from a high of 7.8 percent per
annum in real terms during 1980-82 to a more moderate 5.0 perc-nt during
1982-85 and eventually to 4.4 percent per annum for 1985-90. This is
consistent with the framework of achieving the medium-term goal of an equal
balance in the ratio of private and public fixed investment by 1990.
Creditworthiness
27.      At the end of 1978, Turkey faced an overwhelming debt burden of
$7.5 billion in short-term debt and $6.8 billion of medium- and long-term
debt. Turkey was faced with service payment obligations (mostly on short-term
debt) of $5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly three times the value of
merchandise exports in 1977. Following the resolution of the 1978 debt
crisis, Turkey pursued a very conservative policy of external borrowing which
was restricted almost entirely to long-term borrowing. Much of this was
arranged through the OECD Consortium for Turkey and was extended on
concessional terms. Also, between 1978-1980 Turkey rescheduled some
$9.6 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of rescheduling
arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors. Approximately
$6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in convertible Turkish
lira deposits and bankers credits and $l.2 billion of non-guaranteed suppliers
credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or partially converted into
Turkish lira obligations. As a result of the these measures, short-term debt
as a percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to
12.5 percent in 1981. Inflows were mostly from official sources -- major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the total
debt outstanding at end-1981, 87 percent constituted medium- and long-term
debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt outstanding and
disbursed as a percent of GDP is projected to rise from 28 percent in 1981 to
31 percent in 1982 and then fall to 29 percent in 1985 and 26 percent in 1990.
28.      Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the coming
years. Accordingly, the debt service ratio is projected to increase to
24.2 percent in 1982 from about 14 percent in 1981 as a result of a large
repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier OECD agreements.
Projections beyond 1982 show a decline of the debt service ratio to
19.4 percent in 1984, an increase to 20.6 percent in 1985 (again on account of
repayments of rescheduled debt), and then a fall to 18.1 percent in 1990. The
debt burden should remain manageable, provided current policies are
successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained, and Turkey continues
to receive further international support from private and official donors.
29.      On all aspects of economic analysis, the IMF and the Bank have
coordinated closely with each other, and Turkey continues to be in good
standing with the IMF. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1,250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. Under the arrangement, Turkey has thus far made
ten purchases totalling SDR 1,060 million. The present standby is to expire
on June 17, 1983 and a one-year extension is being sought by the Turkish
authorities.



-8-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
30.      Through May 31, 1983 the Bank/IDA have lenlr $3,939 million to Turkey,
through 71 projec:ts.  Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of funds lent,
industry and DFCs for 34 percent, power for 13 percent, structural adjustment
and program loans for 26 percent, and urban developrnent, transportation,
education and tourism for the remaining 9 percent.  As of March 31, 1983, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $236 million, of which about $82 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1983, with notes on the status
of ongoing projects.
31.      The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crisis from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures, and continuing constraints on the availability of local funds.
The implementation of private sector projects has generally been more
satisfactory. Recently, however, the high interest rates for working capital
combined with depressed domestic demand and reluctance of investors to take
the foreign exchange risk, have led to slow commitments under DFC lending.
Disbursements average 53 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding structural
adjustment loans) as compared to 55 percent for Tunisia and 45 percent for
Morocco.
32.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of redirecting the Turkish economy towards a development path placing more
reliance on market forces and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy.
These objectives also include increasing domestic savings and reorienting a
restrained public investment program to reflect the Government's priorities of
completing ongoing projects faster and emphasizing quick-yielding new
investments with positive balance of payments impact. The main vehicle for
the Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program.
33.      Agriculture, industry, transportation and energy will continue to be
the key sectors for project lending. In agriculture, projects are expected to
emphasize irrigation, credit, and reform of the extension and research
services. In industry (including DFCs), the emphasis will be on the promotion
of exports, employment, and increasing operational efficiency.  Energy
projects underway are for power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite
resources, as well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration.
Future projects will emphasize both the oil/gas and coal/lignite sub-sectors.
In addition, transportation projects will focus on developing the
infrastructure to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of
operations. Projects for industrial training, urban and regional development
and public utilities may supplement these efforts.



- 9 -
34.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural and financial
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development plan, employment, SEEs, transportation and the
agro-industrial subsector.
35.      This loan and a structural adjustment loan are the third and fourth
operations of this fiscal year to be presented to the Executive Directors at
the same time.  A loan for the exploration for gas in Thrace is expected to be
presented to the Board on June 28, 1983. Other projects being processed
include: technical assistance to SEEs, industrial training, agricultural
extension, gas utilization and rehabilitation of the paper industry.
36.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was
9 percent in 1981, and is expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
13 percent in 1981 to about 14 percent in 1985.
37.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, meat processing, motor bicycle engines, truck
manufacture, piston rings and cylinder liners, and tourism. It has also
invested in the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB). New investment
opportunities are being pursued.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
38.      Turkey has substantial untapped hydropower and lignite resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
geothermal potential. Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW and corresponds to an annual production of about
100,000 GWh under average hydrological conditions. Only 10 percent has been
developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30 percent over the
next 10 years with the completion of hydropower generating plants under
construction or planned. There are also a large number of sites suitable for
small hydropower schemes of up to 20 MW. Proven and probable lignite reserves
are about 7.5 billion tons, but about half of this is of extremely low quality
(950-1,000 kcal/kg). Production in 1982 was about 17.7 million tons,
equivalent to about 3.8 million tons of oil. Oil and coal production have
been declining over the last decade.
Energy Consumption and Supply
39.      Total energy consumption was about 33 million tons of oil equivalent
(toe) in 1980, of which commercial energy consumption amounted to 26 million
toe. Petroleum made up the most significant share of primary commercial
energy consumption (60 percent), with lignite (18 percent), hard coal
(10 percent), hydropower (11 percent) and imported electricity composing the
remainder. Overall, 23 percent of final commercial energy consumption was in



- 10 -
the form of electricity. Non-commercial energy production (primarily
fuelwood, but also other biomass) was also an important energy source,
especially for the household sector. Per capita energy consumption is likely
to rise rapidly during the balance of the 1980s, in parallel with rising per
capita income. Demand for electricity, which presently exceeds Turkey's
supply capacity, will also grow rapidly. To meet rising energy requirements,
Turkey launched a massive program in the late 1970s to increase the domestic
production of electricity and lignite. This program has stretched the
implementation capabilities of the public energy agercies and spread their
resources over too many projects, with resulting delays in implementation.
Organization of the Energy Sector
40.      The energy sector in Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
Governmnent-owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources.
Under MENR, the Turkish Coal Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum
Corporation (TPAO), and the Mineral Research Institute (MTA) have
responsibility for the extraction of fossil fuels and radioactive minerals.
Identification, design and construction of hydro projects is entrusted to the
State Hydraulic Wor'ks (DSI). The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) is
responsible for generation, transmission, and since November 1982 also for
distribution of almost all the electricity sold in Turkey. Private sector
participation in the supply of electricity is confined to two small private
utilities (CEAS and KEPEZ) and industrial companies which generate power for
their own use.
Energy Sector Policies
41.      Throughout the 1970s the Government's efforts to maintain domestic
energy prices led to increasingly serious economic problems. The low wellhead
prices set for domestic petroleum production became a major deterrent to
exploration and development by international oil companies. At the same time,
the policy of holding domestic petroleum product prices constant in local
currency terms, despite accelerating domestic inflation and rising world
prices for energy, led to rapidly increasing demand for petroleum and rapidly
increasing imports. Similarly, prices for hard coal, lignite and, to a lesser
extent, electricity, the other major primary energy sources for Turkey, were
also held down, causing serious financial losses to TKI and reduced profits to
TEK. The low prices also discouraged the adoption of effective conservation
measures. The policy of energy subsidies was largely abandoned after the
financial and political crises of late 1979 and early 1980, and since then
most prices of petroleum products have been raised to international levels and
have been maintained at those levels by regular adjustiments.
42.      The Government is in the process of developing a program for the
conservation of energy resources by encouraging their more efficient use in
existing and new industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and
legislation are being evaluated. Legislation has been passed allowing for tax
credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency improvements.



- 11 -
Electricity Supply and Demand
43.      Turkey's total installed capacity is 6363 MW, of which 3406 MW
(54 percent) is thermal and the balance 2957 MW (46 percent) hydro.
Generating capacity and electricity production increased at average annual
rates of 9.2 percent and 9 percent respectively over the 1972-1982 period.
However, the development of electricity supply has not kept pace with the
growth in demand, which averaged 10 percent p.a., resulting in frequent power
shortages and increasing reliance on imports. Installed capacity is expected
to more than double by the end of the decade, reaching 15,050 MW in 1990, with
the share of hydropower in the total rising from 46 percent to 53 percent.
Despite the projected capacity expansion, supply shortages are likely to
*         continue over the 1980s.  Protracted delays in the commissioning of generating
units have reduced the reserve margin available to compensate for poor plant
availability. Improved load management, and better maintenance and
rehabilitation of generating facilities, should contribute to increased
reserve margins.
44.      Because major power generation will be concentrated in eastern and
central Turkey, it has to be transferred to the consumption centers located in
the western part of the country. The proposed investment program for the
expansion of the transmission network includes construction of 4,443 km of
380-kV lines by 1990. Following the recent takeover of the municipalities'
distribution networks by TEK, a detailed survey of the urban networks is being
carried out to determine their condition and formulate an investment program.
TEK's supply program to the rural sector aims at the electrification, by 1987,
of all villages in Turkey. Sixty percent of them have already been connected
to the national system.
Bank's Role in the Power Sector
45.      The proposed project would be the fourth loan to TEK and the
fifteenth Bank Group operation in the power subsector in Turkey. The Bank has
made ten loans and a technical assistance grant (total $476.7 million), and
IDA has granted three credits (total $55.7 million). These were for four
hydroelectric projects, two thermal power stations (oil- and lignite-fired),
one thermal power station in association with a lignite mine, and several
transmission and distribution networks. The technical assistance grant helped
reorganize Turkey's power subsector. The first five loans/credits were for
projects in the CEAS concession area, and were completed successfully. Their
physical objectives were largely met, albeit often with long delays. They
were generally less successful in achieving their institution building targets.
46.      A Project Performance Audit Report on the Keban Transmission (Loan
568-TU) and the TEK Power Transmission (Loan 763-TU) Projects distributed to
the Board on November 23, 1981 found that these projects have met their
physical objectives in spite of implementation delays and cost overruns. The
Audit Report also pointed out that while the overall organization of the power
sector has significantly improved with the help of the projects, problems
remained as TEK had not yet achieved reasonable autonomy in management,



- 12 -
staffing and pricing. A Project Completion Report on the Istanbul Power
Distribution Project (Loan 892-TU) distributed to t:ae Board recently 1/ noted
considerable delays in physical completion of the project. The main reasons
for the delays were late preparation of bidding documents and shortage of
local currency. The report also stated that not alL institutional goals of
the project had been achieved, including in particuLar the transfer of the
municipal electric utilities to TEK 2/. Previous loans to TEK have been for
the First and Second Transmission Projects, and the Elbistan Mine and Power
Project.  The completion report for TEK Transmission II is due to be submitted
in the fall of 1983. A supplementary loan is being considered to address the
problems of the Elbistan project.  The power station is about seven years
behind schedule because of shortage of local currency, poor performance of Lhe
civil works contractors, inadequate site organization and management, and slow
equipment erection. The major problems encountered in the lignite mine are
much slower than a,nticipated progress in overburden removal and dewatering of
a clay (gyttya) formation in the overburden and inadequate site organization
and management. In addition, there have been delays in the establishment of
workshops, provision of spares and recruitment of Turkish staff. In preparing
the supplementary loan, the colenders (German Aid Program (KfW), EIB, IBRD)
are reviewing with TKI, TEK and the Government an action program to resolve
the above difficulties.
47.      The Bank has played a major role in the consolidation of the power
sector in Turkey and in the creation of TEK. The Bank has continued to
advocate much needed institutional reform and has achieved some success in
assisting the authorities in strengthening the institutional capabilities of
the subsector.  A good deal of progress has been made in some areas such as
improving TEK's accounting system, system planning, and procurement procedures.
48.      TEK, a State Economic Enterprise established in 1970, has had
responsibility for planning and implementing the general electrification of
Turkey including the construction of thermal power p'Lants and transmission
networks, rural electrification and the generation and transmission of
electricity. TEK recently assumed responsibility for direct sales of
electricity to all customers and for the construction and maintenance of urban
distribution networks. As a State Economic Enterprise, TEK operates under the
provisions of the SEE law and the State Personnel Law. Its organization and
management have been significantly shaped through a multiplicity of external
controls.  The reduction of SEE financial dependence on the Government and
improved operational efficiency have recently been major goals of the
Government. The Bank has supported these objectives in SALs I, II and III.
The core of the GovernmentCs program for SEEs is a wide-ranging reform decree
that has recently been approved. The new decree classifies State enterprises
into different categories and lays down unifornm principles relating to the
composition of their Boards of Directors, the tenure of Board members and the
qualifications required of top management. The enterprises will henceforth

- 13 -
be allowed to determine their product prices; if for any reason the Government
establishes prices, the loss, if any, to the enterprise will be made up by the
Government. Employees of the enterprises will be subject to a new personnel
regime different from that applicable to Government employees. The
enterprises will also have greater autonomy in determining their investment
programs, within the framework of the national plans. The Government's
strategy is to bring about greater efficiency in SEE performance through
decentralization of responsibility, greater management autonomy and
competition. The ultimate objective is to place the SEEs in an economic
environment where they would compete on an equal footing with private sector
firms, especially with regard to output prices, factor inputs, and credit.
While the Government recognizes that the challenge is to change deep-rooted
attitudes, not merely laws, the new decree should have considerable impact by
signaling the new approach towards SEEs. Within the framework of the SEE
decree, the Government intends to seek the Bank's assistance in providing
technical assistance aimed at improving the overall performance of selected
SEEs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
49.      The proposed project is part of a comprehensive transmission
development program designed to meet TEK's needs up to 1990. The project was
identified in early 1982 and appraised in February 1983. Loan negotiations
were held in Washington from May 10 to May 20, 1983. The Turkish delegation
was led by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Financial and Economic Counselor of the
Turkish Embassy in Washington, and included representatives of the Ministries
of Energy and Natural Resources and Finance, as well as of TEK. The main
features of the loan and project are given in the loan and project summary and
in Annex III.
Project Objectives
50.      The proposed project conforms to the Government's strategy for
increasing domestic production of energy and improving the balance between
investments in generation and investments in transmission and distribution
facilities. The Government continues to give highest priority to the
development of the energy sector, recognizing that domestic production of
energy needs to be increased rapidly to meet the growth in demand.
51.      The Karakaya hydropower plant, partially financed under Loan 1844-TU,
is scheduled to be completed by end-1986. The transmission lines to be
constructed under the proposed project are necessary to permit utilization of
the power produced by Karakaya and several other plants scheduled for
commissioning in 1984-86.
52.      The project would also address a number of institutional objectives.
Assistance would be provided to TEK on issues posed by the takeover of
electricity distribution entities. The objective of the assistance would be
to help reduce losses, introduce uniform technical standards and procedures
across the various regions of Turkey and set priorities for the expansion and
rehabilitation of the distribution networks. In addition, TEK's management



- 14 -
would receive assistance in the development and implementation of a management
information systera, and in long-term planning through load research, and
tariff analysis and formulation. The project would also support improved use
of existing training facilities, thereby helping TEK resolve its chronic
shortage of qualified staff.
Project Description
53.      The propcsed project includes the construction of about 1,500 km of
380-kV transmission lines to accommodate new generating capacity coming on
stream between 1983 and 1986 (Map IBRD 17075). The project would also include
a technical assistance component under which TEK would engage consultants to
assist with:
(i)    improved organization and operation of municipal
distribution of electricity, legally transferred to TEK
in November 1982, and conducting distribution feasibility
studies;
(ii)    preparation and implementation of a program of load
research, demand management, tariff restructuring and
energy conservation;
(iii)    implementation of the first stage of a long-term manpower
development and training program, including overseas
training for TEK instructors; and
(iv)    development and implementation of improved accounting and
financial reporting and billing procedures for TEK,
including its distribution enterprises.
A Staff Appraisal Report (Report No. 4407-TU) dated May 31, 1983, and entitled
"TEK Transmission Project III", is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors.
Project Implementation
54,      TEK will be responsible for execution of the project.  Construction
of the transmission lines is scheduled to start in late 1983 and be completed
by the end of 1986. TEK would retain consultants satisfactory to the Bank to
assist with project management and supervision. The engagement of these
consultants would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement,
Section 7.01(b)). Timely completion of the 380-kV substations associated with
the transmission lines in the project is of paramount importance. Award of
contracts for all project-related substations would also be a condition of
loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 7.01(a)).
55.      Over the last ten years TEK has experienced a period of
organizational stability in spite of several changes in senior management and
the rapid expansion of the power system.  However, management has been
preoccupied with the rapid expansion of generation capacity and has not been
able to give sufficient attention to financial policy, tariff demand
management and training.



- 15 -
56.      Under the proposed project, consultants would be appointed by
December 31, 1983 to:
(a)    help improve the organization and operating procedures for the
18 recently formed power distribution enterprises and help
plan investments for the rehabilitation and extension of urban
distribution networks (about 220 man-months) (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 2, Part B(l));
(b)    help improve overall system planning and tariff
restructuring. This would include a load research, demand
management, tariff and energy conservation study (about
300 man-months) (Loan Agreement, Schedule 2, Part B(2)).
(c)    help improve training of TEK staff.  This would include
assistance to TEK in preparing specifications for training
equipment to be financed under the project and for training
and manpower planning (about 80 man-months) (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 2, Part B(3));
(d)    help improve accounting and management information systems.
This would include the introduction of microcomputers to
accelerate tabulation and processing of data (about 210
man-months) (Loan Agreement, Schedule 2, Part B(4)).
Environmental Aspects
57.      Unsightliness and to a lesser extent noise are the principal adverse
effects of the project. Both would be kept at acceptable levels.
Project Costs and Financing
58.      The total estimated project cost, excluding about $35 million of
interest during construction and $0.4 million of front-end fee on the Bank
loan, is about $259 million. Of this, $178 million would be in foreign
exchange. The project includes 810 man-months of consultants services.
Physical contingencies are estimated at about 9 percent of the base cost and
price contingencies at about 27 percent of the base cost. TEK has signed
agreements with the European Settlements Fund and the French Government to
cover about $9 million of the foreign exchange costs. The remainder of the
foreign exchange costs would be financed from the proposed Bank loan of $163
million and by TEK. Local financing would be secured through annual
governmental budget allocations in accordance with the project implementation
schedule. However, to ensure timely availability of local funds, it has been
agreed that a special TL account would be established and replenished as
required by TEK to carry out the project in a timely manner (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01(b)). Under existing regulations, goods and services to be
imported for the proposed project would be exempted from taxation through
1983. The Government assured the Bank during negotiations that the exemption
would be extended to cover the implementation period of the proposed project.

Financial Position of TEK
59.      TEK's financial performance has been improving, but the biggest
problem which has affected TEK's financial viability has been the difficulty
in gaining Government approval of electricity tariff increases beyond direct
fuel cost adjustments. Trends in the economic environment in Turkey in the
last several years have also had a direct and significant impact on TEK's
financial position. Both operating costs and investment costs have been
rising steeply with inflation rates and because of the depreciation of the
Turkish lira (averaging about 30 percent p.a. against the US dollar from 1980
to 1982). While some immediate problems are foreseen for TEK's near-term
financial position, the recent approval of the SEE reform law should have a
positive impact.
60.      Since the signing of the Loan Agreement for the Karakaya Hydropower
Project (Loan 1844-TU) in May 1980, the Bank has been monitoring the overall
adequacy of TEK's tariff levels by looking at the share of investment costs
covered by internally generated funds. Accordingly, the Government has been
required to take o:r cause TEK to take actions, not limited to changes in the
structure or overall level of its electricity rates, to allow TEK to generate
funds from internaL sources equivalent to not less than 20 percent of annual
capital expenditures of TEK and DSI for power projects in 1981, increasing to
35 percent by 1986.
61.      Since 1982 TEK has not been able to meet the agreed level of cash
contribution towarcls the TEK/DSI investment program. TEK's cash contribution
was only 16 percent: in 1982 and is expected to be about 12 percent in 1983.
Two main factors contributed to the shortfall. Generating facilities,
particularly hydro plants and lignite fired thermal units, were late in coming
on stream and the 1983 water levels in Turkey's hydropower reservoirs are much
below normal. Thus expensive oil fired thermal units have had to be operated
at an abnormally high level to meet load demand. In the circumstances, it was
agreed during negotiations that cash generation levels required under Loan
1844-TU be amended to 16 percent for 1982, 12 percent for 1983 and 21 percent
for 1984 (compared to 22 percent, 25 percent and 29 percent respectively
agreed under Loan 1844-TU). It is expected that TEK will be able to achieve
the levels agreed under Loan 1844-TU for 1985 and beyond. Tariff levels have
been increased recently by 15 percent effective June 1, 1983 and the
Government plans to increase tariffs again by an additional 15 percent before
December 1, 1983 (Loan Agreement, Section 5.05).
62.      TEK and the Government would continue to furnish to the Bank not
later than October 1 of each year the power subsector investment plan for the
following year, and an action plan showing how these investments would be
financed, including a demonstration of how the agreed financial ratios would
be met. To improve its financial performance, TEK wouald need to combine
tariff adjustments with consolidating and rationalizing its investment
program, reducing losses, and improving operating efficiency.
63.      Automatic fuel cost adjustment of tariffs was agreed to in 1971 under
Loan 763-TU and again in 1974 under Loan 1023-TU. While adjustment of tariffs
has not been automatic, tariff increases have just about kept pace with the



- 17 -
impact of rising domestic fuel prices on TEK's overall operating costs during
the period 1980-82.  The current practice is for TEK to seek approval from tne
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to increase its tariffs immediately
following increases in domestic fuel prices. During negotiations it was
confirmed that the fuel cost adjustment of tariffs would be continued.
Furthermore, all tariff increases on the wholesale (bulk) level, including
fuel adjustments, would be fully reflected at the retail level (Loan
Agreement, Section 5.04(a) and Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02).
64.      Before the recent takeover of the municipalities, TEK had liquidity
problems in part because of difficulties in collecting revenues from some of
the major municipalities, which diverted electricity revenues to other uses.
TEK has had a working capital deficit for the last three years, and has
financed the resulting working capital requirements by delaying payments to
suppliers, especially to TPAO. Following the transfer of municipal
distribution assets to TEK in November 1982, TEK's liquidity position is
expected to improve.
65.      During negotiations it was agreed that TEK's management would take
all necessary steps to improve the company's working capital position,
obtaining a current ratio of at least 0.7 by the end of 1983, and increasing
the ratio to 1.0 by the end of 1984. Thereafter, it was agreed that the
current ratio would be kept above 1.0 as one indication that TEK is operating
efficiently and maintaining payments to suppliers (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.06).
Procurement and Disbursement
66.      Five separate contracts would be awarded after ICB for the supply of
aluminium cable steel reinforced (ACSR) conductors ($63.7 million), shield
wire ($4.7 million), insulators ($17.9 million), hardware assemblies
($15.9 million) and series capacitors ($4 million). The contract for the
supply and erection of steel towers ($94.6 million) would also be awarded
under 1CB procedures. Up to 15 percent domestic preference would be allowed
for locally manufactured goods. Local firms are expected to be competitive
for the ACSR contract and for the supply and erection of towers. Training
manuals and other miscellaneous training aids and computer software packages
would be purchased through limited international bidding for items of less
than $10,000 up to a maximum aggregate limit of $300,000, by shopping with at
least three price quotations. The steel towers and conductors cofinanced by
ESF would be purchased in accordance with their regulations. Consultants for
training and technical assistance would be selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines and employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
All works contracts and equipment and materials contracts financed by th; -
costing over $250,000 each would be subject to prior Bank review. Other
contracts financed by the Bank would be subject to post-award review.
Disbursements would begin in the first half of FY84 and the loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by the end of FY87. No retroactive financing or advanice
contracting would be necessary.
Project Justification
67.      The project is the least cost alternative for connecting the thermal
and hydro power plants already under construction with the interconnected
system. The economic rate of return on the project is 9.4 percent based on



- 18 -
economic prices for inputs and the projected tariffs according to covenants
under this and previous loan agreements, and on the assumption that tariffs in
real terms will be at least maintained. The resulting tariffs are taken as a
proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay. This return is a reflection of
the inadequacy of the level of prevailing tariffs, whlich are significantly
undervalued, rather than a measure of the economic viability of the project.
Moreover, it understates the real return on the project because it does not
take account of the substantial surplus accruing to the ultimate beneficiaries.
Project Risks
68.      Most of the project is located in areas of difficult access.  Adverse
climatic conditions would also influence construction progress during winter.
Reasonable precautions are being taken, however, to ensure adequate physical
and financial resources will be available to cope with the expected
difficulties. The possible risk of inadequate local currency funds delaying
the implementation of the project would be taken account of by the proposed
establishment of a TL account (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(b)).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
69.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Turkish Electricity Authority
and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and
the Bank, and the Report of the Conmnittee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan and Guarantee
Agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans for power projects and their
more important features have been included in Part IV of this report.  Special
features of the Loan Agreement are referred to in the text and listed in
Section III of Annex III. There are two special conditions of loan
effectiveness:
(i) the borrower has awarded contracts for construction of all
380-kV substations; and
(ii) the borrower has employed engineering consultants to manage
and supervise construction of the transmission lines under the
project (para. 54).
70.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
71.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.        STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 1983 1/
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 - Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973.  Effective Date:
March 20, 1974.  Closing Date:  December 31,1983.
The project is expected to be substantially completed by the current
Closing Date of December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, about $35.5 million
has been disbursed of this $44 million loan.
Ln. No. 1023 - Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project: US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Progress has been made on the power component in line with the
measures recommended in February 1982. The civil works contracts have been
renegotiated and additional contractors brought in. TEK has delegated site
management to STEAG, a German project management firm. The main contractor,
Foster Wheeler (nW), has revised the work plan taking into account the use of
erection personnel being made available by the main equipment suppliers. The
revised work plan concentrates maximum effort in completing Unit No. 1 by end
1984.. Units No. 2, No.3 and No. 4 would follow at one year intervals. With
the arrangements made through the US EXIM Bank, and the proposed reallocation
of an additional UJS$6.8 million from the IBRD loan, financing for the FW
contract through end 1983 is assured. Social infrastructure and salary
problems persist. The contract for operation and training for the mining
component expires in July 1983. Decision on renewal has not been taken. The
contract for mine consulting is continuing. TKI has not negotiated frame
contracts for mine equipment maintenance.  Maintenance of mine equipment is
inadelquate. TKI's ability to mine lignite in sufficient quantities to
adequately supply the power station (17.6 million tons per year) will be
assessed in connection with the appraisal of a supplemental loan tentatively
scheduled for September 1983.
Ln. No. 1130 - Corum-Cankiri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of
June 23, 1975. Effective Date: January 22, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1984.
Satisfactory progress is being maintained except for delayed payment
to contractors by DSI.  The Bank has agreed to the Government's request for
reallocation of proceeds so as to provide additional funds for short-term
credit, which is e!xpected to be sufficient to cover needs until a proposed
second agricultural credit project, now scheduled fcr Board consideration in
June 1983, becomes effective.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Ln. No. 1248 - Agricultural Credit and Agro-industries: US$54.3 million loan
of May 5, 1976. Effective Date; May 11, 1977. Closing Date June 30, 1984.
The supervised credit and ferryship components are fully disbursed
and the study of TCZB organization and operations has been completed. Due to
reluctance of sub-borrowers to assume foreign exchange risk and availability
of other sources of credit without this risk, only 11 percent of the
agro-industries component has been disbursed.  The Government is considering
proposals for dealing with this issue.
Ln. No. 1258 - Balikesir Newsprint: US$7O million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, 1976. Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Although the Closing Date has not been extended, accounts are being
kept open pending settlement of final payments. As of March 31, 1983, $68.4
million, or 98 percent of the total loan amount, has been disbursed. A
project completion report is under preparation.
Ln. No. 1265 - Livestock III: US$21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976.
Effective Date: February 25, 1977. Closing Date: March 31, 1984.
The Closing Date has been extended to March 31, 1984 to allow for
utilization of the remaining $6.8 million of undisbursed loan funds. Project
implementation has been satisfactory. However, the increased availability of
locally bred offspring of imported cattle at considerably cheaper prices than
for comparable directly imported cattle, has caused a serious reduction in the
demand for sub-loans. The Bank is currently considering a request from the
Government for restructuring all three ongoing livestock projects to include
financing for the foreign exchange component of loans for sheep and beef
fattening in addition to dairying; locally bred improved cattle and sheep, as
well as imported ones; and farm machinery and equipment, livestock housing,
pasture and forage production, feeds and other inputs in addition to livestock.
Ln. No. 1310 - South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure: US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date: March 1, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1983.
Project implementation is about two years behind schedule due to
initial difficulties relating to land acquisition and project organization.
At present most project works are either completed or under advanced
implementation. The Closing Date has been extended for the first time by one
year to December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, $10.8 million, or 42 percent
of the total loan amount, has been disbursed.
Ln. No. 1379 - DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date; July 21, 1977. Closing Date:
December, 31, 1982.
The Closing Date for this loan has not been extended, but the
accounts are being kept open for settlement of final payments. As of
March 31, 1983, the undisbursed balance of this loan is $7.0 million.

Ln. No. 1585 - Northern Forestry: US$86.0 million loan of June 5, 1978.
Effective Date: October 30, 1978. Closing Date: March 31, 1986.
Overall physical achievements are about 60 percent of targets. Local
funding, which is almost totally dependent on timber sales, has been
inadequate due to a depression in the construction industry. Although
equipment procurement is still behind schedule, proposals for foreign
equipment procurement have been agreed, providing for initiation of remaining
procurement in 1983/84 with completion of disbursement expected by early
1986. A management consultant to assist the project implementation is
expected in Ankara shortly.
Ln. No. 1586 - Livestock IV: US$24.0 million loan of June 5, 1978. Effective
Date: October 31, 1978. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Implement:ation of the supervised credit program is extremely slow due
in part to the increased availability of locally bred offspring of imported
cattle at considerably cheaper prices than for directly imported cattle. A
Government request for restructuring of all three ongoing livestock projects
(see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1606 - Erdemir Stage II Steel: US$95.0 million loan of June 30,
1978. Effective Date: July 30, 1979. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira have caused serious
financial problems for the company. Proposals to tackle the situation are
being considered by the company and the Government in consultation with the
Bank. Implementation of the main components of the original project is one
year behind schedule with additional delays now expected on some non-critical
support facilities and several additional items recommended by consultants to
improve productivity, quality, and efficiency. A financial plan prepared by
the company is being reviewed.   Extension of the Closing Date to permit
utilization of the remaining loan funds is dependent upon development of a
satisfactory financial plan.
Ln. No. 1741 - Ports Rehabilitation: US$75 million of July 2, 1979.
Effective Date: January 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Cumulative loan disbursements of $38.0 million up to March 31, 1983
were only about 51 percent of the total loan amount dlue to initial delays in
tendering, awardingr contracts, appointing consultants for port planning study,
and finalizing specifications of a 250-ton floating crane. Physical
implementation is IIow progressing satisfactorily. Extension of the Closing
Date is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1742 - Grain Storage: US$85 million of July 2, 1979. Effective
Date: January 21, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Prequalification procedures for silo construction contractors are in
progress. The Government is currently examining the merits of possible
adjustments in the project contents to take account of changes in relative
prices and cost increases due to previous delays.

Ln. No. 1748 - TSKB XIII (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$60
million of July 12, 1979. Effective Date: October 25, 1979. Closing Date:
September 30, 1983.
Delays in committing this loan have resulted due to sub-borrowers'
reluctance to bear foreign exchange risk and cancellation of loan contracts
because of financial distress caused by high interest rates and shortage of
local currency. These financial problems which are endemic in the Turkish
private sector have prevented TSKB's serious arrears position from improving.
The current Closing Date of September 30, 1983 is not likely to be extended.
As of March 31, 1983, about $43.4 million has been disbursed.
Lns. Nos. 1754 and 1755 - TSKB (US$65 million) and SYKB (US$15 million)
Private Sector Textiles loans of September 17, 1979. Effective Date:
February 29, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
A lower than anticipated level of commitments (about $38 million or
55 percent of forecasts) still prevails due to depressed conditions in the
textile industry and the sub-borrowers' reluctance to assume foreign exchange
risk. Local consultancy service has been reorganized on schedule, as a
private sector joint venture without further need of the Bank's financial
support.
Ln. No. S-15 - Ankara Air Pollution Engineering: US$6 million loan of
December 12, 1979. Effective Date: April 4, 1980. Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Out of the five components of this project, only two (Seyitomer Plant
and Air Pollution Monitoring Equipment) have so far been partly implemented,
representing US$0.9 million or 15 percent of the total loan amount. The test
results from the MTA pilot plant showed that investment in a larger scale
pilot plant would not be warranted. The Alternative Technology Study will not
be executed since no feasible processes exist for coke or hot briquetting
manufacture based on Turkish lignite. The Gas Production Study will be
implemented, but the cost for the study might be significantly higher than the
appraisal estimate. Revision of the cost estimates and extension of the
present Closing Date are under consideration.
Ln. No. 1844 - Karakaya Hydropower: US$120 million loan of May 21, 1980.
Effective Date: August 15, 1980. Closing Date; December 31, 1988.
Implementation after initial delays is now satisfactory. The cash
generation covenant was not met for 1982, and is not likely to be met for
1983. This matter is now being pursued with the Government.

Ln. No. 1847 - Sumerbank Textiles Modernization and Rationalization:
US$83 million loan of May 28, 1980. Effective Date: February 27, 1981.
Closing Date:  June 30, 1984.
After initial delays of about one year due to delayed loan
effectiveness and staffing problems of the project implementation unit,
project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily and the costs are
within appraisal estimates. The reorganization plan for the Cotton Textile
Division was approved by the Sumerbank Board in March 1982. Recruitment of
competent personnel for the Cotton Textile Division and the project
implementation unit has been hampered by salary limitations on State Economic
Enterprises. The situation is expected to improve after the passage of the
SEE reform decree.
Ln. No. 1862 - Livestock V: US$51 million loan of June 6, 1980. Effective
Date: October 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress on the credit component for livestock development, with the
exception of boilers, is extremely slow. The Government has decided not to
implement the meat processing component due to changes in its investment
priorities, and a request has been received to reallocate the funds.
Implementation of the animal health and breeding components is reasonably
satisEactory. A Government proposal for increasing the types of livestock
credit eligible for financing (see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1916 - Petroleum Exploration Project: US$25 million loan of
November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Project implementation is slow due to delay in contracting consulting
services and initiating technical studies. Acceptable drilling locations have
not yet been identified in southeast Turkey. The Bank has recently approved
the Government's request to extend the scope of the loan to include the Thrace
basin, which has been found to have a highly attractive potential for
hydrocarbon exploration, and to reallocate a portion of the proceeds of the
loan to finance computer equipment for higher quality seismic data processing
needed for the Thrace program. Progress in separation of TPAO's
import-related operations is also behind schedule because of its relation to
the broader issues under consideration in the SEE reform legislation. Energy
audits for five major industries are currently in progress.
Ln. No. 1917 - Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project:
US$62 million loan of November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project is about one year behind schedule due to initial delays
in equipment procurement and delivery. Bids for the enhanced recovery studies
for other fields are under review, and the studies are expected to start
shortLy.  The fracturing of the Hamitabat gas field has been completed
successfully and has demonstrated the feasibility of full commercial
develoDment of the field. Progress in separation of TPAO's import-related
iperacions has also been delayed because of its relation to the broader issues
unaer consideration for the SEE reform legislation.

Ln. No, 1952 - Labor Intensive Industry Project: US$40 million loan of
March 13, 1981. Effective Date: June 12, 1981. Closing Date:
June 30, 1986.
A poor investment climate still continues to hamper loan
utilization. As of January 31, 1983, subloans totalling $16.8 million had
been approved by SYKB.
Ln. No. 1967 - Second Fruit and Vegetable Project: US$40 million loan of
April 6, 1981. Effective Date: August 1981. Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding more slowly than projected, but
should improve as a result of experience gained to date; all consultants have
been engaged and are in place. Three of the four Regional Marketing
Corporations will become operational as soon as TCZB's contribution is
received in early May 1983.
Ln. No. 1985 - Fertilizer Rationalization and Energy Saving Project:
US$110 million loan of May 15, 1981. Effective Date: August 28, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
The project components of AZOT and IGSAS are progressing
satisfactorily. GUBRE, one of the three beneficiaries, has not yet signed a
contract with an engineering company for project implementation because of
changes proposed in the scope of the project by GUBRE management to further
improve its economic viability.
Ln. No. 1998 - State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project: US$70 million loan
of June 3, 1981. Effective Date: August 27, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank is
considering the Government's request for an extension of the deadline for
completion of a study of DYB's future role.
Ln. No. 2093 - Export-Oriented Industries Project: US$100 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: May 28, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Although the special task force for dealing with problem projects is
now functioning relatively effectively, prolonged low capacity utilization
rates in industry and high interest rates make a substantial improvement in
arrears unlikely in the near future. Demand for direct foreign exchange fixed
asset financing has been declining due to reduced private sector investment
demand as a result of current economic conditions and the unwillingness of
sub-borrowers to bear foreign exchange risk. The technical assistance program
for potential exporters has been proceeding on schedule.

Ln. No. 2094 - Erzurum Rural Development Project:  13S$40 million loan of
March 5, 1982.  Effective Date:  November 24, 1982.  Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
Since the loan became effective in November 1982, implementation has
been on schedule for the irrigation, soil conservation, new roads, plant
protection, and veterinary services components. However, progress is slow
with extension services and recruitment of consultants, and it has proved
difficult to recruit and retain a project manager in Erzurum.
Ln. No. 2131 - Second Fertilizer Rationalization Project: US$44.1 million
loan of May 13, 1982. Effective Date: April 13, 1983. Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
This loan became effective in April 1983.  The Government has
requested cancellation of Part A of the project which relates to GUBRE, one of
the four beneficiary fertilizer manufacturing companies of the project, which
is no longer interested in proceeding with its portion of the project.  The
total loan amount will accordingly be reduced from $44.1 million to $38
million to reflect this cancellation.  The other project components are making
satisfactory progress.
Ln. Nc. 2137 - Highway Rehabilitation Project:  US$7L.1 million loan of
May 13, 1982. Effective Date: August 13, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress continues to be good. All civil works and procurement
contracts have been bid and feasibility studies have been completed for all
the remaining road sections included in the loan.
Ln. No. 2158 - Structural Adjustment Loan III: US$304.5 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date: July 16, 1982. Closing Date:
December 15, 1983.
This loarn became effective in July 1982. The first tranche of the
loan has been fully disbursed. Release of the second tranche has been
authorized (May 1983).
Ln. No. 2159 - Istanbul Sewerage Project: US$88.1 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date: January 24, 1983. Closing Date;
December 31, 1988
This loan became effective in January 1983.
