However, to be\n            effective, the design of the project needs to be sensitive\n            to the Borrower's capacity. The approach of keeping the\n            project's design simple and making minimum demands on\n            scarce Borrower capacity, the efforts by all parties to\n            apply the lessons of the First Emergency Credit, and the\n            good dialogue between the Bank and the Borrower, facilitated\n            the project's implementation. Nevertheless, the use of\n            a positive list of eligible imports, the floor placed on the\n            value of import transactions which could be financed by the\n            Credit, and the stringent import documentary requirements,\n            slowed disbursements and perhaps reduced the developmental\n            impact of the Credit. It is recommended that in these\n            situations, emergency quick-disbursing operations should\n            dispense with the link to imports and follow the simplified\n            procedures for adjustment operations approved by the Board.\n            While this involves more risk, the returns from moving\n            quickly would offset the higher risk."}, "docdt": "1999-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
