in international efforts at\n            reconstruction and rapid economic recovery, peace and\n            stability in Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region generally.\n            The project will ensure that the Government is able to\n            provide basic services to returning refugees and the\n            existing population, and consolidate the economic recovery\n            and stability already underway. By providing foreign\n            exchange for imports, ERRC will enhance private sector\n            production and employment which will reinforce the\n            reintegration effort. The project will finance a positive\n            list of imports important for reintegration, reconstruction\n            and continued economic recovery. The list of eligible\n            imports is as follows: live animals for breeding; seed\n            grains and fruits and spores for planting; oil and chemical\n            oil products; sugar and industrial glucose; petroleum coke\n            and jelly; inorganic chemical products; hydrocarbons and\n            derivatives; pharmaceuticals; fertilizers; inks and toners;\n            basic oils; artificial wax; insecticides, herbicides, etc.;\n            plastic and cellulose products; rubber products; wood and\n            wood products; paper and paper products (books, etc.);\n            cotton; synthetic fibers; ceramic products; glass; iron and\n            steel; copper; nickel; aluminum; lead; zinc; motors;\n            telephones and radiophone equipment; cars, tractors, cycles,\n            etc.; photocopiers and printers; topographical, geodesic and\n            mathematical instruments; medical instruments; gas, liquid\n            or electrical meters; and office equipment."}, "docdt": "1997-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
