satisfactory,\n            sustainability likely, though institutional development\n            impacts were only modest. Lessons stress the following. The\n            simplified formula by which civil works contractors\n            subcontracted the equipment, supervised by a consultant\n            project manager, proved efficient, with limited management\n            requirements, and expenses at the Civil Aviation and\n            Meteorological Authority (CAM). However, procurement\n            problems plagued this project from the beginning, causing\n            major delays, despite procurement workshops during the\n            project launch. To this end, it is suggested to engage a\n            full time procurement specialist in the implementing agency.\n            Although project design, and performance indicators\n            rightfully addressed sector management issues, these were\n            not fully focused on quantitative objectives for\n            revenue-generation, neither towards achieving efficient, and\n            effective management, both issues closely related. However,\n            through the technical assistance to the Yemeni Board for the\n            Management of the Road Maintenance Fund, the project\n            established the analytical capacity to implement planning,\n            programming, and budgeting exercises, which can provide the\n            framework for discussions on network priorities. Other\n            lessons address the importance of maintaining dialogues on\n            institutional goals, and, the need for civil service reform\n            should be pursued (i.e., linked to the Civil Service\n            Modernization Project)."}, "docdt": "2002-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
