As the project involves two\n            separate implementing agencies - the Ministry of\n            Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC) and the Civil\n            Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) - it is divided\n            into two parts, one for each agency, each to be implemented\n            independently of the other.
