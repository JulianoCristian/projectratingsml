The ratings of the PPAR generally\n            concur with the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            ratings, except for the following instances: Multi-mode\n            Transport Project- outcome (ICR satisfactory, PPAR\n            moderately satisfactory) and sustainability (ICR unlikely,\n            PPAR likely); Transport Rehabilitation Project- outcome (ICR\n            satisfactory, PPAR moderately satisfactory); Privatization\n            Support Project-  Bank and borrower performance, unrated by\n            the ICR, in the PPAR they are satisfactory and\n            unsatisfactory respectively; and the Second Public Works\n            Project - Bank performance (ICR satisfactory, PPAR highly\n            satisfactory).  Four primary lessons were learned.  In a\n            post conflict, country unification situation additional risk\n            analysis is appropriate to ensure that the government is\n            fully committed to the reforms proposed and the timetable\n            for the reform agenda.  Project objectives should be framed\n            realistically, taking into account the borrower's\n            ability to achieve stakeholder support for proposed changes.\n            Genuine community ownership and participation can enhance\n            the likelihood of project success.  Inter-ministerial,\n            agency and stakeholder coordination are crucial to project\n            sustainability and that the Bank could be more proactive in\n            helping to improve the general level of coordination."}, "docdt": "2004-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
