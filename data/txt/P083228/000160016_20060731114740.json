Policy\n            Credit Project (PEDPCII) has a satisfactory outcome, is\n            likely to be sustainable, and has a satisfactory\n            institutional development impact. The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are satisfactory. Several factors\n            have affected the satisfactory implementation and outcomes\n            in the Program supported by PEDPC II. First, the continued\n            high level political support and commitment has kept the\n            Program on track, enabling the Government to take on\n            challenging institutional reforms, such as establishing an\n            independent Examination Commission, moving forward on the\n            restructuring of the Textbook Board, and the Chief\n            Minister's monitoring teams that have helped to fill\n            gaps in district monitoring. Second, alignment in the senior\n            provincial management and bureaucracy has been maintained\n            which also facilitates implementation. Third, the Government\n            has maintained its financing commitments under the medium\n            Term Budget Framework. Fourth and most important, a strong\n            management information system and data analysis has helped\n            to monitor progress and to identify areas that require\n            further support. There are however factors that have\n            hindered progress in implementation and outcomes in certain\n            areas. Delays in reorganization of the district education\n            system have delayed the start up of district capacity\n            building programs. This has in turn affected the capacity to\n            monitor school performance, including setting up a\n            streamlined system to monitor teacher absenteeism. The slow\n            progress in capacity building of school councils has also\n            delayed activating school councils to play a more effective\n            role. The institutional reforms required for improving\n            quality have taken longer than earlier anticipated, but will\n            be a key focus in the next phase of reforms."}, "docdt": "2006-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
