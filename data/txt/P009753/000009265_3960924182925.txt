PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.      This report reviews the preparation, implementation and achievements
of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 848-IN) in India, for
which a Credit of US$38 million was made to the Government of India (GOI).
The proceeds of the IDA credit were made available to the Government of
Punjab (GOP) for onlending to the implementing agency, the Punjab Water
Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB). The Credit was signed in October 1978 and
was closed in September 1985.
2.      The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Urban and
Water Supply Division, South Asia Projects Department on the basis of a draft
PCR prepared by WSSB, the Credit and Project Agreements and all other
information available on file.
3.      In accordance with the revised procedures for project performant:e,
this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluations Department (OED), but tke
project was not audited by OED staff.
4.      Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to
the Borrower, GOP and WSSB. Comments from the Borrower were received in July
1987 and are reproduced in Annex 1 to this report.

PUNJAB WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(CREDIT 848-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.      The Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Project was designed to respond
to a situation in Punjab (not uncommon throughout India) in which
urban water supply and sewerage investments were greatly inadequate, and
service levels were gradually deteriorating in the fast growing urban areas.
Operation, maintenance and mabagement of water supply and sewerage systems
were also unsatisfactory (pa'a. 1.03). Project activities called for
improvement and expansion of water supply and sewerage facilities in eight
urban towns of the Punjab (Amritsar, Bhatinda, Jullundur, Ludhiana, Moga,
Pathankot, Patiala, and Rajpura). In additiont the project included
consultant assistance, specialized equipment and training in order to
strengthen organization, management and staffing of the implementing agency
(WSSB) and the local partners (MCs) (para. 2.14).
Lack of Project Impact on Sector Policies and Practices.
2.      Project implementation could be characterized in large part as
"business as usual" in the Punjab water supply and sewerage sector, with the
exception that financing was provided by IDA. Little new technology was
involved, and almost all equipment and supplies were obtained from in-dountry
manufacturers. Although both IDA and the borrower reported that the project
was successful ir terms of meeting physical construction objectives and in
extending service levele, little progress has been reported o.n achieving such
institutional improvements as strengthening of billing and collection
activities, upgrading accounting systems, and decreasing the level of
unaccounted-for water at the MC level (para. 4.05).
Failure of Local Agencies to Adopt and Implement Management Reforms.
3.      Although the scale of the physical construction activities was well
within the construction implementation capacity of the implementing agency
(WSSB), it appears that GOP and IDA were unable to influence the local
institutional partners to take corrective actions to improve operations,
maintenance and management because of the separate nature of state and local
governments. MCs, for their part, appeared to perceive the project as a
state government initiative with IDA, *n which they had little or no
participation. Thus MCs did not feel obliged to adopt and implement the
necessary financial and operational discipline. GOP's efforts to find and
train appropriate and qualified staff for improvement of financial management



practices was undercut, partly due to a lack of interest on the part of the
MCs and partly due to a shortage of funds at the local level. Thus far no
finncial statements have been made available on the performance of the MCs
because f the failure to implement commercial accounting systems at the
local level (paras. 5.05-5.06).
Failure to Improve Implementation Procedures.
4.      Implementation experience showed difficulties typically
encountered by young agencies attempti4g to carry out IDA funded projects for
the first time. For the implementing agencies it was their first encounter
with IDA's objectives, values, and methods of implementation. As is typical
of many water supply and sanitation projects, success was more evident with
relation to physical construction components, since implementing agency staff
had had experience with these' kinds of activities in the past. On the
institutional side, however, the project called for improvements in areas
where the implementing agency was weak. Here success was considerably more
elusive (para. 9.01).
Conflicts between State and Local Authorities.
5.      Other hindrances were derived from the fact that there were strained
relations between state implementing auzthorities and the MC partners in the
eight urban towns at times, as the state authorities tried to enforce
compliance with covenants. To some extent such implementation difficulties
are the result of an attempt to impose new values on old systems and
institutions at the local level, institutions which did not fully share the
project's objectives. In addition, however, basic underlying problems
existed at the local level, where sources of revenue are few and demands on
available funds are many. Unfortunately, the project did not include
components to address the basic underlying local problems (para. 9.02).
Political Interference in Tariff Increases.
6.      As is too often the case in water supply and sewerage projects,
tariff increases were politicized -- as local officials did not vant to be
seen taking such action. A method of depoliticizing tariff increases needs
to be found, possibly one in which a state utility commission reviews
proposed tariff increases based upon measurable indicators of capital and
operating costs, and inflationary pressures (para. 9.03).
Lick of Emphasis on Strengthening Management and Operations.
7.      In relatively new and expanding utilities it seems to be
much easier to emphasize coverage targets through construction activities
instead of concentrating on less glamorous activities to ensure c2ntinued
functioning of the facilities coustructed. It is the difference between
emphasizing the visible versus the invisible, and inexperienced institutions



- vI -
are move likely to emphasize the former. Only after reaching a stage of
maturity, it seems, do utilities graduate to a long-term viewpoint,
emphasising and devoting considerable resonrces to preventive maintenance,
repair, and management activities. This is often a slow and painful process,
requiring a great deal of political resolve (para. 9.04).

PROJECT COPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.01    The Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Cr. 848)5 approved in
September 1978, was the third Bank Group financed project for community water
supply and sewerage in India, following projects for the City of Bombay
(Cr. 390) and the State of Uttar Pradesh (Cr. 585).
1.02    The State of Punjab, located in the arid plains of northwestern
India, is one of over 20 states and territories in India. In 1971, about 24
percent of the 13.6 million Punjab population lived in 108 urban townships
scattered throughout the State. Between 1961 and 1971, population had
increased in urban towns by 25 percent, but the rate of increase was expected
to accelerate to 5 percent per annum during the 1970's because of strong
in-migration from rural areas.
1.03    Water supply/sanitation in Punjab faced an all too common situation
throughout India, in which urban water supply and sewerage investments were
greatly inadequate, and service levels were gradually deteriorating in the
fast growing urban areas. Operation, maintenance and management of water
supply and sewerage systems were also unsatisfactory. Urban water systems
generally supplied water intermittently to consumers throughout the day;
system pressures were low and service was unevenly distributed. Compliance
with water quality standards was not assured in urban systems for reasons
having to do with the intermittent nature of the systems themselves. Wastage
and leakage percentages remained high. Instead of operating as an integrated
system, urban towns were often served by several small zones which functioned
independently, each separately provided with tubewells, overhead tanks and
distribution systems.
1.04    In the early 1970's, the State of Punjab had been relatively
successful in increasing the coverage of piped water supplies throughout
urban areas. Urban population covered increased from 21 percent in 1971 to
44 percent in 1976, serving 59 out of the 108 townships, although only
partially. However, service levels were deteriorating against a backdrop of
relatively small investments together witih increases in population and
urbanization. People without access to piped water supply in urban areas
relied mainly on shallow wells, while industries not connected to public
supplies developed their own systems.

PCR Prepgration
1.05    The Project Completion Report (PCR) is bas.d upon a review of project
files, available Bank Croup reports, and discussions with relevant Bank
staff. This report also benefits from material prepared by the Punjab Water
Supply and Sewerage Board in support of the PCR effort. In general,
materials found in the files and other reports were sketchy and incomplete,
and left several questions unanswered. However, it has not been possible for
IDA staff or consultants to visit the Punjab during the preparation of this
report because of restricted access due to area tensions.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin
2.01    Although the Central Government -- through its Five-Year Plans,
special programs and recently, its International Decade for Water Supply and
Sanitation (IDWSS) Decade Plan -- has had considerable influence on sector
development, State governments in India are the primary authority for
development of water supply and sewerage systems. The states execute their
responsibilities through various departments and agencies, which in turn may
delegate part or all of their duties to local authorities. In certain cases,
municipal authorities or other agencies have assumed authority through
special legislation for planning, design, construction, and operation and
maintenance, of water supply and sewerage szrvices within their
jurisdictions.
2.02    In November 1976, Punjab sector institutions were upgraded under the
Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board Act in an effort to attract finan-ial
support for needed water supply and sanitation projects. Some functions of
the Public Health Branch (PHB) of the Public Works Department (PWD) were
reassigned to the uewly established Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board
(WSSB), which was given responsibility for the construction if urban water
supply and sewerage systems. However, operation and maintenance of these
systems largely remained the responsibility of individual municipal
authorities (municipal corporations/committees, MCs). 1/ The PHB retained
responsibility for development of water and sanitation facilities in rural
communities.
2.03    The Punjab Water Stpply and Sewerage Project was originally prepared
jointly by WSSB and PUB as part of a program to be implemented during the
1977-1980 period. The project was submitted to the Government of India (GOI)
and emerged for consideration by the International Development Association
(IDA) in April 1976 after being judged by GOI as being one of the best
1/ The Punjab Municipal Corporation Act 1976 is also of interest.

prepared state projects and one of the most able to attract international
financing (Project Brief (PB), para 3.01). The original project proposed
financial support for water supply and sewerage facilities in three urban
towns (Amritsar, Jullundur, and Ludhiana) and support for water supply
facilities in 1782 rural communities (PB, para 1.05). The scope of the
project was subsequently modified during pre-appraisal discussions to include
five additional urban towns (Bhatinda, Moga, Pathankot, Patiala, and
Rajpura), while the rural component of the project was deleted.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.04    An IDA pre-appraisal mission visited the Punjab in March- April 1977
to meet with government officials regarding the proposed project. This
effort was linked in the field with a mini-sector study undertaken by the
World Health Organization (WHO)/World Bank Cooperative Program, WHO staff
being officed in New Delhi. Discussions with government officials centered
around a Project Report, which laid heavy emphasis upon construction --
rather than subsequent operation and maintenance, but did take into account
the financial aspects and their effect on tariffs. Nonetheless IDA staff
believed that the proposal required more work before it could be considered
suitable for IDA funding.
2.05    During preparation, disagreement emerged between IDA and the
Government of Punjab (GOP) regarding the proposed rural water supply
component and whether sewage treatment would be included. IDA's
pre-appraisal mission felt that further institutional reorganization would be
necessary if rural water supply were to be included in the project, and
suggested that consultants be engaged to analyze possible organizational
alternatives to find a solution. The GOP, however, did not agree to the need
for such a study, and maintained that the present organizational structure
was effective. Other difficulties were foreseen if the rurat component were
funded, particularly IDA's insistence that cost recovery be pursued in rural
communities, while GOP exercised a policy 100 percent grants for
construction, and subsidized a portion of operation and maintenance costs.
In the absence of agreement on the issues mentioned above, GOP withdrew the
rural component of the project.
2,06    During pre-project discussions the urban component was extended to a
total of eight towns in order to reduce the per-capita investment, avoid
implementation difficulties which could develop if all construction
activities were concentrated in only three towns, and extend and improve the
service for a larger population (PB, para. 6.10). At the same time, GOP
accepted as an objective the strengthening of WSSB, and the development of
viable municipal water works agencies under the authority of individual MCs
for system management on a self-supporting basis. GOP also agreed to pass
amending legislation so that WSSB could ta6: over operation and maintenance
of the MC's water supply and sewerage systems in case of default or
mismanagement.



-4-
2.07    The Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Project was appraised by IDA in
October-November 1977.
Conditions of Agreement
2.08    The project was approved by IDA in September 1978 and project
agreements were signed in October 1978. Legal agreements regarding the
project included the Development Credit Agreement (between GOI and IDA), the
Project Agreement (between IDA and WSSB), and the Punjab Agreement (between
IDA and GOP). As a condition of the Punjab Agreement (section 2.04), each MC
would be required to ensure efficient operation and maintenance in the
future. To achieve this objective, GOP was required to cause each MC to:
-   establish a separate advisory committee with the authority to
recommend policy relating to water supply and sewerage services;
-   establish a separate MC water supply and sewerage department by
March 31, 1979, and require the head of the department to report
directly to the Commissioner or President of such MC;
-   ensure that the MC water supply and sewerage department maintain
separate accounts for water supply and sewerage services ard have its
own budget and bank account;
-   ensure that the MC water supply and sewerage department maintain
separate accounts in accordance with a full public utility commercial
accounting system beginning April 1, 1980;
-   ensure that key MC personnel with appropriate qualifications serve in
the water supply and sewerage department; and
-   ensure that the MC's water supply and sewerage department would
operate and maintain the water supply and sewerage systems within its
jurisdiction in accordance with sound engineering, administrative,
personnel, financial and public utility practices.
2.09    Although the above conditions were further formalized through
subsidiary loan agreements between WSSB and each MC individually, such
formalization came about only in early 1979, after all other aspects of the
project had been finalized. There remained a feeling among MCs that they had
not been full partners in project preparation, particularly regarding the
institutional issues.

Project Objectives
2.10    As stated in the Appraisal Report (SAR, para. 4.01), the project
objective was to improve service levels so that "safe" and "continuous" water
supply could be provided to the entire population of eight towns, as well as
satisfactory wastewater removal to the extent that it was financially
feasible. Actually, the SAR overstated the objective when calling for "safe"
and "continuous" water supply, 2/ since as early as the PB the objectives for
physical components had been downgraded to an "increase in service levels"
(para. 4.01). The President's Report (PR) more accurately stated the
objectives, calling for an effort "to improve and expand water supply and
sewerage facilities," as well as improvements in "operational and management
techniques".
2.11    The SAR (para. 4.04) also included other more specific project
objectives, as follows:
-   to maximize the utilization of existing water production capacity by
(i) revision of the zoning systems; (ii) the extension of metering to
the extent economically justified; (iii) the introduction of a
stepped tariff structure to limit waste; (iv) changing the
operational pattern; and (v) the reduction of unaccounted-for water
by leak detection and repair and other measures;
-   to maximize the utilization of the existing sewerage systems by the
increase of sewer connection rates, the extension of laterals in
areas already provided with trunk sewers, and system rehabilitation
by, among other things, desilting; and
-   to increase the number of water and sewerage connections to the
economically weaker sections of the community by the provision of
credit on easy terms to cover connection costs and basic water closet
(WC) installations.
2.12    In addition to the construction of physical works in eight towns of
the Punjab, the project was to include a major component for institutional
strengthening in the sector. As stated in the PR (para. 38), GOP's
objectives for the development of its water supply and sewerage sector
included:
-   developing an adequate instituticnal framework to provide urban water
supply and sewerage services rapidly,
2/ The activities funded by the project would not have been sufficielit to
ensure "safe" and "continuous" water supply in the eight urban towns.



-6-
-   making the urban water supply and sewerage systems  i ancially self
sufficient,
-   better utilization of existing water supply and sewerage systemf,
and
-   extending and improving services where the needs are greatest.
2.13    Thus the strengthening of WSSB's capabilities was to be an important
first ste., as it woultd provide GOP with a suitable base for further
institutional development within the sector.
Project Description
2.14    The project included three major components:
1)  water supply and sewerage works in eight towns of the Punjab
(Amritsar, Bhatinda, Jullundur, Ludhiana, Moga, Pathankot, Patiala,
and Rajpura);
2)  consultant assistance for institutional strengthening in the areas
of management, organization, and staffing of MCs and WSSB; and
3)  specialized equipment to upgrade WSSB capabilities, antd provision
for staff training, both in WSSB and the participatiAg MCs.
2.15    The SAR details the major construction activities of the project only
in terms of targets over a time horizon. 3/ Components specified included
tubevells, service reservoirs, distribution mains, service connections,
standposts, and (for Rajpura and Bhatinda) water treatment works; details for
sewerage included sewer connections, laterals, interceptors, pumping
stations, outfall mains, and disposal facilities.
2.16    Feasibility and engineering design studies of sewage treatment plants
in the eight towns were to be a part of the project in order to develop a
future package for possible IDA support. Detailed estimates of costs for
consulting services and training activities were not included in the SAR,
although such efforts were to include studies of tariff questions,
development of a training plan for WSSB staff, and development of staffing
patterns for revenue generation operations.
3/ e.g., 56 tubevells in Ludhiana by end 1983, 60 tubewells by end 1984, etc.

Project Costo. Financins
2.17    Project costs were estimated at US$77.6 million equivalent, including
about US$2.5 million of taxes and duties. The principal categories were:
(a) water supply schemes (US$15.9 million), (b) sewerage works (US$31.8
million), (c) engineering costs (US$10.0 million), (d) specialized equipment,
consultancy services and training (US$1.2 million), (e)physical contingencies
(US$5.7 million), and (e) price contingencies (US$13.0 million) (PR, para.
50).
2.18    An IDA credit of US$38.0 million equivalent was to finance about 50
percent of project costs, net of taxes and duties. The credit was to finance
all foreign exchange costs (US$5.5 million) and a portion of local costs
(US$32.5 million). The balance of funds for the project were to be provided
by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the Government of Punjab
(GOP), and participating MCs. LIC had been actively involved in lending for
state water supply schemes, and agreed to provide $15.1 million equivalent in
local currency, or about 20 percent of the total financinig required. 4/ State
and local governments participating together would provide the balance of
US$24.5 million equivalent.
2.19    The proceeds of the IDA Credit were channeled through GOI to COP on
standard IDA terms, as part of central assistance provided to state
governments for development purposes. GOP was to onlend these funds to WSSB
at 8.5 percent interest for a period of 25 years, including three years of
grace. Under subsidiary loan agreements between WSSB and each participating
MC. these funds would be relent by WSSB to the respective MCs.  Such
agreements also made MCs liable for repayment of the loan to WSSB at 8.5
percent interest over 25 years. The signing of the subsidiary loan
agreements was a condition of credit disbursement. Terms of LIC loan to WSSB
were also 8.5 percent interest, for a period of 25 years (with three years
grace period).
III. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Covenants
3.01    According to the Punjab Agreement (Section 2.10), GOP had the
responsibility of ensuring financial performance on the part of MCs, as
follows:
4/ LIC had a similar role in CR-585, th Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and
Sewerage Project.



-8-
during the construction period, GOP would cause each MC to cover
annual operating expenses, working capital and debt service or
depreciation, whichever is higher;
GOP would cause each MC to generate internal cash at the rate of at
least 30 percent in FY83, 35 percent in FY84, and 40 percent from
FY85 onwards. 5/
3.02    Full assessment of the achievement of these covenants is not possible
because financial statements are not available on the financial performance
of the MCs. Although 12 accountants were recruited and trained by GOP and
placed in the individual MCs in 1983, all but two left their positions within
a few months because of lack of support and/or insufficient funds at the MC
level. It can be assumed, however, that the cash generation covenants cited
above were not met because revenues have been only abouc 25 to 50 percent of
targeted amounts in all MCs.
3.03    Financial periormance by the MCs was severely hindered by a number of
factors, including:
-   the inability or unwillingness of MCs to raise water and sewerage
tariffs due to an unfavorable political environment;
-   the overall situation in the Punjab, particularly in regard to the
sporadic civil unrest during project implementation;
-   poor progress in the installation of new water meters and the repair
and maintenance of existing meters;
-   the inefficiency of MCs' billing and collection activities;
-   the high percentage of unaccounted-for water in most MC water systems
(30-45 percent); and
-   the inability of MCs to retain the trained accountants recruited by
GOP for the project.
3.04    The project did lead to some progress toward financial targets, since
by 1984/85 the MCs' billing and collection activities had become more
regular, and revenues had increased above previous levels. Data are
insufficient, however, to fully gauge the progress during this period.
5/ The GOP's fiscal year (FY) begins April 1st.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Parastatal Development
4.01    Although both IDA and the borrower report that the project was
successful in terms of meeting physical construction objectives and in
extending service levels, there is less agreement regarding the project's
contribution toward the institutional objectives. This is probably to be
expected, since there was a lack of broad consensus among the various parties
(IDA, COP, WSSB, MCs) at appraisal about what the institutional objectives
should be, particularly at the local MC level.
4.02    GOP enactment of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board Act 1976,
which authrrized the establishment of WSSB and reallocated to it activities
for urban water supply and sewerage construction, reportedly was taken in
order to attract outside funding to the Punjab. In initial discussions on
the project, IDA pushed for further institutional changes, seeking to
strengthen WSSB's role. Thus the Bank wanted WSSB to become a strong
parastatal with not only responsibility for construction activities, but with
responsibility for operation and maintenance of facilities as well. Bowing to
political forces, however, IDA agreed to allow each MC to-retain
responsibility for operation and maintenance and management of completed
facilities. Each MC was to form its own water supply and sanitation
department, with bank accounts and accounting systems separate from those of
other MC activities.
4.03    Unfortunately, there :as not enough discussion at the initial stages
with the MCs regarding how they could participate in the project, and how
they would eventually undertake operation and maintenance and management
tasks once construction had been completed.
Commitment to Project Objectives
4.04    IDA staff saw a need for sector improvements at the pre- appraisal
stage and hoped to use the project as a vehicle for their implementation. In
addition to construction activities, the project called for efforts toward
innovation in sector institutions. There is little evidence, however, that
the WSSB and the MCs shared these concerns with IDA in the same way. There
was clearly more agreement among the parties involved regarding the
construction objectives than regarding the objectives for institutional
strengthening, primarily added at IDA's insistence. In retrospect,
sufficient incentives were not built into the project to ensure that the MCs
would fulfill the institutional components. As has been pointed out
elsewhere, 6/ covenants built into proiect agreements are not sufficient to
6/ "Operational Policy Review, Compliance with Loan Covenants," OED report
No. 4090, September 1, 1982.



-10-
ensure that implementing agencies will carry out those items with which they
do not fully share an interest.
4.05     In large part, project implementation could be characterized as
"business as usual" in the Punjab water supply and sewerage sector, with the
exception that financing was provided by IDA. Little new technology was
involved, and almost all equipment and supplies were obtained from in-country
manufacturers. General improvements in operation, maintenance, and
management lagged behind construction activities. Little significant
progress has been reported on the problems of unaccounted-for water, billing
and collection, and in upgrading accounting systems at the MC level.
4.06    Even if the MCs had been fully committed to the institutional
objectives there would still have been problems in implementation, since
improvements in these areas can only be expected over the long term. However,
in the absence of full commitment, little progress was possible.
4.07    In a related issue, IDA seemed unaware of the need for institutional
strengthening at the MC level. In retrospect, more time should have been
spent during the pre-appraisal period to develop a consensus on the
institutional objectives of the project, especially at the local level.
During implementation, IDA failed to act in a catalytic role to help sort out
the problems between WSSB and MCs as they developed. Supervision missions
concentrated mainly on monitoring compliance with project covenants in a
somewhat mechanical way, rather than attempting to provide enlightened
guidance and perspective on the problems.
Management and Training Assistance
4.08    The project was planned such that local (in-country) consultants were
to be engaged for guidance on major issues for institutional strengthening.
Local consultants were hired by WSSB to develop a plan for organization,
management and staffing for local water and sewerage departments at the MC
level. However, the work was judged by WSSB to be unsatisfactory, as the
recommendations would have been of minimal use in upgrading these activities.
The general impression was that the consultants were strong in accounting and
financial areas, but weak in their knowledge of municipal organization and
staffing. Preliminary reports were sent to the MCs with the suggestion by
WSSB that appropriate recommendations be implemented, however, later
inquiries made during IDA missions indicated that MCs were unaware of report
contents.
4.09    Local consultants also were recruited to assess training needs and to
suggest training courses and policies, both in WSSB and the MCs. A6ain, WSSB
was less than satisfied with the results of the effort. The report did not
fully respond to the terms of reference, and recommended training that would
have cost 10 times the available funds. Although the consultants had
experience in their respective specialities, they did not have experience in



-11-
working with institutions for water supply and sanitation, and their
recommendations were not particularly relevant to the situation. Recent
information from WSSB iidicates that a training program for WSSB and MCs'
staff has been undertakenx since 1985 in cooperation with a Punjab state
institution, although no details are available.
4.10    Local consultants were found who successfully provided computer
analysis of distribution systems in several of the urban towns.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTA-T7ON
5.01    The Development Credit Agreement between GOI and IDA was signed in
October 1978, became effective in January 1979, and the conditions of
disbursement were met in six towns by March 1979. Implementation was
generally hampered by sLow start-up, early difficulties in procurement of
materials, inflation during the 1979- 80 period, and civil unrest in Punjab
after late 1984. Despite implementation delays, the progress and quality of
physical construction was reported to be good once construction began.
Throughout the implementation period, however, little prgress was formally
reported on institutional and financial objectives which t';e project
designers sought to address. Although the project was expected to be
completed by March 31, 1982, delays required extension of the closing date by
2.5 years, from March 31, 1983 to September 30, 1985, when disbursement ended
and the remaining undisbursed credit of US$2.8 million was cancelled.
5.02    Annex 1 compares the estimated versus actual works completed by major
categories. According to WSSB, the slow start was the result of a number of
factors, including slow delivery of counterpart funds to WSSB from GOP and
the MCs in comparison to targets fixed at appraisal; the delay in signing
subsidiary loan agreements between WSSB and the respective MCs; and slow
delivery and shortages of materials, particularly with respect to cast iron
pipes and cement. Additional project delays and difficulties were attributed
to civil disturbances in the Punjab, particularly after late 1984, making it
difficult not only for IDA missions to visit the field to monitor efforts,
but also for work to be completed on the project.
5.03    In contrast to the good physical progress, the financial and
operational aspects of the project posed major problems. An early problem
was that the MCs failed to contribute their agreed share towards capital
expenditures; but by March 31, 1983, the MCs had contributed 96 percent of
their target share. Another problem was inadequate billing for sewerage at
the MC level; however, by early 1983 IDA staff reported that all MCs had
begun billing every two months for sewerage in accordance with project
agreements.
5.04    Other problem areas at the MC level were low water rates, inadequate
billing and collection procedures for water supply, inability of MCs to
retain trained accountants provided by GOP, and inadequate project monitoring



-12-
and financial management. Supervision missions reported critical financial
and operational problems in three of the urban towns (Ludhiana, Pathankot,
and Patiala).
5.05    In summary, it appears that GOP and IDA were unable to influence the
MCs to take the necessary corrective actions, because of the separate nature
of state and local governments. MCs, for their part, appeared to perceive
the project as a State government initiative with IDA, in which they had had
little or no participation. Thus MCs did not feel obliged to adopt and
implement the necessary financial and operational discipline. GOP's efforts
to find and train appropriate and qualified staff for improvement of
financial management practices in MCs was undercut, partly due to a lack of
interest on the part of the MCs and partly due to a shortage of funds at the
local level. Thus far no financial statements have been made available on
the performance of the MCs because of the failure to implement commercial
accounting systems at the local level.
5.06    IDA staff report that the scale of the physical construction
activities was well within the construction implementation capacity of WSSB,
the implementing agency. In addition, no major difficulties or
irregularities surfaced in the procurement process, based upon limited
evidence in the files. Through association with IDA, WSSB has also been
exposed to concepts and procedures that can lead to further institutional
improvements in the future, but that may be slow in manifesting their full
impact. In general, the project was relatively successful in terms of
physical construction, but future improvements need to be made in financial
and cost recovery aspects, as well as in operation, maintenance, and
management at the local MC level.
VI. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01    There is very little detailed information regarding the effectiveness
of operational measures at the MC level, although problems are evident based
upon recent sketchy reports. Questions that remain unanswered include the
efficiency of billing and collection operations, the effectiveness of meter
repair facilities, the progress of leak detection and repair activities, as
well as the status of accounting practices, staffing, and training at the MC
level.
6.02    As an example, consider the problem of meter repair facilities.
According to project targetsp meter repair workshops were to be opened in all
eight towns by March 31, 1979. Recent indications from WSSB are that only
three meter repair workshops have been established, at Amritsar (serving
Amritsar, Pathankott and Jullundur), Ludhiana (serving Ludhiana and Moga),
and Patiala (serving Patiala, Rajpura, and Bhatinda). Much work needs to be
done to improve these operations, since a total of only 3,356 meters had been
repaired, while a total of 19,623 are lying out of order as of September



-13-
1985. The problems that are being experienced at these facilities have not
been reported to IDA.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01    As reported above, although the implementing agency was able to
achieve the construction objectives, it was not generally successful in
achieving stated institutional and management improvements, particularly at
the local level. The rc'asons for this failure can be partially attributed,
as noted previously to a failure of project designers to fully involve local
MCs in A dialogue about the institutional issues at an early date. No doubt,
however, basic underlying problems also exist at the local level, where
sources of revenue are few and the demands on available funds are many.
1.02    From a review of supervision mission reports, it can be seen that IDA
staff spent some effort addressing institutional issues throughout project
implementation, although in a rather mechanical way through monitoring
compliance with covenants. By late 1984 some progress had been made in
increasing revenues, and in improving billing and collection activities.
However, civil unrest after that time redirected local priorities, diverting
attention to other matters. At tines, IDA missions were only able to visit
New Delhi because of tensions in Punjab.
VIII. LESSONS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS
8.01    With a view toward future projects, the following ideas emerge for
consideration:
_.  sufficient time should be spent at the pre-appraisal stage to develop
consensus on the institutional objectives, particularly with local
level officials and their staff;
2.  progress on institutional objectives should be linked closely with
measurable indicators, such as improvements in billing and
collection, cash generation covenants, reductions of leakage,
wastage, and unaccounted-for water;
3. appraisal of proposed institutional improvements should be made only
on the basis of detailed studies, much in the same way that physical
components are appraised only on the basis of detailed designs; and
4. the financing of connection fees for water and sewerage in low income
areas proved to be very popular, and has the potential to increase
the number of connections in other projects.



-14-
IX. PERSPECTIVE
9.01    Implementation experience showed difficulties typically encountered
by young agencies carrying out IDA funded projects for the first time. It
was the first experience of the implementing agency with IDA's objectives,
values, and methods of implementation. As is typical of many water
supply/sewerage projects, success was more evident with relation to physical
construction components, since implementing agency staff had had experience
implementing these kinds of activities in the past. On the institutional
side, however, the project called for improvements in areas where the
implementing agency was weak. Here success was considerably more lusive.
Local Accountability
9.02    Accountability at the local (MC) level was not achieved in the
project. There was evidence of strained relations between state implementing
authorities and the Y- partners in the eight urban towns, as the state
authorities tried to enforce compliance with covenants. To some extent it is
a reflection of an attempt to impose new values on old systems and
institutions at the local level, institutions which did not fully share the
project's objectives. Unfortunately, at the project preparation stage IDA
did not see the MC level as being in need of strengthening.
Pricing
9.03    Tariff increases were politicized, since local officials did not want
to be seen taking such action. A method of depoliticizing tariff increases
needs to be found, possibly one in which a state utility commission reviews
proposed tariff increases based upon measurable indicators of capital and
operating costs, and inflationary pressures.
Construction
9.04    In relatively new and expanding utilities it is much easier to
emphasize coverage targets through construction activities rather than
concentrate on the less glamorous activities to ensure continued functioning
of the facilities constructed. It is the difference between emphasizing the
visible versus the invisible, and inexperienced institutions are more likely
to emphasize the former. Only after reaching a stage of maturity, it seems,
do utilities graduate to a more long-term viewpoint, emphasizing and devoting
considerable resources to preventive maintenance, repair, and management
activities. This is often a slow and painful process, requiring a great deal
of political resolve.

Under the present arrangement, tariff
revisions are the responsibility of the State
Government which would consider a number of

adequately looked at by a body appointed for
