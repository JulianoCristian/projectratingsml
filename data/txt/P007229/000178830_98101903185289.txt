REPORT AND RECOIE"INDATION OF THE PRYESIDET
TO THTP EXCCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO GULY'NA FOR SECOND SEA DETFENSE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $5.4 million to
the Government of Guyana. The loan would finance the foreign exchange
component of a sea defense project designed to protect Georgetown, the
capital of Guyana, and of ancillary expenses related to sea defenses
in Guyana which have been financed under a previous Bank loan. The
loan would be repayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace period,
with interest at 7½ percent.
2.        The status of previous loans to Guyana is summarized in Annex
I.  An economic report on Guyana (CA-4a) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on October 1, 1970. An appraisal report on the proposed project
(PS-7a) is being distributed separately. Country and project data sheets
are attached hereto as Annexes II and III.
PART I - COUNTRY CONSIDERATIONS
3.        The proposed loan would be the second sea defense loan for
Guyana.  The first sea defense loan, made in 1968, was the Bankts first
lending operation in recently independent (1966) Guyana. The Bank had
made a loan for agricultural credit in 1961 in the amount of $0.9 million
(net of cancellation) to the former colony of British Guiana, with the
guarantee of the United Kingdom. This loan has been repaid in full.
s"ince independence, Bank loans and IDA credits to Guyana have totalled
$7.9 million and $5.1 million, of which $6.9 million and $4.6 million,
respectively, remain undisbursed. Almost one-half of the loans/credits
extended have been for an education project, about two-fifths for sea
defenses and the remainder for livestock credit. After some initial
delays progress on the education and sea defense projects has been
generally satisfactory. The IDA credit granted in December 1970 for a
livestock project is not yet effective. However, action has been taken
on most of the outstanding matters, including appointment of a livestock
director, and the credit is expected to become effective shortly.
4.        Guyana experienced a period of social and political insta-
bility prior to independence, and there were severe civil disturbances
in 1962 and 1964. The underlying cause of social tension was the
antagonism between Guyanese of African and those of Indian descent.
P greater measure of stability has been achieved in the last few years
under the leadership of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham, head of the
People's National Congress Party. Early last year Guyana proclaimed






itself a Cooperative Republic, and progress was made during 1970
towards settlement of the boundary disputes with two of Guyana's
neighbor countries: an agreement was signed with Surinam for renewed
economic cooperation, and arrangements were made with Venezuela for a
twelve-year moratorium on territorial claims.
5.        The last economic report concluded that in spite of Guyana's
narrow productive base - mainly bauxite, sugar and rice - the country's
overall economic performance in the past five years had been satisfac-
tory. Real output has grown at an annual average of about 4.5 percent
since 1965 - or about 2 percent in per capita terms - wjith growth being
concentrated in mining and sugar while rice production declined. At
the same time, the 14 percent rate of unemployment estimated for 1965
appears to have been reduced to about 12 percent. This growth perfor-
mance was achieved with the help of a high level of investment in
mining and the steady growth of public capital formnation, of which
about one-third was financed out of public savings - reflecting a sltrong
fiscal effort with an average ratio of taxes to GDP of 19 percent.
The volume of external assistance also rose sharply, with a shift from
grants to loans on concessionary terms.
6.        In 1970 the Government called for the preparation of a new
social and economic development plan for the 1970's setting as principal
objectives: (a) fuill employment by the early 1980's; (b) some major
changes in the system of economic organization and ownership, including
government equity participation of 51 percent in enterprises exploiting
natural resources, and government-supported cooperatives playing an
important role in economic development; and (c) hinterland development
to exploit resources in the interior, mainly through agricultural
settlements which are to be encouraged with settlers coming from the
coast and from overcrowded Caribbean islands. A long-range development
plan (1972-85) is nowq under preparation and scheduled for completion
later this year.
7.        Considering the relatively large amount of external assistance
available, the economic report suggested a public investment program
which was consistent with the Government's strategy, except that
it accorded lower priority to hinterland development. This investment
program envisaged expansion and modernization of the basic infrastructure
in those sectors with the greatest productive or cost-saving potential
(agriculture, including sea defenses, fishing, power, communications and
air transport) together with increased investments in education, health,
sanitation and housing. The program rested on two assumptions. First,
a sharp upward shift in the level of public sector savings was expected
to result from new tax measures introduced in 1970 and the establishment
of a national insurance system. Second, improvements would be carried
out in public administration to make use of all the project assistance
likely to be made available by bilateral and multilateral aid agencies.






8.        In recent months the political and economic scene has been
overshadowed by the Government's decision to nationalize the Demerara
Bauxite Co. Ltd. (DENBA), the largest bauxite mining company in Guyana,
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of Canada, Ltd.
(ALCAN). The Government started negotiations with DEIBA at the end of
1970 with a view to obtaining at least 51 percent of the equity of the
company through .he purchase of shares out of future profits. On Coop-
erative Republic Day, February 23, Prime Minister Burnham announced that,
as the negotiations had not reached a successful conclusion, the Govern-
ment would nationalize DB!3A "with reasonable compensation".   Legislation
was presented to Parliament relating to any bauxite "undertaking" in the
country which set forth the following: if the Government entered into
negotiations with a comnany to achieve government particiration "on just
and equitable terms" and these broke down, the Minister of Mines would
have the option to certify the breakdowm of said negotiations, at which
point ownership would automatically vest in the Government; the Government
would then pay compensation. The Parliament approved the legislation
virtually unanimously; for the first time since independence, the two
main political parties were in accord on a major policy issue.
9.        The Governmrent is presently negotiating with ALCAN regarding
the terms of the nationalization, with narticular attentlon to the compen-
sation arrangements and future sales to ALCAN. It has indicated that,
following completion of its negotiations with ALCAN, it will try to reach
agreement with the other bauxite producer in Guyana, Reynolds Aluminum
Company, on a majority participation by the Government in the local
Reynolds enterprise.
10.       With the negotiations between the Government and ALCAN still
going on, it is impossible to iudge what effect nationalization of the
company might have on Guyana's economy. In 1970, production of bauxite
and alumina contributed 46 percent of Guyana's earnings from exports of
goods and non-factor services and 19 percent of its GDP. During this
period DEWTBA was responsible for 75 percent of the bauxite and 100
percent of the alumina production.   The gross value of DEIIBA's sales  >
abroad was US$62 million.  With the exception of calcined bauxite, all of
which is exported to Western Europe, all bauxite and alumina exports go
to Morth America.  If this market were to be lost, Guyana would have to
seek alternative outlets. There is the further question of how far the
Government will be able to fulfill its expectations that it can handle
the technical and managerial aspects of bauxite production. The possible
effects of nationalization on other foreign investments in Guyana have
also to be considered. The countryts future economic development, and
consequently its creditworthiness, must depend to an important extent
on the further exploitation of its mineral and forest resources, for
which foreign partners will be needed to provide assistance in production






- 4 -
and marketing.  If this exploitation does not take place, the rate
of economic growth is likely to fall below the 5 percent a year
assumed in the economic report, since the prospects for Guyana's two
staple crops, sugar and rice, are not particularly promising.
11.       The flow of bilateral external assistance has not yet been
interrupted by these developments, and Canada recently signed a C$2.3
million loan for a water supply project. Meanwhile, preparations for
new projects and rrograms are continuing. Assistance from bilateral
sources is provided by the United States (at a level of authorization
of close to US$10 million a year), by the United Kingdom (about US$15
million) and by Canada (about US$4 million). U.S. assistance is
concentrated on the agricultural sector (mainly to improve rice produc-
tion), certain roads and water supply; the U.K. has helped in financing
sea defenses and certain social services; CIDA has concentrated its
capital assistance efforts mainly on air transportation. Considerable
technical assistance is provided by all the three countries, as well as
by the U0IDP and Germany. Guyana organized meetings of an Aid Coordina-
tion Group in 1967, 1968 and 1969, and is planning another meeting in
early 1972 after completion of the new development plan. Coordination
between the Goveinment, the bilateral aid donors, UNDP and the Bank
Group has been satisfactory.
12.       The Bank has discussed with the Government of Guyana pos ible
Bank/IDA operations in selected priority fields where significant institu-
tion building is involved or where bilateral lenders have not shown an
interest in participating on their owm. The sea defense program had not
attracted financing from bilateral sources until the Bank helped to work
out a project for the first phase, in which the United Kingdom is now
also participating. The second project, now under consideration, is
likely in due course to be followed by a third. In addition, prepara-
tory work is proceeding on power and highway projects, and the possibility
of a fisheries credit project is being investigated with the help of the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
13.       Guyana's creditworthiness for borrowing on conventional terms
is severely limited by its narrow resource base and weak balance of
payments, which is heavily dependent on the continuance of official aid.
However, external public debt service is quite low (less than 4 percent
of export earnings net of foreign companies' profits), and most of the
aid which Guyana receives from bilateral sources is on highly concessional
terms. I consider, therefore, that Guyana is creditworthy for the loan
now under consideration. However before recommending any further Bank
lending, I shall review the economic situation very carefully in the light
of developments in the bauxite sector.  An economic mission will visit
Guyana when the outcome of the Govermnent's negotiations with ALCAN can
be better evaluated.

PART II - THE PROJECT
14.       In 1968 the Bank assisted Guyana in financing the works for the
first sea defense project (Loan 559-GUA), which included the economic and
engineering feasibility study for the proposed second sea defense project.
Both the ongoing and the proposed projects are part of the first phase of
a Twelve-Year Sea Defense Program for the period 1968-79 designed to protect
coastal areas below sea level against cyclical and local erosion, as well as
from total inundation. The Georgetowfn area and adjacent coast are subject
to an erosion phenomenon which, although its causes are not fully known, has
been extensively studied. Hydrographic investigation and historical data
indicate that this area is about to be affected by an active erosion cycle
which is expected to start sometime after 1973, last for approximately
thirteen years and to cause a number of breaches in the present sea defense
structures. The proposed project would upgrade these structures to provide
flood protection for an area of about 2.5 square miles where Guyana's main
institutional and administrative centers as well as important residential
communities and public utilities installations are located.
15.       Some delay was experienced in the execution of the works under the
first sea defense loan in connection with selection of consultants and in-
vitation of bids from conitractors. Construction was begun in June 1970 and
is progressing satisfactorily according to a modified schedule of construction
which was made necessary by unusually heavy erosion. As of Play 1971, 22 per-
cent of the funds provided under the loan had been disbursed.
16.       Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO) completed the feasi-
bility study for the proposed project in September 1970. The proposed project
consi.sts of the following elements: (a) the rehabilitation of 6,830 feet of
existing sea defense structures and the construction of 1,570 feet of new sea
defense structures protecting Georgetown, (b) the construction of a diversion
road, (c) the rehabilitation of eight drainage outfalls including sluice
gates, (d) the procurement of two tugs and nine pontoons to transport stone,
(e) the construction of a slipway to service the floating craft, (f) the
purchase of steel sheet piles and equipment for use under the Sea Defense
Program, and (g) consultant services for detailed engineering, preparation
of tender documents, and construction supervision. Two maps of the project
site and the country are attached as Annexes IV and V. The diversion road
has been included in the project as part of the preparatory works necessary
to facilitate construction and also to provide an alternate route to the
major road along the Georgetown seawall which will have to be closed during
construction. New floating craft will probably not be available until the
latter part of the construction period, estimated to be about 24 months, and
craft may be leased in the interim to expedite construction. The cost of
rental would be eligible for Bank financing under the terms of the Loan
Agreement.   The floating craft comprise an integral part of the project as
they are essential for the implementation of the works remaining under the
Twelve-Year Sea Defense Program. The eight drainage outfalls included in






- 6 -
the project weze originally included in the first sea defense project, but
were deleted from the first project in agreement with Guyana because new
designs had to be prepared for theni as a result of severe erosion in the
project area and because of shortage of funds.
17.       Total cost of the project is estimated at $6.8 million.   The
proposed loan of $5.4 million would finance the entire foreign exchange
component of the project, estimated at $5.0 million, and interest and other
charges on the loan during construction ($0.4 million). In addition to fi-
nancing the local cost component, estimated at $1.8 million equivalent, the
Government would provide the necessary funds to meet the project's recurrent
costs.
18.       The project is designed to protect Georgetown against cycles of
severe sea erosion activity which pose the threat of periodic and extensive
damage to property and the disruption of business activity, and consequently
the retardation of economic development. The estimated internal economic
rate of return of the investment over the 32-year life of the project, on
the basis of simplified but conservative assumptions, is over 30 percent and
the benefit-cost ratio, based on a discount rate of 10 percent, is calculated
at 3.8:1.
19.       With the exception of stone and sand, construction materials for
the proposed sea defense structures (cement, asphalt, steel sheet piles and
polypropylene sheets) would be imported. Stone is available domestically
from public as well as private quarries. Arrangements exist which would
assure a continuous supply of stone for the proposed project. The same
consultants who prepared the preliminary engineering (NEDECO) have been
appointed to perform the detailed engineering, preparation of tender documentc;
and construction supervision of the Georgetown sea defense works.   Sir Willit;_
Halerow and Partners (U.K.) have been retained for similar consulting serviceF
relating to the eight drainage outfalls. The consultants will undertake the
training of Guyanese counterparts. These appointments will ensure a timely
start of the works. The tugs and pontoons would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding.  Local manufacturers of floating craft would
be given a preferential margin of up to 15 percent or the actual duty,
whichever is lower. Construction of the sea defense structures would be
according to normal Bank practice for the awarding of civil works contracts;
construction of the small diversion road would be by force account.
PERT III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS A1'D AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Loan Agreement between Guyana and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of
the draft Loan Agreement conform substantially to the pattern of provisions
generally found in Bank Loan Agreements.






- 7 -
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOIIENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Total Project Cost                1,7b7       4,956    6,783
Financing:  The proposed Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange cost of
US$5.0 million and US$0.4 million for interest and commitment
charges on the Bank loan during construction. The balance of
US$1.8 million in local currency will be provided by the CGovern-
ment of Guyana.
Procurement: International competitive bidding (except for the diversion
road which would be built by force account).
Construction Period: February 19072 to February 1574.
Engineering Consultants: Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO). Sir
William Halcrow and Partners.
Economic Benefits:  The direct economic benefits of the project was evaluated
in terms of savin!;s in damages to the Georgetown area.
The analysis is based on assumptions concerning the pro-
bability of the occurrence of breaches in the defenses
as presently constituted; the timing, magnitude, and
number of breaches; and the extent of property damage
resultant from breaches. Using the most probabie set
of assumptions, the internal economic rate of return is
estimated to be about 30 percent, and the benefit cost
ratios 3.8:1 and 2.9:1, respectively, for discount rates
of 10 percent and 14 percent.
