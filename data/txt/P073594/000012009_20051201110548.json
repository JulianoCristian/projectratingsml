The project offers\n            valuable lessons in several areas. First, it demonstrates\n            how important financial sector regulation is. Second, it\n            underscores the importance of taking a proactive position on\n            financial sector policy issues. Third, it illustrates the\n            importance of the quality of the policy dialogue, and it\n            provides an example of how a state-of-the-art approach to\n            financial system regulation could be included in the overall\n            policy dialogue between the Bank, and a developing country.\n            Fourth, it provides an example of an operational framework\n            for a complicated and relatively new subject which the Bank\n            and the international community had very little experience\n            in, especially for the developing world. Fifth, there are\n            also important lessons emerging out of the implementation of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2005-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
