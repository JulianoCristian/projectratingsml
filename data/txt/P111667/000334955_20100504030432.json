The reallocation is based on: (i)\n            the need to strengthen animal and human health activities;\n            and (ii) the need to replace equipment and materials damaged\n            by the earthquake at the Central Bio-safety Laboratory in\n            Port au Prince."}, "docdt": "2010-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
