"Ratings for the Avian Influenza Control\n            and Human Influenza Emergency Preparedness and Control\n            Project for Haiti were as follows: overall outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, and both the Bank and the Borrower performance\n            were moderately unsatisfactory. The following are among the\n            more important project lessons: (1) Close coordination and\n            cooperation between animal health and human health are key\n            to successful implementation of investments. (2) The\n            establishment of a medium to long-term prevention and\n            control program is required. The lesson for this project and\n            other animal health interventions is that even if responding\n            to a disease specific emergency, interventions also need to\n            focus on systemic improvements and basic capacity building\n            which are sustainable in the medium to long term. (3)\n            Mitigation measures to close a financing gap should be part\n            of appraisal. (4) Institutional strengthening in project\n            management is the pillar to success in fragile contexts, in\n            particular for emergency operations. (5) A flexible and\n            timely response is critical."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
