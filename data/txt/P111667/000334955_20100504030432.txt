If, yes, please explain:

Indicators do not change but the targets are modified because the base line has changed,
as well as the depth of activities to be conducted with the reallocation of proceeds for the
strengthening of the MARNDR. Particularly the following targets will change in the
objective indicators of the project: (i) 1/3 (instead of ½) of communal sections will send
weekly reports on time; and (ii) 1500 (instead of 2800) backyard poultry farmers
currently applying at least three prescriptions to protect their poultry and/or family of
Avian Influenza diseases.

Components and main activities of the project will remain the same but the eligibility of
expenses in Sub-component 1.2. (emergency fund) will include: « the design and
implementation of a compensation mechanism and the delivery of direct on-farm support
for assisting in restoring productive assets of affected and at-risk poultry producers . »
(as per Schedule 1, Part 1, Parag. 1.2).


Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables) _X__Yes       ___No
If, yes, please explain:

We are requesting a reallocation of resources from expense categories as follows:
Category (1) emergency fund to Category (2) for the general activities of the Project; and
from Category (4) Unallocated to Category (2) for the general activities of the Project.
The proposed reallocation is based on: (i) the need to strengthen animal and human health
activities (category 2); and (ii) the need to replace equipment and materials damaged by
the earthquake at the Central Biosafety Laboratory in Port au Prince. The proposal is to

                                             6
       reallocate resources towards the category 2, which will enable the project to achieve the
       expected results and objective. This principally concerns consultancies, goods and works
       related to the biosafety laboratory and capacity to address the post-earthquake needs. The
       table below shows the proposed changes, while the following presents the final Schedule
       2 Table.
