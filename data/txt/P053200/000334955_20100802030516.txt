                 IEGWB Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.

About this Report
      The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the expected
results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Banks lending operations
through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or
complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank
management have requested assessments: and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and
other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local
offices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the
document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the
Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
 instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their
project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is
available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are
consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,
Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is
consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are
expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project
achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost
compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk t o Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible rafings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for Lesotho's Health Sector
Reform Project (HSRP, US$20.4 million) and HIV and AIDS Capacity Building and
Technical Assistance Project (HCTA, US$5.0 million). HSRP was the first phase of a
planned three-phase Adaptable Program Loan designed to support a ten-year government
Health Sector Reform Program (2000-2009). Project plans included co-financing by the
government and an array of other development partners, including the African Development
Bank, European Union, Republic of Ireland, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization.
HSRP was approved on June 30,2000, became effective on January 3 1, 2001, and closed on
June 30,2005. Total actual costs were US$19.53 million, or 95 percent of the original
estimate; of the IDA credit of US$6.5 million, US$6.16 million, or 94.8 percent, was actually
disbursed. The closing date for the project was extended once, by fifteen months, to allow
additional time for achievement of triggers to move to Phase 11.

HCTA, a first-of-its-kind project, was explicitly designed to enhance country capacity to
absorb a significantly larger amount of resources offered by another donor (the Global Fund
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria). It was approved on July 6,2004, became
effective on January 3 1, 2005, and closed as scheduled on December 3 1, 2008. The grant was
98 percent disbursed.

This report was prepared by Judyth Twigg, IEG consultant. The findings are based on a
review of project files; the projects' mid-term reviews and Implementation Completion and
Results Reports; documents related to Lesotho's Global Fund grants; published and
unpublished literature on health status and health reform in Lesotho; and health statistics and
documents released by the Government. Interviews were conducted with some of the project
task managers; other World Bank managers, staff, and consultants who worked on the
project; officials from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning, and other government agencies; health providers; representatives of
key non-governmental organizations; and other donors. During a two-week mission to
Lesotho in October 2009, government and health sector personnel, World Bank staff, and
donors were interviewed in Maseru and the districts of Leribe and Thaba-Tseka. A list of
those consulted is in Annex A. IEG would like .to express appreciation to those interviewed
and to the World Bank Lesotho Liaison Office staff, particularly Theresia Rasethuntsa,
Masekeleme Sekeleme, and Ligo Mohibe, who helped make appointments, arranged for
transportation, and assembled key documents.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to Government
officials and agencies for their review and comments, but no comments were received.

Summary
The $20.4 million Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP, 2000-2005) was designed as the first
phase of a three-phase adaptable program loan (APL) to support a ten-year Health Sector Reform
Program (2000-2009) whose objective was to achieve a "sustainable increase in access to quality
preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health care services in Lesotho." The objectives of the
HSRP were to assist Lesotho in achieving a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive,
curative, and rehabilitative health care services, including: (a) strengthening the capacity of the
Ministry of Health and Social Work (MOHSW) to develop, carry out, and monitor the Program;
and (b) expanding the capacity of the public sector to respond to HIV/AIDS. The project's focus
was to enable the MOHSW to collect and analyze information, foEulate and assess sectoral
strategies for improving equity, quality, and access, meet international standards for financial
management, monitor progress against a stated workplan towards measurable targets, evaluate
strategies, and attract and retain qualified staff. Further, by project's end the Government of
Lesotho was to have established partnerships with non-governmental organizations undertaking
activities to prevent the transmission of HIV and mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS.

The closing date for the project was extended once, by fifteen months, to June 30,2005, to allow
additional time for achievement of triggers to move to Phase 11. During the life of the project, the
MOHSW improved its capacity to plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate comprehensive health
sector reform strategies in the areas of service delivery, health financing, human resources, drug
supply, and infrastructure development. Implementation of a ten-year health sector policy
inaugurated in 1999 continued on track, and development partners worked together through what
was termed a sector-wide approach. Shortcomings included the failure to: (a) fill vacant positions
with appropriately skilled personnel; (b) establish a Health Management Information System
(HMIS) that would manage the required information and evidence to report health sector reform
program indicators; and (c) build capacity of several MOHS W departments and in the districts to
implement the reform program and strengthen service delivery. Policies and guidelines for
HIV/AIDS were developed, but prevention and targeting of high-risk groups received insufficient
attention. Overall, health system development did not lead to improvement in service delivery
during the lifetime of the project, and health outcomes improved modestly, at best. The major
reason for this disconnect was the persistent problem in human resources and capacity.

The outcome of the HSRP is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, based on the Substantial
relevance of its objectives, Modest relevance of design, Modest achievement of both objectives,
and Modest efficiency in meeting those objectives. The Risk to Development Outcome is rated
Substantial. The project resulted in institutional capacity strengthening in the MOHSW,
especially in the Health Planning and Statistics Unit, but questions lingered about the extent to
which the gains from the project were fully institutionalized, given problems with staff turnover.

Bank performance is rated Satisfactory, with important attention to the need to market reforms
and address issues with politicization of the civil service, but insufficient focus on the risks posed
by human resource challenges. Borrower performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, with
the MOHSW having been transformed into a more professional organization with increased
commitment to reform, but with staffing and financing issues a continued obstacle.

The objective of the $5 million HIV and AIDS Capacity Building and Technical Assistance
Project (HCTA, 2004-2008) was to increase Lesotho's capacity to use effectively the resources
                                                     xii


provided through a $29 million Global Fund grant to support the implementation of HIV and
AIDS programs within its territory. The project provided technical assistance to build capacity in
the Ministry of Health and Social Work, the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,
National AIDS Commission, and civil society organizations. The HCTA project design was
uniquely different from previous World Bank HIV/AIDS projects, with its exclusive focus on
using the Bank's comparative advantage to complement and enable the absorption of much more
substantial Global Fund resources. This innovative design reflected a new partnership model
never before attempted by the Bank in the health sector and was well adapted to the country
situation.

The project closed as scheduled on December 3 1,2008. It greatly improved the capacity of the
Ministries of Health and Finance and the National AIDS Commission to manage and disburse
Global Fund resources, but few resources were used to strengthen the capacity of civil society
organizations beyond the largest umbrella NGOs. Ninety-two percent of all posts at the National
AIDS Commission were filled. Annual reports on all key HIV/AIDS program indicators were
produced and disseminated each year of the project, although monitoring and evaluation systems
remain weak. Lesotho's Round 2 Global Fund grant was 99 percent disbursed by the end of the
HCTA project. Key informants repeatedly offer the same bottom-line analysis: in the absence of
the Bank's intervention, the Global Fund's Round 2 grant to Lesotho would have been cancelled.
Almost half of grant funding was disbursed through civil society organizations, and almost all of
the grant-funded civil society subprojects received a satisfactory rating from the Global Fund
with respect to achieving output targets.

Nevertheless, improvements in the efficacy with which the funds were used were modest. On the
one hand, there were major achievements in the procurement and distribution of drugs through
the National Drug Supply Organization, promising to improve the availability of drugs and
efficacy of treatment programs. However, only three percent of project resources were used to
strengthen the capacity of civil society and there was little emphasis on building civil society's
technical capacity to provide interventions. Positions at the Ministry of Health and Social Work,
which were key to improving the technical capacity and effective use of funds, were not filled
due to high staff turnover; the vacant staff positions, particularly the inability to staff the behavior
change communication unit, were a serious setback for the country's ability to formulate and
implement an effective HIV prevention campaign. While the project increased the capacity to
mobilize additional resources for the national program, as exemplified by additional grants from
the Global Fund (Rounds 5 , 6, 7, and 8) and the United States Government through the U.S.
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the capacity to use these funds
effectively to prevent HIV and mitigate its impact remains weak and was only modestly
enhanced by the project.

The outcome of the HCTA is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project's objectives were
highly relevant, though the design was only modestly so. The project substantially achieved the
objective of raising the capacity to use Global Fund resources, but the capacity generated to use
the resources effectively was modest. The project was substantially efficient in meeting those
objectives.

The Risk to Development Outcome is rated Substantial. The project's contribution to the
country's ability to absorb Global Fund and other donor resources has proven its effectiveness in
attracting additional resources. While donor funds are no guarantee of sustainability, the increase
in financing creates favorable conditions for maintaining and improving upon capacities that
                                                xiii

were created, particularly in the presence of a partner such as the Bank who has focused attention
on capacity-building imperatives. International technical assistance, however, is a short-term
solution to a long-term problem. It is not clear that the Government adequately planned for
absorption of technical assistance provided by the project to facilitate permanent improvements
in local capacity. Institutionalizing the systems created or supported by the project remains a
concern.

Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. The Bank's role was catalytic, supporting innovations in
institutional capacity development to increase adequacy of procedures and systems as well as
individual capabilities. Some shortcomings remained, however, including failure to focus on the
well-known problem of human resource retention, targeting of capacity-building at national-level
institutions at the expense of the district level and below, and failure to take advantage of
opportunities to explore synergies between HIV/AIDS and TB. Borrower performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory, with high levels of commitment throughout and appropriate
development of policy documents and strategies to develop the national response to HIVIAIDS,
but failure to respond to high staff turnover and to Bank exhortations about the need to focus
attention on HIV/AIDS prevention.

Lessons

The experience with the two projects has generated the following lessons:

   The Bank needs to pay greater attention to political economy factors that can influence
   project implementation and performance. Even issues that are seemingly resolved can
   re-emerge unexpectedly. For example, there are current political controversies swirling
   around the National AIDS Commission, with continuing rumors that it is about to be
   dissolved. Given that the Commission's initial creation was viewed by many as simply a
   quick political fix, intended to placate public outcry over increasing number of AIDS-related
   illnesses and deaths, it is not surprising that it remains a source of controversy, in many cases
   merely a tool in ongoing power struggles.

   Health sector reform does not and cannot take place in a vacuum. In the case of the
   HSRP, the lack of a macroeconomic support program to push for difficult policy issues
   outside the purview of the MOHSW probably constrained or delayed actions, particularly in
   the areas of decentralization of services and upgrading the salaries and benefits of health
   workers (civil service salaries being a system-wide issue). Lack of progress or clarity on
   "upstream" issues - most importantly, setting the rules of the game for an eventual fiscal
   devolution to local authorities - meant that "downstream" activities within the health sector
   itself had to be deferred, or redesigned to fit within the purview of only the health sector.

   Sustainable human resources retention requires long-term planning, ownership, and
   most of all, innovation. Like many countries in the region, shortage of skilled manpower is
   one of the main challenges facing the Government of Lesotho. Levels of remuneration, while
   important, are not the primary issue. Staff in rural areas cite a variety of more compelling
   factors that make it difficult for them to attract qualified personnel: neglect by senior
   management and headquarters offices, who virtually never spend time outside Maseru
   conferring with service providers at the health facilities themselves; housing and security;
   and most importantly, lack of resources, especially equipment and vehicledfuel, that would
   make it possible for staff to perform their main task - saving lives - effectively. It is also not
                                              xiv

clear that an exclusive focus on supply-side issues is appropriate in the human resources area.
If all staff worked to full capacity, the situation would be improved greatly, but existing
approaches have not focused on the productivity and duplication sides of the equation.

HIV/AIDS programs must be balanced with attention to, and integration with, other
key health priorities. There is near-universal agreement that HIV has crowded out other
important health challenges in Lesotho. The HCTA's focus on Global Fund resources may
have exacerbated this problem, with its exclusive concentration not only on HIV, but on
Global Fund-financed HIV interventions; Government attention, largely because of the
significant dollar amounts involved, remains with the Global Fund grant, and opportunities to
integrate both Global Fund activities and HIV-related activities with the health sector in
general have been missed. Bank projects could have encouraged integration of HIV with
other health services, including those for TB, reproductive health, and orphans and
vulnerable children.

As more resources are becoming available to finance HIV programs, it is the Bank's
comparative advantage to focus on system strengthening projects like the HSRP and
HCTA. The Bank's hands-on implementation support remains much needed, given the
Global Fund's status as a grant-providing agency that offers limited implementation support.
Continued Bank support for strengthening of implementation systems can help remove
capacity bottlenecks and speed up the pace of implementation of other partners' HIV and
health sector reform programs. This approach is also an effective way to invest limited Bank
resources, as compared to a much costlier expenditure on more mainstream interventions.
Building capacity and filling gaps uses the Bank's comparative advantage, particularly in
system and fiduciary strengthening, in a way that complements, rather than competes with,
other partners' financing. In short, the Bank's approach to health and HIV/AIDS in Lesotho
has accomplished a lot with relatively little money. In the current environment, with a
number of global initiatives providing substantial resources toward improving health,
nutrition, and population outcomes, the Bank's approach in Lesotho could serve as a valuable
lesson to be extended to other priority development areas.

1. Country and Health Background
 1.1    Lesotho (formerly Basutoland) has endured periods of political turbulence, including
seven years of military rule, since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1966.
Constitutional government was established in 1993 (Central Intelligence Agency 2009). In
1998 contested elections resulted in widespread protests and riots, prompting brief but
intense intervention by South African and Botswanan military forces under the auspices of
the Southern African Development Community. Constitutional reforms restored relative
political stability, with peaceful parliamentary elections in 2002, but National Assembly
elections in 2007 were once again hotly contested. Although aggrieved political parties
continue to demonstrate distrust of the results, the last three years have been dominated by
relative peace and consensus (Owusu-Ampomah, Naysmith, and Rubincam 2009).

 1.2    Lesotho is small, mountainous, and landlocked, bordered on all sides by South Africa
and heavily influenced in all spheres by its only neighbor. It has a population of about two
million, about a quarter of whom live in urban areas. Predominantly Christian, the vast
majority of the population is of Basotho ethnicity. Forty percent of women and 28 percent of
men have secondary education or higher. With boys frequently tending livestock part- or full-
time, and then transitioning to mine work as adults, women tend to be more educated and to
occupy the majority of mid-level public and private sector white-collar jobs. Access to basic
services in rural areas is low. Fewer than one percent of rural residents have access to
electricity in their households, only 37 percent travel fewer than 15 minutes to a water
source, and half have no access to sanitation facilities (World Bank 2009b).

1.3      Real per capita economic growth averaged 3.3 percent over 1991-2007, above
average for sub-Saharan Africa. Lesotho reached the status of lower-middle income country
in 2005. Extreme income inequality persists, with a Gini coefficient of 0.63 and more than
half of the population living below the poverty line of US$ 1.50 per day (Owusu-Amoman,
Naysmith, and Rubincam 2009; World Bank 2007).

Health Conditions
 1.4     Lesotho's relatively strong economic development in recent decades was mirrored by
improvement in the state of its human capital until the late 1990s, when the impact of the
AIDS epidemic became evident. Lesotho has the third highest reported adult HIV prevalence
rate in the world, at 23.2 percent, surpassed only by Swaziland and Botswana (NAC 2008a).
That figure has remained steady for the last several years. Approximately 18,000 people, or
one percent of the entire population, die annually of AIDS-related complications (Cohen
2009). As a result, Lesotho has experienced a dramatic recent decline in life expectancy: in
2007 life expectancy had dropped from its peak of 60 years in the early 1990s by about 15
years and was lower than in the 1960s (Figure 1- 1). Infant and under-five mortality rates
increased steadily in the late 1990s, consistent with the timing of pediatric deaths due to
HIV/AIDS, but have declined since the early 2000s to pre-AIDS levels (Figure 1-2) (World
Bank 2009b).
                                                                                                      2

1.5    The total fertility rate has declined from 4.9 per woman in the 1990s to 3.5 in 2005
(World Bank 2009b). The strong influence of the Catholic Church on government policy has
prevented further development of family planning interventions (Adair 2009; Tuoane,
                                               3


Madise, and Diamond 2004). Because of its temperate climate, Lesotho is almost entirely
free from the tropical diseases, including malaria, that are prevalent in most of sub-Saharan
Africa (Shonubi 2005). Measles irkmunization coverage rates have remained steady at over
80 percent, and more than half of children with diarrhea receive oral rehydration solution (up
from 29 percent in 2000). The share of women reporting exclusive breastfeeding more than
doubled from 15 to 36 percent between 2000 and 2004. However, the percentage of
underweight children worsened between 1996 and 2004, from 16 to 20 percent, with the
highest prevalence among the poorest income quintiles.

1.6     Lesotho also has the fifth highest tuberculosis (TB) incidence rate in the world, with
5 13 cases per 100,000 people (Seung 2009). Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death for
those with HIV and AIDS (80 percent of HIV patients are co-infected), the number of deaths
from TB having tripled since 1990 (World Bank 2009~).      Multidrug-resistant and extensively-
drug-resistant TB are suspected to be rising. Although accurate data on drug resistance are
not available, ten percent of smear-positive patients are estimated to have multidrug
resistance (Satti 2008).

Health System
 1.7     Lesotho's health system is managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare
(MOHSW). Service delivery takes place mainly through the MOHS W and faith-based
organizations, the largest of these being the Christian Health Association of Lesotho
(CHAL), which operates about half of the country's health facilities. Public and CHAL
facilities generally cover distinct geographic areas, and so while they offer the `sameservices
they do not compete with or substitute for one another, as purchasers generally do not choose
between the two types; they simply go to whatever facility is located in their geographic area.
The health system is divided into four levels: tertiary and specialized hospitals, district
hospitals, health centers and clinics, and village health workers. Only the MOHSW provides
tertiary services in the form of the national referral hospital, Queen Elizabeth I1 (QEII)
Hospital, with particularly critical cases referred to Bloemfontein, South Africa, about a
ninety-minute drive from Maseru (Babich 2008). About 2,600 traditional healers also provide
services, some outside the realm of biomedical interventions (Lievens and Manu 2008b).

 1.8     The country has ten health districts (Macro International 2008). Health service
delivery in each district is overseen by district health management teams, headed by district
medical officers. Generally, each district has at least one hospital and a number of primary
care facilities, but there is some concentration of facilities in the capital and the lowlands
districts nearest the capital (World Bank 2009b). On average, there are 9.5 primary facilities
and just over one hospital per 100,000 population. Lesotho has only 0.75 annual outpatient
visits per capita, well below the World Health Organization (WHO) norm of 3.5 and
significantly below that for South Africa (2.3)(World Bank 2009b). Given the magnitude of
the HIV pandemic, it is unlikely that service demand accounts for this low utilization;
monetary costs, transport costs, long waiting times, and staff shortages are likely constraining
factors (Lievens and Manu 2008b). Transportation is particularly burdensome for the
Basotho who live in inaccessible mountain regions with few roads and sometimes extreme
weather (floods, snowstorms, and high winds), although the Lesotho Flying Doctors Service
                                                                4


uses single-engine planes and helicopters to reach the most critical cases in these areas
(Furin, Shutts, and Keshavjee 2008; Shonubi 2005).

1.9     The Government is moving forward with an aggressive process of decentralization
that will impact health service delivery at both facility and community levels (PEPFAR
2009). The Local Government Act of 1997 devolved responsibility for health service
provision and management to district governments and community councils. Responsibility
for primary level health facilities is currently being gradually transferred to the Ministry of
Local Government and Chieftainship, with MOHS W maintaining responsibility for
secondary and tertiary hospital services.

 Box 1-1: Human Resources in the Health Sector
 Lesotho's human resource situation is commonly defined as a perpetual crisis. The health sector is no
 exception. The pull factor from the geographically contiguous and economically stronger South Africa is
 continuous and substantial. There are about 90 doctors in all of Lesotho, and 80 percent of those are from
 other African countries, many marking time in Lesotho while waiting for certification in the South African
 medical corps (Mddicins sans Frontibres 2009). The shortage of physicians makes nurses even more valuable,
 but those are also in short supply: from 1994 to 2004 the number of employed nurses fell by 15 percent,
 halving the rate of nurses and midwives per 1,000 population at a time when the country's burden of disease
 was substantially increasing (World Bank 2009b). Only a small minority of the country's health centers say
 they have a full contingent of staff. In 2006/07, 87 percent of all approved health worker posts in the country
 were actually filled, but these numbers varied widely across categories: the National Health Training Center
 filled 99 percent of its positions, but primary health facilities had a vacancy rate of 33 percent (Lievens and
 Manu 2008b). Salary rates, while higher than those ip other poor sub-Saharan Africa countries, are
 uncompetitive with South Africa, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries, where
 many Basotho nurses go.

 Lesotho does not have its own medical school. The National Health Training Center produces 60 new nurses a
 year, and the Christian Health Association of Lesotho (CHAL) nursing schools an additional 70 nurses and
 nursing assistants, but studies indicate an immediate need for about 600 nurses. The Government has
 considered a variety of options to address this problem, including extra pay allowances to selected health
 workers using Global Fund grants, but it is unclear whether these would create disincentives to health workers
 who are not beneficiaries of this schemeea     Overall, the human resource reform thrust has been too focused on
 filling vacant slots, with little attention to staff incentives other than pay enhancements.

 International partners (including the Bank) have long recognized the magnitude of the human resource
 challenge, but little has been done effectively to address it. For example, the US Millennium Challenge
 Account has committed US$140 million to new and improved health facilities across the country, but there are
 no plans to train or recruit the additional estimated 600 health care workers that will be needed to staff these
 structures (Mddicins sans Frontikres 2009). The Bank's recent public-private partnership project, which is
 assisting with the construction of a new referral hospital to replace the aging Queen Elizabeth I1 facilities, will
 need about 1,000 staff, with only 600 of those to come from the existing hospital. The new facility will have to
 hire the additional 400 health workers largely from outside Lesotho; it is uncertain how these plans will be
 perceived by the health workers in place. A concept note issued collectively by health donors (Health
 Development Partners 2008) noted the apparent lack of commitment of senior management in the Ministry of
 Health and Social Work to implementation of its Human Resources Development and Strategic Plan. A
 recently-constituted Technical Human Resources Working Group on Health, composed of key representatives
 of Government and donors, is currently formulating new short- and long-term strategies to address the human
 resources problem.

 a.The Round 8 Global Fund grant includes support for health staff in CHAL facilities, in an effort to reduce inequities in
 pay among health personnel.
                                              5


1.10 One of the pervasive problems of Lesotho's health sector is its human resource crisis
(Box 1- 1). Although the ratio of physicians per 1,000 population has doubled since the
1990s, it remains among the worst in the region (World Bank 2009b). The shortage of
doctors makes medical support staff such as nurses even more valuable, but they are also in
short supply, with 600 vacant nursing positions waiting to be filled (IRIN 2009).

1.11 Given the country's severe human resource constraints, effectiveness and efficiency
remain major challenges to the health system. With outpatient contact levels low and average
2007 occupancy rates of Government and CHAL hospitals 38 and 42 percent, respectively, it
is reasonable to question whether scarce human resources are being deployed effectively.
The only hospital reaching a bed occupancy rate of 75-80 percent is the QEII, but the quality
of its care is reported to be below standard (Naylor and others 2008).

World Bank and Other Donor Support
1.12 Lesotho has historically received a relatively small amount of overall donor
assistance. This is partly attributable to the limited financial management and monitoring
capacity of the Government, and also a decline in donor interest after the end of South
Africa's apartheid regime in 1994 and the civil unrest after the 1998 election. Official
development assistance dropped from around US$70 per capita in the early 1990s to US$15
per capita in the early 2000s, well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank
2005b). Less than ten percent of the country's budget is financed through foreign assistance
(World Bank 2009b). Much of Lesotho's economic growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s
was spurred by the Bank-supported Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which employed a
significant number of Basotho and provides substantial revenues through the sale of water to
South Africa.

1.13 The World Bank's funding for health in Lesotho began in April of 1985, with the first
of two population and health projects that ran through the late 1990s. The objectives of the
Health and Population Project ($3.5 million, 1985 - 1992) were to strengthen the
organization and management of the Ministry of Health; improve the efficiency,
effectiveness, and coverage of health care and family planning services; and strengthen
manpower development and training. The Second Population, Health, and Nutrition Project
(US$22.1 million, 1989 -1 998) was intended to introduce financial and institutional policy
reforms and inject needed investment resources, with components related to population
control, TB, sexually transmitted infections, the development of urban filter clinics, food
security, and institutional development.

 1.14 As recently as the early 2000s, few development assistance agencies supported
Lesotho's health sector, with the African Development Bank (AfDB), Development
Cooperation Ireland (DCI), and the Bank as the main donors. At that time, UN agencies
(WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA) provided technical support, but their country offices were
relatively small. DCI was the only bilateral donor with health sector experience in the
country; the European Union, which had earlier provided substantial support through
technical assistance, closed its office in 2005. Support for the health sector has increased
dramatically in recent years, however, largely due to the rising share of HIV/AIDS in total
health spending, from 5.2 percent in 2002 to 18.2 percent in 2005, and representing almost a
                                                 6


quadrupling in value from US$2.3 million to US$8.4 million annually. By 2005/2006, almost
two-thirds of the country's HIV/AIDS spending came from international partners (NAC
2008b). This rapid increase in external funds, particularly for HIV/AIDS, presented a
significant absorption challenge.

1.15 The most significant current sources of donor support for health are the Global Fund,
DCI, the World Bank, AmB, the United States Government, and the European Commission.
The Global Fund is by far the largest external financer for HIV/AIDS, with a cumulative
amount of US$66.2 million for HIV and TB programs committed between 2004 and 2008
(Annex E); the recently-approved Round 8 proposals, two grants of US$50.4 million (2009-
201 1) and US$6.8 million (2010-2012), add substantially to that amount. The U.S.
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) entered Lesotho in 2007 with a
commitment of US$9.5 million, since increased to $29.6 million in 2008 and $26.7 million in
2009; Lesotho was added as a PEPFAR focus country in 2008. The U.S. Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) has pledged US$122.4 million to the health sector over five
years (2008-2012), part of a larger $362.5 million grant that also covers water resources and
private sector development. MCC's Health Sector Project focuses on renovation of health
centers, establishment of antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinics in fourteen hospital outpatient
departments, a new central laboratory and blood transfusion center, construction of student
and staff residences for the National Health Training College, and overall health systems
strengthening (MCC 2009).

 1.16 Prior to 2000, the array of projects supported by various partners had been defined
separately from other MOHSW activities, and minimal collaboration generally occurred
across donor-supported projects. Each agency retained its own procedures for monitoring,
reporting, disbursing, and accounting, conducted separate evaluations of "its" activities, and
communicated directly with the respective implementing units within the ministry (rather
than with the Health Planning and Statistics Unit (HPSU), which is charged with donor
coordination and sector planning). Donor support to the Lesotho health sector since 2000 has
flowed through a nominal sector-wide approach ( S WAp), with coordinated policy advice by
partners, an agreed sector expenditure framework, harmonized fiduciary systems, and
common performance indicators (but not pooled financing). The Bank has played a critical
role in facilitating the S WAp, in the area of institutional development and the development of
systems capable of coordinating donor and government support to the sector. Given the rapid
expansion in donor activity over the last four years, however, particularly that directed
toward HIV/AIDS, the effectiveness and efficiency of coordination efforts has become a
major issue. With fifteen development partner agencies now active in Lesotho, donor
coordination occurs through monthly meetings of a Development Partners Consultative
Forum, inaugurated in 2005, co-chaired by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and DCI. The co-chairs of the Forum meet with MOHSW every six weeks ((`six-
weekly meeting"), and all partners participate in MOHS W-led Joint Quarterly and Annual
Reviews of the health sector. Yet interviews with key stakeholders reveal lingering questions
about the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of these coordination mechanisms.

2. Health Sector Reform Project
Background and Context for Health Reform
2.1                    ~~
        In the 1 9 9 0 the health sector was widely perceived to have deteriorated in quality,
while costs to the consumer had increased. Despite higher per-capita expenditures on health
than sub-Saharan African averages, health status indicators lagged; money was not
effectively buying health. An estimated 30 percent of the population did not have access to
basic health services, and key health status indicators were either stagnant or worsening.
Ministry budgets were regularly underspent (by 3- 15 percent over the period 1991- 1995),
largely due to a lack of financial information to inform decision making, unrealistic
estimations of implementation capacity, and an inflexible financing system that did not
permit reallocation within the sector. Furthermore, sector expenditures were not aligned with
stated objectives: up to 40 percent of the recurrent budget was being spent on Queen
Elizabeth I1 Hospital, despite a stated commitment to primary care. Geographic inequities
were evident, with per capita expenditures on primary and secondary care ranging from 23
Maloti in Mohale's Hoek to 90 in Maseru.

2.2     Shortly after the country's first democratic elections in 1993, the Ministry of Health
held a workshop to define its strategy and policies for the subsequent decade. A national
health policy was defined that year, with a commitment to progressive attainment of
universal coverage of essential health care, social justice, and equity. A National Health
Sector Plan 1995-2000 also emerged from the 1993 workshop, identifying six key areas for
policy and institutional reform: financial reform, reform of human resources, decentralization
of services, a district health package, safe and effective supply of pharmaceuticals, and better
coordination of donor efforts.

2.3      Building further on the 1995-2000 plan, a February 1996 conference called together
all of the major stakeholders in the sector, producing a more comprehensive implementation
strategy. The Government's 1999 health policy (Government of Lesotho 1999) called for a
sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health care
services throughout the country. It was supported by WHO, AfDB, the Bank, and the EU
with training and significant financial and technical assistance. Bank-supported analytic work
in 1999 led to the production and marketing of a user-friendly document explaining the
rationale for health system reform and intended to mobilize public support (MOHSW and
World Bank 1999). It was this experience in collaborative analytic work and policy
formation, together with widespread recognition of the need for donor harmonization and
political consultation, that led to the adoption of the sector-wide approach in 2000.

Design
OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS

2.4    The HSRP was designed as the first phase of a three-phase adaptable program loan
(APL) to support a ten-year Health Sector Reform Program (2000-2009) whose objective,
according to both the Development Credit Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document,
                                                    8


was to achieve a "sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative, and
rehabilitative health care services in Lesotho." This project, designated as Phase I:
Strengthening Institutional Capacity (2000-2003), was intended to lay the foundation for
Phase I1 (Policy and Institutional Reform, 2003-2006, piloting or testing, critically assessing,
and revising proposed reform strategies), and Phase I11 (Nationwide and Sector-Wide
Implementation, 2006-2009, bringing to scale strategies for which there was established
evidence of effectiveness). The Program and this first phase were to be co-financed by the
Government and other core health sector development partners. The MOHSW and these
partners were to define common systems, procedures, and standards to support a longer-term
objective of disbursing donor and Bank support as time-slice financing against a single sector
budget. It was thought that the timeframe required to realize sustainable institutional change,
combined with the opportunity to tie allocations to achievements, would be strongly
supported through an APL.

2.5      The objectives of the project, as stated in the Development Credit Agreement,
included language both general to the overall Program objective and specific to Phase I: "to
assist Lesotho in achieving a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative,
and rehabilitative health care services, including: (a) strengthening the Ministry of Health
and Social Work's capacity to develop, carry out, and monitor the Program; and (b)
expanding the capacity of the public sector to respond to HIV/AIDS." While improvements
in service delivery targets and health outcomes were Program objectives, they were not
anticipated as results of Phase I. The PAD indicated that, by the end of the first phase, the
MOHSW should have been able to collect and analyze information, formulate and assess
sectoral strategies for improving equity, quality, and access, meet international standards for
financial management, monitor progress against a stated workplan towards measurable
targets, evaluate strategies, and attract and retain qualified staff.

2.6        According to the DCA and the PAD, the project (Phase I) contained six components:

      A.    Financial Planning and Management (US$l .13 million), including the strengthening

Agreement, were:

   a     Budgetary allocation forecasts for FYs 2004,2005, and 2006 made in accordance
         with health sector priorities indicated in the Borrower's medium-term expenditure
         framework.

   a     Financial data of acceptable quality produced no later than 60 days after the end of
         each fiscal year during the project implementation period.

   a     Quarterly reports produced with respect to monitoring and evaluation activities
         carried out under the project for each preceding quarter, not later than 45 days after
         the end of said quarter.

   a     At least 80 percent of professional positions within MOHS W not left vacant for
         more than three months during the execution of the Program.

   a     At least 50 percent of finds granted to Beneficiaries for the carrying out of
         activities related to HIV/AIDS disbursed by the end of each project year.

2.8     The PAD also specified triggers for progression from Phase I to Phase I1 of the

program, as well as indicators to bekmployed to assess achievement of the objectives of the
overall ten-year Sector Reform Program (Annex D).
                                                10


2.9    The $20.4 million project was financed by a $6.5 million IDA credit, planned
counterpart contribution of $3.52 million, and cofinancing from five donors: US$3.4 million
from the African Development Bank; US$360,000 from the European Union; US$1.3 million
from the Republic of Ireland; US$1.59 million from UNICEF; and US$3.73 million from
WHO. Each partner was to contribute resources in its area of comparative advantage.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

2.10 Project management was integrated within the structures of the MOHSW, a departure
from the past practice of implementing through Project Implementation Units, in order to
avoid parallel systems, increase capacity, and integrate the management of the project into
the ministry. The units responsible for planning, implementation, and monitoring functions
were to be assisted by focused, external technical assistance at various management levels. A
proj ect-financed Financial Management and Information System (FMIS) Technical
Assistance Team was to design management systems and their roll-out during the first 24
months of the project; then, following a transition period, a new Project Accounting Unit
(PAU) was to be established at the ministry to be responsible for financial management and
reporting arrangements under the reformed FMIS procedures. Procurement was to be
managed by a new Procurement Unit that would work closely with the PAU. It was
anticipated that bringing these functions directly within MOHSW structures would
institutionalize on-the-job training and learning. All donors to the ten-year sector reform.
program worked through these implementation structures.

2.1 1 Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was to be coordinated by a newly-established unit.
MOHSW constructed a Logical Framework to demonstrate how sub-sectoral outcome
objectives (for infrastructure, human resources, and financing, for example) would contribute
toward the impact objectives of the Program, and how Project activities would contribute
toward sub-sectoral outcome objectives. This Framework also contained indicators for
monitoring progress and achievement. Donor missions were to be coordinated around Joint
Annual Reviews each October to reduce the burden on Government to report to multiple
agencies, and also to support efforts to maintain a comprehensive perspective on the sector.
A baseline survey of the Phase I performance indicators was to have been supported under
project preparation, with the results available prior to project effectiveness.

2.12 To facilitate and expedite the implementation of the HIV/AIDS component of the
project, an implementing agency was to be contracted by the National AIDS Control
Program to manage, monitor, and evaluate AIDS-related activities supported by the project.
The vehicle for implementation of most of the HIV/AIDS interventions was to be NGOs and
CBOs, with activities undertaken within the framework set out by the National AIDS
Strategy and Annual Implementation Plans to be prepared by the contracted implementing
agency.

Implementation
                    COST AND FINANCING
PLANNED VERSUS ACTUAL

2.13 The project was approved on June 30,2000, and became effective on January 3 1,
2001. Total actual costs were US$19.53 million, or 95 percent of the original estimate. Of
the IDA credit of US$6.50 million equivalent, US$6.16 million, or 94.8 percent, was actually
spent. Actual cofinancing was US$12.11 million, about 120 percent of initial estimates. The
Government?s actual counterpart contribution of US$0.82 million was only one-quarter of
what was planned. The project spent about double what was planned on the Financial
Planning and Management component and over triple what was planned on Planning for
Phase I1 Activities, while underspending at 50 percent of planned amounts for Planning and
Monitoring, 8lpercent of planned for Human Resources Development, and 20 percent of
planned for Partnerships (Annex Table C. 1).

2.14 The closing date for the project was extended once, by fifteen months, to June 30,
2005, to allow additional time for achievement of the triggers to move to Phase 11.

            EXPERIENCE
IMPLEMENTATION

2.15 Human Resources: Staff shortages at all levels affected the pace and success of
implementation. Rapid staff turnover (including at the highest levels of MOHSW) and
transfers to other ministries after undergoing training exacerbated these problems. The
project?s mid-term review (November 2002) expressed concern regarding the lack of
counterparts for consultants and follow-up on consultancies, resulting in a situation where the
MOHS W remained reliant on expensive consultants because it did not always internalize the
capacity intended to be built through the consultancies.

2.16 Lesotho AIDS Program Coordinating Authority (LAPCA): The condition of
disbursement of the HIV/AIDS component was met only in August of 2002, when Crown
Agents South Africa was contracted to supply implementation support to LAPCA, the
institutional coordinating body in the country for the HIV/AIDS response. A significant
amount of time was lost developing the terms of reference for this contract and conducting
the recruitment. Throughout its existence, LAPCA lacked full government support; it did not
have a legal status and lacked critical staff. The head of LAPCA was dismissed without clear
reason in 2003, with a new director not appointed for two years, toward the end of the project
period. It was also clear that MOHSW and LAPCA had not agreed on their respective roles
and responsibilities, leading to unnecessary duplication (of, for example, procurement of
home-based care kits) and lack of harmonization of guidelines for implementation of
prevention, care, support, and treatment activities. All of this turbulence produced
unanticipated delays in HIV/AIDS grants approval and processing and rampant speculation
about LAPCA?s demise. In September of 2003, a UNDP-led donor proposal was presented to
the Government recommending the formation of a National AIDS Commission, while the
Bank continued to advocate for strengthening LAPCA so that it would be able to play the

? The mid-term review called the production, retention, deployment, capacity, motivation, and security of staff
the single greatest challenge for the health and social development sector of the country.
                                                  12


Secretariat role whenever a commission or council was constituted. Eventually, the National
AIDS Commission (NAC) replaced LAPCA in September of 2005.

2.17 CHAL: A Government/CHAL partnership study was commissioned in 2000,
proposing a framework for formalizing the process of coordinating the Government-run
health care system with CHAL institutions and facilities. In December of 2002, a
Supplementary Emergency Financing Facility was signed, providing for salary subsidies and
additional funding to bring all CHAL institutions to a threshold level equivalent to 20 percent
of their annual operating costs during a two-year interim period, while arrangements were
supposed to be made for a long-term Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). After repeated
delays, the MOU was finally signed in February of 2007.

2.18 Decentralization: The MOHSW was committed to a process of progressive
decentralization, where authority and accountability for primary health care would be passed
to local authorities as soon as sufficient capacity was attained at that level. Milestones that
would trigger the handover of facilities to local councils had not been developed by project
closing, however, and it was not clear whether the ministry would grant authority to local
councils to manage the delivery of the district health package. It should be noted that
decentralization was an intensely politicized issue, and trade-offs were sometimes made
based on non-technical considerations. Piloting of decentralization in three districts started
late and encountered two additional constraints: late election of local councils, and failure to
designate cost centers for the District Health Management Teams (DHMT), resulting in
inadequate work space and equipment. By project closing, the DHMTs in the three pilot
districts had been set up, and efforts were ongoing to expand the DHMT approach to the
entire country. Linkages between MOHS W and local government were still weak, however,
leading to confusion at the district level, where district health officers did not know whether
they were answerable to the local council or to the Ministry of Health. The process was
further complicated by the establishment of Community Councils through the Ministry of
Local Government, in essence inaugurating a government-wide decentralization process that
lagged that in the MOHSW by several years and in many ways was not congruent with it.
By the end of the project period, a final decision was taken to decentralize health centers and
public health functions but retain hospitals under central administration.

2.19 Userfees: The possibility that user fees constituted a barrier to access by the poor
was an ongoing concern, with widespread perception that the existing exemption policy was
poorly implemented. In addition, during the project period, Malawi and Lesotho were the
only two Anglophone sub-Saharan African countries that did not allow for the retention of
user fees within the health sector. In response to previous requests to retain revenues, the
Ministry of Finance had cited concerns about financial accountability. With improvements in
financial management and accounting capacity during the life of the project, it became
appropriate to request from the MOFDP permission to pilot retention of user fees in a small
number of districts, and to test ways to improve implementation of user fee
exemptions/waivers to avoid the adverse distributional impact of improved revenue
collection and retention. Toward the end of the project period, the Government decided to
abolish user fees altogether at the clinic level; concern remained about the lack of fee
retention at the district hospital level, reducing staff incentive to collect.
2.20 Sector-wide Approach: This Health Sector Reform Program was the first attempt by
the health sector to use one consolidated plan as the basis for mobilization of resources for all
development partners. Joint missions have become standard, and Annual Joint Program
Reviews have been held and attended by all partners since 2000. The move to a three-year
sector expenditure plan in 2005 made this process more efficient in many ways, and the first
Annual Joint Review of the sector expenditure plan (conducted in 2008) found it to be
comprehensive, costed according to program activities, and focused on key priorities. Donor
funds are not pooled, but in concept the sector operates according to a SWAP in most other
senses of the term: a long-term, joint strategic approach; annual joint reviews; common
financial, accounting, and procurement procedures and institutions; common M&E systems;
and a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) that coordinates financing. The Bank
times its missions to coincide with the Joint Annual Review and other key decision points;
Bank missions serve to focus the attention of Government and other players on key issues
requiring resolution.

2.21 The SWAP approach is clearly most visible during the Joint Annual Review. Many of
the policies set and decisions made during this annual process, however, lack follow-up.
MOHSW rarely calls upon development partners to work together outside the mandated Joint
Annual Review process, and over the last two years, there has been a trend for bilateral
donors to sign their own separate MOUs with MOHSW in addition to the joint Health
Development Partners MOU that defines the SWAp. There is some indication that MOHSW
would like to control its relationships with bilateral donors independently, rather than
overseeing a process in which those donors collaborate with one another. In other words, the
joint sector planning process appears much more coherent on paper than it does in reality.
Several key development partners observed that there is still no genuine common strategy
among donors, resulting in persistent geographic and programmatic overlap and gaps, The
monthly health partners' forum is viewed by some as extremely useful, but by others as
problematic, with rare development of action plans and even more uncommon action on
those plans. Perceptions of the SWAp's success vary from development partner to
development partner, as does the level of participation in joint forums. Interviews with
stakeholders revealed a common perception that the donors who bring substantial resources
of their own to the table see limited value in collaborating with others.

outputs
2.22 Technical assistance was contracted to develop FMIS software, which was piloted at
the new Project Accounting Unit. The software was successfully employed and improved the
management of the capital budget, as evidenced by several consecutive years' worth of
satisfactory audit reports. Accountants were trained and equipment was procured, including
computers. The Financial Management Unit was established within the Health Planning and
Statistics Unit (HPSU), and the Project Accounting and Procurement Units were created
within the HPSU, replacing individual Project Management Units. A Financial Management
                                                       14


Committee, responsible for overseeing financial management across the Ministry, was
established. MOHSW cost centers were rationalized. Financial and procurement procedures
and guidelines were developed and applied, alongside the necessary equipment and training.
One shortcoming here is that the HPSU, which was capacitated significantly and quickly,
came to spearhead the reforms and to hold all of these new structures under its own roof.
While it has been useful to have the HPSU as a focal point of reform, other offices, such as
the MOHSW financial controller?s office, did not receive similar attention, leading to a lack
of balance in capacity.

2.23 A three-year sector expenditure plan was completed at the end of November 2004;
there were delays because the cost centers were defined on the basis of Health Service Areas
while the long-term strategy was to define the district as the basic health planning unit.2
There was also no MTEF for the country that set hard budget constraints for the various
sectors and defined outputs that each sector was supposed to deliver. The Bank, in the
absence of a macroeconomic lending program in the country, had not performed a recent
public expenditure review (the last multisectoral review had taken place in 1999, and the last
health sector review in 1996), and therefore such analysis was not available to inform the
MTEF. In 2005/2006 the MOFDP introduced an MTEF process beginning with a few
ministries, including MOHSW.

2.24 A Pharmaceutical Master Plan was established, based on a report submitted by a
private firm in August of 2003 that had been contracted to conduct a comprehensive review
of pharmaceutical services. On the basis of this Plan, a National Medicines Policy was
approved in September 2004, and a draft strategic plan for implementation developed; a Drug
Regulatory Authority was established to monitor drug quality and ensure that drug selection
was based on an Essential Drug List; tools to facilitate rational prescription, including the
Essential Drugs List and Standard Treatment Guidelines, were developed; appropriate
legislation, such as National Medicines and National Drug bills, was passed; drug awareness
campaigns were conducted; and pharmacy personnel were trained and deployed.

2.25 An Essential Services Package, consisting of selected essential health interventions
that were to address the largest disease burdens in the country, was piloted in three districts.
It included public health interventions (health education and promotion, immunization,
nutrition, integrated management of child health, and environmental health); control of
communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and TB; sexual and reproductive
health, including family planning, safe motherhood, adolescent health, and prevention of
mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT); and essential clinical services for common
illnesses. Although it was defined, it was not costed as of project closing. The Essential
Services Package was to provide a framework for prioritizing public expenditures, provide
benchmarks against which MOHS W could measure disbursements on the basis of equity, and
form the basis of the provider-purchaser arrangement between the Government and CHAL.
The Package was later rolled out to all districts, although the initial pilot in three districts was
never thoroughly evaluated.

including capital investments.

2.26 The process of construction of a new referral hospital was initiated, through an
innovative concept involving public-private partnership. At the end of the project period, the
International Finance Corporation was working with MOHSW and MOFDP to develop the
concept for implementation during Phase 11.

2.27 Under the previous Bank-financed population, health, and nutrition project (1989-
1998), the Government had endeavored to conduct a Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS), but after expending significant resources to collect data it failed to produce any
analysis. The completion of Lesotho's first DHS in 2004 is therefore viewed as a significant
output of the project. It provides robust baseline indicators for assessing the long-term impact
of the project and program.

Outcomes
2.28 During the life of the project, there were improvements in the capacity of MOHSW to
plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate comprehensive health sector reform strategies in the
areas of service delivery, health financing, human resources, drug supply, and infrastructure
development. Implementation of the ten-year health sector policy inaugurated in 1999
continued on track. The financial management and information system in the MOHSW was
improved, with standardized budgeting procedures, integrated planning and budgeting
processes, decentralized cost centers, improved application of budget against plans, and
audits of external funds conducted on time with unqualified reports. A five-year strategic
plan for M&E was developed and institutionalized, with regularly conducted quarterly
activity monitoring reports and annual joint sector reviews, consistent with the sector-wide
approach. The Government signed an interim agreement with CHAL, and a draft MOU was
prepared to formalize the contractual arrangement. A human resources development needs
assessment and strategic plan was completed in 2005, with a Directorate of Human
Resources created and staffed. A long-term infrastructure plan was developed. An Estate
Management Unit was created and staffed. An essential health package was defined to
address the most prevalent diseases and service delivery requirements in the sector, and the
package was extended to referral systems. District Health Management Teams (DHMT) were
established in three pilot districts; it does not appear that these pilots were evaluated before
setting up DHMTs in all districts.

2.29 Overall, most of the triggers relative to this objective set for movement from Phase I
to Phase I1 were met (Annex D), and a Health Sector Reform Phase I1 project was approved
in October 2005.

2.30 Shortcomings included a failure to: (a) fill vacant positions with appropriately skilled
personnel (despite the implementation of the human resources plan, supply shortages and
turnover were overwhelming, and scarce human capital was often not productively
deployed); (b) establish a Health Management Information System (HMIS) that would
managed the required information and evidence to report health sector reform program
indicators; and (c) build capacity of several MOHSW departments and in the districts to
implement the reform program and strengthen service delivery. Although several
infrastructure projects were implemented, overall infrastructure development took place in an
ad hoc fashion; the EMU did not carry out effective implementation of the infrastructure plan
                                                 16


in a way that included preventive maintenance and the construction of facilities that would
accommodate the implementation of the District Health Package and decentralization.

2.3 1 Total per capita health expenditure more than doubled between 2001 and 2005 (from
US$16 to US$42), but the impact of that increase was eroded by appreciation of the South
African Rand and inflation. Government health expenditure in constant Maloti decreased at
an average annual rate of four percent between 2001 and 2005. As a share of GDP, total
health expenditure decreased from 7.1 percent in 2001 to 5.5 percent in 2005, and public
health expenditure as a share of overall government spending also declined over the same
period, from 8.8 to 6.7 percent (World Bank 2009b; Lievens and Manu 2008b). *

2.32 MOHSW budget execution has worsened in recent years, from over-expenditure in
2004/05 (104 percent) to 87 percent in 2006/2007 (Lievens and Manu 2008b), indicating that
capacity was not built and sustained for even a short period after the project closed. Some of
the factors contributing to poor execution include confusion over the jurisdiction of district
health management teams, late availability of budget allocations to cost centers, budgeting
for staff posts that remain unfilled, and lack of clarification of roles of agencies responsible
for HIV/AIDS. The program with the largest increase in budget over this time period,
Disease Control, experienced the poorest budget execution, indicating a need for
significantly improved management effort and institutional development before further
resources should be allocated (World Bank 2009b). In other words, the main challenge facing
the sector has not been a shortage of financial resources, but the capacity to use those
resources effectively.

2.35 While the development budget was well managed by the Project Accounting Unit,
financial management of the recurrent budget remained a cause for concern. The absence of a
Financial Controller, combined with frequent rotation to other ministries of accountants who
were trained in the MOHSW, undermined the aim of moving toward budget support.
Although Government allocations to the health sector increased in nominal terms between
2002/03 and 2006/07, the rate of spending declined after 2003/04. As of December 30,2006,
the average spending rate of the recurrent MOHSW budget was 53 percent, with the lowest
spenders those units most critical to public health: Family Health at 26 percent, Disease
Control at 20 percent, and HIV/AIDS at 20 percent. District spending rates ranged from 32
percent for Quthing to 65 percent for Maseru. Explanations for the low spending rates
include delays in districts' and units' access to the recurrent budget, which was frequently
not made available until the second quarter of the fiscal year, and a persistent shortage of
accountants and financial management specialists due to a lack of qualified candidates.
Improvements in planning and timely procurement were also suggested to facilitate budget
execution.

2.33 A 2009 World Bank Public Expenditure Management Review found that challenges
remained in the areas of budget execution, internal controls, and fiscal reporting (World
Bank 2009b). Another criticism is that budget allocations are largely on an incremental basis,
mainly on the basis of inputs (such as salaries and operating expenses). The outputs and
outcomes of public spending are not explicitly stated; for example, service delivery targets in
terms of quantity or quality are not set. There remains difficulty with activity-level costing;
budget classification has remained largely unchanged, with programs and subprograms
                                                        17


basically referring to organizational structures rather than to functional orientation; and there
is limited or no integration of recurrent and development budgets during budget planning
(World Bank 2009b).

2.34 Overall, health system development led to little improvement in service delivery over
the lifetime of the project, and health outcomes improved only modestly. Vaccine coverage
did not increase significantly, with coverage of DTP13 increasing from 74 to 78 percent from
2001 to 2004, while DTP3 was basically unchanged, from 72 to 71 percent; coverage of the
first dose of measles vaccine decreased from 63 to 59 percent during this time period, but the
second dose of measles vaccine increased from 46 to 56 percent (WHO data). Antenatal care
coverage (at least one visit) remained steady at around 91 percent (United Nations data).
Infant and under-five mortality decreased modestly. The major reasons for this disconnect
between health system development and trends in service delivery and health outcomes were
the persistent problems in human resources and capacity. In addition to shortages in raw
numbers, there were also problems with: (a) maldistribution, with the Central region much
better covered than the Northern and Southern regions; (b) production and deployment, with
operational inefficiencies in the National Health Training College resulting in some
occupations experiencing excess enrollment while others saw high dropout rates; and
(c) weak human resource systems and management, where problems remained in posting
policies, equity in remuneration, loose promotion criteria, limited opportunities for career
advancement (especially for much-needed nurses), and ad hoc in-service training. In other
words, existing human resources were not effectively deployed and used. Historic wage
differentials between Government and CHAL facilities were not remedied. The politics of
the situation were a further aggravating factor, as elected officials pushed for the creation of
new health facilities - which accrued political benefits to them - without regard to the
challenge of staffing them.

2.35 The MOHSW commissioned a Human Resource Needs Assessment Study in 2002
and subsequently a Human Resource Development and Strategic Plan (2005-2025), and the
ministry's personnel division was elevated to a directorate (and therefore allocated additional
staff at central and district levels). A MOHSW Integrated Human Resource Management
Information System was developed, but it was not compatible with analogous systems used
by the Ministries of Finance and Public Service. The Government, however, was not treating
the human resource situation as a crisis during this time period, and MOHSW was
constrained by lack of priority accorded to the issue in other ministries.

EXPAND CAPACITY OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO RESPOND TO HIV AND AIDS: MODEST
     THE

outputs

2.36 Policy and technical guidelines, protocols, and procedures were developed for TB,
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, HIV/AIDS treatment, and PMTCT. A National
HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2000-2004) was developed and endorsed, to be coordinated
through LAPCA/NAC at the national level and District AIDS Task Forces at the district
level. The project supported non-governmental and faith-based organizations, along with one

public sector institution (Lesotho Mountain Police), to implement interventions for
HIV/AIDS prevention and care, including voluntary testing and counseling, condom
distribution, home-based care, and support for orphans. Data are not available on specific
interventions financed, the groups on which they focused, or their coverage, nor is there an
indication of focus on any public sector institution other than the Lesotho Mountain Police.
A behavioral surveillance survey was conducted in 2002, with preliminary results not yet
available at the time of project closing. The Lesotho/South Africa working committee was
revived, and collaboration on cross-border referrals, HIV/AIDS , and disease surveillance
took place. Collaboration with traditional healers improved through regular dialogue and
training on HIV/AIDS and referral to the regular health system.

Outcomes
2.37 The formal triggers relative to this objective set for movement from Phase I to Phase
I1 were largely met (Annex D), but none of these three triggers (development of guidelines
and protocols, evaluation of prevention interventions, and increased participation of the
private sector and NGOs in HIV/AIDS prevention and control) is indicative of outcomes
related to the development objective of increasing the capacity of the public sector to respond
to HIV/AIDS. There is little evidence to indicate increased activity in the public sector,
coverage of public sector activities, or efficacy of activities implemented in or by the public
sector. For example, there are no data on numbers of public sector employees trained, the
coverage of that training, and its impact.



OUTCOME

2.3 8 The project had Substantially relevant development objectives, but Modestly relevant
design, Modest achievement of both objectives, and Modest efficiency. Taken together,
these ratings are indicative of significant shortcomings, resulting in a Moderately
Unsatisfactory outcome of the project as a whole.

2.39 Relevance of Objectives is rated Substantial. The project aligned precisely with the
objectives of the Government health sector strategic plan, and its objectives were responsive
to sector issues and challenges in the country. Poverty in Lesotho is deemed not only chronic
but self-perpetuating, as the poor have very low utilization of social services such as health
care which, in turn, causes further impoverishment. According to a survey of 4 10 households
carried out in 2002 by the University of Lesotho, 30 percent of respondents cited protracted
sickness of a household member as a major cause of household poverty, with an additional
16 percent citing the death of a breadwinner (World Bank 2005b). The link between health
and the potential for economic development was particularly strong during the project period,
when migration to South Africa was still the main source of labor for Basotho males who
could only work abroad if their health permitted. The project also responded to the current
Country Assistance Strategy, approved in 2006, which has as objectives fighting the
HIV/AIDS pandemic, improving human development outcomes and decentralization, and
service delivery and M&E.
                                              19


2.40 Relevance of Design is rated Modest. Project design responded explicitly to lessons
learned about sustainability of achievements within previous sector operations. Previous
efforts at development assistance in Lesotho's health sector had focused on improvements in
priority health programs, but not on improving the ability of local institutions to evolve and
respond independently to local health needs. This Program therefore prioritized, in Phase I,
the strengthening of institutional capacity, to ensure that the government institution charged
with assessing health needs and designing cost-effective and affordable responses had the
capability to do so. In other words, the justification for this approach was the achievement of
a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health
services. The development of a single program plan and budget was to reduce fragmentation
of financing to the sector, improve technical and allocative efficiency, and ensure that
investments were sustainable.

2.4 1 Equally importantly, the development of common implementation procedures was to
ensure that donors would have a vested interest in building the institutional capacity of the
Government to make allocation and disbursement decisions, implement strategies, and
evaluate impact, rather than establishing individual project management and implementation
units that would rely on temporary capacity and systems. A Poverty Reduction and
Management Group study in 2006 supported this approach, finding that the only realistic
option for increasing fiscal space for the health sector was to enhance governance and
improve efficiency of spending (World Bank 2009b).

2.42 The inclusion of an explicit HIV/AIDS component to the project came in response to
a request from Bank management. Because the MOHSW's National AIDS Control Program
was weak, LAPCA had not yet been established, and other government ministries were
undertaking almost no HIV/AIDS activities, the project team at first argued that the addition
of such a component without adequate preparation would inappropriately strain weak
implementation capacity. The compromise decision was to add a relatively small amount for
HIVIAIDS (US$2 million), require the government to contract implementation support, and
specify that the funds be disbursed primarily through non-governmental actors. This
coalesced well with the approach of the Bank's Multi-Country AIDS Program and its focus
on channeling money to a range of actors to implement national strategy; the inclusion of this
component brought important attention to an issue that was politically sensitive at the time.

2.43 However, it is a significant shortcoming that program components and activities did
not map appropriately to the project's objectives. Given the high level of understanding of
the sector's human resource challenges during project preparation, the project .did not
sufficiently incorporate concrete plans for increasing and sustaining performance in the
sector; innovative solutions to the human resource retention problem were discussed, but
there were no mechanisms for actual experimentation with or implementation of those
solutions. Project design therefore did not respond to the development objective of
sustainable development of capacity. In addition, most of thefunds for the HIV/AIDS
component were directed toward NGOs and CBOs, even though the objective was to increase
capacity for the public sector response to the epidemic, and project activities also focused on
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, which was not part of the development
objectives.
                                                           20


2.44 Furthermore, the design of the HIV/AIDS component did not prioritize prevention to
groups that were at highest risk of transmitting infection, nor did it attempt to assess and
prioritize the highest-impact interventions; this was despite the fact that a Bank-authored
study on HIVIAIDS in Lesotho, published in October of 2000, had identified multiple sexual
partnerships and increasing incidence of STIs as the two key factors fueling the spread of the
epidemic (World Bank 2000a).4 The Government's September 2000 National AIDS Strategic
Plan identified the same risk factors and priority interventions (Government of Lesotho
2000). Overall, the Bank could have demanded more emphasis on HIV prevention.

2.45 The choice of an adaptable program loan allowed the Bank's operations to be aligned
with the Government's overall health sector reform program, ensured the Bank's continuous
support in a phased approach throughout the reform, and helped to align support from other
partners with the Government's reform program. Debate continues, however, about the
decision to focus exclusively on policy and institutional reform during the first phase,
explicitly deferring expectation of real improvement in service delivery and/or health
outcomes until later phases of the Program. The Executive Summary of the Government's
Program Implementation Report for Phase I is critical of this approach, as are many other key
stakeholders. The priority interventions of Phase I focused on system building in an
environment of declining service delivery, and this was seen as a significant limitation of the
design: at the end of Phase I, there was no significant improvement in service delivery. The
approach, with its resultant stagnation in quality of services, may have had an impact on
public and political support for reform, a problem that was anticipated during some early
project preparation missions but later neglected.

2.46 The MOHSW's 1999 publication, with Bank support, of "Strengthening Lesotho's
Health Care System," may have contributed to this problem by specifically calling attention
to the failure of the health system to address too-high infant mortality, increasing child
malnutrition and maternal mortality, increasing prevalence of HIV, TB, and STIs, and rising
incidence of alcoholism and trauma. Although this document explicitly made the case for
long-term attention to capacity-building and institutional development in the sector, it may
also have raised expectations regarding attention to immediate service delivery challenges.
Furthermore, the focus on system building may have led to an under-appreciation of
emerging immediate needs, such as the rapidly increasing burden of orphans and vulnerable
children. In other words, it may have been the case that health objectives were somewhat lost
as the ultimate aim of the work, and improved processes came to be seen as the goal rather
than the means; at minimum, project design did not include provisions to prevent this from
happening.

2.47 Efficacy of both objectives is rated Modest. The first objective, strengthening the
MOHSW's capacity to development and implement the Health Sector Reform Program, was
modestly achieved, with important systems and plans developed, but human resource
shortages and turnover largely stalling the ability to implement the new plans and policies.
Continued poor budget execution was a result. There is little evidence on outputs or

4. This report further stressed that there had been no study since 1989 to establish baseline levels of knowledge,
risk awareness, and prevention measures against which progress could be measured, and that overall, the
direction and strategy for information, education, and communication activities appeared inadequate.
                                               21


outcomes related to the second objective, increasing the capacity of the public sector to
respond to HIV/AIDS.

2.48 Efficiency is rated Modest. Operating from one sector plan and one logframe led to
the development of one annual review plan and report for all partners, reducing transaction
costs for MOHSW. However, there were costly mismatches in plans and approaches between
Government agencies, including between the ministries of health and finance on the sector
expenditure plan/MTEF, and between MOHSW and the Government as a whole on
decentralization. Despite the common sector plan, the work of donors was not well
coordinated; as more donors were entering the sector (particularly for HIV/AIDS) toward the
end of the project period, inefficiencies resulting from inadequate capacity for coordination
were increasing. Staff turnover led to long vacancies at key positions and inefficient
requirementsfor training and retraining, and to the continued hiring of expensive consultants
because of lack of internalization of capacity intended to be built through the consultancy
process.

2.49 The HIV/AIDS component did not prioritize the targeting of groups most likely to
spread the infection and therefore did not prioritize the most efficient, high-impact
interventions. The delay in the implementation of the component, along with the continued
controversy over LAPCA and its successor, likely reduced the efficient management
ofHIV/AIDS resources.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.50 Risk to Development Outcome is rated Substantial. The project resulted in some
institutional capacity strengthening in the MOHSW, especially in the Health Planning and
Statistics Unit. Questions lingered about the extent to which the gains from the project were
fully institutionalized and sustainable, however, given problems with staff turnover.
Although human resource challenges were recognized from the beginning of project
preparation, actual project interventions were focused too strongly simply on numbers -
filling vacant slots, training more health workers - and not enough on the various kinds of
staff incentives that would keep people in their positions and, importantly, raise productivity.
Interviews with medical staff in the districts, for example, reveal that salaries are not the
primary issue (salaries, in fact, while below levels in South Africa, are above that of many
other countries in sub-Saharan Africa); instead, housing, security, contact and encouragement
from headquarters staff in the districts, and above all the availability of equipment to perform
their assigned tasks effectively are far more important. Although the institution-building
focus of this first Program phase has benefited follow-on operations (see Chapter 5), it is not
clear that the institutions created will be able to mitigate the perpetual human resource crisis.

BANKPERFORMANCE

2.51   Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory.

2.52 Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory. Project preparation activities included
appropriate analytic work (Institutional Capacity Assessment and Health Sector Expenditure
Review), identification of risks, consultation with donors and a wide range of other
                                                        22


stakeholders (including members of the political opposition), political economy analysis, and
careful selection of the adaptable program loan instrument. The Bank was a key player in the
formation and operation of a series of Government Working Groups whose outputs
contributed to the development of the overall 1999 health sector reform program. Project
design, for the most part, responded appropriately to lessons learned from the previous
Population, Health and Nutrition Project (1 989-1998): the need to ensure Government
ownership and commitment to the project, and a focus on institutional strengthening to
ensure sustainability of achievements. The adaptable program loan design, with a phased
approach and pre-defined triggers for moving to the next phase, was appropriate for
achieving the project's objectives.

2.53 More emphasis might have been placed, however, on tailoring activities to the
Borrower's capacity. Although the project included an institutional assessment, there was no
prioritization among the numerous capacity-building interventions, which should have been
important given the complexity of the project and.the large number of triggers (1 4) for
movement to Phase 11. Ironically, given capacity constraints, it may have been preferable to
design fewer and smaller components into a capacity-building project. Although the triggers
were largely met, some of those achievements were not well established. Even though the
Bank was not directly responsible for each of the many areas of capacity building, as other
development partners covered niches according to their areas of comparative a d ~ a n t a g e , ~
overall it was too much for MOHSW to master - and sustain -- in one dose. Greater
selectivity would have been appropriate.

2.54 Because the overall Program design dedicated Phase I to institutional strengthening
and capacity development, most of the project's specified outcome indicators actually
involved outputs: budgets allocated, reports produced, systems established, policies and
guidelines drafted. There was no attempt during project design to determine ways to measure
the quality and sustainability of these outputs and whether they were likely to lead to
achievement of overall Program outcomes (service delivery quality and health status).
Furthermore, Program design did not project specific targets for the end-of-program
indicators that did constitute measurable outcomes; for example, the PAD (p. 5 1) lists as an
end-of-program indicator "increased TB treatment success rate," with no baseline or
magnitudehate of increase specified.

2.5 5 Project design documents accurately identified substantial human resource risks,
acknowledging that the recruitment and retention of staff was essential to achieving and
sustaining project objectives. These documents also correctly realized that Lesotho was
unlikely to be able to compete effectively with South Africa in terms of staff salaries, and
that innovative approaches would therefore be required. The project's design proposed
approaches to reduce rates of civil service attrition included the provision of staff housing,


  The Bank assumed primary responsibility for assessing financing strategy and infiastructure/physical
planning; AfDB and DCI focused on human resource development; WHO and UNICEF focused on disease
control, family health, nutrition, and service delivery; and WHO addressed pharmaceutical issues (World Bank
2000c).
                                              23


greater attention to security issues in rural areas, tying performance to advancement, tying
training opportunities to job functions, and improving procedures for appointments,
promotions, and deployment. It is a significant shortcoming, however, that the project did
not follow through on these non-salary-related approaches to human resources recruitment
and retention.

2.56 There was also an appropriate effort to market reforms. Despite the evidence that the
health sector was not responsive to the population's needs, there was not any vocal
widespread dissatisfaction with the health care system, and therefore the potential for
opposition to allocation of significant resources to strengthening of capacity (particularly
when prioritized over immediate improvement in service delivery) was high. Civil society
organizations were not advocating reform, nor was health reform an explicit issue in the
                                                   The
political debate at the time (World Bank 2000~). Bank therefore appropriately assisted
with the publication of "Strengthening Lesotho's Health Care System" (1999) in order to
market the reform effort.

2.57 Politicization of the civil service was a key issue during preparation, with decision-
making, staffing, and collaboration among staff frequently affected by political and familial
affiliations. This problem came to a head during the 1998 civil unrest in the country. The
Bank team supported small-scale analyses of the cultural background to these schisms and
subsequently contracted a consultant during the preparation process to facilitate team-
building within the MOHSW. Given these concerns, project design could have included
activities to continue the process of professionalization and forging a sense of a common
purpose within the ministry.

2.58 There was also insufficient attention during preparation to the relationship between
the Government and CHAL. Preparation missions cited as an "absolute for success" the
negotiation of an effective partnership agreement, including a focus on compensating CHAL
not merely on the basis of the number and qualifications of its health staff, but instead
concluding - before project effectiveness - an outcome- or performance-based compensation
arrangement. This arrangement was not finalized until early 2007.

2.59 Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. The relationship between the Bank
and the Government remained excellent throughout the project. Supervision and involvement
of management, when necessary, was appropriate, as was expertise within supervision teams.
The task team included a strong skills mix: effective team leadership combined with the
skills of a health economist, operations advisor, financial management advisor, procurement
specialist, health systems specialist, and consultants with expertise in human resource
development, capacity assessment, and other critical areas. Supervision of M&E was
appropriate, with attention to progress on attainment of the 14 triggers for movement to
Phase 11; the Bank team was proactive in recognizing that the triggers would not be met by
the original deadline and therefore in extending the project as appropriate.

BORROWER
       PERFORMANCE

2.60   Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
                                                24


2.6 1 Government performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Since 1996, the
MOHSW had been firm in its intent to develop a single, comprehensive Sector Program
towhich government and all partner agencies would contribute. The Government undertook
its own process, with assistance from development partners, of developing that Sector
Program and a parallel policy regarding HIV/AIDS.

2.62 The budget for MOHSW as a percentage of the total Government budget increased
steadily from 2000/01 to 2004/05, an indication of Government commitment to the health
sector (World Bank 2005b). Government budget details reflect increasing shares to MOHSW
in terms of recurrent expenditures, domestically-funded capital expenditures, and loan- and
grant-funded capital expenditures. Per capita MOHS W budget figures also increased, in
aggregate terms and in terms of specific budget components. Government documents at the
time, however, indicated that health budgets would be unlikely to rise further in the medium
term. These statements could raise questions about the longer-term commitment to health
budgets over the course of the entire health reform program, although it should be noted that
responsible budget management would limit allocations to a sector that was under-spending.

2.63 Lack of continuity in the Minister and Principal Secretary positions in MOHSW
greatly hindered the program and project in its early years. Units within the Ministry did not
communicate and coordinate well with one another. Other ministries, including finance,
public service, and local government, failed to provide strong and timely support, resulting in
damaging delays in approvals for several important policy documents and continuations of
consultancies, transfers of key skilled MOHSW personnel to other sectors, and delayed
appointments for key positions (including the Chief Executive of LAPCA). Perhaps most
compelling was the failure to staff LAPCA at the highest levels at a time when HIV
prevalence was known to be high. These problems diminished in the latter years of the
project, when turnover at the highest levels of MOHSW ceased and the Principal Secretary of
the ministry regularly attended the entirety of the Joint Annual Review meetings.

2.64 Implementing Agency performance is rated Satisfactory. Initially, staff resistance
to health reforms within MOHSW posed major challenges; advocacy of the reform program
was insufficient within the various departments of the ministry and in the districts. Over the
life of the project, however, the ministry has been transformed into a more professional
organization with increased commitment to reform, and many MOHS W staff have claimed
ownership of the reform process. Technical assistance was appropriately deployed for M&E,
financial management, procurement/accounts/audits, pharmaceuticals, infrastructure
development, and human resource development, resulting in additions in institutional
capacity. All legal covenants were met, reports were issued in a timely fashion, and reviews
were conducted as planned. The Project Accounting and Procurement Units are now used by
a number of development partners.

MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

2.65   Monitoring and Evaluation is rated Modest.

2.66 M&E Design is rated Substantial: M&E was to be carried out by a newly-
established M&E Unit within the HPSU. The ministry, with the cooperation and approval of
                                               25


all development partners, developed a logframe for the sector reform program, linking
Project activities to the achievement of objectives and developing a set of indicators for
monitoring progress. Short-term training and technical assistance were to enhance the
capacity of HPSU to carry out M&E functions, and a draft M&E Plan was produced. Donor
missions were to be coordinated around Joint Annual Reviews each October to reduce the
burden on Government to report to multiple agencies, and also to support efforts to maintain
a comprehensive perspective on the sector. A comprehensive Health Sector Report was to be
produced annually to summarize financial and programmatic reports, as well as to report on
core indicators, as the basis of the annual review. A baseline survey was to be supported
during preparation, with the results available prior to effectiveness, and a similar survey
commissioned at the end of Phase I, along with a Joint Evaluation to determine whether the
Program was ready to proceed to Phase 11. The baseline survey was to include data on public
and household expenditures on health, with particular attention to vulnerable and under-
served populations: the poor, those living in rural areas, households headed by single
mothers, and other high-risk groups identified as relevant to the HIV/AIDS component. The
implementing agency contracted by LAPCA was to be responsible for M&E of the
HIV/AIDS component of the project.

2.67 M&E Implementation is rated Modest: At the outset of Phase I, a private firm was
contracted to conduct the baseline survey. Baseline values were not established, however,
because population- and facility-based surveys employed sample sizes that were too small,
and because the Health Management Information System was not adequate to support the
task. Significant technical assistance and training took place among personnel in the M&E
Unit, including post-graduate training across a variety of disciplines (epidemiology, public
health, health economics, biostatistics, demography, and population statistics) in South
Africa. An appropriate manpower mix was therefore established at the central level.
However, an automated and decentralized M&E system was not achieved by the end of the
project period due to the slow pace of development of the HMIS and FMIS. As a result, a
system was not in place by the end of Phase I to produce accurate and relevant data to
monitor the reforms. The HMIS was not operational, data were not routinely collected from
the districts, and therefore data analysis did not take place. Staff levels and skills were
inadequate at the district level, and appropriate tools and equipment at that level were not
present; there were no health information officers deployed at the district level by the end of
the project period. Initial Annual Joint Reviews did not present empirical information on
health status, service delivery, and care-seeking; at these initial reviews, even the
presentation of key indicators missed sources of data that were known to be available. In
sum, although the MOHSW was expected to be in a position routinely to produce accurate
data to monitor reforms by the end of the project, this did not happen. Although initially
planned for 2001, the completion of Lesotho's first Demographic and Health Survey in 2004
was an important achievement of the project.

2.68 Utilization of the data is rated Modest: Significant amounts of effort and resources
were expended on M&E. The project supported a number of studies that generated important
information on human resource planning and management, the pharmaceutical sub-sector,
financial management, estate management, and the QEII Hospital. Although quarterly
reviews of progress in the sector were conducted and quarterly M&E reports produced by
                                                 26


project closing, there was little evidence that these reviews were used for decision making by
senior management.


3. HIV and AIDS Capacity Building and Technical
Assistance Project
Background and Context on HIV/AIDS
3.1      In 2000, the Government of Lesotho adopted a National HIVIAIDS Strategic Plan
and a National AIDS Policy Framework. These were based on a multi-sector approach to the
fight against HIV and AIDS, and embraced engagement with civil society and communities.
The Lesotho AIDS Program Coordinating Authority (LAPCA) was established in 2001 as a
department of the Government Cabinet Office with a mandate to coordinate, monitor, and
evaluate implementation of the national response. Its ability to fulfill that mandate was
limited by many factors, including a lack of autonomy, inability to recruit a full complement
of staff, and the dismissal of its Executive Director that left it leaderless for over a year.
Although the HIV/AIDS unit of the MOHSW had also been engaged in efforts to address
HIV and AIDS since the late 1980s, as a unit under the Division of Disease Coritrol it did not
have the status, commitment, and leadership required to assume the level of responsibility
necessary to lead the sector's response.

3.2      The approval by Lesotho's Cabinet in early 2004 of a document titled "Scaling Up
the Fight against the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Lesotho" reflecfed increased high-level
attention to the epidemic. Endorsement of this document was accompanied by a decision to
create an independent National AIDS Commission (NAC) to oversee the national response,
an autonomous statutory body that in effect reports to the Prime Minister (ACTAfrica 20 10).
The Commission was initially envisioned to comprise an appointed Commissioner and four
other Commissioners elected by their constituents (youth, women, church groups, and people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)), and with an improved LAPCA functioning as its
Secretariat. It was intended to imbue the country's approach to HIV/AIDS with an
appropriate sense of urgency, and it was therefore given improved autonomy, resources, and
staff in comparison with LAPCA. The process of creating the NAC was prolonged for a
variety of reasons, including initially a lack of adequate consultation among stakeholders.

3.3     Meanwhile, in 2002, with support from external partners (particularly the Clinton
Foundation), the Lesotho Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) submitted a successful
proposal to the Global Fund for a US$34 million grant ($29 million for HIV/AIDS and $5
million for TB) to scale up efforts against those infections over the subsequent five years (see
Box 3-1 for an overview of the Global Fund). The Principal Recipient of the Global Fund
resources was the MOFDP, and the two sub-recipients LAPCA and the MOHSW.

The specific goal of the Round 2 Global Fund grant to Lesotho was to "contribute to the
reduction of HIV incidence, particularly among youth, and improve the care and support of
PLWHA and those affected by the epidemic" (Global Fund 2010). The five-year grant's
original start date was January 1, 2004, with the grant period divided into two phases: Phase
                                                      27


1 (two years) was scheduled to end on December 3 1, 2005, and Phase 2 (three years) on
December 31,2008. The Phase 1 budget totaled US$10.6 million, and the total budget
including Phase 2 totaled US$29.3 million. Specific target groups and beneficiaries were
youth and PLWHA. Strategies included youth education and prevention, behavioral change
communication (BCC) and community outreach, condom distribution, prevention of mother-
to-child transmission of HIV, care and support for the chronically ill and their families,
antiretroviral treatment and monitoring, HIV counseling and testing, care and support for
orphans and other vulnerable children (OVCs), stigma reduction in all settings and respect
for confidentiality, policy development (including workplace policy), and information
 systems and operational research.

 Box 3-1: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria
 The Global Fund was established in January of 2002 as a mechanism to support national programs to
 combat AIDS, TB, and malaria. It is a financing agency, with grant application and implementation the
 responsibility of country-based Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) composed of government,
 NGO, donor, faith-based, and private sector stakeholders. Grants are signed for an initial period of two
 years (Phase l), and are extended for longer periods (Phase 2, from year three through the end of the grant
 period) only after review of achieved results. The Global Fund operates as a financing instrument and
 does not provide the kind of supervision or implementation support typically provided by the Bank or a
 bilateral donor. Monitoring of programs is carried out by staff in Geneva.

 To date the Global Fund has committed US$19.3 billion in 144 countries to support prevention,
 treatment, and care interventions for all three diseases. Applications for funding are, as a rule, accepted
 only from CCMs, and they are accepted not on a rolling basis but in designated Rounds. Applications are
 currently being accepted for Round 10, with proposals due in August 20 10.

 Lesotho's CCM is chaired by the Principal Secretary of the MOHSW, with a representative of the
 Lesotho Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS serving as Vice-Chair. CCM membership in Lesotho
 is statutorily specified as six seats from government, six from civil society, four from multilateralhilateral
 donor agencies, two from academic institutions, and two from the private sector, with these constituencies
 each choosing their own representatives. The Principal Secretary of the MOFDP is a member, and a
 GFCU representative attends CCM meetings but is not a formal member. The Bank is not a member of
 the CCM. Lesotho's commitments and disbursements from the Global Fund are in Annex E.


3.4      Planned activities (outputs) included efforts to: (a) improve life skills, peer education
training, and HIV/AIDS prevention services to adolescent and pre-adolescent young people,
with specific focus on girls; (b) establish and support youth resource centers and adolescent
reproductive health corners; (c) promote access to condoms for sexually active youth by
installing condom vending machines in youth-friendly corners; (d) establish PMTCT
programs in all 18 health service areas; (e) establish and operate voluntary counseling and
                          0
testing (VCT) centers; ( provide antiretroviral therapy (ART); (g) provide drugs and
supplies (including drugs for opportunistic infections); (h) provide community home-based
care support to PLWHA and their families; (i) develop and disseminate HIV/AIDS-related
policy guidelines and protocols; (i) support OVCs with a basic package of care (including
material and financial support), and include as many OVCs as possible in the school
program; (k) train health service providers in the management of HIV/AIDS; (1) train
community health assistants and volunteers in HIV/AIDS care and support; (m) strengthen
the umbrella bodies of NGOs and other CBOs to coordinate implementation of HIV/AIDS
                                                 28


activities at the community level; (n) provide outreach programs focusing on the human
rights of PLWHA; ( 0 ) ensure HIV/AIDS workplace policies and programs in line ministries;
and (p) strengthen institutions in charge of coordination and management of the HIV/AIDS
response.

3.5     The grant was signed in 2003, and implementation began as scheduled in January
2004. By December of 2005, however, after almost US$8 million had been disbursed, the
Global Fund indicated that its Secretariat was considering issuing a "No Go"
recommendation for Phase 2, effectively cancelling the grant. Disbursement of funds was
relatively low despite the negative effect of appreciation of the local currency against the US
dollar. Concerns included (Global Fund 2005):

     0   Implementation issues: The Principal Recipient (MOFDP) seemed unable to
         coordinate implementation efforts and to absorb the funds of the Global Fund and
         the technical partners to the grant. There was little activity in 2004, and only modest
         evidence of programmatic activity by late 2005. Youth education results were poor
         despite their importance to the program's goals.

     0   Monitoring and evaluation issues: The M&E plan was not being implemented.
         Results were not properly verified and were therefore unreliable. No Data Manager
         or M&E specialist was in place, and there were "laborious and lengthy"
         disbursement processes due to the absence of a continuous results verification
         system. These M&E failures were said to have occurred despite the availability of
         technical support.

         Grant management capacity: There were significant management capacity and
         coordination issues at the Principal Recipient and Sub-Recipient levels. The Sub-
         Recipients appeared to have direct access to the grant bank account.

         Procurement and supply management: There was no clearly defined
         procurement strategy, and capacity was weak. Problems with procurement and
         disbursement functions were seen as likely to impede the smooth implementation of
         activities and coordination among the implementers.

3.6     In sum, the Global Fund observed in late 2005 that although there was potential in the
HIV/AIDS program funded by the Round 2 grant to Lesotho, a variety of key issues were not
being addressed effectively and rapidly, with no clear plan in place to overcome these
obstacles. It was determined that there was "currently insufficient evidence to justify
continued funding."

3.7     Support for the receipt, management, disbursement, and accounting for funds,
implementation of effective interventions, and monitoring of implementation and results was
provided neither by the Global Fund nor by the few development partners operating at the
time in Lesotho (despite their having assisted in the development of the Global Fund
proposal). Although Lesotho's first Global Fund proposal could have encompassed capacity-
building and technical assistance, neither the authors of the proposal nor the Global Fund
appraised the capacity of existing institutions to implement the extensive program. Financing
                                               29


from the Global Fund focuses almost exclusively on HIV/AIDS activities. The challenge
facing Lesotho was therefore how effectively to implement a large amount of external
financing, given limited experience to date and national institutions that were still in the
process of being defined. It was clear that additional financial resources for implementation
were not required from the Bank, that implementation capacity for HIV/AIDS was a cross-
cutting factor in the public sector, and that additional efforts were required to mobilize latent
capacity in civil society.

3.8      The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for Lesotho had been discussed by
the Bank's Executive Directors in 1998 and therefore did not anticipate an HIV/AIDS
capacity-building project. Given the size of the Global Fund award, initial plans for a second-
generation World Bank project in the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) were rejected.
The challenge had shifted from advocacy and resource mobilization to implementation and
delivery on the ground. The Bank's recognition of the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS in
Lesotho, coupled with the obvious capacity constraints in the country, had been firmly stated
in project documents dating back to 2000. The concept for a capacity-building project
specifically to address implementation constraints surrounding the Global Fund grant was
first floated by the task team in the summer of 2003, resulting in a firm decision in November
2003 to rapidly prepare the HCTA project in order to avert the risk that the Global Fund
could suspend its support.

3.9     The HCTA was designed to provide technical and implementation support,
complementary to that being provided by other donors who were supporting Lesotho's
national response to HIV/AIDS (UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, Development Cooperation Ireland,
the African Development Bank, and the U.K. Department for International Development
(Dff D)). Project designers determined that additional financial resources for implementation
were not what was required; rather, targeted implementation support was needed to facilitate
use of Global Fund resources as well as to leverage additional external financing. The project
defined implementation capacity broadly, to include not only adequate systems and
procedures, but also sufficiently competent and committed human and physical resources to
implement proposed activities (World Bank 2004).

3.10 At the time, the Bank had more experience than any other agency in implementation
of national multi-sector HIV/AIDS programs in Africa through the MAP. Through previous
project activity, the Bank was also familiar with the challenges of addressing HIVIAIDS in
Lesotho. The Bank had been working with LAPCA and was aware of the additional
capacities needed to perform its functions. The Global Fund proposal had been built on the
design of the HIV/AIDS component of the Health Sector Reform Project and had been
similar to the design of many MAP projects in the region: mostly grant financing to
communities and line ministries for direct implementation of the multi-sector response.
During preparation of the HCTA, there was extensive collaboration across the various
external partners providing support for HIV/AIDS in Lesotho. The pre-appraisal mission was
a joint mission undertaken together with UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, Development Cooperation
Ireland, DfID, and the Global Fund, and there were additional consultations with the US
Embassy and the African Development Bank.

Design
OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS

3.1 1 The objective of the $5 million equivalent HIV and AIDS Capacity Building and
Technical Assistance Project, as stated in the Development Grant Agreement, was to
"increase the Recipient's capacity to use effectively the resources provided through the
Global Fund grant to support the implementation of HIV and AIDS programs within the
Recipient's territory." The PAD states the development objective slightly differently: "to
increase the capacity of government and non-governmental institutions responsible for the
national response to HIV and AIDS to utilize and assess the impact of funds received for
HIV/AIDS ." Although these objectives are worded differently, their meaning is essentially
the same; both wordings highlight the use of funds, and the language of the PAD on
assessing the impact of funds received underpins the Grant Agreement's emphasis on
effectively using the resources provided. This review will assess the achievement of the
objective as stated in the Grant Agreement, as it addresses the more specific task of
increasing the capacity to use Global Fund resources, and the key performance indicators in
the PAD focus exclusively on performance with respect to use of Global Fund resources..

3.12     The project contained four components:

    A.     Strengthening the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning's capacity for
           overall management of external grant funding for HIV and AIDS programs ($0.37
           million planned), including long-term technical assistance to coordinate between
           the principal recipient and sub-recipients of Global Fund support and ensure timely
           submissions of annual work programs and approval of those work programs by the
           CCM, facilitate disbursement of funds to the sub-recipient's accounts, ensure
           adequacy of financial controls and audits, and ensure timely reporting on agreed
           monitoring and evaluation indicators to the Global Fund.

    B.     Strengthening the Ministry of Health and Social Work's capacity for
           implementation of HIV and AIDS programs ($2.14 million planned), including
           acquisition of technical advisory services, enhancing the capacity of the MOHS W
           to: (a) design and implement effective strategies aimed at changing behavior related
           to HIV and AIDS; (b) oversee the performance and security of drug inventory
           management systems; and (c) establish efficient logistics systems for adequate
           provision of laboratory services; and enhancing NDSO's capacity to procure and
           distribute adequately and efficiently all required drugs and other relevant goods
           needed to sustain performance in the health sector, including expansion of
           warehousing facilities.

    C.     Strengthening LAPCA's capacity for coordination, monitoring, and evaluation of
           national HIV-and AIDS programs ($1.38 million planned).6 Afirm was to be
           engaged to generate and manage proposals submitted for funding through LAPCA,

 At the time of appraisal, it was anticipated that LAPCA would be transformed into or replaced by a National
AIDS Commission and Secretariat that would become the subject of this component.
                                                         31


            strengthen district-level entities, monitor implementation by civil society and
            private and public sector grant recipients, and ensure that appropriate fiduciary
            safeguards and procedures were in place.

     D.     Strengthening involvement of civil society and private sector entities in combating
            the spread of HIV and AIDS ($1.1 1 million planned), including formulation and
            implementation of programs designed to spur the involvement of civil society
            organizations and private sector entities in the fight against the spread of HIV and
            AIDS in an adequate and sustainable manner, and establishment of a coordination
            mechanism. Dedicated NGO and private sector focal persons were to be located in
            LAPCA, and a civil society consortium with substantial grass-roots involvement
            was to be contracted to work with medium and small NGOs and CBOs in
            development of proposals and in implementation.

3.13      Performance indicators and their targets, as defined in the DGA and the PAD, were:7

          80 percent of the Global Fund grant disbursed by the end of the project;
     0    30 percent of the Global Fund grant disbursed through civil society organization;
     0    50 percent of HIV/AIDS sub-projects financed through the Global Fund grant
          implemented in a satisfactory manner; and
          annual reports on all key HIV/AIDS program indicators produced and disseminated.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

3.14 The project capitalized on existing institutional structures. The implementing agency
for the project was the Global Fund Coordination Unit (GFCU) within the MOFDP, which
was also the Principal Recipient of the Global Fund grant. It held responsibility for
overseeing project implementation and monitoring, and for coordinating project support to
the MOHSW and the NAC. However, as with the implementation of the Global Fund grant
itself, the MOHSW's Project Accounting Unit (which was managing funds of multiple
external financiers, including the Bank's support for the Health Sector Reform Program)
managed disbursements of funds against expenditures, and the MOHS W' s Procurement Unit
handled the procurement of contractual services and goods. This institutional arrangement
was complex, involving several agencies, and required carefbl coordination.

3.15 Specific recipients of technical assistance under the project were to be the MOFDP's
Global Fund Coordinationunit; LAPCA and its local arms, the District AIDS Task Forces;
the MOHSW's HIV/AIDS Directorate, M&E Unit, the Project Accounting and Procurement
Units, as well as the National Drug Supply Organization and National Public Health
Laboratory; other government ministries and agencies; and NGOs, CBOs, and private sector
entities throughout the country. Technical assistance was to be contracted to firms and
individuals, except in the case of civil society, where proposals were to be sought from a

' While the indicators in the DGA and the PAD are identical, the targets are not. In the PAD, all targets are set
for year 4 of the project and there are no targets for project closing. In addition, the year 4 target for the frst
indicator is 75 percent disbursement.
                                                32


consortium of large, experienced NGOs and umbrella organizations. Particular stress was to
be placed on expanded and more effective engagement of civil society organizations,
including NGOs, industry, small businesses, churches, and CBOs. Project design explicitly
included a commitment to developing the ability of these many actors to make a contribution
by defining their comparative advantage; ensuring that they employed tested interventions;
and building their capacity to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate effective projects,
and to manage and account for funds received.

Implementation
                    COST AND FINANCING
PLANNED VERSUS ACTUAL

3.16 The project spent more than planned on activities supporting the MOHS W (133
percent of planned) and the National AIDS Commission (120 percent of planned), and
significantly less than anticipated on the Ministry of Finance (65 percent of planned) and on
civil society and private sector capacity development (only $150,000, or 14 percent of
planned) (see Annex Table C.4 for planned and actual spending by component). A
reallocation of funds was done in November of 2007 from the unallocated category to civil
works. This reallocation, and the overall reallocation of funds between components, was
justified to take into account increases in construction costs for the National Drug Supply
Organization warehouse and unanticipated high costs for several consultancy contracts.
Currency fluctuations, particularly a strengthening of Special Drawing Rights against the
Maloti, produced gains that helped to cover deficits. Flexibility in reprogramming helped to
move resources to where they were most needed, although it remains unclear why civil
society activities were funded at levels much lower than had been anticipated.

            EXPERIENCE
IMPLEMENTATION
3.17 The HCTA was approved on July 6,2004 and became effective on January 3 1, 2005,
about a year after the implementation of the Global Fund Round 2. grant was launched.
Project effectiveness was delayed by three months, largely because of the delay in
recruitment of the Chief Executive of L A P C W A C . Disbursement was slow in the early
stages of implementation, with only US$245,000 having been disbursed as of January 2006.
Institutional arrangements began to function relatively smoothly about 18 months into
implementation.

3.18 By February of 2006, after receiving additional information from Lesotho's CCM, the
Global Fund changed its recommendation for Phase 2 funding to a "Conditional Go," with
recommendations for a number of time-bound actions. Among those were several remedies
to be supported by the World Bank, most specifically the hiring (for a period of 3-4 years) of
a Grant Management Agent dedicated to the following tasks: coordination and liaison with
project stakeholders; establishment of a Grant Management Unit within the National AIDS
Commission; procurement of goods and services; disbursement of funds; contracts
management, monitoring, and evaluation; capacity-building of staff of the Grant
Management Unit; capacity-building for line ministries, district AIDS task forces, and
affected communities; and development and execution of an exit strategy and plan (Global
Fund 2006a).
                                              33


3.19 Disbursements picked up significantly as technical assistance contracts were awarded
in subsequent months, but still only 73 percent of funds had been disbursed as of May 2008.
Disbursement delays were attributed to delayed payments on three major contracts: grant
management, behavior change communication, and support for civil society organizations.
The pace of implementation accelerated during the last months of implementation, and 98
percent of planned funds were eventually disbursed. The project closed as scheduled on
December 3 1, 2008, which coincided with the end of the Global Fund Round 2 grant.

3.20 A number of institutional changes occurred during the life of the project, including
the disbanding of LAPCA and establishment of the National AIDS Commission in 2005, as
well as the establishment of the National AIDS Secretariat of the NAC; the upgrading of the
HIV/AIDS Unit under the MOHS W Disease Control Division to a full-fledged Directorate
designed to guide the technical aspects of the national response; establishment of positions
for HIV/AIDS, TB, Data Management, and Information Officers at the district level; and
dramatically increased participation of development partners and implementing partners in
the HIV/AIDS response. Delays in the setting up of the HIV/AIDS Directorate in the
MOHSW, the NAC Secretariat, and the GFCU caused significant slowdowns in initial
project implementation.

3.2 1 There was high turnover of staff after capacity building, with personnel trained under
the project moving to international NGOs, other organizations within the public sector, or
NGOs. For example, all of the staff recruited under the Behavior Change Communication
Unit in MOHSW moved to the NAC because of better conditions of service (with those
MOHSW positions still unfilled). The rate of international migration of staff trained under
the project, however, was only five percent. This dynamic illustrates the need for the
Government to harmonize the conditions of service to curtail destabilizing movement of staff
between government institutions.

outputs

3.22 The project conducted technical assistance as planned, including extensive training of
staff and development of policies and guidelines, for the ministries of finance and health, the
NAC Secretariat, and civil society organizations. Equipment, including computers, vehicles,
and office equipment, was procured. Long-term technical assistance was well integrated in
most hosting agencies and helped to strengthen capacity of those agencies in coordination,
program implementation, and fiduciary issues.

3.23   Ministry of Finance and Development Planning/Global Fund Coordination Unit:
An M&E coordination plan was developed, with manuals, systems, procedures, tools, and
data base. Flowcharts for data were developed, with institutional roles and responsibilities
specified. An implementation plan and budget were developed.
                                                34


3.24 Ministry of Health and Social Work: The HIV/AIDS Directorate was established,
equipped, and staffed. The Project Accounting Unit was staffed, and an accounting procedure
manual and other project reports were produced. The Procurement Unit was strengthened
through staffing and improved record-keeping and procurement documentation. The Global
Fund Coordinating Unit and the procurement and financial management units in MOHSW
became well coordinated in their work, even though they fall under different ministries.
Approval procedures and lines of communication were clear and effective. The National
Drug Supply Organization was strengthened through the creation and staffing of a
procurement department and the production of manuals. Functional warehousing capacity
was enhanced by 1000 square meters. Inventory management and security at all hospitals
were strengthened, and drug supply overall was transformed from a push system to a pull
system. The Drug Supply Manual and Lesotho Standard Operating Procedures were
developed. (This strengthening and related drug supply procedures are regularly cited as one
of the most important outputs of the project.) However, only 56 percent of posts in the
HIV/AIDS Directorate were filled, with high staff turnover a continued challenge. In
particular, there was difficulty filling positions in the Behavior Change Communication Unit
of the MOHS W; all three staff members of that unit took positions with other Government
agencies. This situation negatively impacted the country's ability to formulate and implement
an effective BCC campaign, key to prevention.

 3.25 National AIDS Commission: The NAC Chief Executive was appointed in 2005, and
 the Grant Management Unit was staffed and made fully operational, helping to accelerate the
 disbursement of Global Fund resources toNGOs. A procurement manual was developed.
 District AIDS Coordinators and district AIDS task forces were trained. Public sector line
,ministries were provided with assistance to develop fundable proposals for mainstreaming
 HIV/AIDS activities, and to support implementation. Appropriate fiduciary safeguards and
 procedures were put in place without constraining implementation. A Behavioral Change
 Communication strategy was developed. Ninety-two percent of posts in the NAC were
 filled, a higher percentage than for the HIV/AIDS Directorate of the MOHSW because of
 higher remuneration.

3 -26 Civil Society Organizations: The project established and strengthened umbrella
organizations to enhance coordination among NGOsand increase participation of civil society
in the fight against HIV/AIDS. There were unspecified activities intended to coordinate civil
society functions and increase NGOcapacity to develop proposals. A consultant was hired to
perform an institutional capacity assessment before proceeding with capacity-building
activities, although this work did not begin until late in the project period (July 2007)
(Armstrong 2007). The civil society consultant engaged NGOs effectively, enhanced trust
between Government and the NGO community, and galvanized the civil society movement
within the country. As a result, NGOs are a central part of the national response (as
evidenced, in part, by the Lesotho Council of NGOs being named a Principal Recipient for
Round 8 of the Global Fund). However, capacity-building activities focused primarily on
training and procurement of equipment for umbrella organizations rather than for specific
NGOs.

Outcomes
3.27 Lesotho's Round 2 Global Fund grant was 99 percent disbursed by the end of the
project, almost half of it (47 percent) through civil society organizations. Almost all (93
percent) of the 15 grant-funded subprojects were implemented with a satisfactory Global
Fund rating. Annual reports on all key HIV/AIDS program indicators were produced and
disseminated each year of the project, informing both future programming and
policy/strategy development (see Annex Table C.5 for HCTA achievements against targets).
Key informants repeatedly offer the same bottom-line analysis: in the absence of the Bank's
intervention, the Global Fund's Round 2 grant to Lesotho would have been cancelled. The
capacity to mobilize additional resources for the national program also increased, as
exemplified by additional grants from the Global Fund (Rounds 5, 6, 7, and 8) and PEPFAR.

INCREASE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO USE GLOBAL
         THE                                    RESOURCES
EFFECTIVELY: MODEST

3.28 The objective of the project was not only to increase Lesotho's institutional capacity
to use Global Fund resources, but to use those resources more effectively in achieving the
goal of the Global Fund grant, namely to "contribute to the reduction of HIV incidence,
particularly among youth, and improve the care and support of PLWHA and those affected
by the epidemic." (Global Fund 201 0)

3.29 The Global Fund considers that the targets for the Round 2 grant have largely been
met. By December 2008 the Round 2 grant received a Global Fund performance rating of
"A2," based on "exceeding expectations" for the performance indicators (A 1 rating) but
"adequate" performance (B1 rating) on management issue^.^ All but two of the "top 10''
output targets on deliverables were met or exceeded (Table 3-1, lower panel)." Clearly there
was significant progress, using Global Fund resources, in delivering treatment to HIV-
infected people.

3.30 However, the Global Fund ratings are based largely on meeting targets for delivering
outputs - and not their effectiveness in improving intermediate or final HIV/AIDS outcomes.
With respect to assessing the impact of the HCTA on the effective use of Global Fund
resources, this evaluation must assess, first,'the evidence that HCTA invested in the capacity
of government and civil society to use the resources more effectively (the outputs), and

  The Global Fund rates performance of its grantees along the following scale: A1 (exceeds expectations), A2
(meets expectations), B 1 (adequate), B2 (inadequate but potential demonstrated), and C (unacceptable). The
ratings are based on two main criteria: performance of indicators against targets and management issues.
Ratings of A1 or A2 are considered to be satisfactory.
  "...the performance on indicators rating for this Grant continues to be `A'. However, the inconsistency of data
reported, errors in financial reports and bank reconciliations coupled with lack of action on the TGF's previous
recommendation to provide evidence that HTC are operational, continue to downgrade the performance rating
to `Bl'." (Global Fund 2010, p. 33)
lo There were 14 "top 10" indicators, of which one is not presented here because both the target and the actual
were not set until the last year of the project (and the target was set at 10% of the actual). It is not clear whether
the baseline of "0" for the percent of children receiving ARV prophylaxis is correct and whether this indicator
was to represent only the contribution of the Global Fund or all programs.

second, evidence that any increase in capacity resulted in the more effective use of Global
Fund resources to achieve the Round 2 grant goal of reducing the spread of HIV among
youth and improving care and support among PLWHA (the outcomes).

outputs

3.3 1 Efficacy of government. The overwhelming share of HCTA project resources (97
percent) was spent on building government capacity. The investments in the Ministry of
Finance and Development Planning and in LAPCA/National AIDS Commission were
primarily with respect to improving capacity for program management and procurement. The
investments in capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Work, on the other hand, had the
greatest scope for improving effectiveness of the funds disbursed, as they were aimed at
raising capacity to design effective behavior change strategies, improve the performance and
security of drug management and distribution systems, and improve the efficiency of
laboratory logistics.

3.32 The evidence of improved capacity for effective use of funds at MOHSW presents a
mixed picture. On the one hand, the strengthening of the National Drug Supply Organization
and related drug supply procedures is regularly cited as one of the most important outputs of
the project and has the potential to improve drug availability and thus the efficacy of
treatment programs. This was regularly cited by respondents as one of the most important
contributions of the project. On the other hand, the investments in the technical capacity of
the HIV/AIDS Directorate in behavior change communication - a potentially critical input
into the efficacy of prevention programs - were thwarted by staffing problems referred to
earlier. Only about half of the posts in the Directorate, which is the main government
technical resource for HIV/AIDS programs in Lesotho, were filled, and all three positions in
the behavior change communication unit were vacated after being filled.

3.33 Efficacy of civil society. Civil society organizations implemented nearly half of the
$29 million Global Fund grant, yet HCTA spent only 3 percent of its resources ($150,000,
only 14 percent of what was planned) to build the capacity of civil society to effectively use
these funds. Those investments were made late in the project and primarily in larger NGO
umbrella organizations as opposed to direct investments at the district level and below. The
capacity-building activities were primarily aimed at mobilizing and coordinating NGOs, as
opposed to improving their technical capacity. The Project did not, for example, provide
sufficient support to enable communities to assist the chronically ill and OVCs effectively.

3.34 An independent review of civil society involvement in Global Fund-financed
activities found a number of constraints impeding effective participation: lack of knowledge
and understanding of Global Fund processes; inadequate capacity-building activities, in
particular training that is consistently too short in duration; lack of financial resources,
including for such basic tasks as printing out large documents from the CCM; poor
communication and information-sharing among civil society organizations; continuity gaps
resulting in frequent job-changing from one NGO to another; and an absence of alliances or
partnerships among NGOs (Akoku 2009). l 1 The fact that an independent report issued in

'' This was a review undertaken and written independently by a staff member for one of the umbrella NGOs.
                                               37


June 2009 recommended significant investment in capacity-building for NGOs, including
strengthening of their management and technical capacity, indicates that the project fell short
of its goals in this area. The Bank's follow-on project is addressing this need.

Outcomes

3.35 The HCTA project did not include any indicators to measure the extent to which the
Global Fund grant was used effectively, nor did the Global Fund grant include such
measures. The latter did track three "impact" indicators: infection rates among children born
to HIV-infected mothers; attitudes about people living with AIDS; and condom use among
young people (Table 3-1, upper panel). The infection rate among newborns reached the
target of 15 percent, a reduction from the 25 percent "baseline" from 2002 (Global Fund
documents do not note the source for the baseline value, however). Based on preliminary
results from the 2009 DHS, it appears that condom use among people 15-24 with a non-
cohabiting partner may have risen from about 53 to 67 percent (short of the 80 percent target,
but still progress), while the target of 40 percent of the population with accepting attitudes
toward people with HIVIAIDS was not met (24 percent only). While there has been some
modest progress, it is difficult to attribute this to Global Fund outputs per se or to attribute
the effectiveness to the impact of the very modest HCTA capacity-building investments in
technical capacity for effective interventions. Further, problematic for assessing both the
achievements of HCTA and of the Global Fund grant, the IEG mission was unable to obtain
information on how the roughly half of all grant resources implemented by civil society were
used or their effectiveness.

3.36 Thus, even though there was a large increase in the number of young people, both in
and out of school, taught life skills education, and a large number of condoms was distributed
through multiple channels, there have been limited observable behavioral results attributable
to these activities. For example, according to the Five-Year Evaluation of the Global Fund
case study in Lesotho (Macro International, Inc., 2008), there was no evidence of behavior
change that could have explained a decline in incidence for the period 2005-2007.
Comparing the results of the 2004 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) with the
preliminary results of the 2009 DHS, the percent of men 15-24 who had two or more sexual
partners in the past 12 months fell from 36 to 21 percent, but the mean lifetime number of
partners rose from 4.4 to 5.1. Among women 15-24, the percent with two or more sexual
partners in the past 12 months declined from 9 to 4 percent, but the mean number of lifetime
sexual partners doubled, from 1 to 2.

date. f. Reported for 2003, source unknown.

3.37 Government has not used Global Fund resources to finance prevention activities
tailored to groups most likely to transmit HIV infection (although the country?s Round 8
proposal to the Global Fund includes appropriately targeted prevention activities)(CCM
2008). Incentives to curb the prevalence of multiple partnerships and intergenerational sex
have not materialized. Provision of prevention material through the school system has been
delayed, in part because of perceived reluctance to discuss sex explicitly and to recommend
                                                       39


the use of condoms, meaning that the primary sources of information for youth are NGO-run
after-school and summer programs; this is despite studies indicating broad support for the
introduction of sex education in the national school curriculum among young people, parents,
and teachers (Mturi and Hennick 2005). The "Be Faithful" part of the ABC strategy has been
integrated into several policies and strategies, but policies and communication programs are
not specific on multiple concurrent partnerships, which is particularly important given the
difficulty of translating the term "be faithful" into Sesotho (NAC 2009a, 2009b). Current
policies do not provide evidence-informed guidance on priority populations for intervention,
and programs are not targeting the populations where most new infections happen. Almost no
activities are targeted explicitly toward adults, married couples, and people in lon -term
steady relationships (NAC 2009a). "Migrating" couples have not received focus. " In other
words, there is no evidence that Global Fund resources were spent effectively on prevention
interventions that would importantly "turn off the tap" of new infections.

3.3 8 The 2006/07 National AIDS Spending Assessment (NASA) suggests that only 10
percent of total HIV/AIDS funding was spent on HIV prevention (1 5 percent in 2005/06),'3
and the share of spending for efficient prevention interventions remains quite low (Table 3-
2). The Global Fund's own reporting on Lesotho's Round 2 grant and the Five-Year
Evaluation stressed voluntary counseling and testing and PMTCT. The 2007/08 NASA
showed some improvement, with 12.9 of all HIV/AIDS spending going toward prevention,


 12. Modes of transmission apart from heterosexual sex are apparently relatively rare (NAC, 2008a). Several
studies have indicated the presence of sex work in some locations in Lesotho, but it is not as prevalent as in
many other countries (Leclerc and Garenne 2008). In the 2004 DHS, around 1.7% of men reported having paid
for sex in the last twelve months, and of these, 58% said they had used a condom during their most recent
encounter. There is also, of course, anecdotal evidence of men having sex with men, but there has been no
systematic effort to estimate the size of that population or its HIV prevalence. Injection drug use has not been
reported in the country.
13
   In contrast, 33 percent was spent on care and treatment, 24 percent on program management, 13 percent on
OVC support, and 11 percent on social protection, putting prevention in fifth place on the priority list (NAC
2009a).
                                                       40


but this represented an under-spending of the 20.9 percent that had been planned. In 2008,
only 10.6 percent of Global Fund spending was budgeted for prevention, and 10.4 percent
was actually spent on prevention activities (NAC 2009b).

3.39 There is no unified operational HIV prevention strategy, with no coordinated,
intensive, multi-service approach to reducing HIV transmission and scaling up a
comprehensive range of prevention interventions. In the absence of such a strategy, the
Government instead pursued a highly politicized "Know Your Status" (KYS) campaign,
which allocated significant resources toward mass testing and diverted attention away from
more cost-effective focus on groups most likely to transmit infection (Box 3-2). Given the
significant investments in VCT, there has been no impact evaluation to reveal the extent to
which dis-inhibition behavior has occurred (the tendency of those tested negative for HIV to
return to risky sexual behaviors).

Box 3-2:"Know Your Status"
In March 2004, the Government of Lesotho launched the Know Your Status (KYS) campaign. Designed not
only as an HIV prevention measure, but also as a way of enabling the infected to receive care and treatment,
the campaign's goal was that "all people over 12 years old living in Lesotho would know their HIV status by
the end of 2007." During the launch, the country's Prime Minister publicly took an HIV test, making a
strong statement against the stigma attached to HIV testing (and indicating the high political significance of
the national effort). The campaign received technical support fromWHO and financial backing from the
Global Fund, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the Global Business Coalition on
HIV/AIDS. In the absence of a coherent national HIV prevention strategy, the KYS campaign became the
focal point of the country's prevention efforts.
The KYS scheme planned for 7,200 community health workers to be trained in HIV testing and counseling.
These workers would then offer rapid HIV tests to every household in the country, with everyone tested and
counseled then referred to post-test services according to their HIV status (AVERT 2009). Com<munities
were given wide leeway to determine how testing and counseling would be rolled out.
By October of 2006, however, only half of the planned community volunteers had been recruited, and
conditions of poverty and rural isolation hindered efforts to reach the entire population. A Human Rights
Watch report found some positive aspects of the campaign: there was no evidence of involuntary testing,
only a few unproven allegations of breach of confidentiality, some effort to ensure that testing was linked to
HIV treatment and care services, and great commitment among counselors to bringing counseling and
testing to communities (AIDS Rights Alliance for Southern Africa and Human Rights Watch 2008). The
report also, however, found a tremendous gap between the planning of the KYS campaign on paper and the
capacity to implement what had been planned. Medical staff were in short supply (IRIN 2009), testing
counselors were poorly trained and supervised, there were significant failures to safeguard human rights, and
links between testing and treatment centers were inconsistent.
There are major discrepancies in the reported eventual reach of the campaign: the government cites an
increase in testing coverage from 2.7 percent in 2004 to 17.2 percent in 2007, but Human Rights Watch
claims that only 2 percent of the target 1.3 million people - fewer than 25,000 - were tested through the
KYS scheme by August 2007. A WHO press release stated that 240,000 people in Lesotho knew their HIV
status at the end of the year, but it is not clear how many of those were tested as part of the KYS campaign.
A 2007 survey by the Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS found that, despite the considerable
investment in KYS, there was no preventive effect on workers' engagement in sexual risk behaviors as a
result of HIV testing, calling into question the behavior change impact of post-test counseling (NAC 2009a).
Lesotho's National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan 2006-201 1 includes a target of 80 percent of the population
age 12 and older knowing their HIV status by 20 1 1.

3.40 More could have been done to identify high-impact interventions, including male
circumcision and a more cohesive prevention program focusing on partner reduction and
HIV/AIDS education for youth, and a more intensive integration of HIV services with
traditional public health interventions such as family planning and maternal and child health.
The Basotho are a highly religious people, and opportunities were missed to work with
pastoral voices of all denominations to send appropriate prevention and behavior change
messages to youth and adults alike. Because of lack of effective communication strategies to
engage youth, there are reports that young people are persisting with known risky sexual
behaviors on the assumption that they can remain alive and healthy indefinitely on ARVs
should they become infected. Also, there have been missed opportunities to engage key
men's groups from civil society, such as the Association of Former South African Miners
and the Association of Herd Boys; men-to-men peer forums on prevention, if properly
identified and capacitated, could prove to be efficient vehicles for transmission of prevention
messages. Overall, the Government remains timid about discussion of risk groups and
behaviors that facilitate HIV transmission, preferring to leave these tasks to consultants
rather than engaging necessary subject matter head-on.

Ratings
OUTCOME
3.41 The project had Highly relevant objectives and Modestly relevant design, Substantial
achievement of one of its development objectives and Modest achievement of the other
development objective, and Substantial efficiency in meeting those objectives. Taken
together, these ratings are indicative of moderate shortcomings, resulting in a Moderately
Satisfactory outcome of the project as a whole.

3.42 Relevance of Objectives is rated High. Fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of
four pillars of the current Country Assistance Strategy, making the focus on HIV/AIDS
highly relevant. Indeed, a follow-on HIV/AIDS project was explicitly included in the FY 06-
09 Country Assistance Strategy as part of the Bank's support to the fight against HIV/AIDS
in the country. The project directly supported the Government's priorities as set out in the
2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Vision 2020, the National HIV and AIDS Strategic
Plan (2006-201 l), and the Millennium Development Goals.

3.43 The objective of the national HIV/AIDS program in Lesotho was to control the
spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigate its impact on vulnerable groups, individuals, families,
communities, and the nation as a whole. Global Fund support to Lesotho served this
objective, with activities designed to scale up interventions for prevention, care, treatment,
and impact mitigation, including the expansion of training and education, provision of basic
care to those infected and affected by the epidemic, home-based care, community
mobilization, and promoting civil society and public-private partnerships in the fight against
HIV/AIDS. The HCTA project was designed to provide targeted to support to enable the
recipient and implementing agencies effectively to receive, manage, and assess the impact of
these funds.
                                                  42


3.44 According to the 2007/08 NASA, more than 76 percent of resources for HIV/AIDS,
from both the Government and development partners, was budgeted for direct programs
(prevention, treatment, care and support, and impact mitigation). Increasing resources were
being absorbed relatively slowly due to limited capacity. The National Strategic Plan (2006-
201 1) explicitly called for greater attention to system strengthening and capacity building.

3.45 The recently-published Five-Year Evaluation of the Global Fund notes that Global
Fund grants often require country capabilities that do not exist (Macro International 2009).
An overarching finding from the evaluation is that CCMs are largely ill-equipped - in terms
of resources, capacity, and political will - to either take on or coordinate the myriad
functions required for adequate grant oversight and management. The Bank team was
remarkably prescient in reaching this conclusion years earlier, and in designing a project
specifically to address this issue.

3.46 Relevance of Design is rated Modest. The HCTA project design was uniquely
different from all other World Bank HIV/AIDS projects. It exclusively focused on using the
Bank's comparative advantage to complement the Global Fund grant. The design was
intended to remove capacity bottlenecks and speed up the pace and effectiveness of
implementation of the Global Fund grant. It harnessed the Bank's comparative advantage in
system and fiduciary strengthening in an effort to complement, rather than compete with,
Global Fund and other partners' financing. This innovative design reflected a new
partnership model never before attempted by the Bank in the health sector. The project team
was strategic and innovative in adapting project design to the country situation.

3.47 Project design was flexible, given the rapidly evolving nature of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in Lesotho. New capacity-building requirements and new resources emerged during
implementation, and the project was able to respond appropriately, for example, by canceling
a consultancy that was no longer needed because it was financed by other partners, or by
extending the term of a consultant whose contract financed by another partner was expiring.
Flexibility was occasionally constrained, however, by the fact that some project activities,
particularly consultancies, were not adequately covered by the planned budget.

3.48 Key performance indicators were output-oriented and designed to focus on the
implementation status of the Global Fund grant, which proved to be practical and easy to
monitor. However, this focus emphasized the fact of disbursements and reporting rather than
the quality or impact of interventions, or the use of data or analysis from reports for policy or
program design and implementation. Most importantly, project design did not include, in its
results framework or its indicators, focus on a key part of the development objective:
increasing Lesotho's capacity for effective use of Global Fund resources. Particularly in light
of the stress in a recent evaluation of the Global Fund on this very issue (Macro International,
Inc. 2009), this omission is an important shortcoming.

3.49 There was also insufficient focus on capacity building below the national level. Local
councils, district-level civil society organizations, and private sector organizations were
neglected in project design. As a result, there were problems with parallel implementation
arrangements at the district level, with the NAC, Ministry of Local Government and
                                              43


Chieftainship, and MOHSW all recruiting M&E officers and other staff without appropriate
consultation and harmonization.

3.50 Efficacy of the first objective is rated Substantial and of the second objective is
rated Modest. Capacity-building support provided through the project substantially
increased Lesotho's capacity to disburse Global Fund resources. However, the project only
modestly improved the effective use of those resources.

3.5 1 Efficiency is rated Substantial. Implementing arrangements were efficiently aligned
with those of the Global Fund grant. The project used and built capacity of existing structures
and capacities in the GFCU, NAC, and MOHSW. For example, GFCU, which was the
implementing agency for the project, was also the Global Fund grant Principal Recipient.
The PAU and Procurement Unit of the MOHSW, responsible for managing the funds of
multiple external financiers under the HSRP, also managed the HCTA. The PAU and
Procurement Unit also provided financial management disbursement and procurement
services for the Global Fund grant (although it should be noted that, toward the end of the
project period, the PAU's tasks under the Global Fund grant were transferred to an analogous
department directly within the GFCU, largely because of PAU-caused bottlenecks).

3.52 However, there were some shortcomings. Inefficient implementation delays plagued
the early phases of the project, due to the controversy over restructuring and eventually
eliminating LAPCA, the delay of recruitment of the NAC Chief Executive (which was a
condition of project effectiveness), poor understanding of procurement procedures by user
departments, and inadequate capacity to develop TORS for technical assistance due to
differences of opinion on the roles and functions to be performed under the technical
assistance contracts. Role-definition among implementing agencies was not clear; for
example, while GFCU was responsible for overall coordination and financial management
and expenditure were the purview of MOHSW, much time was lost in trying to decide where
overall leadership would reside. Eventually, an Operations Manager was appointed in
MOHS W, and a Steering Committee with representation from all relevant agencies was
established, but valuable time was lost in realizing these efficiencies.

3.53 As the country's M&E capacity was strengthened, several parallel systems were
created without proper plans for coordination and integration. Each system has created its
own arm at the district level. For example, the M&E system under NAC recruited ten data
officers for the ten districts; likewise, MOHSW recruited ten HIV/AIDS officers and ten
information officers to facilitate health sector M&E in the ten districts. There has been
inadequate synergy between these decentralized units, and in some cases competition
between them and deliberate hoarding of data.

                 OUTCOME
RISK TO DEVELOPMENT

3.54 Risk to Development Outcome is Substantial. The project's contribution to the
country's ability to absorb Global Fund and other donor resources has proven its
effectiveness in attracting additional resources. While donor funds are no guarantee of
sustainability, the increase in financing creates favorable conditions for maintaining and
                                                  44

improving upon capacities that were created, particularly in the presence of a partner such as
the Bank that has focused attention on capacity-building imperatives.

3.55 International technical assistance, however, is a short-term solution to a long-term
problem. It is not clear that the Government adequately planned for absorption of technical
assistance provided by the project to facilitate permanent improvements in local capacity.
Institutionalizing the systems created or supported by the project remains a concern (World
Bank 2009~).   While the positions for head of the NAC and the directodstaff of the HIV
Directorate of the MOHSW have been internalized and are fully financed by the regular
budget of the Government, the MOHS W procurement manager and finance manager
continue to be maintained through external funding. This is mainly due to restrictions arising
from civil service regulations and less competitive salary scales for civil servants. Progress
has been made recently by moving the finance manager position from an international
technical assistant to a local technical assistant, and both the procurement manager and
finance manager are locally hired. Furthermore, the MOHSW has recently formulated a
medium-term plan on building local capacity, and the follow-on Bank project is explicitly
designed to work with the Government to ensure that HCTA-provided gains are sustained.

BANKPERFORMANCE

3.56    Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.

3.57 Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory. The Bank worked together with other
development partners, including a joint pre-appraisal mission, to identify capacity constraints
in relevant agencies. The project team conducted a sound analysis of the financial support to
the technical capacities already existing in government and civil society, as well as the
technical assistance needed from development partners. Partners participated effectively
based on their comparative advantages at the time. Development Cooperation Ireland and
DfID supported institutional capacity assessments of LAPCA, while WHO did the same for
the MOHSW HIV/AIDS Unit. These assessments informed the TORS for the technical
assistance provided under the project. The Bank's role here was catalytic, supporting
innovations in institutional capacity development to increase adequacy of procedures and
systems as well as individual capabilities.

3.58 Some risks were effectively identified, most notably the potentially harmful impact of
lack of consensus over the roles of LAPCA, NAC, and the NAC Secretariat. The Bank's
mitigation measure, making the appointment of a Chief Executive for the NAC a
precondition for effectiveness, forced a resolution of this issue (at least for the short term).

3.59 However, there were some shortcomings at entry, including failure to focus on the
well-known problem of human resource retention, targeting of capacity-building at national-
level institutions at the expense of the district level and below, and failure to take advantage
of opportunities to explore synergies between HIV/AIDS and TB. Lesotho's Round 2 Global
Fund grant application specified the relationship between HIV and TB: the success of the
HIV/AIDS grant would enhance the performance of the TB grant, while the failure of the TB
grant would undermine the potential for success of the HIV/AIDS grant (Global Fund
2006a). The proposal specifically noted that, at the time, TB was the most common co-
                                              45


infection of HIV/AIDS and that the trend was increasing, with sentinel surveillance data from
Maseru revealing an increase from 11.3 percent of TB patients being HIV-positive in 1991 to
49.6 percent in 2000, and an overall increase in TB cases from 249/100,000 in 1995 to
501/100,000 in 2000 (CCM 2002). However, the preparation and design of the project did
not include an analysis of the TB program, and TB was not explicitly a focus of project
activities. Despite this omission, however, the project team provided support and monitored
implementation progress of the TB program during supervision missions. This support may
have been more efficiently and effectively provided had it been initially designed into the
project. The project did not take into consideration possible synergies between HIV/AIDS
and TB to inform integrated implementation arrangements.

3.60 Only three risks to achievement of development objectives were identified during
project preparation, and all were assessed as modest or low: that internal politics would
undermine decisions on how the Global Fund grant would be managed; that the areas
targeted for capacity support would not be sufficient to support Global Fund grant
implementation; and that Global Fund resources would become insufficient to meet demand.
Risks to components identified as substantial related to ongoing debates over the role of
LAPCA and the NAC, and to possible delays in the procurement of consultant services that
would address Global Fund implementation challenges; the identified mitigation measures
were appropriate, if not always effective. Risks related to human resource shortage and
retention were not specified, however, despite overwhelming accumulated experience with
this problem during other projects, and these issues were a challenge throughout project
implementation.

3.61 Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. During preparation, the Bank correctly
observed that even though this was a small Technical Assistance Loan, supervision would
have to be substantial, as the project was in essence serving as supervision of implementation
of the Global Fund grant itself. Supervision missions collaborated effectively with
Government and the CCM to identify and manage proactively implementation problems. The
Mid-Term Review in September/October 2006 correctly identified institutional coordination
problems and recommended effective measures to address them. Supervision documents
reveal that the task team repeatedly expressed concern over the quality of HIV prevention
activities and the pace of their implementation.

BORROWER
       PERFORMANCE

3.62   Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.63 Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Government
commitment remained high throughout, as evidenced by counterparts? special efforts to
attend scheduled meetings with Bank mission personnel even during periods of political
instability, including strikes called by the opposition party in 2007.

3.64 The Government developed appropriate policy documents and strategies to guide the
national response: the National HIV and AIDS Policy, National Orphan and Vulnerable
Children Policy, HIV Testing and Counseling Policy, and Blood Transfusion Policy. In
addition, the Labour Code Act was amended to prohibit discrimination against PLWHAs,
                                                46


and a Legal Capacity of Married Person's Act was passed to empower women. However, the
Government was slow to respond to high staff turnover and both internal and external
migration of skilled manpower, and also to Bank mission exhortations about the need to
focus attention on HIV/AIDS prevention.

3.65 Implementing Agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The GFCU
ensured that annual work programs were submitted on time and approved by the CCM, that
disbursements of funds to sub-recipients were facilitated, that financial controls and audits
were adequate, and that reporting on agreed indicators was timely. GFCU coordination of
both the Global Fund grant and the HCTA was smooth, and staff performance was excellent.

3.66 The MOHSW was the successful beneficiary of capacity-building within the PAU,
PU, M&E Unit, HIV/AIDS Unit, and fiduciary systems. This enabled MOHSW to provide
quality treatment and care to a substantial number of those infected with HIV/AIDS and to
fulfill its role as sub-recipient of the Global Fund grant.

3.67 The NAC was capacitated through the establishment of its Grant Management Unit,
which became fully staffed and operational. Although it has evolved into one of the primary
stakeholders in the national response, questions remain about its effectiveness. The
development of the National Behavior Change Communication Strategy, capacity
development in community M&E at district and sub-district levels, and mainstreaming
HIV/AIDS in public sector ministries has not developed as planned. Political controversy
continues to swirl around the NAC, and it remains to be seen whether it will persist in its
current institutional form.

3.68 The GFCU and Procurement Unit became increasingly efficient at working together
throughout the life of the project, even though they were located under different ministries.
Approval procedures and lines of communication between them were clear and effective.
There were, however, reports of tension between GFCU and NAC over leadership and
control of civil society capacity-building (Armstrong 2007), and the PAU's performance on
the Global Fund grant was perceived to be causing delays to such an extent that its functions
were eventually transferred to another office directly under the GFCU.

3.69 There was poor understanding of Bank procurement procedures by the user
departments. There were delays in procurement of technical assistance due to lack of
capacity in user departments to generate TORS acceptable to all stakeholders and the absence
of clear institutional mechanisms to link and coordinate the various implementing agencies.
This affected all tenders under the project, resulting in a situation where the Government did
not benefit from technical assistance for the first year of the project. Once the procurement
process was successfully completed, however, the value and contributions of technical
assistance were consistently realized. The procurement of goods also began slowly,
particularly for health products such as drugs for opportunistic infections and STIs.
Furthermore, forecasting, quantification, and coordination between MOHS W, NDSO, and
GFCU were not consistent.

3.70 Umbrella civil society organizations such as Lesotho Council of NGOs (LCN) built
capacity to the point that LCN was named a Principal Recipient of the Global Fund Round 8
                                              47


grant. Almost half of the Round 2 grant was disbursed to NGOs, with 14 of 15 funded
subprojects rated satisfactory by the Global Fund.

MONITORING EVALUATION
        AND

3.7 1   Monitoring and Evaluation is rated Modest.

3.72 M&E Design is rated Modest. Project preparation documents state that M&E
requirements for assessing the outcome and results of the HCTA itself would be limited.
Presumably this meant that the success of implementation of the Global Fund grant would
serve as a sufficiently reliable marker for the impact of the Bank-financed technical
assistance. Measures of success for the technical assistance were set at how well systems
were developed and strengthened to generate early and regular information on the national
HIV/AIDS program's outputs and impact, epidemic trends, and the Government's ability to
assess the impact of the national program. There was no provision directly to assess the
performance of the technical assistance that made up the bulk of project-financed
interventions. Supervision missions encouraged the government to introduce a formal
performance evaluation process on the technical assistance and to share that evaluation with
funding agencies, but such evaluation activity was not incorporated into project design.

3.73 M&E Implementation is rated Modest. An M&E Unit in the NAC was established,
with ten data officers recruited (one for each district) to strengthen local M&E capacity. Two
international technical advisors financed by the Global Fund and USAID were put in place to
assist this M&E Unit. An electronic database system was developed to improve overall data
management. The M&E team under the MOHSW HIV/AIDS Directorate took parallel
capacity-building steps, now having several units with qualified staff: Epidemiology and
Research, M&E, and Information Communication and Technology. The MOHSW also
appointed ten HIV/AIDS data officer posts, one in each of the districts. There is an
agreement that the NAC will collect non-clinical data and rely on MOHS W for clinical data,
but division of labor and data sharing remains problematic.

3.74 Overall, the M&E system remains fragmented. M&E planning and design has taken
place at a very sophisticated level, but those plans are grossly mismatched with the capacity
of the staff and systems implementing them. HIV/AIDS data, financial management data, TB
data, and human resource data still run as vertical systems (Macro International 2008).
Preparation documents for the follow-on HIV and AIDS Technical Assistance Project stress
that M&E strengthening requires immediate attention (World Bank 2009~).         Redundant
systems at the district level remain highly inefficient, particularly in a context of
overwhelming human resource shortages. Similarly, the support to M&E from development
partners has been uncoordinated, and various vertical programs have their own systems with
their own specific data needs that are not well integrated with the overall M&E system. As a
result, MOHSW departments collect large amounts of data required by various programs,
overburdening the M&E system while leaving it with critical gaps and significantly impeding
the quality of data and the extent to which data are used.

3.75 Utilization of the data is rated Modest. The Principal Recipients and Sub-
Recipients have collected data on key indicators and used those data to prepare quarterly and
                                                 48


annual reports, including Joint Annual Review reports. These M&E reports were used to
formulate key policy and strategy documents such as the National HIV/AIDS Policy, the
National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2006-20 1l), and the National HIV/AIDS Coordination
Framework. Improved capacity was also used to conduct research studies and surveys such
as HIV/AIDS workplace and drug stock studies, antenatal epidemiological sentinel
surveillance, surveys on gender and multiple concurrent partnerships, and a modes-of-HIV-
transmission study. However, data use remains limited due to system fragmentation, the
planning cycle not being synchronized with the reporting cycle, and limited advocacy using
strategic information (NAC 2008a).


4. Conclusions and Lessons

Health Reform
4.1     Country ownership and commitment to the reform process are key to successful
implementation. The HSRP was preceded by extensive consultation among stakeholders on
the vision for reform. Implementation of the project increased ownership of the reform
process, but staff turnover was high. Ownership and accountability for the reform program
was not sufficiently rooted within all MOHS W departments and units and the health sector in
general; the HPSU was the only department well-versed with the reform program.
Communication within the MOHSW remains weak. Similarly, lack of coherence on
decentralization pace and scope between MOHSW, MOFDP, the Ministry of Public Service
(MOPS), and the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftainship led to inefficient
deployment of scarce resources. The MOHS W should be encouraged to be more proactive
and consistent in promoting the content and image of the reform program both within and
outside the ministry. Throughout HSRP, the HPSU spearheaded the reforms, a task it
managed partly due to stability in leadership and staffing. But ownership of the reforms must
be more widespread across the sector to ensure accountability for results and to build up a
pool of champions for the process.

4.2     Political economy analysis must be ongoing. Even issues that are seemingly resolved
can re-emerge unexpectedly. For example, there are current political controversies swirling
around the NAC, with continuing rumors that it is about to be dissolved. Other agencies
question its usefulness and critique it as simply an additional layer of bureaucracy; certainly
other Government departments, particularly MOFDP/GFCU, would like to absorb its budget
along with its functions, and the MOHSW would like exclusive purview over HIV/AIDS
transferred back to its HIV/AIDS Directorate. Given that the NAC's initial creation was
viewed by many as simply a quick political fix, intended to placate public outcry over the
increasing number of AIDS-related illnesses and deaths, it is not surprising that it remains
controversial, in many cases merely a tool in ongoing power struggles. These ongoing
internal political skirmishes have been tactfully mediated by the Global Fund and especially
by the Bank, but neither external agency managed to stifle the feud. In retrospect, some
informants suggest, perhaps less tact and a more forceful approach would have been
appropriate. It should be noted, however, that competing agencies - in part due to Bank
persuasion - have continued to function relatively well together at the technical level.
                                                49


4.3      There is a strong need to balance improvements in health sector processes with a
focus on improving health services delivery - and it may not always be necessary to assume
that there are tradeoffs between the two. Stakeholders across the sector stressed that
institutional capacity is key to adequate functioning of the health system, but attention to
service delivery, quality of care, and health outcomes cannot be deferred, particularly when
health indicators are declining.

4.4     Health sector reform does not and cannot take place in a vacuum. In the case of the
HSRP, the lack of a macroeconomic support program to push for difficult policy issues
outside the purview of the MOHSW probably constrained or delayed actions, particularly in
the areas of decentralization of services and upgrading the salaries and benefits of health
workers (civil service salaries being a system-wide issue). A dedicated local government
support program could have helped the project sort out knotty institutional issues among the
ministries of finance, local government, and technical lines agencies on these issues. Lack of
progress or clarity on "upstream" issues - most importantly, setting the rules of the game for
an eventual fiscal devolution to local authorities - meant that "downstream" activities within
the health sector itself had to be deferred, or redesigned to fit within the purview of only the
health sector.

4.5    The use and strengthening of existing systems is preferable to the creation of new and
separate fiduciary and other systems. The successful strengthening of capacity in the project
accounting and procurement units underscores the value of using and building on existing
systems.

4.6     Sustainable human resources retention requires long-term planning, ownership, and
innovation. Like many countries in the region, shortage of skilled manpower is one of the
main challenges facing the Government of Lesotho. Although Bank-financed projects have
helped to build capacity in government and non-government institutions, staff that are critical
to delivery of services, particularly nurses and doctors, migrate freely to neighboring South
Africa. Other staff that have been empowered under the Bank project have left those
positions, moving internally or to other institutions, and staff at the district level have moved
to the capital. The Government, Bank, and other development partners remain faced with the
challenge of formulating innovative and affordable manpower development and retention
policies and strategies. It cannot be overstressed that innovation is required in this area.
Levels of remuneration, while important, are not the primary issue. Staff in rural areas cite a
variety of more compelling factors that make it difficult for them to attract qualified
personnel: neglect by senior management and headquarters offices, who virtually never
spend time outside Maseru conferring with service providers at the health facilities
themselves; housing and security; and most importantly, lack of resources, especially
equipment and vehicledfuel, that would make it possible for staff to perform their main task
- saving lives - effectively. It is also not clear that an exclusive focus on supply-side issues is
appropriate in the human resources area, If all staff worked to full capacity, the situation
would be improved greatly, but existing approaches have not focused on the productivity and
duplication sides of the equation.

4.7    Caution must be exercised to ensure that countries do not become over-dependent on
technical assistance, and that technical assistance is reasonably priced and appropriately
                                                   50


monitored. It is important to ensure that implementation capacity remains after provision of
technical assistance has ended. This can take place through support for capacity-building of
existing local staff (through external training or on-the-job training) as well as specific skills
transfers. Building local capacity and skills should be included in technical assistance
contracts, and the Bank should work with Government to develop medium- and long-term
plans to internalize key positions. In making a decision about whether to import expertise or
build local capacity, the local context and ability of the country to employ or transfer skills
from technical assistance to local staff should be taken into consideration.

4.8     It is also important, however, to balance training meetings, seminars, and workshops
with the implementation of operational plans. In most work plans for the MOHSW, training
constitutes more than 40 percent of the activities planned for the year (MOHSW 2008a).
Many staff prefer training sessions to the undertaking of their regular responsibilities,
because of the additional stipends and meals that are frequently made available.
Consideration should be given to on-the-job training methodologies as an adjunct or
alternative to traditional seminars and workshops.

4.9     Some procurement delays have been caused by lack of clarity between user
departments on the functions to be performed by various technical assistance consultants.
There should be a coordination mechanism within implementing agencies to lay out, from the
beginning, clear responsibilities for each departmentbit. Streamlining institutional
arrangements and roles of various components at the design stage is a necessity for avoiding
implementation delays. Individual technical assistance provision should be evaluated for
effectiveness in terms of capacity built by the client entity.

4.10 Civil society in Lesotho remains relatively neglected, and its potential to contribute to
the solution of a wide array of problems in the country is underacknowledged. This is a
particularly significant gap considering the magnitude of donor funds flowing to Lesotho to
support the response to HIV and AIDS, and the growing proportion of those funds that now
supports local, non-governmental organizations and other civil society entities. The Bank
project took important initial steps to assess and close this gap, and naming the LCN as a PR
for the Round 8 Global Fund grant is a landmark achievement. More effort is required,
however, to strengthen logistics for communities to define and carry out their work
effectively.

4.1 1 Monitoring and evaluation must be afforded appropriate attention both during project
design and throughout implementation. Incentives for M&E must be structured into project
activities. Care must be exercised during M&E planning exercises to take into consideration
the capacity of the staff and institutions that will implement those plans.

Health Systems and Communicable Diseases
4.12 There is near-universal agreement that HIV has crowded out attention to other
important health challenges in Lesotho. The HCTA's focus on Global Fund resources may
have exacerbated this problem, with its exclusive focus not only on HIV, but on Global
Fund-financed HIV interventions; Government attention, largely because of the significant
dollars involved, remains with the Global Fund grant, and opportunities to integrate both
                                               51


Global Fund activities and HIV-related activities with the health sector in general have been
missed. Bank projects could have encouraged integration of HIV with other health services,
including those for TB, reproductive health, and OVCs. Insufficient attention has been paid
to the low capacity of social welfare agencies.

4.13 There have been important steps forward in this area, however. Current trends are
encouraging, with more linkages between HIV and reproductive health services. For
example, because of the resources devoted to PMTCT, antenatal clinics now offer HIV
testing, linking HIV services to antenatal services. Very recently, MOHS W launched a new
program intended to integrate child health services with HIV services, but it is premature to
assess results in this area. And it is undeniable that HIV funding has had positive externalities
for the rest of the health sector, most notably strengthened laboratory systems and drug
supply chains.

Relationship between the Bank and the Global Fund
4.14 The Bank's entrance was prescient, strategic, even pioneering, coming in at the right
time and with the right forms of assistance. In other words, the Bank - in an environment
where there were very few donors active on HIV/AIDS in Lesotho - was the first institution
to act on the increasingly urgent need to assist countries in developing capacity to spend all
the new funds coming from the donor community. Informants recommend the Lesotho model
as strongly relevant for other countries, with a relatively small Bank investment facilitating
the absorption of much larger sums from other donors.

4.15 The form of the Bank's intervention on HIV/AIDS was not without controversy,
however. Bank management was initially planning a more traditional MAP project for
Lesotho, but some Bank staff argued that the country would be hard-pressed to spend all the
money it was about to receive from the Global Fund, let alone additional funding from the
Bank. Significant non-governmental participation and implementation was envisioned for
any HIV/AIDS interventions funded by the Bank from the very beginning, for example, in
part because of a judgment that the government would not have the capacity to absorb the
new funds. It was these arguments that led to the capacity-building project rather than the
MAP approach.

4.16 Global Fund staff (the Fund Portfolio Managers), though based in Geneva, have been
active partners with the government during grant implementation. In particular, Global Fund
staff have intervened at critical points to discourage key personnel from leaving the Global
Fund Coordinating Unit (GFCU) for other positions inside or outside Lesotho, primarily by
persuading the Ministry of Finance (the Principal Recipient) to provide incentives to stay (the
Global Fund grant pays GFCU staff salaries). The GFCU and the Ministry of Finance (where
it is institutionally located) enjoy a productive working relationship, with MOFDP routinely
placing GFCU matters at the top of its agenda. The Bank does not sit on the CCM, and
although its impact has been crucial and the HCTA's results demonstrable, the relationship
between the Bank and the GFCU has not always been smooth. Staff on the ground in Lesotho
observed that until recently, it was occasionally difficult to obtain timely decisions on
important matters from the Bank, and that the Bank was not as flexible as it could have been
in adapting to changing implementation circumstances. It does not appear that Bank
                                                 52


interventions have been deliberately coordinated with Global Fund staff in Geneva, although
there is strong appreciation from Global Fund management for the Bank's contributions to
capacity-building, particularly in the areas of procurement and institutional development at
MOHSW. The Bank and Global Fund missed opportunities to work together to overcome the
political tensions between the MOHSW, MOFDP, and the NAC, and therefore fully to
develop the NAC into a highly-regarded agency that can effectively take the lead in the
country's response to HIV/AIDS.

Value Added of the Bank
4.17 The Bank is clearly regarded by both the Government and most development partners
as a critical player in the health and HIV areas, mainly due to its effective catalytic and
complementary role. The Bank was an essential player in fostering a sector-wide perspective,
building the ownership necessary to sustain progress, and creating a demand for the
information required to plan, monitor, and react effectively to sectoral needs. The Bank was
also key in moving the health sector to a higher position on the MOFDP's priority list. The
Bank's approach has encouraged other partners to consider how each can best coordinate
support that will tap into its specific comparative advantage.

4.18 As more resources are becoming available to finance HIV programs, it is the Bank's
comparative advantage to focus on system strengthening. The Bank's hands-on
implementation support is still needed, given the Global Fund's status as a grant-providing
agency that offers limited implementation support. Continued Bank support for strengthening
of implementation systems can help remove capacity bottlenecks and speed up the pace of
implementation of other partners' HIV programs. This approach is also an effective way to
invest limited Bank resources, as compared to a much costlier expenditure on mainstream
HIV interventions. Building capacity and filling gaps uses the Bank's comparative
advantage, particularly in system and fiduciary strengthening, in a way that complements,
rather than competes with, other partners' financing. In short, the Bank's approach to health
and HIV/AIDS in Lesotho has accomplished a lot with relatively little money. In the current
environment, with a number of global initiatives providing substantial resources toward
improving health, nutrition, and population outcomes, the Bank's approach in Lesotho should
serve as a valuable lesson to be extended to other priority development areas.


5 Epilogue
 .
5.1     There have been follow-ons to both of the projects assessed here. The US$33.5
million Health.Sector Reform Project Phase 2, which was approved in October 2005 and
closed in September 2009, was intended to achieve a sustainable increase in quality
preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health services by increasing access to and quality of
delivery of essential health services. A US$5 million HIV and AIDS Technical Assistance
Project, approved in August 2009 and scheduled to close in January 2015, is intended to
build capacity of government and civil society at both the national and local levels to address
the identified key gaps in implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan in an effort to
contain and reverse the epidemic. In addition, a US$6.25 million New Hospital Private
                                              53


Public Partnership (PPP) Project, approved in November 2007 and ongoing, is to increase the
access, range, and quality of medical services in Lesotho through the replacement of the
existing main public hospital (Queen Elizabeth 11). This sequence of health operations,
reflecting the consistency and continuity of the Bank's engagement in Lesotho's health
sector, flow from long-term strategic thinking dating back to the first Health Sector Reform
Project.

5.2    The Global Fund has approved additional grants to Lesotho in Rounds 5 and 6
(2007), 7 (2008), and 8 (2010) (Annex E), with a Round 9 grant covering mainly HIV/AIDS
and orphans and vulnerable children also signed in 20 10. The total approved grant amount as
of June 20 10 is US$143.4 million, with US$123.3 of that for HIV/AIDS and US$20.1
million for tuberculosis. A total of US$77.9 million has been disbursed.

5.3     The Bank is currently preparing a results-based financing project, coinciding with the
preparation of a new National Development Plan that will introduce the concept to the health
sector and generate evidence and experience. This project is intended to introduce a new way
of thinking about health care financing and service delivery. It is small in monetary terms
(US$5 million), but it is to serve as a catalyst to support not only results-based financing
programs and systems but also leverage large investments from other health sector partners
(such as MCC) towards a results focus.
