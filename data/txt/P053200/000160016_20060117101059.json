Theses\n            lessons were cited: (1) Sustained commitment to reforms and\n            coordination with other ministries is important. (2) Broad\n            ownership of the reform process is key for reform program\n            success. (3) Budgeting priorities must be consistent with\n            financial planning. (4) The health sector is human resource\n            intensive and requires decentralization to effectively\n            deliver health care services. (5) Balance improvements in\n            health sector processes with a focus on improving health\n            services delivery. (6) A multi-sectoral response to HIV/AIDS\n            requires well-coordinated and efficient implementation\n            mechanisms. (7) Pay attention to monitoring and evaluation\n            at the beginning of a project.
