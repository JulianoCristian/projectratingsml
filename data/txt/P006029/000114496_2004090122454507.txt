Director
Country Department IV - LAC

Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Loh:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement 3362-AR (Public Sector Reform Technical 
Assistance Loan) dated August 13, 1991, between the Argentine Republic (the Borrower) 
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).
Since the responsibility for the coordination of the project has been 
transferred to the Secretary of Finance, I would, like to propose the following 
amendment to the Loan Agreement:
Section 3.01 (c) is amended by substituting the words "Subsecretary of Technical 
and Administrative Coordination" by "Secretary of Finance".
If you agree with the foregoing amendment, please sign and date this 
confirmation form below.
Sincerely yours,
By /s/ Minister of Economy
Argentine Republic
