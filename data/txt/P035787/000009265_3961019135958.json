through the financial sector in order to improve marketing\n            of farms outputs (thereby improving rural incomes) and\n            availability of food products to urban population. The\n            project has two main components: 1) an entrepreneurs support\n            component which includes technical assistance, equipment and\n            vehicles, and training and study tours; and 2) an investment\n            credit component."}, "docdt": "1995-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
