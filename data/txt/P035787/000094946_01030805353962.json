assessed\n            as unsatisfactory because the first financial intermediary\n            failed and was liquidated during project implementation;\n            some funds under the investment component remained\n            underutilized; some project sub-components either did not\n            materialize or were unsuccessful for a number of reasons\n            including inactivity by the agriculture ministry,\n            development of institutions providing similar services, and\n            political instability; and the technical services unit\n            failed to become a sustainable institution and had to be\n            closed. Nonetheless, project benefits are considered likely\n            to be sustainable, and World Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory. Many of the implementation flaws and delays\n            could have been avoided or minimized with a more proactive\n            role and timely reaction on the part of the Borrower,\n            Borrower performance is adjudged unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned including the following: As a compromise, it was\n            agreed that while technical assistance would be targeted at\n            the dairy sector, the credit line would be extended to the\n            entire agro-processing sector. In the end, only 12 percent\n            of the credit line was on-lent to the dairy industry,\n            indicating that it may pay to keep the project flexible to\n            help to achieve broader developmental objectives. The\n            Albanian Government agreed not to interfere in the\n            bank's on-lending; over 400 sub-loans to the Albania\n            agro-processing sector were granted at market rates, which\n            proved this arrangement viable in Albania."}, "docdt": "2001-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
