        following main items: (i) Beef cattle: the stocking of about\n            870 small beef breeding and fattening farms. Farm\n            investments would include a boundary fence, fencing to\n            divide the land into paddocks, tools, seeds, fifteen\n            heifers, a bull and nine steers. Where possible the farmers\n            would attend a farmer's training course. (ii) Pigs: the\n            project would help about 270 farmers purchase two or three\n            sows and two fattening pigs for each farm. It would also\n            finance the construction of inexpensive pig shelters.\n            Projects would be located in areas where good crops of sweet\n            potatoes can be grown, which the animals would be fed\n            together with protein concentrate. (iii) Poultry: typical\n            project poultry units would consist of 100 layers or the\n            production of 600 broilers per year at the rate of 50 per\n            month. Financing would be provided for sheds, water tanks,\n            cages, equipment and chicks. As some previous poultry\n            investments have been unsuccessful only twenty farmers would\n            be financed initially, and further investments would depend\n            on the satisfactory evaluation of the initial group. (iv)\n            Technical services: the project would finance the\n            construction of a new Livestock Farmers Training Center and\n            an In-Service Training Center for DASF staff."}, "docdt": "1972-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
