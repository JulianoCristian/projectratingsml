INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR A
LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed devel-
opment credit of US$5.O million to Papua New Guinea, most of which is to be
relent to the Papua New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) for a term of fifteen
years, including five years of grace, at an interest rate of 1¼ percent per
year. PNGDB would on-lend the funds to smallholders to develop beef cattle,
pig and poultry farms.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        New Guinea, a U.N. Trust Territory, and Papua, an Australian dependency,
are administered by Australia under an Administrator as one political and economic
unit called Papua New Guinea. Australia is firmly committed to Papua New Guinea's
eventual independence, and has accepted the recommendations made by Papua New Guinea's
previous House of Assembly to prepare the country for full internal self-government
during the period 1972-1976.
3.        A new House was elected in March of this year, and the outcome of the
elections accelerated the timetable for self-government and independence. It
had generally been expected that the conservative United Party would win a
r jority in the House, but instead the progressive Pangu Party led by Mr. Michael
Somare gained a surprising victory althou7h neither party won a majority of the
seats in the House. Following the elections Mr. Somare formed a coalition govern-
ment with four smaller and disparate groups. While the Administrator continues
to chair the Executive Council$ Mr. Somare was appointed Deputy Chairman, which
in effect made him the country's first Chief Minister. The House has approved
the government's proposed timetable for self-government and independence which
implies that Papua New Guinea will achieve internal self-government by the end
of 1973 and be fully independent by the end of 1976.
4.        The Bank Group's association with Papua New Guinea began with a general
survey mission in 1963, Its report provided the framework for the country's
First Five-Year Development Program, 1968-1973. This year the Bank has acted
as executing agency for a project, financed by UNDP, to advise on strategies
to be used bi the preparation of the Second Five-Year Development Program
(197U-1`?70). The four exper.: ieve recently submitted their draft report.
5.        The Bank has made four loans to Papua New Guinea for a total of
US$U.L7 million and the Association four development credits amounting to
US$20.2 million. A statement of Bank loans and IDA credits, including reports
on the present status of the projects, is attached as Annex I. The largest
single loan Nas US$23.2 million for a hydroelectric project, which was needed
to provide power for one of the most rapidly developing areas of the country.
The remainder of Bank Group lending has gone for telecommunications, highways,
ports and agricultural development.   These projects were selected for their
high economic priority in helping to open up the country and bring the local
people into the cash economy.



-2-
6.        Th7e IFO has made no investments in Papua New Guinea but is exploring
the possibility of doing so. The Asian Development Bank has recently made
-its first ldifii,foiLothe Papua and New Guinea Development Bank, to finance the
foreign exchange costs of approved projects.
7.        Until the newly'elected Ministers have had an opportunity to decide
the future course of their country's development, to be embodied in the Second
Five-Year Development Program, and the principles that will govern future
economic and financial relations betwreen Papua New Guinea and Australia have
been worked out, the appropriate size and nature of future Bank Group assistance
cannot be determined with any precision. However, it is likely that agriculture
and education will continue to be high priority sectors in our future lending
program. A reconnaissance mission to study the education sector is scheduled
for Novvember. '
8.        The proposed IDA credit would be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of
Australia as, under the Papua New Guinea Act, all public loans incurred by the
Administration of Papua New Guinea are automatically guaranteed by Australia.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
9.        'A report, "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the Territory
of Papua New Guineat' (EAP-80a), was circulated to the Executive Directors on
September 9, 1969. Country data are at Annex II. An economic mission visited
Papua New Guinea in April/May 1972 and its report will be distributed shortly.
:Recent economic developments are discussed below.
10.       The overall growth of Papua New Guineats economy has been satisfactory
during the 1960's. GDP rose by almost 8 percent a year during 1960/61 - 1965/66
and accelerated to almost 11 percent annually during 1966/67-1970/71, owing partly
to the implementation of the large Panguna copper mining project on Bougainville
Island but, until recently, also by a 15 percent average annual increase in the
export-oriented modern agricultural sector, by favorable trends in private
non-mining investment, and by sharply rising government expenditures, especially
for economic development. Since growth has been virtually limited to the monetized
sector the share of the traditional subsistence sector, from which 70 percent of
the local population still derives the major part of its living, fell from about
two-thirds to less than 40 percent during the sixties. This underlines the
basically dual structure of the Papua New Guinea economy, consisting of a
sluggish indigenous subsistence sector based on traditional agriculture, and a
rapidly expanding modern sector, closely related to the Australian economy and
relying largely on export-oriented plantation agriculture, government operations
and services and, lately, also on mining.   Per capita GNP in Papua New Guinea
in 1971 was around TUS$300, including the high-income expatriate sectcr; the per
capita income of the indigenous population was around US$160, or only 14 percent
higher than five years before.
11.       Since mid-1971, the economy has been passing through a recession with
a decline in real GNP of 4 percent. Main factors have been the readjustment of
private investment to previous levels after the completion of the construction
phase of the Bougainville project, and a lull in new private investment, especially
among smaIl- and medium-scale Australian and local expatriate investors caused by
the uncertainty about Papua New Guinea's political future after independence. In



-3-
addition, there has been a drastic decline in world market prices for most of
the country's agricultural export commodities (copper, cocoa, rubber, palm
oil) and marketing difficulties for coffee.
12.       In spite of a rapid growth of exports during the latter half of
the sixties, there continues to be a large deficit in Papua New Guinea's
external account which is covered by Australia (see below). In addition to
the effects of the Bougainville project, first apparent in 1970, for which
the large import requirements were financed through private capital inflows,
the current account has been affected by increasing import prices, a general
rise in imports of capital goods, due to stepped-up development works, and a
growing demand for consumer goods imports. The services account has lately
been affected by the sharp increase in international shipping freight rates.
13.       Activity in the monetized sector is unusually dependent on govern-
ment spending, which accounted for about 45 percent of gross monetized sector
expenditures (excluding investment in Bougainville). To finance these expend-
itures the country continues to be heavily dependent on Australian assistance;
the Australian grant (US$83 million) covered one-third of total expenditures
of about US$237 million. Although tax revenues have almost doubled in the last
three years, they and other receipts still covered only about 43 percent of total
Administration outlays, or considerably less than current expenditures, while the
rest was financed through increased borrowing. In addition, the Australian
Commonwealth Government continues to be responsible for certain functions - civil
aviation, defense, and some public works involving gross outlays in Papua New
Guinea of around US$62 million in 1972.
14.      The country's tax base rests on the expatriate community and tax
revenue from indigenes is still small. Tax rates are fairly low, about half of
the Australian level, to attract foreign capital and expertise. Currently tax
revenue amounts to 16 percent of GNP in the monetized sector and 10 percent of
total GNP. The entire revenue system is currently under review with the aim
of imposing higher rates and introducing new taxes.
15.       The Bougainville copper mining project went into operation in April 1972.
The Panguna Mine, the second largest of its kind in the world, will produce 30
million tons of ore annually. The initial cost of the project (including explora-
tion expenses, financing charges and working capital) is estimated at about
US$480 million financed through equity of US$150 million and borrowed funds,
including large suppliers' credits from Japan. The Papua New Guinea Administration
has acquired a 20 percent equity interest in the Bougainville Copper Company to
be held in trust for the local population. Despite its giant size and not-
withstanding its unique technical achievements, the project's direct benefits to
the Papua New Guinea economy will be limited before 1980 i.e. estimated annual
Government revenue from the project will be not more than US$15 million while
estimated net balance of payments benefits will rise from US$25 million in 1973
to US$55 million a year by 1979.
16.       The Government is currently preparing the Second Five-Year Development
Program for 1973-1978 which will coincide with Papua New Guineats transition to
self-government and independence. A Government White Paper on Issues and Policies,
explaining in simple terms the major policy problems and possible strategy alter-
natives, has been debated in the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly. In addition,
a group of UNDP-financed planning experts recruited and supervised by the Bank is



preparing a report on general development strategy for Papua New Guinea, which
is scheduled to be available to the planners in Papua New Guinea by the end of
November 1972. These'exercises will form the basis for the program which is
scheduled to be approved by the Papua New Guinea Parliament in August 1973.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Agricultural Sector
17.       Papua New Guinea's economy continues to rely almost entirely on land
resources and agricultural production. About 90 percent of the country's popu-
lation is'dependent on agriculture which, including the subsistence sector,
accounted for about 60 percent of total GDP in 1970 and for most export earnings.
Coconut, cocoa, coffee and rubber are the principal commercial crops grown by
both the local people and expatriates. The total area under these crops was
nearly 900,000 acres in 1970, about half of which was owned by expatriates.
18.       Falling world market prices have affected almost all of the country's
major export commodities. At the same time local labor costs and costs of
imported farm inputs have risen. Moreover, new investment in plantations has
slackened due to the political uncertainty and increasing demands that land be
returned to indigenous control. Recent diversification into other commercial
crops such as tea, pyrethrum, passion fruit, oil palm, peanuts, and feedgrains
has not yet had an impact on Papua New Guinea's economy.
19.       The price declines for export crops have marked economic and social
implications especially where they affect smallholders who have become dependent
on these crops for cash income and have no practicable alternative to fall back
on. This applies particularly to coffee where smallholders account for 80 percent
of the acreage and 78 percent of production. The reduction in money incomes comes
at a time of increasing exposure of the rural people to Western civilization,
causing tensions and resentment.
20.       Livestock, although still a small industry in Papua New Guinea, is
growing rapidly. Cattle are not native to the country and beef production on
expatriate ranches started only in the late 1940's for consumption by the Australian
community. As a source of protein beef is too expensive for the majority of the
local population, but as more local people are drawn into the monetized sector of
the economy'they are expected to become significant consumers of beef products.
Alternative cheaper sources of animal protein are pigs, poultry and fish. Despite
a great demand for pork a relatively small number are slaughtered at abattoirs
each year because of poor transportation facilities and because most of the pigs
are traded, sold or exchanged in village areas. The demand for poultry meat and
eggs has also been increasing faster than domestic production, as reflected in
significant increases in imports.
The Papua New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB)
21.       The PNGDB was founded in 1965 and started operations in 1967.  It is
headed by a Managing Director and governed by a twelve-member Board of Directors
appointed by the Governor General of Australia from the public and private
sectors. Four members of the Board are indigenes.



- 5-
22.       PNGDB lends for the development of indastry, commerce and agriculture
to expatriates and indigenes. Under lending policy PNGDB is required to
rely on the prospects of an enterprises's success rather than on security in
determining its eligibility for financial assistance, and is required to pay
particular attention to the advancement of indigenes and the financing of
their enterprises.
23.       PNGDB has 60 expatriates in its staff of 150, mostly in senior and
middle management positions. It has a substantial training program through
which indigenes are expected to take up more of the increasing workload.
However, due to the acute shortage of university trained local graduates, the
senior positions are likely to be mostly filled by expatriates for some time
to come.
2h.       The capital of PNGDB, equivalent to US$17 million, has all come from
the government as allocations from the budget, and is intended to be non-
repayable equity. Under the previous IDA credits about US$3.1 million are
being channelled through PNGDB in addition to US$4.5 million under a recent
loan from the Asian Development Bank. One-third, about US$7.0 million of
PNGDB's investments are  in the rural sector and the remainder,
about US$1400 million, in industry and commerce. In the last few years there
has been a substantial increase in the number, and value, of loans for
indigenous agricultural purposes. Total approvals reached 2,051 for US$5.2
million in 1971,of which 1,938 for US$2.9 m lion were for indigenes.
25.       PNGDB has incurred losses since it started operations principally
because its portfolio was small in the initial years and also because of its
high training costs. With an increasing portfolio and higher interest rates
losses are diminishing, and PNGDB is expected to show a profit in FY 1972 and
subsequent years.
Description of the Project
26.       Under the project would be financed medium- and long-term investments by
the PNGDB and the government to increase smallholder beef cattle, pig and
poultry production and to improve livestock extension, education and research
facilities in the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF). PNGDB
relies on the extension staff of DASF in rural lending, and is assisted consid-
erably by it in all aspects of small agricultural project preparation, appraisal
and supervision. A very good working relationship has been established between
DASF and PNGDB, and regular meetings are held between the two organizations at
headquarters and regional levels. Loans to farmers would be made on the basis
of farm plans and budgets prepared by DASF extension staff, who would also
supervise their implementation.
27.       The project would consist 6f the following main items:
(i)  Beef cattle: The stocking of about 870 smalI beef breeding and
fattening farms owned by individuals or groups would be financed
under the project. Most farms would be about 150 to 200 acres
in size. Farm investments would include a boundary fence, fencing
to divide the land into paddocks, tools, seeds, fifteen heifers,
a bull and nine steers.  Where possible the farmers would attend
la farmer's training course given by the DASF before the cattle
are provided. The average size of the sub-loan is expected to
be about US$5,000 and would be repaid in twelve years including
a grace period of 4 years.



-6-
(ii)  Pigsi The project would help-about 270 farmers purchase
two or three sows-and two fattening pigs for each farm. It
would 'also finance the construction of inexpensive pig shelters
made of local materials which should last for up to eight years.
Projects would be located in areas where good crops of sweet
potatoes can be grown, which the animals would be fed together
with protein concentrate. The average sub-loan would be slightly
over US$1,000 and would be repaid in five years including a grace
"period of 2 years.
(iii) Poultry: Typical project poultry units would consist of 100 layers
or the production of 600 broilers.per year at the rate of 50 per
month. Financing would be provided for sheds, water tanks, cages,
equipment and chicks. The average sub-loan for broilers would be
about US$730 to be repaid in four years including one year of grace,
and for layersiabout US$l,o60 for five years including two years of
grace.  As some previous poultry investments have been unsuccess-
ful, primarily because of poor supervision and poor quality of
feed, only twenty farmers would be financed initially, and further
investments would depend on the satisfactory evaluation of the
initial gro up.
(iv)  Technical Services:  The project would finance the construction
of a new Livestock Farmers Training Center and an In-Service
Training Center for DASF staff. Investments would go into dormitories,
eating facilities, offices, library, classrooms, transport and
equipment. Also, six existing research centers for beef and pigs
would be'strengthened and a new research center for poultry would
be constructed to replace the existing temporary center.
Cost and Financing of the Project
28.       The total cost of the project is equivalent to US$9.8 million, of
which the Association would provide US$5.0 million covering the off-shore element.
The Association is expected to provide about US$4.2 million for beef cattle, US$0.3
million for pigs, US$0.1 million for poultry and US$0.4 million for technical services.
Retroactive financing of US$600,000 would be provided for sub-loans already made
by PNGDB for smallholder beef cattle development from May 1, 1972. The Bank
Group has been encouraging the government for some time to develop its small-
holder beef industry, and in the recent past the PNGDB has substantially in-
creased its lending for:that purpose. In the early part of this year the
government asked the Association to make available savings lnder our last
agricultural credit project (Credit 175-PNG) to help finance this on-going
program. As the Association was then in the process of appraising the project
now being presented, it declined. However, since appraisal has shown that
the lending procedures followed by PNGDB in making beef cattle sub-loans in
the past are acceptable to the Association, I consider it reasonable to make
retroactive financing available to May 1 of this year as was requested by the
government. A detailed break-down of the cost of the project is given in
Annex III.



-7-
29.       Of the total project cost of US$9.8 million, 14 percent would be
financed by the farmers, 23 percent by the government, 7 percent by PNGDB
and 51 percent by IDA, this proportion being the off-shore cost component of
the project. Siall farmers generally have few cash resources and their contri-
bution to project costs would, therefore, consist mainly of their own labor
and some cash from the sale of crops. PNGDB would be reimbursed by IDA for
90 percent of its loans to smallholders and would contribute the remaining
portion from its owin resources. The government's contribution to the project
which would be limited to financing the technical services, would be made through
yearly budgetary appropriations.  IDA would also finance a small portion of the
technical services.
30.       The IDA credit would be made to the Administration of Papua New Guinea
and mosu of the proceeds would be made available to PNGDB under a subsidiary
loan agreement for 15 years including 5 years of grace at an interest rate of
1¼ percent per year. The PNGDB would charge its smallholder sub-borrowers
71¼ percent for loans up to A$3,000 and 7-3/4 percent for loans above that
amount. These differential rates conform to the accepted practice in Papua New
Guinea of charging small indigenous borrowers less than the larger local and
expatriate oorrowers, the latter paying up to 13 percent for certain kinds of
loans. The spread for PNGDB between what it pays for the IDA funds and what it
receives for them is necessary to cover the institution's high administrative and
training costs and to enable it to generate reasonable reserves.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       International competitive bidding would not be suitable as the
tems to be financed by IDA are small and varied. Purchases would there-
fore be made through regular commercial and government channels. Different
brands of fencing materials, tools, equipment, feeds and veterinary medicines
can be obtained competitively in the main towns, and cattle for farmers would
be purchased from the large ranches in Papua New Guinea at prices negotiated
between the ranches and DASF's livestock buyer. Items financed by the govern-
ment would include expatriate and indigenous staff, buildings, and equipment
and vehicles. Procedures for obtaining these items are acceptable.
32.       Practically all the credit funds, US$h.6 million, would be disbursed to
PNGDB, through the government, to cover 90% of PNGDB's loans to smallholder cattle,
pig and poultry farmers.  Disbursements would be made against a certificate of
expenditure furnished by PNGDB. The balance of the credit, US$400,000, would be
disbursed to the government to cover part of the cost of buildings, vehicles and
equipment related to technical services.
Economic Evaluation
33.       Based on current import prices for beef, pig and poultry products the
foreign eXchange value of the import substitutes produced under the project' during
its life would total an estimated US$22.6 million. Deducting the foreign exchange
components of the investment and of production costs amounting to about US$7.1
million, the foreign exchange savings would total an estimated US$15.5 million
during the life of the project. Based on projected world market prices for beef,
current import prices for pigs and eggs and estimated prices for broilers,
the economic rates of return for the Project (excluding.the cost of



- 8 -
technical services), have.been estimated at 18 percent for beef, 53 percent
for pig , .8 percent for eggs and 45 percent for broiler production. These
figures were computed using the wage rate,about US$0.70 per day,at which
there is known to be a willing supply of family or clan labor. The economic
rate of return for the project as a whole is estimated at 19 percent excluding
and 14.percent including the cost of livestock and extension services.
3h.       In addition to helping diversify agricultural production, the Project
would provide a substantial amount of additional employment both on the farms and
through the expansion of technical services, feedgrain production and marketing
facilities. The acquisition of new farming methods by small-scale indigenous
farmers, as well as their increasing participation in the market economy, would
be added benefits.
PART IV - LBGAL INSTRUMENrS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Administration
of Papua New Guinea and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and PNGDB, the Recommendation of the Committee required by
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
separately. Necessary modifications have been made to the General Conditions
applicable to Development Credit Agreements to take account of the fact that
the Borrower is not a member. A draft letter from the Commonwealth giving,
inter alia, certain assurances on the status of the Credit is also being
distributed.
36.       The execution and delivery of the Project Agreement and a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Administration and PNGDB are conditions of effective-
ness.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Devel-
opment Credit.

ANNEX I (a)
STATUS OF PROJECTS
Loan 546-PNG. First: Telecommunications Project, 1968
This project is progressing satisfactorily and is practically
complete. In February of this year funds were made available from the
unallocated category of the loan, and from savings in other categories,
to permit the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to purchase additional
equipment needed for its 1971-1972 program. The Closing Date for this
project is June 1973.      -
Credit 137-PNG.  New Britain Smallholder Development Project, 1970
Credit 175-PNG. Agricultural Development Project, 1971
Both these projects are practically complete. Out of a combined
total of $6.5 million of IDA funds there will be savings of about $1 million
due to some ineligible expenditures under Credit 137 and a reduction in the
size of the project under Credit 175. We have recently agreed in principle
to the use of $620,000 from these savings for agricultural activities closely
related to the project. The Closing Dates for these projects are December
1972 (which probably will have to be extended) for Credit 137 and June 1974
for Credit 175.
Credit 204-PNG and Loan 693-.PNG.  First Highway Project, 1970
The combined loan and credit was for $9.0 million. At the tine
this project was presented to the Executive Directors the total cost was
estimated at A$10.2 million. By the middle of this year it was estimated
that total costs had increased 75% to A$18 million. The cost overruns were
caused, in the first instance, by the lowest construction bid being 60% above
the appraisal, estimate largely because of the great demand for contractors
imposed by the Bougainville copper mine; and secondly because as work progressed
difficult unforeseen sub-soil conditions came to light. The cost of consultants
also increased. Disbursement percentages have been reduced to keep disbursements
