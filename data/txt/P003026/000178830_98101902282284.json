This\n            fourth credit will provide US$10 million to finance about 34\n            percent of SOFIDE's total financing requirements and\n            about 45 percent of its foreign exchange needs for the\n            period from September 30, 1976 to December 31, 1978."}, "docdt": "1977-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
