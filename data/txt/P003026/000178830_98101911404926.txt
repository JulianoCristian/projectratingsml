Year of Establishment: 1970
Role of the World Bank Group in the Establishment of SOFIDE
The Bank Group was instrumental in establishing the Company; IFC subscribed
18.75% of SOFIDE's share capital and helped attract foreign investors to
participate in its share capital. Also IDA granted a $5 million credit to
SOFIDE in 1970 and seconded a Bank staff member as SOFIDE's first Director
General. The objective was to set up a development finance company to
provide long-term finance to the private industrial sector in Zaire.

SUI~MARY
i.        The Societe Financiere de Developpement (SOFIDE) was established
in early 1970 by the Government of Zaire to assist financially and tech-
nically in the development of soundly managed enterprises in all productive
sectors of the economy. The Bank Group played a vital role in the creation
and the growth of the institution; it participated in the preparatory work;
IFC subscribed about 19% of SOFIDE s share capital and helped attract foreign
investors to participate in its share capital; the Bank seconded a staff
member to become the Director General of the company and acted as Executing
Agency for a program of technical assistance by UNDP. The Bank Group has
been the primary source of financial assistance to SOFIDE to which it has
granted three lines of credit totalling $25 million. The World Bank Opera-
tions Evaluation Department conducted in 1976 a project performance audit of
the first line of credit to SOFIDE (190-CK). It concluded that, in general,
SOFIDE had successfully fulfilled the objectives that were set for it at its
creation although some aspects of its operations need improvement. The present
report draws from the lessons of the audit in its review of SOFIDE which is
one of the soundest financial institutions in Zaire and the only development
finance company in that country.
ii.       In the first part of the 1960's the economy of Zaire suffered
severely from the turmoil that followed independence. However, after the
return of political stability and the monetary reform of 1967, all sectors
of the economy, except agriculture, recorded output increases. The economy
performed relatively well until 1974; subsequently it deteriorated substan-
tially as a result of a lack of planning, of fiscal and monetary restraint,
and because of nationalization measures that slowed down investnents. In
1975, difficulties resulting from previous internal policies were compounded
not only by the increase in the price of oil and the decrease of copper
prices, but also by the war in Angola and the resulting closing of the port
of Lobito and the Benguela railway. At the end of 1975, the Government
decided to take corrective measures and in agreement with the IMF initiated
a Stabilization Program in early 1976. Recently it has announced a number of
denationalization measures designed to attract again foreign investors and
resume the development of productive activities.
iii.      Manufacturing accounted for about 9% of GDP at market prices in
1974. Between 1970 and 1974, total value added in the sector increased in
real terms at an annual rate of 6.8%. The rate was higher for consumer goods
industries (7.1%) than for capital goods industries (2.7%). In 1974, consumer
goods industries accounted for about 55% of total value added by the manufac-
turing sector. There are about 530 manufacturing enterprises providing
full-time employment to more than 150,000 persons. Manufacturing plants are
heavily concentrated in the areas of Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, the capital of
the province of Shaba. Chemical products, cement and tobacco products are the
main non-mineral industrial exports. Although the value of these exports has
more than doubled in recent years, they still represent a very small part of
total merchandise exports.  The EEC countries are Zaire's main trade partners.



- vi -
iv.       SOFIDE is managed by Mr. Kazadi Membu, its President and Director
General assisted since September 1976, by Mr. Roberto Chadwick, a Bank staff
member, seconded to the institution as Deputy Director General for a three-
year period. SOFIDE's staff which totals 83 including 20 professionals is
of good quality but still needs close supervision. Three agricultural ex-
perts have been seconded by UNDP/FAO to assist SOFIDE in its operations
related to agriculture.
v.        The quality of SOFIDE's project appraisal has somewhat deteriorated
in recent months due to a lack of coordination among the various departments
involved in project work. Moreover, despite Bank Group insistence during
supervision missions, SOFIDE is still lacking a systematic approach to super-
vise projects it finances. During negotiations, SOFIDE management agreed
to make definite efforts aiming at an improvement of project appraisal. It
was also agreed that SOFIDE will strengthen the supervision of projects it
finances.
vi.       From beginning of operations in 1970 to the end of 1976 SOFIDE ap-
proved 128 loans totalling about Z34 million and 10 equity investments
totalling Z1.7 million. At the end of December, SOFIDE's total loan port-
folio which is of good quality and well diversified among economic sectors
amounted to Z12.1 million; in addition the company held equity participa-
tions in five enterprises for a total of 3885,000. Although the policy
changes in 1974 and 1975 affected SOFIDE's portfolio and implementation of
projects, the institution was kept in a sound financial position; however, its
profitability declined because of high administrative expenses, slow disburse-
ments, increasing financial charges on borrowings while income as a percentage
of loan portfolio remained more or less constant. This trend was interrupted
in 1976 when SOFIDE made a profit representing more than 10% of its average
net worth, mainly due to an increase in disbursements and a wider margin on
its operations. In view of SOFIDE's higher interest rate on its loans since
the beginning of 1977, wider spread on rolled-over IDA funds, expected
stricter control on the growth of administrative expenses, and faster dis-
bursements, SOFIDE's profitability is likely to continue to improve in coming
years.
vii.      The recent measures adopted by the Zairian Government should be
conducive to a resumption of industrial investment. In this environment,
SOFIDE's future lending prospects are good. As of August 1976, there were
13 projects in the pipeline amounting to total capital investment of S35
million. The potential SOFIDE investment in these projects amounts to F9
million of which 96 million for equipment replacement and expansion and
îr3 million for new projects. Approvals from September 30, 1976 to December
31, 1978 are expected to total ;25.9 million (US$29.8 million) of which
&19.4 million (US$22.3 million) are for expenditures in foreign currency.
The IDA Credit of $10 million will therefore provide about 34% of SOFIDE's
total requirements and about 45% of its foreign exchange needs during the
period.
viii.     The proposed Credit would be onlent by the Zairian Government to
SOFIDE at 8.5% p.a. SOFIDE in turn would relend these funds at a minimum of



- vii -
12.5% p.a. The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk on the IDA
Credit for SOFIDE's loans to small-scale Zairian enterprises, (defined as
Zairian majority-owned enterprises with total assets not exceeding US$250,000
equivalent) against payment of a 1% p.a. commission. It was agreed at nego-
tiations that individual loans made by SOFIDE to this category of clients
would not be financed by IDA beyond US$100,000 equivalent.  Other borrowers
would assume the foreign exchange risk. SOFIDE would pay to the Government a
commitment charge of 3/4% per annum on the undisbursed amount of the Credit,
starting 60 days after signature. The free limit for industrial subprojects
would remain at $150,000, and the aggregate limit would remain at $2 million.






I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Societe Financiere de Developpement (SOFIDE) was established
in early 1970 after more than two years of preparatory work in which the
Bank Group played a very active role. The Bank Group also participated in
establishing the Company: IFC subscribed about 19% of the share capital
of SOFIDE while foreign institutional investors subscribed about 26% at
the invitation of the Bank Group; IDA supplemented SOFIDE's initial resources
by granting in 1970 a first Credit (190-CK) of US$5 million; it seconded a
staff member to become the Director General of the Company and acted as
Executing Agency for a program of technical assistance from UNDP. A Second
IDA Credit (271-CK) of US$10 million was granted in 1971 and a Third IDA
Credit (463-CK) of US$10 million in 1973. The World Bank Operations Evalua-
tion Department conducted in 1976 a project performance audit of the first
line of credit to SOFIDE (190-CK). It concluded that, in general, SOFIDE had
successfully fulfilled the objectives that were set for it at its creation,
but pointed out a number of areas where SOFIDE needs to improve its perfor-
mance (appraisal and supervision, linkage with the Investment Commission).
1.02      SOFIDE's second and third IDA Credits will be fully committed by
the beginning of 1977. This report reviews the Company's performance and
outlook and recommends a fourth IDA Credit of US$10 million, with the
following objectives:
(i)  To provide term financing on appropriate terms to productive
enterprises in Zaire in the following sectors: manufacturing,
transport, tourism, and agro-industry;
(ii) to continue to support the growth of SOFIDE as a leading
develoment institution in Zaire by strengthening its
resource base, its project appraisal capabilities, internal
organization and procedures.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
General
2.01      Zaire covers an area of 2,345 km  in the middle of Africa.  With a
coast of 30 km on the Atlantic Ocean, the country is mostly landlocked. The
Zaire river drains the entire territory and dominates the geography of the
country.  Zaire is well endowed with mineral resources (principally copper but
also manganese, cobalt, zinc) and also has an enormous potential for agricul-
tural development.



- 2 -
2.02      Zaire's Mopulation totals about 23.5 million inhabitants (10
inhabitants per km ) and is growing at an annual rate of 2.6%. It is
basically a young population with high fertility and mortality rates.
More than 75% of the population live in rural areas. However, urbanization
which made significant strides during the troubles of the yearly 1960's is
proceeding rapidly and it is estimated that by 1980, about one-third of
the country's population would be living in cities with more than 100,000
inhabitants.
The Economy
2.03      A World Bank Basic Economic Report (721-ZR) on Zaire, was published
in July 1975. An up-dating economie mission visited the country in May-June
1976. Its report is being finalized.
2.04      Mining and metal processing is the most important economic activity
in Zaire accounting for almost a quarter of GDP. Agriculture, despite its
enormous resources and potential represents no more than 16% of GDP although
about 75% of the country's population work in that sector. Non-Government
and Government services account for 23% and 14% of GDP respectively while
manufacturing represents 9%, transport 8%, construction 6% and energy 1%.
2.05      A major element in the evolution of the economic and financial situa-
tion in Zaire is the international price of copper. Copper accounts for 60%
to 70% of the country's foreign exchange receipts and taxes on exports of
copper average 40% of Government revenue. The price of copper increased from
a low of 48 US cents per pound in 1972 to a peak of 150 US cents in early
1974, and then sharply declined: the average price for 1975, 56 US cents, was
40% below the average price for 1974, 93 US cents. This sharp fall in copper
price together with considerable increases in import costs, and transport
disruptionsifrom the war in Angola, came at a time when economic and financial
policies were based on continuing high copper prices and the national-
ization of foreign activities. The result was a reduction in economic
activity.
2.06      The Economy until 1974.  In the first part of the 1960's the
economy suffered severely from the turmoil that followed independence. How-
ever, after the return of political stability and the monetary reform of 1967,
all sectors of the economy, except agriculture, recorded output increases.
Between 1968 and 1970, GDP rose at an annual rate of 10%; in 1970-1974 the
growth rate fell to 5%. It amounted to 5% in real terms in 1974. GNP per
capita was estimated at US$140 in 1973. 1/
2.07      The rise in the retail price index was 6% in 1971, 14% in i972,
11% in 1973, 28% in 1974 and accelerated further afterwards (see para. 2.11).
2.08      While in the 1960's, Zaire had always had a positive current
account, it was no longer so in the 1970's; this deterioration was mainly
due to the depressed level of exports in 1972 when world market pricqs
1/   World Bank Atlas, 1975.



- 3 -
for most of Zaire's exports were at a cyclical low, and a sharp increase in
the cost of imports. In 1973, with the recovery in world commodity markets,
export receipts rose by 50% and the current account position improved signi-
ficantly, despite a 26% increase in import payments.
2.09      During the 1973-1974 copper price boom, the Government committed
itself to a number of questionable investments.  From 1973 to 1974, Government
revenue increased by 44%, but current expenditures increased by 66% and the
current budget surplus of Z21 million in 1973 was followed by a budget
deficit of g210 million in 1974. Fiscal and credit policies were strongly
expansionary in 1973 and in 1974, resulting in increasing domestic demand and
balance of payments deficit. Moreover, the Zairianization of agricultural,
commercial and transport enterprises in November 1973 resulted in a decline in
economic activities in these sectors. This was followed in December 1974 by
the nationalization of some 75 industrial enterprises formerly owned by
foreigners, and the appointment by the Government of "Delegues Generaux"
to manage the companies. The authority given to the Delegues Generaux,
most of whom were not prepared to manage industrial enterprises, and the
uncertainty felt by foreign shareholders and managers about future devel-
opments, resulted in a slow-down of production and interruption of investments
in most industrial enterprises.
2.10      Although SOFIDE's approvals of projects increased during this
troubled period as the management of some companies continued to prepare
and submit investment proposals for financing, disbursements were slowed
down as the implementation of projects was delayed in many instances.
This in turn had a negative impact on SOFIDE's profitability at a time
when its administrative expenses were pushed up by inflation.
2.11      Recent Economic Development.  In 1975, the above difficulties.were
compounded, by the increase in the price of oil, the decrease in copper
prices, and the war in Angola which closed the port of Lobito and the Benguela
railway. Budget, credit and exchange restrictions were not sufficient to
prevent the financial and economic situation from deteriorating further. Real
GDP declined by probably 1.5% during 1975 and the current budget deficit
increased to X180 million. Retail prices in Kinshasa, which had increased
by 28% in 1974, rose further by 32% in 1975, with a sharp acceleration at the
end of the year due to increasing shortages. In April 1976 retail prices
were 91% over the April 1975 level. The terms of trade, which had improved
in 1973, started deteriorating in 1974, and deteriorated further by 41% in
1975.  The balance of payments had shown a deficit of M380 million in 1974
which increased further to 9518 million in 1975. Borrowing abroad on a
large scale, particularly from private commercial banks, and increasing
recourse to short-term credits for financing current imports burdened Zaire
with a high public debt and large service payments.



- 4 -
2.12      At the end of 1975, the Government adopted corrective measures
commensurate with the seriousness of the situation. Discussions were
initiated with the IMF in November 1975.  In December 1975, the Govern-
ment decided to give back to former owners 40% of the share of their
industrial enterprises and the new Department of the Portfolio started
negotiating with them the question of management and compensation. In
March 1976, the Zaire was aligned with the SDR thus implying an effective
devaluation of 42% vis-a-vis the US dollar. This was accompanied by a
Stabilization Program which included a drastic reduction of the budgetary
and balance of payments deficits, credit limitations, cancellation of low
priority investments with a high foreign exchange content, improvement of
pricing policies and of the import licensing system and the decision to
seek debt rescheduling from foreign creditors. In addition, the program
allowed a 20% salary increase followed by a wage freeze. The implementa-
tion of the Stabilization Program is monitored by a Stabilization Committee
comprising the Director of the Office of the Presidency, the Governor of
the Central Bank, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Portfolio.
2.13      Finally the Government announced in September 1976, a number of
measures of denationalization taken by the Stabilization Committee. The
objectives of these measures are to allow previous owners of Zairianized
enterprises in agriculture, trade and transport to come back if they wish
to do so while leaving untouched Zairian owners who have performed well.
Former owners of previously nationalized industrial enterprises may recover
60% of their shares provided they agree to sell the balance of 40% to pri-
vate Zairians of their choice. This should help to solve the problem of
management since the foreign owners will have the majority of shares.
The lIanufacturing Sector
2.14      Data on the recent evolution of the manufacturing sector, are
provided in Annex 1 and summarized below. In recent years, manufacturing
accounted for 8 to 9% of GDP at market prices and total value added in the
sector increased at an annual rate of 6.8%. The rate was higher for consumer
goods industries (7.1%) than for capital goods industries (2.7%).
2.15      In 1974, industries engaged in the production of consumer goods
accounted for about 55% of total value added by the manufacturing sector. The
most important consumer goods industries are in the beverage, food processing,
textiles and clothing sectors. In 1974, they accounted for 67% of value added
in such industries and 37% of total value added in the manufacturing sector.
Textile equipment and non-ferrous minerals accounted for more than 50% of
value added in the capital goods industries.
2.16      There are about 530 manufacturing enterprises with modern accounting
systems. They provide full-time employment to more than 150,000 persons.
Manufacturing employment is estimated to have grown at a rate of 8% to 9%
per annum between 1968 and 1973.
2.17      According to a survey conducted in 1970, 35% and 24% respectively
of manufacturing plants were located in the areas of Kinshasa and Lubumbashi,



- 5 -
the capital of the province of Shaba. Since then, the importance of Kinshasa
as the center for large-scale manufacturing activity has increased further.
Almost all new large manufacturing projects implemented in recent years
were located in Kinshasa.
2.18      Although the value of non-mineral industrial exports in current
prices increased from $5.2 million in 1970 to an estimated $12.9 million in
1974, it only represented 0.9% of total raerchandise exports in 1974. Chemical
products, cement and tobacco products are the main non-mineral industrial
exports. About 75% of Zaire's exports are to countries of the EEC and about
60% of imports originate from these countries.
2.19      Between 1970 and 1974, the Investment Commission which reviews
and decides on requests from investors soliciting the various advantages
granted under the Investment Code, approved manufacturing investments
totalling 3124 million. Major subsectors were beverages (27% of total
manufacturing investments approved), nonferrous minerals (25%), transport
equipment (19%) and chemicals (8%).
Government Industrial Policies
2.20      The Government influences investment in the industrial sector
through the incentives of the Investment Code, and policies affecting
tariffs, prices, expatriate employment and foreign exchange.
2.21      Under the Investment Code established in 1969, the Government
can grant a number of tax exemptions (on profits, expatriate income taxes,
property taxes, import duties on capital equipment) and guarantees for
repatriation of capital investment, profits and interest. The Investment
Code benefits are granted for periods which vary in length depending on
the size of the projects and of their priority for the country. The Code
specifies that litigation arising from foreign investments may be arbitrated,
at the request of any party, under the provisions of the International
Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.
2.22      The Investment Code established an Investment Commission within
the Department of National Economy and Industry to examine all project
applications for approval and granting of incentives. Although the Code
has specific criteria for the assessment of the economic contribution of
projects the small staff of the Investment Commission has not been able
to review adequately the large number of applications, and decisions to
grant the advantages of the Investment Code have sometimes been taken for
political reasons outside of the Commission. Some projects have received
extremely favorable and economically unjustified advantages, such as prac-
tically unlimited protection against foreign and local competition. More-
over, due to lack of overall guidelines and objectives, the Commission may
decide without adequate financial and economic analysis. Incentives have
been given to some projects with low economic return or high dependence on
imports. Consequently, although the Code has succeeded in attracting for-
eign capital, it has not been used as an effective tool to channel invest-
ments to priority sectors.



-6-
2.23      As pointed out inrthe OED performance audit report, the relation-
ship between the Commission and SOFIDE was not clearly defined at the outset;
in practice it was informal'and often improvised. A more formal link between
SOFIDE and the Investment Commission would increase SOFIDE's impact on indus-
trial development and contribute to improving decision making process in Zaire
for industrial development. It was agreed, at negotiations, that the Govern-
ment, would associate more closely SOFIDE with the work of the Investment
Commission.
2.24      In 1974, special provisions were added to the Investment Code to
promote expansion of productive capacity. It included a 50% rebate on the
profit tax on retained earnings to be reinvested and a complete exemption
from the turnover tax and custom duties.
2.25      Tariffs were increased in 1972.  Import duties now vary from 50%
to 120% for luxury goods. They average about 50% for goods competing with
domestic production and about 20% for intermediate and investment goods.
Import controls are more important than tariffs as a protective mechanism
and are usually part of the incentive package granted to investors. The
corporate tax amounts to 40% of income. Dividends are taxed at 20%.
2.26      The Government has a policy to control prices paid to producers both
in agriculture and in manufacturing industries. For new investments, the
selling price is often calculated in percentage of the production cost,
usually leaving a profit margin of 15% to 20% of cost. The Government has
since 1967 been reluctant to allow increases in prices and this has often
resulted in reduced profits for some manufacturing enterprises. Some of
SOFIDE's clients have experienced financial difficulties as a result of this
policy, which now is applied more liberally.
2.27      Until the end of 1975 many foreign enterprises experienced in-
creasing difficulties in their relations with the Government, basically due
to the Government's desire to Zairianize foreign activities as quickly as
possible. Difficulties took the form of pressures to reduce the number of
expatriates, reluctance to grant price increases and to allocate increasingly
scarce foreign exchange.
2.28      The "denationalization" of enterprises decided at the end of
1975 and 1976 were accompanied by the following measures designed to permit
enterprises to operate normally: request to employ expatriates, submitted to
the Stabilization Committee, are usually considered favorably; price controls
have been relaxed; special allocations of foreign exchange have been made to
allow enterprises to import the most needed spare parts. Difficulties remain
for the repatriation of past and current profits, due to the present foreign
exchange situation. The change in attitude of the Government will probably
encourage industrial enterprises to resume investment which lagged in the last
two years.



-7-
2.29      Promotion of Small-Scale Zairian Enterprises.  In addition to a
law reserving trade activities to Zairian nationals, three laws were passed
in 1973 for the benefit of small- and medium- size Zairian enterprises. The
first law established a promotion office (Office de Promotion des Petites
et Moyennes Entreprises Zairoises, or OPEZ); the second made these enterprises
eligible for investment incentives similar to those currently granted by the
Investment Code. The third law instituted a guarantee fund (Fonds de Garantie
des Credits aux Petites et Moyennes Entreprises Zairoises, or FGEZ) which is
not yet operating, though a special account in Banque du Zaire has been
credited with M3 million for that purpose. OPEZ started its operations at
the end of 1973. In May 1976, it had a Zairian staff of 54 persons, of which
20 graduates from the local university. The foreign staff consisted of 2 ex-
perts from UNIDO and 4 experts from the Association pour la Formation des Cadres
de l'Industrie et de l'Administration (AFCA) whose local office was absorbed by
OPEZ.  OPEZ's budget, which amounted to L250,000 in 1975 was reduced to ZI80,000
in 1976. However, including the carry-over of the unspent balance of 1975
(9110,000), authorized expenses for 1976 total about M290,000. OPEZ had
mixed success until now. It tried to build on AFCA's experience to develop
specific program of assistance to SSEs in Kinshasa, but its efforts have been
unsuccessful to date because of (i) a lack of qualified and experienced staff;
(ii) strained relations between the Zairian and the expatriate staff; and
(iii) a lack of a defined strategy supported by the Government. SOFIDE has
tried to develop its assistance to Zairian entrepreneurs, in particular after
the 1972 nationalization measures and to develop an effective cooperation with
OPEZ, which would have provided the badly needed technical assistance. This
did not succeed due to OPEZ limited capabilities. Although it is not expected
that OPEZ may in the near future contribute significantly to the development
of Zairian entrepreneurship, SOFIDE and OPEZ could work out joint programs of
assistance to Zairian entrepreneurs, on the basis of either subsector or
geographic priorities.
2.30      The OED performance audit report pointed out that SOFIDE's minimum
intervention limit of g10,OO0 (US$11,500) acted as a partial deterrent against
SOFIDE lending to small-scale enterprises. In view of the high rate of infla-
tion in Zaire in recent years, this minimum limit does not probably constitute
any more an obstacle to such lending, although it still prevents SOFIDE to be
active in the informal sector.
Financial Environment
2.31      Eight commercial banks with a total of 46 branch offices cover
virtually the entire country. The Banque Commerciale Zairoise (25.5% Govern-
ment and 25.5% Belgian Societe Generale de Banque) is by far the largest,
with deposits accounting for more than 60% of all commercial banks' deposits,
and 20 branch offices. The second largest is Banque du Peuple, controlled
by a multinational group of banks. The third one is Union Zairoise de Banques
(UZB). The newest commercial banks are the Banque de Kinshasa, almost fully
Zairian-owned, which opened for business in 1970, the Banque Internationale



pour l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO) and the First National City Bank, which
opened a branch in 1971. Since the Central Bank does not rediscount medium-
term credits, commercial banks are reluctant to provide such credits beyond
three years, although through revolving short-term credits they have sig-
nificantly contributed to financing the development programs of large-scale
public and private enterprises.
2.32      The control of bank credit to the private sector, imposed through
quantitative limits until 1969, was subsequently progressively relaxed.
Credit policy became sharply expansionary from the end of 1973, when the
external situation was favorable, and when some nationalized activities began
requiring credits to cover deficits. Credit expansion was allowed to con-
tinue unabated through 1974, even after the external situation had deteri-
orated. In 1975, in order to restrict credit expansion, the reserve require-
ment of 40% introduced in February 1974 to replace credit ceilings was raised
to 45%. As part of the Stabilization Program of March 1976, a limit has been
set to the expansion of credit to enterprises and households during 1976.
However, as SOFIDE is in practice the only provider in Zaire of long-term
funds for industrial development the limit does not constrain its operations.
2.33      In January 1974, maximum interest on loans by commercial banks for
various sectors were set at the levels indicated below. To prevent banks from
concentrating on credits to large enterprises earning highest interest,
minimum are set aside for lending to agriculture and small- and medium-size
enterprises.

2.34      A World Bank financial sector study, to determine ways to improve
resource mobilization in Zaire and to increase the contribution of the finan-
cial network to the development process is scheduled for FY 1978.
III. THE COMPANY
Background
3.01      SOFIDE was created by the Government in 1970 to assist financially
and technically in the development of soundly managed private enterprises
in any productive sector of the economy, to help foster the distribution
of industrial shareholdings and the growth of a capital market in Zaire.
The Bank seconded a Bank staff member, Mr. Guetta, to be SOFIDE's first
1/   Defined as enterprises with total assets not exceeding X 150,000
(US$173,000).



Director General.  Since then, the Bank Group has been the primary source
of financial assistance to SOFIDE to which it has granted three lines of
credit totalling $25 million (in addition to IFC's $0.75 million subscrip-
tion to SOFIDE's capital).
Role
3.02      The OED performance audit report concluded that in general, SOFIDE
which is the only development finance institution in Zaire, has successfully
fulfilled the objectives that were set for it at its creation but pointed out
a number of areas where SOFIDE needs to improve its performance. These
include project appraisal and supervision, linkage with the Investment Com-
mission. While commercial banks provide mainly short-term credit, SOFIDE
assist productive enterprises with medium- and long-term financing. Although
since its creation, it has provided financing mainly to medium-scale indus-
trial enterprises, SOFIDE has assisted a number of small Zairian entrepre-
neurs. Moreover, it has recently established an agricultural department with
UNDP/FAO assistance to determine the potential and priorities for the
f inancing of agriculture in Zaire and appraise a limited number of medium-
scale agricultural projects for SOFIDE's financing.
3.03      Although the development of a financial equity market in Zaire is
a stated objective of SOFIDE, very little progress has been made in that
respect, due to SOFIDE's constraints and the changing environment. However,
the forecast financial sector study will help determine ways and means of
helping SOFIDE contribute to the development of a financial market.
Ownership
3.04      The ownership of the company's share capital is presented in
Annex 2. The Government, with 35% of the shares, of which 12.5% belong
to the State, 12.5% to the Central Bank and 10% to publicly-owned commercial
banks, is the dominant shareholder. Other shareholders include about 300
private investors in Zaire (20% of capital), 13 foreign banks (26%), and IFC
(19%).
Board of Directors
3.05      The Board consists of nine members listed in Annex 3.  The Chairman
of the Board, Mr. Kazadi Membu is also SOFIDE's President and Director General.
Directors represent the Government, the Central Bank, local and foreign banks,
the Association of Zairian enterprises and IFC. The Board, composed of
competent members, usually meets four to five times a year and reviews loans
exceeding Z150,000 and equity investments above 950,000. Board decisions
have been good in general, despite the mixed quality of SOFIDE's project
appraisals and the difficulties resulting from the drastic changes in the
environment. The presence of an IFC representative (presently Mr. Alland)
in the Board has contributed significantly to the Board's effectiveness.



- 10 -
Executive Committee
3.06      The Committee which consists of six members, (see Annex 3) is
empowered to approve individual loans up to 150,000 and equity investments
up to M50,000. IFC is not represented in the Executive Committee.
Management
3.07      In 1973, Mr. Kazadi Membu succeeded Mr. Guetta as SOFIDE's Direc-
tor General. Previously, he was the Director of the Central Bank's Credit
Department.  At the same time, Mr. Fortuit from the French Caisse Centrale
de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), who had already 15 years' experience as
General Manager of Development banks in Africa, was appointed Deputy Director
General. In 1974, Mr. Kazadi became also Chairman of SOFIDE's Board.
Messrs. Kazadi and Fortuit constituted an effective management team and
contributed to developing SOFIDE into one of the soundest institutions in
Zaire. Mr. Fortuit was succeeded in 1976 by Mr. Roberto Chadwick, a Bank
staff member with a two-year experience at the Resident Mission in Zaire,
who has been seconded to SOFIDE for three years. There are clear indications
that Mr. Chadwick will also be able to work effectively with Mr. Kazadi in
the management of the institution.
Organization and Staff
3.08      As of December 1976, SOFIDE's staff totalled 83 including 18
Zairian professionals and 2 expatriate professionals. Most of the Zairian
professionals are university graduates that joined SOFIDE at the end of
their studies and are dedicated to their work. They have either received
on-the-job training or have attended courses at CEFEB 1/ or EDI. The overall
quality of the staff is good, but given their relatively limited working
experience, they still need close supervision.
3.09      SOFIDE's organization (see chart in Annex 4) includes a Project
Department in charge of the financial aspect of project appraisal; a
Supervision Department responsible for project implementation and follow-up;
a Department of Research, Documentation and Promotion which is in charge,
among other things, of the economic evaluation of projects; an Accounting
and Administrative Services Department; a Technical Department that evaluates
the technical merits of projects; an Agricultural Department which has been
assigned to determine the potential and priorities for the financing of
agriculture in Zaire and appraise a limited number of agricultural projects
for SOFIDE's financing. One of the weaknesses within SOFIDE is a lack of
coordination among the various units involved in project appraisal. This
tends to delay the preparation of reports and affects the quality of ap-
praisals, a fact pointed out by the OED performance audit report which
underlined weaknesses in the economic and financial analyses of projects.
SOFIDE's management is aware of this problem and intends to monitor closely
the preparation of appraisal reports and to improve the quality of economic
and financial analyses. Since IDA is the main provider of external resources
to SOFIDE, the review of subprojects by IDA has been and will continue to be
beneficial to the development of SOFIDE's staff appraisal capabilities.

Technical Assistance
3.10      SOFIDE has been continuously relying on technical assistance from
expatriates. In addition to the recruitment of a Bank staff member as
Director General in 1970-1973, and to the appointment of an expatriate
Deputy Manager Director since 1973, the Bank was involved in providing
technical assistance at the operational level through secondment of finan-
cial analysts and engineers, under a UNDP contract that expired in mid-1976
for which IBRD was executing agency. In addition, UNDP has agreed to finance
three experts for a three-year period, starting in early 1976, to help SOFIDE
develop its project promotion and processing capabilities in the agricultural
sector. FAO is the executing agency for this project. An expatriate engineer
provided under French bilateral assistance joined SOFIDE recently to head the
Technical Department.
Policy Statement
3.11      SOFIDE's Policy Statement prepared in cooperation with IBRD was
adopted by its Board in 1970. It was amended in 1973 to permit SOFIDE to
finance parastatals up to a limit of 25% of its commitments. IDA also agreed
to consider, as equity, a Government advance of 31 million to SOFIDE in the
determination of limits for single and global equity investments in order to
permit SOFIDE to have more leverage in projects submitted for its financing.
Since then, no other changes have been made to the Policy Statement which
is attached as Annex 5.
Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
3.12      IDA has continuously pressed SOFIDE to increase its lending rate in
order to: (i) take inflation into account and (ii) provide SOFIDE with a
spread sufficient to cover its increasing administrative costs and build up
its equity. Since 1971 and until the end of 1975 SOFIDE charged an interest
rate of 8% p.a. to 9% p.a. for loans to agriculture and small-scale indus-
tries and 10.5% p.a. for other loans. This latter rate was increased to
11.5% p.a. at the end of 1975. In view of recent and current inflation in
Zaire, these rates are negative in real terms. The foreign exchange risk on
all external borrowings is borne by the Government, with the exception of the
Third IDA Credit, for which Credit: (i) borrowing enterprises that are small
or medium (i.e. with total assets not exceeding ê150,000) and that are Zairian
majority owned do not carry the foreign exchange risk which is taken at no
cost by the Government, and (ii) other industrial clients of SOFIDE have the
option of either taking the foreign exchange risk or of paying a 1% p.a. pre-
mium transferred by SOFIDE to the Government for the coverage of the foreign
exchange risk. As of January 1977 SOFIDE's lending rate to large enterprises
was raised from 11.5% p.a. to 12.5% p.a. plus a 1% appraisal commission. For
the Fourth IDA Credit it was agreed at negotiations that the Government would
assume the foreign exchange risk on SOFIDE's loans to small-scale Zairian
majority-owned enterprises (defined as enterprises with total assets not
exceeding US$250,000 equivalent) against payment of a 1% p.a. commission. It
was also agreed that individual loans made by SOFIDE to this category of
clients would not be financed by IDA beyond US$100,000 equivalent. Other
borrowers would assume the foreign exchange risk.

Procedures
3.13      SOFIDE's procedures for project appraisal, follow-up, procurement
and disbursements have only partially been spelled out in writing. The
company does not yet have a comprehensive Operational Manual. This was
brought to the attention of SOFIDE's management who agreed during negotiations
to prepare such a manual.
3.14      (a)  Appraisals.  The quality of SOFIDE's appraisal has somewhat
deteriorated in recent months, because of a lack of proper coordination
between the various departments involved in appraisal work. Important aspects
of projects are not dealt with in sufficient detail or are simply ignored.
The economic evaluation of projects has been particularly deficient in a
number of cases. The difficulty to obtain valid data in Zaire does not explain
these problems entirely. Considering the qualifications and dedication of the
staff, these deficiencies are not difficult to correct, and management intends
to do so.  It is recommended that all projects submitted by SOFIDE to IDA for
refinancing include the calculation of an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and
that those projects that are import-substituting include the calculation of an
Economic Rate of Return (EROR). Assurances in that respect were received from
SOFIDE during negotiations.
3.15      (b)  Follow-Up.  IDA has continuously pressed SOFIDE to implement
a systematic follow-up system and even proposed formats for this purpose.
However, until recently, the need to supervise projects systematically was
not felt by management as very few borrowers defaulted. As a result, SOFIDE
still lacks a systematic approach to supervise its projects and there are no
regular on-site visits nor periodic reports to management. More recently a
high level of arrears has demonstrated to SOFIDE's management the danger of
inadequate supervision. The appraisal mission again insisted on the need for
a systematic supervision system and proposed a plan including specific budget
allocation for supervision travel. SOFIDE's management agreed in general
with the mission's views and proposals and furthermore during negotiations
it agreed to strengthen the supervision of projects it finances.
3.16      (c)  Procurement and Disbursement.  SOFIDE's procurement and dis-
bursement procedures are adequate. SOFIDE does not usually require competi-
tive bidding; however, project promoters are requested to solicit offers
from several suppliers from which SOFIDE and the promoter select the most
favorable. The promoter is required to pay its share of the investment before
SOFIDE disburses its financing. SOFIDE then disburses against presentation of
invoices or relevant documentation.
Auditors
3.17      SOFIDE's accounts are reviewed and audited by Berger, Block,
Kirscher, Schellekens & Co. The latest report covers the fiscal year that
ended on December 31, 1975. The quality of the audits is generally satis-
factory, but they still do not conform to IDA requirements for DFCs as
regards the evaluation of the portfolio. SOFIDE has agreed to request its
auditors to prepare in the future audits in line with IDA requirements.

IV. OPERATIONS AND FINANCE
4.01      Annexes 6 and 7 provide information on SOFIDE's operations from
1970 to 1976. These operations started rapidly in 1970 and expanded
significantly in 1971 but slowed down in 1972 as the investment climate in
Zaire was not favorable. Between 1973 and 1975, approval of projects by
SOFIDE increased, but disbursements were considerably reduced as serious
delays occurred in project implementation. During 1976, as the investment
climate started to improve, approvals increased by 91% and disbursements
by 72%.
4.02      Between 1970 and 1976, SOFIDE approved 128 loans totalling about
.34 million and 10 equity investments totalling 31.7 million. Disbursements
on loans amounted to X20.6 million, and disbursements on equity investments
totalled iZ0.9 million. Projects financed by SOFIDE during the period under
review represented a total investment of about 970 million of which i}45
million were for import requirements. The projects ranged in size from total
costs of 925,000 to B8.6 million. About 30% of approvals were for small- and
medium-size projects. The most important subsectors assisted were food and
beverages (14.4% of total approvals), transport (14.1%), hotels, restaurants
and tour agencies (8.3%), mining (7.3%). Of all the projects approved, 14%
were new projects and 86% were for the expansion of existing facilities.
Beneficiaries of loans were predominantly located in the Kinshasa area (55.6%
of total approvals) and the Shaba area. About 51% of loans approved had a
maturity of 5 to 7 years, 29% less than 5 years and 20% more than 7 years.
4.03      A sectoral distribution of projects financed by SOFIDE under Credits
190-CK, 271-CK and 463-CK is presented below:
190-CK            271-CK*           463-CK*            Total*

*    As of 9/30/76
SOFIDE's subprojects appraisals usually include a calculation of a financial
rate of return but rarely include an economic rate of return (para. 3.14).
Calculations made by IDA on the basis of data presented in SOFIDE's appraisals
show that, subprojects accepted for IDA financing have economic rates of
return ranging from 18% for a cement project to 27% for a mining venture.
Lack of collection by SOFIDE of financial data for the enterprises it financed
due to inadequate project supervision does not permit to verify these rates
ex-post.  Moreover, the drastie policy and economic changes of 1974 and 1975



- 14 -
have often resulted in substantial changes in the profitability and financial
structure of enterprises financed. Despite this lack of data, it appears
however, that, in general projects financed by SOFIDE were sound and economi-
cally justified.
Resources
4.04      SOFIDE's resource position as of September 30, 1976 is presented
in Annex 8. At that date, resources available for new project approval
amounted to Z8.9 million (US$10.2 million) of which g8.7 million (US$10
million) was in foreign exchange. SOFIDE's local resources consist of its
share capital (.2 million) and quasi-capital (Z3 million) 1/ and the rolled-
over IDA funds (Zl.1 million).
4.05      Foreign resources have been provided mainly by IDA with three
credits totalling M22 million (US$25 million). In 1971, SOFIDE also obtained
a gO.8 million loan from EIB to finance a single textile project (9 years at
6.5%). A 91 million loan granted in 1972 by SIFIDA 2/ in 1972 has been totally
reimbursed.  SOFIDE also obtained a line of credit of BF300 million (z6.8 mil-
lion) from the Societe Belge d'Investissement (SBI) and a line of credit of
DM6.5 million (about M2.1 million) from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).
Despite its relative youth and Zaire's financial difficulties, SOFIDE has
thus been able to mobilize external resources for industrial investment,which
demonstrates the confidence placed by foreign assistance agencies in SOFIDE's
situation and capabilities.
4.06      Under the SBI line of credit (8.25%) SOFIDE can finance its loans
and equity investments up to a maturity of 12 years, including local currency
expenditures, but is limited to financing projects with Belgian participation
or improving Belgo-Zairian economic relations. This de facto ties the line
of credit to Belgian procurement. The KfW loan has a 30-year maturity,
including a 10-year grace period, and must be used for loans to small- and
medium-scale private enterprises located outside of Kinshasa (up to a limit
of Z100,000 per project). The interest rate is 7.5%, but only 2% is paid to
KfW; the other 5.5% are set aside by SOFIDE to finance promotional studies
and technical assistance to Zairian-owned enterprises directly or through
specialized institutions. As of September 30, 1976, 9250,000 had been
disbursed out of the KfW line of credit.
4.07      According to the Establishment Convention creating SOFIDE, the Gov-
ernment has agreed to assume the foreign exchange risk on all of SOFIDE's
foreign borrowings up to an outstanding amount of $30 million. However the
Government has informed SOFIDE by letter that IDA credits are excluded from
this $30 million limit.
If   Includes a Z2 million Government loan (40 years including 20 years
grace period, 1% p.a. interest rate) and a Government advance of
Z1 million (interest free and no maturity).

Loan Portfolio
4.08      As of December 31, 1976 SOFIDE's total loan portfolio amounted to
912.1 million, i.e. an increase of 33% above the level of December 1975,
reflecting a faster pace of disbursements during 1976. Overall, and despite
the adverse effect of events that took place in 1973-1975 on SOFIDE's port-
folio, the portfolio is of good quality and well diversified among economic
sectors. Total arrears of more than three months as of December 31, 1976
amounted to 9283,238 and affected about 9% of the loan portfolio,which is
acceptable.
Equity Portfolio
4.09      As of December 31, 1976 SOFIDE held equity participations in five
companies for a total of 9885,000. The most important (g400,000) is in
CIZA, a cement company in which SOFIDE has a 7.7% participation. The second
largest equity participation (0323,000) is in Tourhotels, a hotel company in
the Kivu region which SOFIDE promoted. SOFIDE owns 17.1% of Tourhotels share
capital. Other investments are in Cobega, a metal can producer (X72,000,
16% of share capital); Carrigres, a quarry company, (950,000, 8.5% of
equity); and Sogakor, a soft-drink company (940,000, 6.7% of equity). As of
December 31, 1976 SOFIDE had loans outstanding of M802,000 to Tourhotels and
935,000 to Carrigres. Returns on SOFIDE's equity investments have averaged
a low 2.4% p.a. between 1972, when the Company made its first investment, and
1975. Details on SOFIDE's equity portfolio are provided in Annex 9.
Financial Situation
4.10      SOFIDE's balance sheets for 1972 to 1976 are given in Annex 10.  At
the end of December 1976, SOFIDE is in a sound financial position with equity
and quasi-equity totalling g5.3 million and term borrowings of 911.6 mil-
lion against a total portfolio of about M13 million. SOFIDE has always
maintained a safe liquidity position; its net current assets at the end of
1976 amounted to 92.7 million, i.e. more than 3 months of disbursements.
Provisions for losses at end of 1976 amounted to Z258,000 (about 2% of total
portfolio). Given SOFIDE's generally sound portfolio (see para. 4.08), it
seems, that these provisions are adequate. SOFIDE's ratio of term-debt to the
total of equity plus quasi-equity at the end of December 1976 was at 2:2 to 1,
below the maximum of 3 specified in SOFIDE's Policy Statement and which is
also the maximum debt/equity ratio according to IDA's Agreement with SOFIDE.
Financial Results
4.11      SOFIDE's income statements for 1972 to 1976 are given in Annex 11.
Net profits which represented 8.9% of average net worth in 1973, amounted to
only 2.7% in 1975. This decline was caused by a substantial increase of ad-
ministrative expenses, slow disbursements during that period, and increasing
financial charges on borrowings (from 3.5% of average debt in 1971-1972 to
5.6% in 1974-1975) whereas income from loans remained more or less constant
at about 11% of average loan portfolio between 1972 and 1975. The decline in
profit was reversed sharply in 1976, when SOFIDE had a net profit of ê234,000



- 16 -
representing 10.4% of its average net worth. This favorable development was
due mainly to an increase in disbursements and a wider margin on SOFIDE's
operations. On March 21, 1977 SOFII)E's Board decided to distribute dividends
totalling ;150,000 representing 7.5% of share capital.  This development will
make it easier for SOFIDE to convince its shareholders to participate in the
planned share capital increase.
V. PROSPECTS
Medium- and Large- Business Prospects
5.01      Even during 1974, when foreign-owned industries were nationalized,
SOFIDE continued to receive applications for loans not only from Zairian
entrepreneurs but also from nationalized enterprises, mostly for replacement
of equipment or expansion programs. In the case of nationalized enterprises,
SOFIDE had to delay approvals until the problems of ownership, management
and/or technical assistance were clarified. The Governnent decision of last
September to give back ownership of industrial enterprises to the former
foreign owners provided they agree to sell 40% of their shares to Zairians
of their choice seems to be slowly restoring the confidence of foreign inves-
tors. This is likely to induce companies to resume their investment programs,
and thus request loans from SOFIDE for equipment replacement, expansions and
also some new investments.  It seems unlikely that the Government, confronted
with heavy foreign debts will revert to measures which would discourage for-
cign investments. Moreover, recent arrangements concerning Zaire's external
debt situation should further improve the investment climate. Though it may
be assumed that the pace of industrial investment will resume only progres-
sively, it is difficult to estimate its level since many investors may wish to
wait until the effects of the current Stabilization Program are better known.
5.02      As of August 1976, SOFIDE had a pipeline of 13 projects representing
a total investment of g 35 million. The potential SOFIDE financing of these
projects amounts to Z 9 -million of which Z 6 million for equipment replacement
and expansions and Z 3 million for new projects.
5.03      Most probably for the next 2 years SOFIDE's problem will not be that
of finding enough viable projects, but of determining priorities for the
allocation of its limited resources. Catching up with replacement of equip-
ment which has been neglected or delayed during the past 3 years will be an
obvious priority.
Prospects for Lending to Small-Scale Enterprises
5.04      Assistance to Zairian-owned enterprises remains a major objective
for SOFIDE and the recent increase in the number of such projects testifies to
SOFIDE's concern. However, as for agriculture (see para. 5.05), SOFIDE can
provide only a small fraction of the potential credit demand from smalL-scale
enterprises; moreover, the risks of lending to that sector are high, due to
the limited capacity of OPEZ to provide technical assistance, and supervision



- 17 -
would be costly if beneficiaries were scattered around the country. SOFIDE's
management intends to limit lending in that sector to a few subsectors, such
as bakeries, sawmills, transport, etc. and to cases where risks would be
acceptable, either because of the quality of management or availability of
technical assistance. As the most urgent need of Zaire's industrial sector is
the rehabilitation of medium- and large-scale enterprises that were seriously
affected by the economic policy measure of recent years, SOFIDE intends to
concentrate, for the near future, its efforts on helping these enterprises.
Prospects for Lending to Agriculture
5.05      Agricultural credit is still little developed in Zaire.  The agricul-
tural department which started operations in SOFIDE with UNDP/FAO assistance
in May 1976 will only be able to provide a token financing for agriculture,
considering SOFIDE's limited resources, and the enormous potential demand for
agricultural credit in the country. Since agricultural credit may be risky
and its supervision costly, whereas demand is very high, SOFIDE intends to
lirit itself to medium-term projects with high economic return and low risk
and to provide financing either only through agricultural cooperatives or
large agricultural projects which can provide extension services and super-
vision. Preference will also be given to projects intended to rehabilitate
agricultural enterprises that were affected by the economic measures of the
last three years.
Forecast of Operations
5.06      A forecast of SOFIDE's operations is given in Annex 12.  Approvals
of new loans are projected to increase 10% yearly, starting in 1977. Such
an increase would be consistent with a rather slow recovery of the economy.
There is little doubt that if the current Stabilization Program is success-
fully implemented, claims on SOFIDE's resources could be higher than forecast.
In such event the Government would support SOFIDE's efforts to raise addi-
tional foreign exchange resources, as the Government considers that SOFIDE is
the only development finance institution in Zaire able to adequately allocate
term resources for the development of indus try and tour ismn.
5.07      SOFIDE's equity investments have been assumed to grow progressively
but moderately. SOFIDE could play a useful role as representative of Zairian
interests in joint venture with foréign investors. SOFIDE will, however,
make equity investments mainly in expansion projects, so as to get a quick
return on its investments and thus protect its equity base against monetary
erosion.
Resources Needed
5.08      The resource position of SOFIDE from September 1976 through
1978 is summarized below:

5.09      SOFIDE's total requirements during this period are expected to amount
to 325.9 million (US$29.8 million), the foreign exchange cost of which is
estimated at 319.4 million (US$22.3 million). The proposed IDA Credit of
US$10 million would represent about 34% of SOFIDE's total requirements and
about 45% of its foreign exchange needs during the period. As this Credit
would cover only part of SOFIDE's foreign resources gap of X11.1 million
(US$12.8 million) it will need to obtain about US$3 million from other sources.
SOFIDE has already contacted a number of foreign or international agencies,
including KfW, CCCE and the African Development Bank. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that SOFIDE is pursuing its effort to receive these
additional resources to cover its foreign exchange gap. Discussions between
SOFIDE and CCCE are in final stages for a line of credit which would cover a
substantial portion of the resource gap.
l/  Of which a SBI line of credit of X6.8 million tied to Belgian procure-
ment and a balance of 01.8 million on a KfW line of credit reserved
for financing small-scale enterprises outside of the Kinshasa area. It
is expected that SOFIDE will have no difficulty allocating these funds
to eligible projects during the period 1976-78.

5.10       As of March 31, 1977 the balance of IDA Credits 271-CK and 463-CK
amounted to 9 1.9 million (US$2.2 million). SOFIDE has submitted to IDA
projects totaling US$1.8 million.
5.11       The credit vould finance the CIF cost of imported goods, the
foreign component of goods purchased locally and previously imported or of
goods produced locally from imported materials, and the foreign component of
civil works.
The Need to Raise Equity and Quasi-Equity
5.12       SOFIDE's Policy Statement limits its total exposure in any single
company to 20% vf its equity plus quasi-equity. The limit is presently a
little over Z 1 million. Its foreign exchange equivalent has been reduced
from $2 million to $1.3 million by the devaluation of March 1976.  As pointed
out in the OED report, this excessively limits SOFIDE's capacity to finance
sizeable and economically important investment projects with a nigh foreign
exchange component, such as Cimshaba, a cement plant in the Shaba province,
which should be quickly rehabilitatea to become again a large foreign ex-
change saver and l'or wbich SOFIDE couild not, according to its Policy State-
ment, provide s:he neces.sary funds.  An increase in SOFIDE's quasi-capital,
forecast in 1977, will raise the limit to Z 1.6 million (about US$2 million).
Ai increase in the share capital in 1979 would further raise the limit of
SOFIDE's exposure in individual projects and thus increase its impact on
industrial development.
Financial Projections
5.13       Assumptions for the financial projections, projected balance sheets,
income statements and cash flows for the period 1976-1981 are given in Annexes
13 to 16. SOFIDE's past and projected financial ratios are presented in Annex
17.  It has been assumed that IDA credits repaid to the Government would
be used i) for meeting Government guarantees on SOFIDE's loans to parastatals
that are in arrears, ii) for increasing SOFIDE's quasi-capital by Z 3 million
in 1977 and iii) for providing the funds necessary to increase the Government's
and the Central Bank's participation from 25% to 40%    (i.e. from Z 0.5
million to Z 1.6 mil'ion) when the share capital is doubled in 1979.  These
arrigements we;e confirmed during negotiations.
5.14       Appropriate measures have been taken by SOFIDE and the Government
to reverse the decreasing trend of SOFIDE's profits in recent years. The
interest rate charged by SOFIDE on its loans to industr. (except Zairian
SSEs) has been increased from 11.5% to 12.5% p.a. by SOFIDE's Board in October
1976 to take effect on January 1, 1977. In addition SOFIDE charges to its
clients an appraisal fee representing 1% of the amount of the loan. The
additional Z 3 million in quasi-equity will be provided by the Government at
1% interest rate and rolled-over IDA funds at 4%. Previously rolled-over IDA
funds were relent by the Governinent to SOFIDE at 8-1/2%, to leave SOFIDE a



- 20 -
spread of 3% only. The Government decided to increase the spread on these
funds to reverse SOFIDE's declining profitability. These understandings vere
confirmed during negotiations and it vas agreed that these rates vil be re-
vieved by the Government, SOFIDE and IPA no later than December 31, 1979 in
order to ensure the adequacy of SOFIDE's spread on these resources.
5.15       On the basis of above assumptions for SOFIDE's activity and with
the benefit of the measures mentioned in the previous paragraph, SOFIDE's
projected financial position should be sound.  The ratio of administrative
expenses to total assets is expected to decrease from 3.7% in 1976 to 2.2%
in 1979. Profits should increase from 10.3% of equity in 1976 to 19% in
1978. The ratio would decrease slightly thereafter because of the share
capital increase and the start of income tax payment by SOFIDE (which was
exempt of tax until 1980 under the Establishment Convention). Houever, the
ratio would remain at or above 15% through 1981. The term-debt ratio to equity
plus quasi-equity would remain through 1981 within the limit of 3 set in the
Policy Statement.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMIv1ENDATIONS
Conclusions
6.01       During the past tvo years SOFIDE vas confronted with major problems,
due to the deterioration of the economy and uncertainties of governmental
policy regarding future ownership and management of industrial enterprises.
SOFIDE's management must be credited vith maintaining throughout this difficult
period the integrity and the professional ability of its closely knit Zairian
team, keeping SOFIDE on a relatively sound footing and assuming its develop-
ment functions generally well.
6.02       SOFIDE's profitability continuously declined between 1972 and 1975.
However, in 1976 this unfavorable trend vas interrupted. As a result of
appropriate steps taken by SOFIDE and the Government, SOFIDE's profitability
should rapidly increase and its profits should represent a return of 15% or
more of equity as from 1978. SOFIDE's present financial situation is sound and
should remain so. SOFIDE's ratio of term-debt to equity. plus quasi-equity
should remain below 3 through 1981.  The high level of arrears registered in
1975 has been reduced to an acceptable level, facilitated by the Government
honoring the guarantees it had given to SOFIDE for loans to two public companies.
Recommendations
6.03       A Fourth Credit of US$10 million is recommended to meet approxi-
mately 45% of SOFIDE's needs in foreign exchange through the end of 1978 for
financing productive enterprises in Zaire. The Credit vould finance the
foreign cost of imported goods, or goods produced in Zaire with a substantial
import component, foreign costs of services and the foreign component of
civil work.



- 21 -
6.04      The proposed Credit would be relent by the Zairian Government to
SOFIDE, with a flexible amortization schedule conforming to the aggregate
amortization schedule of SOFIDE's subloans, none of which should in principle
exceed a maximum period of 15 years. IDA Funds would be passed on to SOFIDE
at 8.5%, and on-lent to its borrowers at a minimum of 12.5% p.a. The Govern-
ment would assume the exchange risk on the IDA Credit for SOFIDE's loans to
small-scale Zairian enterprises (defined as Zairian majority owned enterprises
with total assets not exceeding US$250,000 equivalent) against payment of a 1%
p.a. commission by the borrowers. Individual loans made by SOFIDE to this
category of clients would not be financed by IDA beyond US$100,000 equivalent.
Other borrowers would assume the foreign exchange risk. It is recommended
that SOFIDE pay to the Government a commitment charge of 3/4% per annum on the
undisbursed amount of the credit, starting 60 days after signature. The free
limit for individual subprojects would remain at $150,000, with the aggregate
limit being kept at $2 million.
6.05      During negotiations, agreement was reached and assurances were
obtained on the following main points:
(i) interest rates to be charged by SOFIDE to its clients and
the foreign exchange risk on borrowings by SOFIDE's clients
(para. 3.12);
(ii) calculation of an internal rate of return (IRR) for each
project submitted by SOFIDE to IDA for refinancing and
calculation of an economic rate of return (EROR) for those
projects submitted that are import-substituting (para. 3.14);
(iii) preparation and implementation of a systematic supervision
program by SOFIDE (para. 3.15);

SOCIETE FINANCIERE DE DEVELOPPIIENT
Statement of General Policy
(Approved by SOFIDE's Board of Directors on February 10, 1970
and amended on M4arch 14, 1973)
The purpose of this Statement is to outline the policy that shall
be applied to the activities of the Societe Financiere de Developpement
hereinafter referred to as the Company, subject to any amendments that may
be made to this policy, after appropriate studies, by the Company's Board
of Directors.
I. OBJECTIVES AND OPERATIONAL CRITERIA
1.        The Company shall assist in the development of soundly managed
enterprises in the Republic of Zaire in all the productive sectors of the
economy. The Company may not, however, engage in activities relating ex-
clusively to land or housing nor in activities of a purely social, com-
mercial or consumption nature.
2.        The Company shall assist enterprises which are majority privately
owned. The Company will also assit, up to a limit of 25% of its commitments,
enterprises with juridical personality that have, in fact, an autonomous
administration, financial management, accounting system and control, and in
which the State contributes directly or indirectly more than 49% of their
share capital. Those enterprises shall also meet all the other eligibility
requirements set forth in the Statutes and in the present Statement of Policy.
3.        The Company shall extend its assistance on the basis of economic
and financial criteria only. Enterprises that submit projects to the Company
shall be required to have efficient management, be technically sound, have
satisfactory market prospects for their production, be able to guarantee a
financial return on the investment and generally to contribute to the economic
growth of the country. The Company shall take all these different aspects
into consideration when appraising the projects submitted to it.
4.        The Company shall make every effort to foster the distribution of
industrial shareholdings and the growth of a capital market in the Republic
of Zaire. With this end in view it shall subscribe to issues of shares
and bonds in appropriate cases and shall sell shares from its portfolio,
provided that these operations are carried out under satisfactory conditions
and that the enterprises concerned are not prejudiced by such a sale. The
Company shall endeavor to create a market for its own shares in the Republic
of Zaire and to do everything within its power, within the framework of the
law and its own Statutes, to encourage Zairian investors to participate in its
capital.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
5.        In accordance with Article 3 of its Statutes the Company shall
extend all kinds of assistance, financial and other, in keeping with its
objectives. The Company shall invest in the capital of enterprises and
shall subscribe to issues of shares and other securities. It shall grant
medium- and long-term loans, for periods depending on the type of project
involved, with an appropriate grace period. The Company may also furnish
guarantees in certain cases. It shall endeavour to actively promote the
establishment of new and the expansion of existing enterprises. It shall
give its clients technical assistance and advice on the planning, layout
and execution of their projects. These loans and participations may be
granted for construction work, purchase of plant and equipment and for the
constitution of permanent working capital.
Il. INVESTMENT POLICY
6.        The Company's assistance in the form of loans or participations
or both forms combined may not normally amount to less than 910,000. How-
ever, the Company is prepared to consider requests for financing of projects
which, without reaching this amount, nevertheless present a definite economic
interest.
7.        As a general rule, the total amount of loans granted by the Company
together with its participations and any other commitments of a financial
nature in favor of a single enterprise may not exceed 20% of the paid-up
share capital, the unimpaired reserves and the quasi-capital contributed by
the Government pari passu with the share capital.
8.        The Company shall join with other financing institutions, whether
local, foreign or international, in financing projects whose financial re-
quirements exceed its capacity.
9.        The Company's total investments in the form of equity participa-
tions may not exceed the total of the Company's share capital plus unimpaired
reserves and the government advance of e1 million ranking pari passu with the
share capital.
10.       As a general rule the Company shall limit its equity participation
in any one enterprise to a maximum of 10% of its own share capital plus un-
impaired reserves and the government advance of e1 million ranking pari passu
with the share capital.
11.       Generally, the Company shall not assume managerial responsibilities
in enterprises it assists and shall limit its share participations to 25Z of
the share capital of any given enterprise. It may, however, by unanimous
decision of the Board, exceed this percentage and even assume managerial
responsibility if this is justified by the circumstances or the nature of the
nature of the enterprise. The Company may also, notwithstanding the above
restrictions, take any action it considers essential to protect its invest-
ments.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
12.       When the Company underwrites an issue of shares or other securities,
it may commit itself for an initial amount in excess of the limits fixed in
the above Articles 10 and 11, as long as it has good reasons to believe that
its final investment will remain within those limits.
13.       When deciding upon the amount and form of financial assistance it
shall provide, the Company shall take into account all the financial require-
ments of the project and the financial situation of the enterprise in ques-
tion. In principle, the loans the Company grants shall not together exceed
50% of the total cost of the project. It may, however, exceed this limit if
there is special justification, such as in the case of an expansion project.
14.       The Company shall endeavour to maintain a balanced portfolio by
distributing its loans, participations and other commitments among all the
sectors of industrial and economic activity within the range of its objec-
tives.
III. FINANCIAL POLICY
15.       The general aim of the Company's financial policy is to maintain
the value of its own capital, to manage its funds in such a way that it is
at ail times able to honor its obligations on time and to achieve a profit
margin that enables it to cover its operating costs, form adequate reserves
and distribute reasonable dividends to its shareholders. To this end the
Company shall:
-    maintain a satisfactory balance between the maturities
of its own obligations and those of the loans it grants;
-    not incur debts of more than one year of term in excess
of three times the amount of its capital plus quasi-
capital;
-    fnot incur exchange risks in respect of those of its
borrowings that are repayable in foreign currencies;
-    generally require appropriate guarantees for the loans
it grants;
-    ffix its interest rates, commissions and other charges
at a level that will enable it to obtain a satisfactory
return;
-    make adequate provisions against potential losses and
build up reserves to a level consistent with sound fi-
nancial practices, taking into account the size and
quality of its portfolio of loans and investments as
well as the need to pay adequate dividends to its share-
holders.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
IV. ORGANIZATION - SPECIAL PROVISIONS
16.       The Company shall strive to develop and maintain a solid and well-
