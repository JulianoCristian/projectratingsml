                         Implementation Status Overview

                         public discussions country wide. The first phase of the staff training for the preparation of the national program has been delivered. 194 school administrators, trainers and teachers
                         were selected to participate. 22 titles of reading books in Russian and Kyrgyz languages have been printed and delivered to schools that implement the program. About 1365
                         schools in four targeted oblasts received the furnitures designed for the pre-school program. The grant disbursement now is up to US$2.2 million, equivalent to 37% of the total grant.

                         the first quarter of 2012, which will account for over 80% of the grant. The delivery of the above inputs of goods and services will contribute to the full attainment of the grant
                         objectives of supporting the government's national school preparation program. Considering the current progress, the team expects the grant to fully achieve its development
                         objective in a timely manner.
