                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1. The closing date for Kyrgyz Republic, Fast Track Initiative, Catalytic Grant Fund -2,
   P118423 (TF099482) will be extended from August 31, 2012 until December 31,
   2012. This would be the first extension of the Project.

2. The Project is on track towards completion and implementation performance has been
   satisfactory. Key performance indicators have been met -- 3,200 primary school
   teachers and 69 methodologists have been trained in pedagogical practice; schools in
   four oblasts were provided furniture; and a standard package of teaching materials
   was distributed to 2,135 schools enabling them to open at least one preschool class to
   the communities they serve. At the same time, due to successful procurement
   processes, the Project has accumulated a savings of USD 250,000 which would be
   used for the purchase of additional learning materials should this extension is
   approved.

3. The IFRs have been reviewed and satisfactory and there is no overdue audit and or
   qualified audit statement. The team has reviewed updated implementation and
   procurement plans and is satisfied that with this extension the Project would be
   completed within the proposed revised closing date.

4. Should you agree to this request, please sign the attached letter to the Government.
