   satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: with a loan in the amount of US$5 million\n            equivalent, the World Bank was able to support an important\n            reform in Montenegro, sharing its international experience\n            and providing on-demand advice. By project closing, the\n            Government had established a strong foundation for\n            continuous improvements in primary and secondary education.\n            While education reforms are complex to implement, projects\n            do not have to be. The Government and the Bank's team\n            designed a project that was simple and supported\n            strategically selected interventions, thus focusing the\n            Bank's resources in these areas. Information and data\n            should be used as a tool to inform stakeholders and gain\n            their support for difficult decisions that are part of the\n            process. Stakeholder involvement in evaluation and planning,\n            through governance bodies like the multi-donor steering\n            committee for this project, is vital for successful and\n            sustainable projects. Bank-financed projects that perform\n            well are buoyed by strong commitment from the Government and\n            stakeholders, complemented by clear project objectives and\n            achievable outcomes."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
