Technology\n            Advancement Project is to reinforce the government's\n            priority for technology-intensive industrial development by\n            strengthening industrial research and development (R&D)\n            and basic research capacity and enhancing the application of\n            industrial standards to raise the quality of products.  The\n            project will finance specialized equipment and complementary\n            inputs comprising facilities to house some of the equipment,\n            and the costs of installation, consumables, and operation\n            and maintenance (O&M) expenditures related to the\n            equipment for three national institutions which play\n            important roles in Korea's industrial/technological\n            development -- Korea Institute of Science and Technology\n            (KIST), Korea Basic Science Center (KBSC), and National\n            Industrial Research Institute (NIRI).  The project will:\n            (a) improve the quality of research programs in KIST to\n            enhance its ability to assist industry in developing\n            advanced technologies; (b) improve opportunities for joint\n            research activities in the basic sciences through\n            strengthening common research facilities at KBSC; and (c)\n            enhance the development and application of industrial\n            standards through strengthening NIRI."}, "docdt": "1991-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
