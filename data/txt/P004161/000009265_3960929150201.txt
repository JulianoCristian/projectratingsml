MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A THIRD TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Korea for US$60.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years including 5 years
of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance
a technology advancement project.
2.        Background.  The rapidly changing structure of Korean industry
towards more technology-intensive production is supported by a strong commit-
ment to the growth of R&D. This has been achieved through the rapid expansion
of training of engineers and scientists, development of public sector research
institutes and the provision of incentives to the private sector to develop
its own R&D capacity. The latter has been successful to the extent that the
private sector is now responsible for nearly 802 of total R&D expenditures.
Total R&D investment has now reached about 2.62 of GNP, which is comparable to
levels in the major industrial countries.
3.   In the earlier stages of industrialization, Korea focussed on the
assimilation and improvement of imported technology. But as industry has
become more technology-intensive, there has been an increasing need to develop
the local capacity for technological innovation thereby reducing reliance on
imported technology. This requires an increasing commitment to the basic
research programs which underlie technological innovation. It also requires
the capacity to undertake research in advanced fields such as micro-
electronics, new materials, biotechnology, etc. Such research focusses on
topics which may be beyond the capacity of the private sector for reasons of
affordability and/or lack of advanced facilities and qualified researchers and
therefore is carried out most appropriately in the public sector research
institutes. However, the research benefits private enterprises with their
capacity to further refine the results through applied and developmental
research.
4.   Enhanced research leads to more advanced products and this requires more
rigorous standards of quality.  This is especially significant for small and
medium industries (SMIs). Industrial policy calls for SMIs to play a key role
as suppliers of parts and materials to large enterprises. The latter have had
to rely heavily on imported parts and materials due largely to the inability
of the SMIs to supply products of adequate quality and reliability. SMIs are
also being encouraged to expand their role as independent exporters in order
to broaden Korea's industrial base especially in technology-intensive
production. A number of measures has been introduced to boost the role of
SMIs as suppliers to large-scale industry and as exporters in their own right.
However, to be successful, SMIs must achieve quality standards comparable with
overseas suppliers and produce products of sufficient quality to be able to
compete in export markets. In support of this, the Government is



strengthening the standards institutes which provide ad-,ice and technical
services to SMIs.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Bank support for technology
development in Korea during the last decade has focussed mainly on financing
R&D projects through financial intermediaries, strengthening those
intermediaries and developing technical and scientific education. These
operations have been consistent with the Government's priorities and
evaluation reports indicate that their objectives have generally been met
successfully. More recently the Bank has started to assist R&D activities in
the universities and the national research institutes. The policy environment
in which the proposed project is being designed is generally sound, having
developed over the last decade with the Bank's assistance under two education
sector loans (1800-KO and 2427-KO) which supported improvements in the policy
framework governing education and research in science and technology. Within
this policy framework, Bank assistance is still required to fill gaps in
investment in research institutions which traditionally have relied on
external financing to meet equipment upgrading needs.
6.        The two previous technology advancement projects (Loans 3037-KO and
3202-KO) have strengthened the R&D capacity of public sector research insti-
tutes thereby improving their ability to provide advice, technical and
research services to industry. The proposed project is the third in a series
of projects which are closely-spaced in order to maximize their impact on
improving support to industry. The project would continue to address the
needs of specific R&D institutions which the Government has identified as
requiring additional quality-improving investments and which the Bank is well-
qualified to provide. The three projects, taken together, would provide
assistance to 10 of the 14 national research institutes thus making an
important contribution to meeting the equipment needs of key laboratories in
the institutes. Furthermore, Bank involvement in the project allows it to
bring value-added to the project design process. Processing of the project
(and its two predecessors) has led to the development of standardized prepara-
tion documents which contain the basic information necessary for project
appraisal. This has increased the cost-effectiveness of the process and
provided a model that Korea may utilize in its role as a donor country. The
project would also continue the opportunity for the Bank to learn lessons from
Korea's experience in technology development which could be utilized
elsewhere.
7.        Project Obiectives.  The broad aim of the project is to reinforce
Government's priority for technology-intensive industrial development by
strengthening industrial R&D and basic research capacity and enhancing the
application of industrial standards to raise the quality of products. More
specifically, the project would assist in: (a) improving the quality of
research programs in the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) to
enhance its ability to support industry in developing advanced technologies;
(b) improving opportunities for joint research activities in the basic
sciences through strengthening common research facilities at the Korea Basic
Science Center (KBSC); and (c) enhancing the development and application of
industrial standards through strengthening the National Industrial Research
Institute (NIRI).

8.        Project Description.  The major component of the project, to be
carried out over a period of three years, would be equipment to be finaxiced by
the Bank amounting to about 65Z of total project costs net of duties and
taxes. The Government would finance complementary inputs, namely civil works
to house some of the equipment (72); installation costs, O&M and consumables
related to the equipment (18Z); and all contingencies (10Z). The proposed
Bank loan, to be disbursed over a period of three and a half years, would
finance items of advanced equipment (baseline cost, US$60.0 million) for three
national institutions which play important roles in Korea's industrial/ tech-
nological development. The loan would finance about 86? of the estimated
foreign exchange cost of the project. Project implementation would be the
responsibility of each project institution w,th the parent ministries of the
project institutions--the Ministry of Science and Technology for KIST and
KBSC, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry for NIRI - becoming involved
directly only in project-wide issues. Equipment procurement would be
undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea in conjunction with the
project institutions. About 85? of the value of equipment would be procured
under ICB. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8965-KO dated February 15, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that:   (a) audit reports
would be submitted by the Government to the Bank within six months of the end
of each financial year; and (b) within six months of the closing date, Part II
of the project completion report would be submitted to the Bank.
10.       Benefits.  The strengthening of KIST's research capacity would
improve its ability to support industry in developing advanced technologies
thereby reinforcing technology development, especially among SMIs, as the
engine of growth in the Korean economy. Opportunities for joint research
efforts in basic sciences would be enhanced through the strengthening of KBSC.
This in turn would lead to a more efficient utilization of resources for basic
research.  The strengthening of NIRI would lead to the development and
application of more rigorous industrial standards which would contribute to
raising the quality of industrial products. This would be particularly
beneficial for exports.
11.       Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the proposed
project.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
