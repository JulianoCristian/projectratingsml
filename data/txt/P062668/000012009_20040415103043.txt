3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

This project was part of the first phase of an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) operation in St. Kitts and Nevis,
St. Lucia, Dominica, Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The program aimed to support the physical
and institutional efforts of the five member countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to
strengthen disaster recovery capacity and emergency preparedness management. The nations' low level of
preparedness, lack of mitigating measures and limited disaster response capability had been evidenced by the
devastating impact of Hurricane Georges on St. Kitts and Nevis in September 1998.

l    The first phase of the program (APL1) was to support the immediate reconstruction and rehabilitation of
     infrastructure in St. Kitts and Nevis and disaster mitigation works and institutional strengthening in St. Kitts
     and Nevis, St. Lucia and Dominica.

l    The second phase (APL2) was to support these same activities in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

l    APL3 was to focus on additional physical investments identified through hazard mapping analysis and was to
     provide further long term institutional strengthening. Funding for this phase was eventually allocated to
     APL2. As a result, APL3 did not materialized.

l    APL4 was to provide contingency funding for any eligible OECS member in case of a severe natural disaster
     during the six year program period. Funding for this phase remains available until the completion of APL2
     expected for January 2006.

It was considered at the time that setting up individual loans for all five countries involved in the program would
be inefficient. As a result, the Bank opted to set up a regional facility to address disaster risks rather than a series
of emergency operations with individual countries. The typical APL approach was modified to provide an
horizontal dimension that would allow countries to join in different phases based on their stages of preparation
(APL 1-3). At the same time, it was also considered more efficient and forward looking to set up a contingent
facility with allowance for post-catastrophe mitigation work that could be called upon in the event of a natural
disaster during project implementation (APL4). The emergency funding would take advantage of the shared risk
characteristics of the group of countries.

The development objectives of the project in St. Kitts & Nevis were:

l    To strengthen key economic and social infrastructure and facilities with the aim of minimizing damage caused
     by future natural disasters and reducing the disruption of economic activity in the event of disaster
     emergencies (pre-disaster works);

l    To reconstruct and rehabilitate key social and economic infrastructure following disasters to allow quick
     recovery and minimize disruption of economic activity (post-disaster works); and

l    To strengthen the country's institutional capacities to prepare for and respond to disaster emergencies in an
     efficient and effective manner.

The objectives were clearly stated and relevant to the situation of St. Kitts & Nevis, which has long been vulnerable
to severe storms and hurricanes resulting in loss of life and infrastructure and property damage. The project
financed structural and non-structural measures to protect people, infrastructure and property from future
hurricanes damage. In addition, it sought to build institutional capacity at the national and local levels, including
the public and private sectors, in order to confront natural disasters more effectively in the future.

The project supported two principal goals of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): supporting infrastructure and
safeguarding the economy. However, the CAS contained no explicit reference to disaster management. This issue
was addressed in an updating economic memorandum which was circulated to the Board in conjunction with the
1998 Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the project and had a clear reference to disaster management

reduction as an important objective of the CAS. The first and third objectives were most relevant to all first phase
countries at the time. The second objective was relevant especially to St. Kitts & Nevis, since there had recently
been a hurricane from which the country was recovering. The loan amount was US$ 8.5 million.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The objectives were not revised

3.3 Original Components:

I. Fast Disbursing Component. (US$ 2.4 million)

l    Provision of US$ 2.4 million in fast-disbursing funds to the Government to be used to finance imports from a
     positive list of items required for recovery from Hurricane Georges. The list included: food grains, edible oils,
     fertilizer, seeds, agricultural equipment and inputs, cement and other construction materials, petroleum and
     fuel products, and medical equipment and supplies. These essential imports could be financed retroactively up
     to a maximum of 20% of the total loan amount. The implementing agency was the Project Coordination Unit
     (PCU) in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development.


II. Physical Prevention and Mitigation Works. (US$ 5.35 million)


l    Reconstruction/rehabilitation of hospitals: Construction of a 40-bed hospital ward in St. Kitts (technical
     assistance by European Union and the Pan American Health Organization - PAHO). Generators were to be
     provided to a hospital and two health posts in Nevis (Ministry of Health).

l    Construction of Shelters: Eight hurricane resistant shelters to lodge crews assisting in relief and restoration of
     services following a hurricane (Ministry of Communication and Works).

l    Improving the reliability of water supply: Providing stand-by generators for use in emergency, a pipe-rack
     storage facility on Nevis and portable storage tanks. Also a study to improve intakes to mitigate future damage
     (Ministry of Communication and Works).

l    Improving electricity supply. Rehabilitate the St. Kitts Power Station, supply equipment and study the
     feasibility of placing underground transmission lines (Electricity utility company).

l    Roads and coastal protection: Studies of beach erosion, slope stabilization and coastal and inland erosion,
     detailed engineering of vulnerable areas and a study of water resource management in small catchment areas.
     Detailed engineering for protecting the airport and ring road on Nevis. Assessment of sea and beach
     movement near tourist areas, fishing areas and the airport. (Ministry of Communications and Works).

l    Replacement of the destroyed air traffic control tower with a mobile unit (Airport Authority).


III. Strengthening the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Emergency Operations Center
(EOC). (US$ 1.45 million)

l    Construction of an Emergency Operations Center in Basseterre to earthquake- and hurricane-resistant
     standards as headquarters for NEMA. It was to have modern disaster management facilities and equipment.
     EOC was also to house a regional training facility for emergency managers.

l    Specialized disaster equipment and loss reduction materials such as portable generators, water purification
     equipment and reinforced plastic sheeting. Some were to be stored in EOC.

l    Island-wide emergency communications system. Equipment to communicate among national agencies and
     disaster management committees at the district and national levels.




                                                          - 3 -

IV. Developing an Effective Early Warning System. (US$ 0.21 million)

l   Support for the National Meteorological Service (NMS). Meteorological equipment and sensors destroyed
    during the hurricane were to be replaced. Computers, phone lines and training were to be provided.

l   Development of a Ham Weather Radio Observation Network. Five to ten auxiliary ham radio weather
    observers to be equipped around the country. Weather stations, radios and training were to be provided.

l   Technical assistance and training. Training in computer technology, basic meteorology, and equipment
    maintenance (National Sea and Airport Authority and National Meteorological Service).


V. Community Based Disaster Management. (US$ 0.11 million)

l   Organization, training and support for new and existing District Disaster Committees to mobilize and educate
    communities in disaster preparedness, mitigation response and recovery. This was to involve citizen
    participation in planning, decision-making and implementation of the National Disaster Plan. Disaster
    Committees were to be provided with disaster supplies and emergency response equipment at the community
    level. Training would be provided on (i) organization and functions of the committees, (ii) Surviving the Next
    Disaster, and (iii) other skills such as emergency search and rescue (NEMA and Ministry of Community
    Development).

VI. Institutional Strengthening. (US$ 0.28 million)

l   Hazard Analysis/Vulnerability Mapping. Identify hazards and vulnerable sites for future mitigation activities
    and to set appropriate standards for development planning.

l   Vulnerability reduction of public buildings. Reduction of potential fiscal liabilities of the Government by
    insuring buildings and facilities and reducing their vulnerability.

l   Building codes. Strengthen the resilience of buildings to disasters through the adoption and enforcement of a
    national building code.


VII. Project Management. (US$ 0.52 million)

3.4 Revised Components:

There were no major revisions requiring changes in the legal agreements. However, given the destruction of
Hurricane Lenny, the studies of roads and coastal protection were focused more precisely on the demonstrated
needs (see section 5.1). Also, as noted below, some components were dropped from the project due to lack of
progress, and others were financed by other donors.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

A Project Concept Document was prepared in June 1998, and the Commonwealth Ministerial Group met with the
President of the World Bank in July 1998. A pre-preparation-pre-appraisal mission visited St. Kitts and Nevis in
September 1998. Negotiations, Board Approval and Signing were all accomplished by December 1998. The
project identified for St. Kitts and Nevis was similar to the other countries (an Emergency Operations Center, sea
defenses and beach protection, community shelters, power facilities, generators for wells and retrofitting of the
hospital).

The project was identified in a short time, but the components were appropriate for this type of project. There was
an emergency situation in St. Kitts & Nevis at the time. Given the rapid assessment of needs and the rapid
response, quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

A Quality at Entry Assessment was carried out in March 1999 by QAG for the whole APL program. QAG gave an
overall rating of 2 (satisfactory). Most of the detailed ratings were also graded satisfactory. The project was rated
Highly Satisfactory for strength of borrower ownership, for adequacy of sector knowledge and for the strategy
underpinning the project. QAG also gave a Highly Satisfactory rating to the use of lessons of previous experience.
On the other hand, QAG gave only a Marginal rating for the adequacy of arrangements for mitigation/managing
environmental impacts during implementation, indicating more attention should have been given to strengthening
environmental management capacity. The project was also ranked only Marginal on the adequacy of information
on financial management because it was silent on the LACI process. The capacity and incentives of the executing
agency were judged Marginal, because the ministries' capacity was not assessed and the PCU was untested. QAG
felt that institutional risks were not adequately accounted for in project design and performance indicators were too
general. QAG gave an Unsatisfactory rating to social impact monitoring.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

l    Resilience of infrastructure has been improved, which should result in reduced disruption of economic activity
     in case of adverse events. Water and electricity supplies have been made more secure. A new hospital wing
     has been built using hurricane resistant techniques. Studies of road and coastal protection works have been
     prepared for implementation in the future. An Emergency Operations Center has been constructed and
     provided with emergency equipment. Emergency shelters have been built or reinforced. An island-wide
     communications center has been established. The planned upgrading of meteorological systems was less
     successful. Hazard mapping, building vulnerability reduction and building code improvements were provided
     by USAID/OAS.

l    The airport tower in St. Kitts, which had been damaged during hurricane Georges, has been rehabilitated with
     bilateral assistance.

l    Capacity has been improved. Hospital workers were given preparedness training. National Meteorological
     Service staff and communities were trained in disaster preparedness (USAID).

Achievement of objectives is rated satisfactory.

4.2 Outputs by components:

I. Fast Disbursing Component.

l    Eligible expenditures were presented with adequate supporting documentation to enable the fast disbursing
     component to be disbursed before the end of 1999, eight months after effectiveness.

II. Physical Prevention and Mitigation Works.

l    Reconstruction/rehabilitation of hospitals: The Bank-financed construction of a 40-bed hospital ward which
     was completed in February 2001 within cost estimates. The EU funded accident and emergency operation
     theaters. Provision of a wide range of equipment (beds, crash carts, etc.) was delayed pending availability of
     counterpart funds. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) provided training in mass casualty
     management, stress management during disasters and contingency planning. The hospital has also revised its
     disaster management plan.

l    Construction of Shelters: Five shelters were completed of the eight planned (3 in St. Kitts and 2 in Nevis). A
     comprehensive shelter policy was developed and submitted to Cabinet for approval. All shelters have multiple
     uses as community centers, post offices and some as health centers. Forty shelter managers have been trained.

l    Improving the reliability of water supply: Ten stand-by generators were installed in both St. Kitts and Nevis.
     They have been installed at the sites of wells and are already in use providing power to water pumps during

     power outages. They are maintained by the Ministry of Works. The study to improve water intakes in Nevis
     was postponed.

l    Improving electricity supply: A study was undertaken of the possibility of installing underground transmission
     lines which would be less vulnerable to storms. This was found to be too expensive, but some lines will be put
     underground as funds are available. The electricity utility company has acquired heavy equipment to install
     more durable poles and is presently upgrading the system to be more storm resistant. Part of the component
     was revised to include additional equipment for power station roofing works.

l    Roads and coastal protection: Studies were contracted for (i) Integrated Coastal Management (contract signed
     Dec. 24, 2002) and flood control and (ii) slope stabilization and drainage in Basseterre (contract signed
     January 20, 2003). Both contracts were completed in June 2003. However the total cost of implementing the
     recommendations of these studies is extremely high and a more affordable prioritized program needs to be
     elaborated (see lessons learned).

l    The reconstruction of the air traffic control tower in St. Kitts has been financed by a French grant (Airport
     Authority).

III. Strengthening the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Emergency Operations Center
(EOC).

l    The construction of the EOC in Buckley was contracted in December 2002 and completed by project closing.
     A stand-by generator has not been acquired for the EOC because of procurement delays and still needs to be
     procured. Specialized disaster equipment for EOC has been delivered, including loss reduction materials
     (portable generators, water purification equipment and reinforced plastic sheeting). It is being stored in
     NEMA's temporary headquarters until completion of the warehouse being built by the US Military at the new
     EOC site.

l    The island-wide emergency communications system has been procured. A comprehensive telecommunications
     proposal was developed by a regional consultant, including detailed specifications. VHF radios will be
     installed soon with two repeater sites in St. Kitts and one in Nevis.

IV. Developing an Effective Early Warning System.

l    Support for the National Meteorological Service (NMS). Some office equipment was purchased for NMS. It
     was decided not to purchase meteorological equipment and sensors.

l    Development of a Ham Weather Radio Observation Network. A decision was taken to reallocate the funding
     for this component to the island-wide Communications System.

l    Technical assistance and training. Maintenance of meteorological equipment and training was provided.
     Further requests for technical assistance and training did not fit the project objectives and were not financed.


V. Community Based Disaster Management.

l    Training was provided under the USAID/OFDA funded PGDM program and completed in all districts by
     October 2001.

VI. Institutional Strengthening.

The Organization of American States' Unit for Sustainable Development and Environment (OAS/USDE)
implemented the disaster mitigation capacity building component for USAID-J/CAR, under the project
Post-Georges Disaster Mitigation (PGDM).

l    Hazard Analysis/Vulnerability Mapping. Hazard mitigation mapping was completed, and a hazard mitigation
     workshop was held. A Hazard Mitigation Policy and Operational Plan were prepared.




                                                          - 6 -

l    Vulnerability reduction of public buildings. Structural vulnerability assessments to hurricanes and
     earthquakes were completed for 94 public buildings.

l    Building codes. OECS Building Code and Guidelines were passed by Parliament, and building inspectors'
     courses were held. A multi-hazard building design course was also held, and building code sensitization
     workshops were held. A booklet on building code guidelines was printed. More inspectors and training are
     needed.


4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

It was not possible to calculate economic rates of return for this type of project.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

It was not possible to calculate financial rates of return for this type of project.

4.5 Institutional development impact:


Institutional development lagged at the beginning of the project period. In the wake of Hurricane Georges the
National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) depended on volunteer staff and did not have a permanent
headquarters. As a result of the project NEMA will soon occupy its new headquarters. The government has shown
its commitment to improving emergency preparedness by funding a Director, a Public Relations Officer, a
Districts' Coordinator and four clerical staff. The Districts' Coordinator is organizing local disaster management
committees (8 on St. Kitts and 5 on Nevis).

The availability of sound structures to house NEMA and to serve as community shelters, should provide continuity
to daily life in the event of a disaster. EOC would be the designated site for continuity of government during an
emergency.

The National Hazard Mitigation Council (NHMC) was mandated under the project. NEMA serves as its
secretariat, calling meetings and setting the agenda. During the 2001/02/03 hurricane seasons, NHMC met
regularly and developed activities to strengthen readiness.

NMS was late in providing technical specifications for meteorological equipment. Part of the funding for NMS
was ultimately cancelled.

With support from OAS/USDE, hazard mitigation mapping was completed, structural vulnerability of public
buildings was assessed and building code guidelines were enacted. Building inspectors have been trained, but
more follow-up is needed, such as training for architects and builders. Funding would be needed for this.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Hurricane Lenny struck St. Kitts and Nevis in November 1999. Missions agreed to accelerate the implementation
of the two studies of long-term options for coastal protection, the ring road of St Kitts and flood control and slope
stabilization, and to prepare preliminary engineering designs for priority investments.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Government appointed almost all members of the PCU on time. The government also provided counterpart funds
in a timely manner.




                                                           - 7 -

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

In September 1999, when implementation should have been well underway, there were delays, and the project was
rated unsatisfactory for implementation progress. The Project Accountant could not attend training in accounting
which led to problems with Bank disbursements. By late 2001 an agreement was reached between the Bank and the
Government to change the financial reporting system to the Statement of Expenditure (SOE) format, which led to
an improvement of government's ability to meet financial reporting requirements.

There were delays in contracting works, especially the EOC and the emergency shelters due to weak procurement
capacity. There were also delays in contracting the studies of sea defenses and integrated coastal management and
flood control and stabilization for Basseterre. Later in the project the Project Coordinator was still spread too thin
among multiple assignments with insufficient time to manage and monitor the project closely. Other staff
members assigned to the project were inexperienced. There was also inadequate office space and slowness of
response from Ministry of Public Works engineers. Especially because of these issues, the closing date had to be
extended from January 31, 2002 to October 31, 2003. There were also delays with auditing which required
recruitment of auditors from outside St. Kitts & Nevis. In spite of these issues, implementation did improve during
the final stages of the project.

5.4 Costs and financing:

Of the US$ 10.85 million total project cost amount determined at appraisal, US$ 10.20 million was spent under the
project, which was 94% of the appraisal estimate. Of the final project cost, the Bank financed US$ 8.5 million,
US$ 0.87 million was provided as counterpart funding by government and US$ 0.84 million was provided from
cofinanciers.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

NEMA has been acknowledged as a key institution within government with a permanent staff and a recurrent
budget. Forty shelter managers have been trained. The National Meteorology Service participated only marginally
in the project. Gains there are less likely to be sustained.

Provided adequate maintenance is provided in the future, most of the physical components and institutions created
under the project are expected to be sustainable. The EOC and the emergency shelters have been constructed using
hurricane resistant materials and techniques. They are equipped for future disasters. Forty shelter managers have
been trained. The hospital wing, including a trauma unit has also been constructed using hurricane resistant
construction. The French-financed air traffic control tower is more operational and more storm resistant. All
construction under the project is now under the responsibility of specific ministries responsible for operation and
maintenance.

The project has helped to increase awareness of disaster risk management. This is not only due to physical works,
but also to the institutional development and public consciousness raising. With the establishment of the National
Disaster Mitigation Council, disaster preparedness and management are now more in the public eye. The public is
becoming more aware of and involved in the ongoing disaster mitigation process.
On balance the gains made under the project are likely to be sustainable.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

The Emergency Operations Center is built and much of the specialized emergency equipment that was procured
under the project is being stored. The EOC will soon be operational and the equipment will be stored in a




                                                          - 8 -

warehouse at the new site. The five community shelters that have been built (three on St. Kitts; two on Nevis) are
available for future emergencies. Forty shelter managers have been trained. NEMA will soon move quarters and
will remain in charge of coordinating disaster preparedness.




7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Following high level discussions between the Bank and the Commonwealth Ministry Group in July 1998, only two
months were needed to send an identification mission. Preparation was urgent because Hurricane Georges caused
major damage to St. Kitts and Nevis on September 21, 1998. The Appraisal Report was prepared in early
December 1998 and Board Presentation came on December, 12, 1998. Despite the short time taken to appraise the
project, the appraisal document contained a large number of details of the project to be implemented.

Bank performance in lending is rated satisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:

During implementation there were thirteen supervision missions, most with an operations officer or disaster
management officer and a disbursement or finance officer. Procurement specialists joined missions, especially at
the beginning of the project period. Supervision reports were well prepared and included detailed checklists for
tracking the progress of each component. These checklists, which were updated by each mission, provided a good
basis to monitor progress. Bank supervision helped to give impetus to implementation when the project stalled in
the early years.

Bank performance in supervision is rated satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Especially because of the urgency with which the Bank responded in preparation, the help and guidance provided
to keep the project on track in the early years and the thoroughness of supervision, Bank performance is rated
satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Local officials participated in the identification of components for the project. Because of the speed with which the
project was appraised, much of the detailed preparation had to be undertaken after appraisal. By March 1999, the
PCU was practically established and the Ministry of Finance, Development and Planning had appointed a full-time
and experienced Project Coordinator. However, not all the staff were fully available to the project from the outset.

Borrower performance during preparation is rated satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Government appointed staff to the PCU before effectiveness. It also provided counterpart funding and mobilized
contributions from other donors, including USAID, the OAS and AFD. Government performance is rated
satisfactory.




                                                         - 9 -

7.6 Implementing Agency:

The PCU was appointed fairly quickly, and work began soon after effectiveness. The PCU managed the fast
disbursement component during 1999. However, there were delays in contracting some works and studies (see
Section 5.3). This led to an unsatisfactory rating for implementation in late 1999 and early 2000. Ultimately a
project extension was required. In the end, however most of the problems were resolved. On balance
implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory.


7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Most of the project components, including the most important works, studies and equipment procurement, were
implemented, albeit with a one year and nine month delay. However, the end result is an improved institutional
and physical capacity to confront disasters. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned


Lessons Specific to St. Kitts and Nevis:

l   A project like this can bring disaster management into the mainstream, not just through implementation of
    works and procurement of disaster supplies, but through consistent supervision and consciousness raising.

Lessons Relevant to all the ERDMP Projects

l   Reconstruction components often require careful assessment and long term effort that generally extends
    beyond the normal three year implementation period for Bank-assisted emergency operations. Therefore,
    priority in this type of projects should be given to prevention, immediate measures to reactivate economic
    activity and careful assessment of longer-term reconstruction priorities and designs. If major works are
    included in an emergency project, as was the case in this project, there should be an explicit provision at the
    design stage for a review of project scope after designs have been prepared. In this particular case, it would
    have been more practical to separate the actual emergency operation, which would have included quick
    disbursing components and technical assistance, and have the actual reconstruction works financed by a
    standard investment loan in a later phase of the APL.

l   It would have been preferable to process the various loan/credit for the different OECS countries as separate
    projects, part of a broader program, but not integrated into one horizontal APL. In the Bank system, APL
    phases each correspond to one project (i.e. with one P0 number) which does not allow for a segregation of
    reporting and accounting on individual sub-projects. The task team had important problems at the beginning
    of the program to obtain differentiated P0 number for each country.

l   The performance of the PCUs was slow to develop in most cases. Ad hoc implementation arrangements
    through Project Coordination Units (PCUs) need to be carefully considered. In projects lacking a critical mass
    of work it is difficult for governments to allocate enough of their scarce qualified manpower to these units.

l   TORs for consulting engineers need to specify government budget constraints to avoid over-designed
    infrastructure that will be unaffordable to implement. The Bank needs to consider requiring performance
    guarantees of consultants and applying penalties for late submissions.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT

Introduction

The Loan Agreement # 4188 (Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project) between the Government of
St. Kitts and Nevis (GSKN) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) was
signed on December 15,1998 and the Project became effective on April 26, 1999.

Through this Program, financial resources in the amount of US$8.5 million was provided to target a
comprehensive and integrated set of activities all in support of the national disaster mitigation objectives of the
Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the Project are clearly identified in the Project Appraisal Document published for the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Program. These
objectives are as follows:

i.   To strengthen key economic and social infrastructure and facilities with the aim of minimizing the damage
     caused by future natural disasters and reducing the disruption of economic activity in the event of disaster
     emergencies.
ii. To reconstruct and rehabilitate key social and economic infrastructure following disasters to allow quick
     recovery and minimize disruption of economic activity.
iii. To strengthen St. Kitts and Nevis institutional capacity to prepare for and respond to emergencies in an
     efficient and effective manner.

In St. Kitts and Nevis (SKN) six (6) components were identified to fulfill the stated objectives. The components
were identified as follows:

· Fast Disbursement
· Physical Prevention and Mitigation Works
· Strengthening National Emergency Management Agency and the Emergency Operations Center
· Developing an Effective Early Warning System
· Community Based Disaster Management
· Institutional Strengthening

Achievement of the Objectives

It would be fair to say that the Project has effectively achieved its broad objectives as highlighted paragraph 1.2
above. The implementation of the Project has not only resulted in the improvement of infrastructure related to
pre-disaster preparation and post disaster rehabilitation but also made notable impacts regarding:

a) strengthening institutional capacities as they relate to disaster management; and
b) contributing to the enhancement of capacity of key government institutions to work in an integrated manner, as
     well as their capacity to provide project management services.

Both the World Bank and the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis acknowledge the achievements of the Project as it
provided the catalyst for reform, for community outreach and helped to stimulate donor interest in the sector
thereby bringing added leverage to the resources committed by the World Bank.

Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project

Some aspects of the Project were relatively easy to implement while others posed some serious challenges to the
team working within and along with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). A careful review of the Project
Components would invite the conclusion that this Project was designed to provide solutions to most of the
problems identified in the focal sector. Consequently, the PCU was faced with the challenge of coordinating
activities among numerous players who represented the various focal points. During implementation it became
obvious that the original design had underestimated both the level of financial resources and the complexity of
implementing an ambitious project that intersected many sectors.

The Fast Disbursing Component can be considered the easiest of the components to be executed and was executed
in good time without much effort. The retroactive financing option was also a feature of the Project that facilitated
the ease of implementation of this component.

The Physical Recovery and Mitigation Works component proved to be the most challenging component to
implement. Some notable delays were experienced in terms of the implementation of a number of activities falling
under various sub-components. The difficulties experienced were due primarily to the lack of knowledge of the
World Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, inadequate in house capacity to prepare terms of reference
and specifications, inadequate preparation for the identification of appropriate sites for the construction of shelters
and serious underestimation of the construction costs.

The medical and surgical wards of the JN France General Hospital were reconstructed to hurricane standards with
a capacity of 80 beds. Five shelters were constructed also with the capability to withstand hurricanes.

The construction of the shelters will significantly enhance the Government's capacity to respond to future needs as
they relate to providing public shelter in times of disaster. Approximately 400 persons would be able to find
appropriate emergency shelter without placing additional pressure on the Government to rationalize the use of
other public facilities (schools) which primary use conflicts with public emergency shelter requirements. The
design of these community shelters also provides an excellent opportunity for the Government to fulfill the
demands of the respective communities for the construction of multipurpose facilities. In this regard, NEMA, the
Ministry of Social Development and Community Based Organizations would use the emergency shelters during
non-disaster periods as community centers to facilitate community development activities, outreach and training
activities.

The reliability of supplying water to a number of communities on both St. Kitts and Nevis has been significantly
improved through the purchase and installation of backup generators.

An in depth inspection of the building at Needs Must Power Station (on St. Kitts) revealed that there were
numerous structural problems that would need to be addressed prior to and in addition to repairing the roof. Due
to the limitation of the funding available under the electricity subcomponent, the Project was unable to pursue the
planned repairs to the roof of the Needs must Power Station on St. Kitts.

The Project was however successful in implementing the planned distribution study on St. Kitts and on Nevis. The
distribution study provided very important information from which the Government was able to make critical
decisions in relation to the upgrading of the electricity distribution system. The study done under the Project
revealed that the option of placing electrical feeders underground would be an extremely expensive undertaking.
Therefore the Government has taken the decision to strengthen the overhead system in the short to medium term.
This upgrade work is currently ongoing under a separate Project. All other major activities under this
subcomponent were successfully implemented. The implementation of the roads and coastal protection
subcomponent resulted in the production of two major studies which will assist GSKN to prioritize future
interventions in the areas of coastal protection/sea defenses, flood control and slope stabilization.

Interventions pursued under the Strengthening Emergency Preparedness and Response component have
considerably strengthened the ability of the Government to effectively plan for and coordinate responses to


                                                          - 22 -

disasters. This has been accomplished through the construction of a modern hurricane resistant building which is
outfitted with basic furniture, disaster related equipment and loss reduction materials. This building will function
as the National Emergency Operations Center and will also provide office facilities for NEMA. The establishment
of an island wide emergency communication system is also expected to make a positive impact on the improved
capability of SKN to respond to both man made and natural disaster emergencies. During the period under review
NEMA was responsible for coordinating several local and regional training activities that involved participants
from both the public and private sectors. Such training initiatives were focused on community disaster planning,
shelter management, management of relief supplies, damage assessment, stress management, mass casualty
management and multi-hazard building design.

The Institutional Strengthening component was one of the most interesting to implement as it provided the
opportunity for GSKN to take advantage of the interest shown by another donor agency in buying into the
Government's plans for recovery and mitigation. This component of the Project was co-financed by USAID/OFDA
through a grant of US$500,000.00 to the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. The main accomplishments to be
highlighted here are the work completed on hazard and vulnerability mapping and building codes.

In the aftermath of the impact of Hurricane Georges in 1998 and in recognition of the importance of disaster
management GSKN took the bold step of changing its policy on disaster management. This was manifested in two
key areas of institutional strengthening namely the passing of the St. Kitts and Nevis Disaster Management Act
and by considering disaster management as a full subject area requiring full time personnel as opposed to simply
relying on part-time volunteers. Therefore, in accordance with the St. Kitts and Nevis Disaster Management Act
of 1998, the Board of Directors for NEMA was legally instituted, with a composition of nine members. Budgetary
and administrative arrangements were made to accommodate the establishment of the National Disaster
Management Agency. Today, NEMA has a staff allocation of 10 full time officers that include a National Disaster
Coordinator, Deputy National Disaster Coordinator, Planning Officer, Public Relations Officer and District
Coordinator. Further, the Hurricane Georges Recovery Task Force was successfully transformed into the
permanent National Disaster Mitigation Council (NDMC), which is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. The
primary objective of the Council is to assist GSKN in the coordination of disaster management activities and advise
on post impact recovery programs and mitigation priorities.

Financial Management

St. Kitts and Nevis was one of the first countries to use the World Banks' new Loan Administration Change
Initiative (LACI) format for financial reporting. Under this new initiative the PCU was expected to prepare and
submit quarterly reports to the World Bank, (including a statement of sources and uses of funds) and ensuring that
all project guidelines were being followed. In this regard, the PCU encountered some serious problems which
negatively impacted the smooth implementation of the Project. In addition to the fact that LACI demands an
excessive amount of information, some Bank staff assigned to work with the Project did not seem to have the
necessary in-depth expertise or experience in operating the LACI system. As a result they were unable to provide
clear instructions and advice to enable the efficient completion of the Reports. The heart of this problem was
highlighted by the various interpretations of the rules and regulations for operating under the LACI system. This
was particularly problematic where the LACI generated Reports were linked to the disbursement process. The end
result was slow processing of claims for withdrawal of the proceeds of the Loan which in turn affected the cash
flow position of the Project.

By late 2001 an agreement was reached between the Bank and GSKN and a decision was taken to change the
financial reporting format from the LACI method to the Statement of Expenditure (SOE) method. This required
the PCU to produce Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on the same quarterly basis instead of Project
Monitoring Reports (PMRs). The change from LACI to SOE resulted in significant improvement in GSKN ability
to meet the financial reporting requirements and therefore fulfill the Financial Covenants established for the
operation of the Loan.

The PCU also encountered some problems with the Special Account held at the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank.
The World Bank requires the Special Account to be held in US dollars and therefore all statements for the Special


                                                        - 23 -

Account must be reflected in United States Dollars. However, the original account was established as an EC dollar
account. Consequently, since the start of the Project the bank statements were produced in Eastern Caribbean
Dollars. This problem was addressed by the closure of the original Special Account that was denominated in EC
currency and a new US dollar account was opened as of May 1st 2001. Due to some difficulties encountered by the
PCU in managing the Special Account at the Central Bank, the Government accepted the recommendation to
establish the US dollar Special Account at a commercial bank which provided more flexibility to the PCU
particularly in situations where there was a need to issue letters of credit to suppliers. The St. Kitts/Nevis/Anguilla
National Bank was approved for the establishment of the Special Account however under the command of the
World Bank the account was later transferred to the Bank of Nova Scotia.

The insistence of the World Bank to have the Special Account transferred from an indigenous bank, the St. Kitts-
Nevis- Anguilla National Bank to a foreign bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia is a source of concern to the
Government. The experience of the PCU has revealed that there is no notable improvement in the efficiency or
cost of doing business with Scotia Bank as opposed to the National Bank. In fact, doing business at Scotia Bank
has proven more costly to the Government than with the National Bank. The virtual blockage placed on National
Bank is a serious issue and the Government would very much welcome the opportunity to dialogue with the Bank
on this issue, with a view towards assessing the validity of the decision and building a consensus on the way
forward.

Another requirement of the Loan Agreement is the undertaking of Financial Audits for all accounts and
components of the Project. Audit reports should be submitted to the World Bank no later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year. The PCU encountered some setbacks in trying to fulfill this Financial Covenant. The
primary source of this problem was the recruitment of independent Auditors for the auditing of Project activities
during 1998 and also for the audit of the 1999 Project activities. Several local auditing firms were contacted
however only one firm expressed any interest in providing services to the Project. The PCU was forced to look
beyond the borders of St. Kitts and Nevis to recruit competent auditors who were interested in working under the
terms and conditions established under the Loan Agreement and the auditing Terms of Reference.

With this new approach the Government was successful in recruiting an independent Auditor to undertake the
auditing functions required by the Project during the financial years 1999, 2000 and 2001. These services were
extended to cover the years 2002 and 2003 after the extension of the Loan was requested from and granted by the
World Bank in 2001. Despite the reasonably early signing of a contract with Price Water House Coopers for the
auditing services for the three years indicated, the presentation of annual Audit Reports was not possible for
submission to the Bank by the due dates. Throughout the implementation of the Project the PCU has consistently
worked with the Auditors to complete the necessary audit work and deliver the Reports by the obligated deadlines.

Procurement

The limited technical capacity to develop detailed specifications and to complete the required procurement
documents negatively affected the smooth progress of the various procurement activities. This was more evident in
the early stages of the implementation of the Project.

A Project Procurement Plan was prepared and approved by the Bank. This Plan was revised regularly during the
implementation of the Project. Due to the fact that the executing agencies had limited knowledge and experience
with the application of the World Bank Procurement Guidelines most of the procurement activities were
concentrated at the PCU. Additionally, the standard procurement documents issued by the Bank are pretty lengthy
documents which serves to intimidate those who are novices at preparing them for submission to the Bank (for
clearance) and potential suppliers of goods and services. During the March 1999 mission, this weakness in relation
to local knowledge and experience with World Bank procurement guidelines was highlighted and it was agreed
that the mission would investigate the possibility of providing some training in procurement for Government
officials in St. Kitts and Nevis. To date only one person associated with this Project has benefited from any official
training in World Bank procurement guidelines and procedures. The experience of the PCU over the
implementation of the Project has proven that this type of training is still very much needed. It is recommended
that the Bank seriously consider GSKN's request for the Bank to conduct a series of short-term workshops (3 to 5



                                                         - 24 -

days) on procurement for relevant officials from all the implementing agencies associated with the World Bank
financed Projects as well as PCU staff members and other relevant persons in the public and private sectors.
Despite the weakness the Procurement process has been competently managed and successfully executed under all
components of the ERDMP that were pursued.

Bank Performance and Bank Supervision

The overall performance of the World Bank is considered satisfactory. The PCU and indeed the Government
recognizes the invaluable contribution of the Bank staff in making this Project a success. The degree of success
achieved in implementing the Project is in part due to the generally high level of support provided by the Bank.
This support was manifested in the ease of access to Bank staff, willingness of staff to provide guidance on Bank
procedures and expert advise on some technical issues. The regular World Bank Supervision Mission added an
important dimension to the coordination, supervision and management of the Project. While the Government
welcomes the opportunity for these visits, the experience has been that such missions are very time consuming
(preparing for and facilitating in country mission activities) and place significant burden on the PCU staff
members and other key stakeholders.

The World Bank carried out approximately 14 supervision missions to the Federation over the implementation
period of the Emergence Recovery and Disaster Management Project. During these visits the various Bank Teams
held numerous meetings with staff of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), other relevant government officials and
persons from the private sector. The supervision missions provided the valuable opportunity for GSKN officials
working with the Project (particularly the PCU staff) to interact with and learn from the wide and varied
experience of the experts/specialists who participated in missions. The implementation of the Project was to some
extent handicapped by the high turnover of staff assigned to work with the Project. Over the period of
implementation the PCU has worked with about five different Task Managers who were supported by an ever
changing group of experts/specialists. These Managers and experts usually came to the Project with different
approaches and management styles to which the PCU had to adjust in order to help keep the Project on track.

Borrower Performance

Considering the constraints highlighted earlier in this Report, the overall performance of the Government of St.
Kitts and Nevis is deemed satisfactory.

Project Coordination and Management

Immediately after the signing of the Loan Agreement, GSKN successfully established the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) within the Planning Unit of the Ministry of Finance, Development and Planning. The core staff of the
PCU included a Project Coordinator, an Assistant Coordinator (on Nevis), a Supervising/Project Accountant, a
Contract Specialist, and an Administrative Assistant. The PCU was established primarily to coordinate and
monitor the implementation progress in accordance with the performance indicators previously agreed upon with
the World Bank.

In addition to the PCU a number of key Government Ministries/Departments were charged with responsibility for
the execution of specific component/sub-components. Each executing entity was required to designate a focal point
who provided the main liaison with the PCU and maintained communication on a regular basis on all issues
related to the respective component or sub-component.

As a requirement of the Loan Agreement, GSKN formally established a National Disaster Mitigation Council
which served as a steering committee to coordinate policy issues, and recommend the selection of priority physical
investments. The Council consists of representatives of relevant government ministries involved in the Project, as
well as representatives from the private sector and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The Council will
continue to function as a permanent body, with its Secretariat at NEMA, even after the Project is officially closed.




                                                        - 25 -

Counterpart Funds and Co-financing

It was agreed that the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis would seek out one or more co-financers to assist in
financing the Project (up to US$500,000.00) on the terms and conditions to be determined/agreed with such
co-financiers. In order to meet the requirements for co-financing and counterpart financing, it was later agreed
with the Bank that specific activities would be identified for financing by the Bank, the Government St. Kitts and
Nevis and the co-financiers. In this regard, GSKN was able to secure co-financing in the form of grant resources
from the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) and USAID/OFDA. Approximately, US$1,500,000.00 was
contributed to the Project from these two sources. See Annex 1 for more details.

While the co-financing and counterpart financing aspect of the Project added a measure of flexibility it also created
another level of complexity in respect of the coordination and management of the Project. On the positive side, the
co-financing option presented the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis with a good opportunity for leverage in
relation to attracting and using additional sources of funds. The Project benefited from additional funds provided
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the ROC. The Project did not encounter
any problems pertaining to the provision of the necessary counterpart financing. The Government demonstrated
an unwavering commitment to the implementation of the Project through the provision of the required budgetary
allocations on an annual basis. In fact, on the occasions when problems were encountered with slow disbursements
from the Bank, the PCU was able to access counterpart resources to make payments on behalf of the Bank then
later seek reimbursement of the funds expended. Counterpart financing contributed to the Project is estimated at
US$1,124,000.00.

Assessment of Outcome

The Government of St. Kitts and Nevis views the implementation of this Project as successful. Our assessment of
the Project is that it has proven to be a leading catalyst for sprouting new programs and placing the issue of
disaster management on the national agenda. The implementation of the Project has produced significant results
to improve the national disaster management situation in the Federation. More specifically, there has been
noteworthy strengthening of key economic and social infrastructure through the reconstruction of the medical and
surgical wards, the construction of five community shelters, and a modern emergency operations center. During
the period of implementation the Country made important strides in strengthening institutional capacity in the
focal sector with increased fulltime staffing, the elaboration of a business plan for NEMA, and the
institutionalization of the National Disaster Mitigation Council.

Project Sustainability

The Project is considered successful and has received backing from the highest levels of Government. Disaster
preparedness and management are featured as important elements of the Government's priorities. With the
establishment and full operation of the National Disaster Mitigation Council (NDMC), disaster preparedness and
management are kept on the agenda at the levels of the public, private and civil society. Through the NDMC the
Government has initiated a structure within which the public-private sector partnership can be developed and the
private sector can be encouraged to share in the development and implementation of Government's disaster
management strategy.

Today, all major Government ministries /departments have developed specific emergency plans that have been
formally adopted as part of their regular operations. Resource gaps and needs are not only identified but resources
are earmarked to build on the work carried out by the Project and to fulfill the needs so as to ensure sustainability
of the work done under the Project.

It is intended that at the close of the Project all physical assets acquired under the Project will become the property
of the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis and placed in the care of the relevant focal agency which would be
responsible for storage, operation and maintenance. The operating and maintenance costs associated with the
acquisition of these assets will then become the responsibility of the respective entity and therefore be integrated
into their regular recurrent budgets.


                                                           - 26 -

If the Project is placed in a national context and the unmet disaster management and physical investment needs are
taken into consideration then the issue of sustainability of the intervention is not without challenges. Questions are
raised regarding access to the appropriate resources that would be critical in addressing the future investment
requirements to meet the targeted goals of the Government and to build on this initial investment. Updating of
information and maintenance of national, sector and departmental emergency plans poses another challenge, as
they must be reviewed frequently to remain relevant to the growing culture of risk management.

Conversely, the current graduated status of St. Kitts and Nevis, (a small island developing state which is highly
vulnerable to natural disasters and external economic shocks and which has been graduated from concessionary
financing opportunities by the World Bank), begs the question as to the sustainability of borrowing at market rates
to finance pre-disaster and reconstruction investments. In this regard, GSKN strongly recommends that the
criterion for graduation from access to concessionary resources be reviewed especially in relation to the provision
of resources in response to natural disasters.

Future Operation

The successful implementation of the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project, the apparent high
level of unmet pre and post disaster needs, and the capacity of GSKN to meet most of the conditions set for the
triggering of APL 3 have stimulated the Government's interest in accessing further assistance from the IBRD
through the resources programmed under APL 3. The APL 3 resources would be targeted at critical physical
investments that were identified in the various studies particularly, those falling under the roads and coastal
protection component of the ERDMP.

Lessons Learned

The implementation of the World Bank financed Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project
highlighted many lessons that are instructive for the future implementation of World Bank financed and non-
World Bank financed Projects. The important lessons learnt are highlighted as follows.

1. A fair amount of flexibility is required when implementing projects with a crosscutting team such as disaster
     management.

2. Aid coordination at the national level is critical to achieving maximum leverage and impact from available
     resources.

3. As far as possible land identification and access issues should be settled prior to reaching the implementation
     phase.

4. Need to seek technical assistance early in cases where capacity to prepare detailed specifications is lacking.

5. Project design is a very critical factor in determining the degree to which the Project can be successfully
     implemented, the objectives and desired outcomes are achieved.

6. Increased stakeholder involvement in the design and implementation phase for the Project can aid in
     improving the successful implementation and general impact of the Project.
