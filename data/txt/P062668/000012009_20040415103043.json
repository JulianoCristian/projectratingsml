"Ratings convey a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, with substantial\n            institutional development impacts, and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower. Lessons specific\n            to St. Kitts and Nevis suggest that projects like this one,\n            can bring disaster management into the mainstream, not just\n            through implementation of works and procurement of disaster\n            supplies, but through consistent supervision, and\n            consciousness raising. Lessons relevant to emergency\n            operations as a whole suggest priority in this type of\n            projects, should be given to prevention, immediate measures\n            to reactivate economic activity, and careful assessment of\n            longer-term reconstruction priorities and designs; that it\n            would have been preferable to process the various\n            loans/credits for the different OECS countries, as separate\n            projects, part of a broader program, but not integrated into\n            one horizontal APL; that careful attention should be given\n            to the project unit manpower, particularly given local\n            capacity constraints; that terms of reference for consulting\n            engineers, should specify government budget constraints to\n            avoid unaffordable infrastructure, while the Bank should\n            also require performance guarantees of consultants, and\n            apply penalties for late submissions, as needed."}, "docdt": "2004-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
