Some lessons learned\n            included: there is a trade-off between speed and targeting\n            accuracy in the preparation of emergency response\n            operations.  Emergency response can be fruitfully combined\n            with the development of a longer-term program.  It is not\n            self-evident that reducing taxes on food staples will lower\n            their prices: if tax reduction is to be used as an\n            instrument there should be sufficient evidence to\n            demonstrate that the proceeds will be passed through to the\n            consumer and that the poor will be targeted."}, "docdt": "2012-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
