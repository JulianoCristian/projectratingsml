1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design +
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)


1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)


The first phase of the Education Quality Improvement Program (EQIP I) was prepared in a
favorable economic and demographic context. Between 1995 and 2000, GDP grew by an average
of 5.7 percent per year resulting in a significant reduction in poverty; the population considered
poor or vulnerable fell from 17 percent to 10 percent during the same period. The macroeconomic
situation was stable with an inflation rate of 2.9 percent per year and a fiscal deficit of 3.2 percent
of GDP. The Government's IXth Plan covering 2000-2005 aimed to improve economic growth,
the competitiveness of the economy and the employability of graduates, particularly for jobs in
the private sector. These structural reforms would require significant changes in the skills and
learning styles of youth entering the labor markets.

By 2000, Tunisia had, for the most part, resolved issues related to access to primary education, as
the net intake rate for grade 1 of primary education was 99 percent in 2000. However, quality,
particularly with respect to problem solving, math and science skills, needed to improve and
internal efficiency remained a concern since 10 percent of students did not complete primary
education and 30 percent of those that did repeated at least once. The success rate for the end of
grade 6 exam was 61 percent (64 percent for girls) and 70 percent at the end of grade 9. Due to a
decline in fertility rates, the school age population for primary education decreased and
enrollments were projected to decline from 1.3 million to 1.2 million students between 2000 and
2004. Nevertheless, improvements in primary enrollments and completion rates led to a rapid
increase in demand for both the second cycle of basic education and secondary education.

The traditional pedagogic approach used in Tunisia's schools, where there was little pupil
interaction, was assessed to be no longer relevant to the changing economic and social needs of
Tunisia. Traditional methods were inadequate as teachers were confronted with a more
diversified student body with a wide variety of learning styles, owing to the generalization of
basic education and the need for students to learn more practical, entrepreneurial and problem-
solving skills necessary for a knowledge-based economy. The education system was centrally
managed, leaving little discretion for municipalities, civil society, parents and beneficiaries to
intervene or contribute to school management and finance.

In this context, in 1998 Tunisia launched a series of studies and a national consultation on
reforming its education system. The resulting reform program launched in 2000 was called
"The School of Tomorrow" ( "Ecole de Demain") and served as the foundation for preparing the
project under review. The reform program was centered around five areas: (i) revamping
curricula and teaching and learning methods as well as improving the evaluation system of all
levels; (ii) professionalizing teaching through a reform of the in-service training of teachers and
principals, and revising the roles and responsibilities of teaching personnel; (iii) decentralizing
the education system and creating more space for civil society to play a greater role; (iv) making
the education system more equitable and inclusive; and (v) modernizing schools by integrating
new information technologies into curricula and management.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

A. Development objectives

In the main section of the PAD the development objectives are to support the medium-term goals
of the government's strategy, in particular the goal of having 80 percent of grade 9 students pass
the basic school leaving certificate (Diplôme de fin d'études d'enseignement de base--DFEEB)
by 2004, by: (a) promoting excellence in teaching and learning; and (b) continuing the push for
the inclusion of all children at all levels of the basic education system.

In the Loan Agreement, the development objective is to assist the Borrower in reinforcing the
process of reforming the Borrower's education sector through: (a) promoting excellence in
teaching and learning in an improved pedagogical and physical environment; and (b) increasing
the inclusion of children into the basic education system.

B. Key performance indicators

The key performance indicators as stated in the major section of the PAD and the project logical
framework were as follows:
       i.   80 percent of grade 9 students pass the end-of-year DFEEB;
      ii.   Continued reduction in repetition rates of 15.9 percent in lower and 20.7 percent in
            upper basic education in 1999 to 5 percent and 15 percent in 2005-2006 respectively;
     iii.   Continued reduction in drop-out rates of 3.2 percent in lower and 10.1 percent in
            upper basic education in 1999 to 1.5 percent and 5 percent in 2005-2006
            respectively;
      iv.   Integration of new teaching and learning methods into various grade levels of basic
            education;
       v.   Introduction of a system of formative assessment that takes into account the basic
            skills (competence de base--CdB) program;
      vi.   Implementation of a program for priority education zones (PEPE) that aims to
            improve school performance in those regions ; and
     vii.   Progressive introduction of school charters (projets d'établissements).


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification

The development objectives and the performance indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

The major beneficiaries were:

    (i) Students enrolled in basic and secondary education, in particular those who would have
        repeated or dropped-out (between 50,000 and 130,000 repeaters and an annual average of
        35,000 drop-outs avoided each year at the basic education level) at appraisal;



                                                    8

    (ii) Approximately 100,000 teachers, of which 5,400 school principals in basic and
         secondary education, through improvements in their working environment, increased
         responsibility and accountability for outcomes, more customized testing instruments and
         remediation tools, higher quality in-service training courses linked to their roles in
         school, and to their prospects for career development; and better defined functions for
         administrators at the school, regional and central levels.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had two components divided each in four sub-components:

Component 1: School-level interventions (US$205.47million; of which US$ 97.75
million Bank financing excluding front-end fee). The first component covered school-
level interventions designed to support the Government's efforts to improve the quality
of both the teaching and learning processes and the physical surroundings in which
students learn.

Sub-component 1.1: Support quality teaching innovations. The objective of this sub-
component was to implement a competency-based approach (CdB) to enable students to acquire
knowledge and know-how to develop both cross-cutting and subject-specific skills.            The
activities to be implemented included: (a) training all types of educators responsible for the
implementation of the CdB program (teachers, principals and inspectors) in lower basic
education; (b) equipping primary schools and inspectorates with photocopying machines to
enable them to produce materials adapted to the needs of students; and (c) producing a range of
documents for teachers of Arabic, French and mathematics (subject guides, assessment
handbooks, teaching methodologies and training modules).

Sub-component 1.2: Use new information and communication technologies. The objective
of this sub-component was to provide students with cross-cutting skills allowing them to learn,
obtain information and solve problems through the use of information and communication
technologies. The activities included: (a) equipping schools and inspectorates with computer
equipment; (b) establishing a network called EduNet to link the various departments and entities
of the Ministry of Education and Training (MET); (c) installing a virtual education library to
provide various structures of the MET with access to quality information on education; (d)
training teachers, principals and inspectors in using and integrating information and
communication technologies in teaching; and (e) strengthening the capacity of INBMI (Institut
National de Bureautique et de Micro Informatique) to manage the new technologies program.

Sub-component 1.3: Extend, equip and maintain school infrastructure. The objective of
this sub-component was to increase school capacity and improve teaching and learning
conditions by building and equipping new upper basic education schools and high schools, as
well as by rehabilitating existing schools. The planned activities included: (a) building and
equipping 48 upper basic education schools and 17 high schools; (b) upgrading existing primary
schools, upper basic education schools and high schools located in PEPE by adding specialized
facilities to bring them up to current standards; and (c) rehabilitating existing primary schools,
upper basic education schools and high schools.

Sub-component 1.4: Reinforce in-service training capacity.            The objective of this sub-
component was to strengthen the quality and effectiveness of teacher in-service training and
included:    (a) training administrators in the Department of In-service Training (DFC) in
implementing training reform; (b) training professional trainers for the in-service training of


                                                  9

basic and secondary teachers; (c) producing distance learning modules in subject areas and cross-
subject themes to complement residential in-service training courses; (d) training principals in
school management; (e) training all school monitors in the new pedagogic approaches; and (f)
renewing and diversifying the equipment available in Regional In-service Training Centers
(CREFOCs--Centres Régionaux de Formation Continue).

Component 2: System-wide interventions (US$0.27 million; of which US$ 0.26 millioon
Bank financing excluding front-end fee)
The second component, which received only a small share of project financing, was designed to
accompany the introduction of the competency-based approach which aimed to strengthen
evaluation and research capacities and management capacity at the school and regional levels.

Sub-component 2.1: Systematize assessment of students, teachers and institutions. The
objective of this sub-component was to create a culture and practice of assessment--with respect
to students, teachers and institutions--focusing on student achievement and school performance.
Planned activities included: (a) training all primary education teachers, a third of all upper-basic
level teachers, and supervisory staff in assessment methods; (b) training principals to assess the
performance of their own schools; (c) providing training in measurement and assessment to
coordinators and commission members responsible for curricula development and exams; (d)
developing a unified framework for planning and grading national examinations, and developing
a related database to produce reports that assist in the diagnosis and remediation of the school
system; (e) designing a procedure for analyzing test items with a view to improving the validity
and reliability of test results, including a sub-procedure for obtaining a representative sample of
the characteristics of the student population; and (f) producing two teachers' guides, one for the
lower basic education level and the other for the upper basic and secondary education levels,
bringing together in a single, easy-to-read document the various regulations pertaining to student
outputs.

Sub-component 2.2: Strengthen education research capacity. The objective of this sub-
component was to provide INSE (which subsequently became the National Center for Pedagogic
Innovation and Education Research, CNIPRE with the means to monitor trends in teaching and
learning quality. The activities included: (a) establishing a school performance indicator system
to evaluate the comparative performance of schools as well as the performance of the overall
school system; and (b) developing a national database of assessments to provide teachers with
formative assessment instruments.

Sub-component 2.3: Improve knowledge of the management techniques and tools of the
education system. The objective of this sub-component was to support the MET in
decentralizing the management of the education system by introducing senior management at the
central and regional levels to good policy and practice in deconcentration and decentralization in
selected countries.

Sub-component 2.4: Regulate student flows. The objective of this component was to put in
place a sector strategy to manage both the impact of declining enrollments at the lower basic
education level and the increase in student enrollments at the post-basic education level. The
activity was to provide a proposal for an orientation system that would include various post-basic
learning pathways.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The quality at entry of the project is assessed as satisfactory based on the following assessment.

Conclusion of QAG. A Quality Assessment Group (QAG) panel rated the quality at entry of the
project satisfactory, since the first phase promoted inclusion in basic education through the
reduction of drop-outs and repetitions by improving teaching and learning particularly in
disadvantaged areas. However, the panel thought that the project objectives were somewhat
limiting and the economic analysis was rated weak because the project did not contain
mechanisms to conduct policy dialogue on sector expenditures.

Design. The project supported an ambitious program of reform and tackled many strategic issues
aimed at improving the relevance and quality of teaching and learning, as well as equity in the
system. The components aiming to improve quality at the school level and system wide were
relevant. By expanding access to post-primary, eliminating entrance exams to middle and
secondary school and targeting resources to the poorest schools, the project would improve the
quality of services to the poorest regions and the efficiency of the system. New pedagogic
approaches, curriculum reforms, teacher training, improving school management and the
introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) at the school level aimed to
improve the quality of education. System-wide interventions including the complete reform of
student assessment systems, building capacity to use ICT for innovative teaching and learning
and building education research capacity were designed to complement school level
interventions.    Guidance from a Quality Enhancement Review to focus on quality issues was
incorporated into the project design. The project could have included studies to assess the
implementation of teacher training and pedagogic reforms.

Lending instrument The project was designed in the context of a 10-year national strategy
aiming to modernize Tunisia's education strategy. The choice of an Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) instrument was appropriate given the long-term nature of the reform which would exceed
the time period of the project as would the implementation of key activities.

Lessons learned Five lessons drawn from previous projects were integrated into the project
design, including: (i) exploiting the synergy between Bank sector analyses and the Government's
effort to build a national consensus on reforms; (ii) putting greater emphasis on the importance of
activities linked to quality; (iii) developing strategic analysis capacity by including timely studies


                                                   11

and policy notes during implementation; (iv) using conditionality only as a last resort; and (v)
being prudent in determining the APL triggers.

Participatory approach The development of the Government's "Ecole de Demain" reform
program involved an extensive one-year national consultation process. However, representatives
of teachers, unions and parents were not involved in preparing the project.

Assessment of risks Eight risks were identified; among them, weak buy-in to reforms and
resistance to change by stakeholders. Teachers were primarily considered the most significant
risks. The mitigation measure mentioned in the PAD was that awareness campaigns were
envisioned. This solution seems insufficient and up-front sessions with various stakeholders to
take into consideration their concerns could have been envisaged.

Economic and sector analyses While comprehensive in scope, the analyses did not include a
detailed sector expenditure analysis. Following the QAG review, the project team committed to
undertake a sector analysis during project implementation which was eventually done in 2003
during the preparation of second phase of the project (EQIP II).

Donor coordination The project was prepared and implemented as a separate operation distinct
from projects financed by the African Development Bank, European Union and UNICEF. While
all supported the government strategy and the donor activities were complementary to each other,
this approach did not facilitate moving to greater donor harmonization of procedures, even if the
individual project coordinators were located within different departments of the Ministry of
Education and Training (MET). Donor meetings took place without ministry representation.

2.2 Implementation

For the most part, activities were well planned and implemented within deadlines. This strong
implementation capacity to deliver project outputs constituted an impressive strength of the
project implementation team which benefited greatly from MET's administrative capacity. The
project could have benefited from a more strategic emphasis on monitoring policy
implementation and outcomes.

Initially, unions resisted the implementation of in-service training during vacation periods.
Finally an agreement was reached with Government to have only half of the training
implemented during vacation time, but two years had been lost, delaying the skill transfer for
teachers to implement the new pedagogic approach and teachers' acceptance of the overall
reforms.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework was prepared detailing indicators and
responsibilities for collecting data. Project monitoring was assured by the Steering Committee.
Output indicators were collected by the project coordinator and sector indicators by the Planning
Unit (DPE). Regarding evaluation, CNIPRE's capacity was designed to be strengthened to: (i)
monitor the development of teaching and learning quality by setting up a school performance
indicators system to evaluate the comparative performance of schools as well as the performance
of the overall school system; and (ii) develop a national assessment data base to provide teachers
with formative assessment instruments. External evaluations were not envisaged in the project
design to assess the implementation of specific reforms such as on how in-service training was
being implemented in classroom, PEPE interventions, setting up of school plans and charters or


                                                12

the introduction of ICT.


Project indicators were collected on a timely basis and were used to monitor implementation.
Establishing a system of new quality indicators was partially completed and the national data
base in formative assessment was not implemented.         CNIPRE carried out national student
learning assessments for second and fourth grades in 2005, participated in the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2003) and the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA 2004), and undertook action research on pedagogic innovations with
UNICEF.

TIMSS and PISA assessments were used to improve science and math curriculums. Performance
indicators were defined to ensure that reform processes were put in place. However, the project
could have formulated indicators to be updated every other year, and throughout the duration of
the project, measuring teachers' application of the new pedagogy and trends in student
achievement, at least for the primary level where pedagogic reforms were being introduced.
Indicators for grades 6 and 9 could also have been formulated, given that exit exams which
purported to measure learning standards were abolished. As a result, project management was
focused more on outputs than on outcomes.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliances

Procurement: Overall, procurement activities were handled within guidelines and standards
acceptable to the Bank:      (i) a procurement plan was developed and used for monitoring
procurement processes; and (ii) the implementation team carried out civil works and the
acquisition of goods and services efficiently. A post-procurement review was satisfactory.

Financial management:         The financial management capacity at the level of MET was
maintained at a satisfactory level, and quarterly and annual audit reports were regularly prepared
and submitted within deadlines. However, the system could not ensure accurate monitoring of
disbursements during the project's last year in large part due to long delays in purchasing an
integrated financial management system and managing the flow of financial information.

Environment protection: The project was classified as category B. In compliance with Annex
12 of the PAD, safeguard and management procedures were applied. MET and the National
Agency for Environmental Protection (NAEP) regularly monitored implementation of the
guidelines and in 2003 conducted an overall assessment of the project's compliance with
environmental policies and guidelines. The conclusions were satisfactory and no irregularities
were identified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The second phase of the program, EQIP II, was prepared before the EQIP I was fully
implemented, given that performance triggers were fulfilled in 2003. Student learning outcomes
were scheduled biannually under the second phase to improve program evaluation, indicators on
sector expenditures and the development of a communications strategy were introduced as ways
to improve program effectiveness. Some ICT activities requiring more time for implementation
were integrated into the second phase. A preventive maintenance strategy is essential for the
upkeep, maintenance and replacement of civil works and ICT investments financed under the
project, as well as from other sources of financing. The African Development Bank is financing




                                                 13

the development of such a strategy.




3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objectives as formulated in the PAD and the legal agreement are the
same. However, specific wording in the development objective in the PAD, which included an
indicator that "the goal of having 80 percent of grade 9 students pass the basic school leaving
certificate (DFEEB)" cannot be measured per se as changes in article 61 of the education law
introduced in 2002 rendered this exam optional and only obligatory for those students seeking
admission to the elite high schools. The DFEEB was a selection exam which impeded students
from progressing and its elimination aimed to accelerate the flow of students to secondary. The
intent of the project was to improve the proportion of children continuing into secondary school.
The policy eliminating the DFEEB as well as the end of Grade 6exam effectively reinforced
project objectives. Thus, for the purposes of the ICR the project development objective as stated
in the loan agreement is assessed.

The project development objective was coherent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
2000-2006, which proposed Bank support to the Tunisian government in three major areas: (a)
consolidating long-term development, mainly through human resource development, natural
resource management, transport, rural development and municipal development; (b) supporting
economic reform to enhance competitiveness and increase employment; and (c) promoting new
initiatives that strengthen local institutions, launch new development niches, and mobilize
external finance. The project contributed directly to (a), and indirectly to (b), through improving
the relevance of education and strengthening human resource development activities that inter
alia improve the quality and adaptability of the labor force.

The project design was relevant since it aimed to reform the education system by opening it up to
all children and to solve the quality and efficiency issues that characterized Tunisian education.
Components and sub-components were clearly defined and coherent with the goals of improving
and reforming the quality of the education system.

The implementation strategy relied on strengthened government structures to implement reforms
ensuring that that the project was managed by MET departments, thereby building institutional
capacity and know-how.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Tunisia succeeded in initiating an ambitious reform of its education system by introducing a new
pedagogic approach that was child-centered and by changing the way students are assessed,
thereby allowing more equitable progress for students in the system. In addition, strategies
aiming to improve the performance of children attending schools in the most disadvantaged areas
were implemented.        These reforms were also accompanied by a vast expansion and
modernization program of the education network at the post-primary levels through school
construction, equipping schools, and providing management structures with computer
technology.    Improvements in transition rates, repetition rates and drop-out rates in primary
positively impacted student flows and the efficiency of the system.



                                                 14

(i) Transition of students to secondary school surpassed the target of 80 percent.            The
elimination of the Grade 9 exit exam and the expansion of schools supported by the project
allowed more students to continue to secondary school. This objective has been achieved as 83
percent of students continued to secondary school in 2005, up from 70 percent in 2000, marking
a significant achievement for the Tunisian education system.

(ii) Continued reduction in the repetition rates in primary. The policy discouraging repetitions
within the three cycles of primary combined with introducing remedial programs for weak
students within cycles improved efficiency and reinforced the competency-based methodology.
As a result, repetition rates declined from 15.9 percent in 1999 to 5.9 percent in 2005 for
primary; though slightly higher than the target of 5 percent, this is an impressive achievement.
Repetition rates for upper basic declined from 20.7 percent to 18.7 percent over the same period.

(iii) Continued reduction in the drop-out rates in primary. At the primary level, the drop-out
rate fell from 3.2 percent in 1999 to 1.7 percent in 2005, slightly higher than the target of 1.5
percent, registering significant and satisfactory progress.

(iv) Drop out rates in upper basic did not improve. For upper basic education level, the drop-out
rate deteriorated slightly from 10.1 percent in 1999 to 10.9 percent in 2005 compared to a target
value of 5 percent. Improvements in drop-out rates in upper basic were probably unrealistic
given that reforms to improve the curriculum and the quality of education were not scheduled to
be introduced until 2006. This was compounded by the fact that there were huge increases in the
number of students entering the seventh grade as a result of higher primary completion rates, and
a greater variation of ability as higher numbers were coming from poorer backgrounds and
weaker primary schools.

(iv) Integration of new teaching and learning methods The efficiency with which the project
accomplished this is impressive and highly satisfactory. All teachers, school directors, inspectors
and pedagogic assistants were trained in the design of class materials, and interactive strategies
with students, and were provided with reference subject guides and situation assessment modules
in mathematics, French and Arabic. Textbooks were revised, edited and distributed in sufficient
quantity for each grade. Field visits during the ICR mission revealed progress in changing
teaching methods, planning of teaching modules, and using continual pupil assessments. Less
progress was evident in using interactive teaching methods and involving children in learning.

(v) Introduction of a new assessment system A system of continual student assessment was
introduced based on formative assessment of skills and competencies and should be considered a
large success and highly satisfactory. The new system emphasizes student progress and is
descriptive. Approximately 45,000 of the 61,721 teachers at the primary level were trained, as
well as one-third of upper basic education level teachers, all inspectors, pedagogic assistants,
primary schools directors, 1,300 upper basic level directors, and 250 directors of upper basic
education schools. Assessment guides were developed and made available to all teachers. The
traditional grade approach continues to be used in some major subject fields due to parental
pressure. The Government has also used the results of the TIMSS 2003 for grades 4 and 8, and
the PISA 2004 to revise curricula in math and science. National student assessments for grades 2
and 4 were conducted in 2005, and the first analysis done by CNIPRE showed modest
improvement in average scores of grade 2 students and a slight decline of those in grade 4 (not
unexpected as the new pedagogy was introduced in grade 4 the same year) while indicating an
improvement of the minimum level required for both.

(v) Implementation of the program of priority education zones (Programme d'écoles à priorité
éducative, PEPE) was satisfactory. Field visits in some PEPE primary schools in urban, semi-


                                                  15

urban and rural areas showed significant accomplishments in improving school infrastructure and
equipment and in developing school projects. Repetition rates in PEPE primary schools improved
but still remain higher than in non-PEPE schools according to a study financed by UNICEF in
2006. Repetition rates for grade 6 were 7.7 percent in non-PEPE schools and 13 percent in PEPE
schools. Drop-out rates were 4.3 percent for non-PEPE and 6.9 percent for PEPE schools.

(vi)   Progressive introduction of school charter projects has not progressed.            The 2002
Education law introduced school charters and school committees (CE) as an innovative
mechanism to improve school management. Delays in setting up CEs were due to differences
between MET and teacher unions concerning the constitution and the management of such CE.
During the 2006-2007 school year an agreement was reached and CEs were introduced in all
schools.

Criteria and triggers for the second phase of EQIP

The performance triggers allowing transition to the second phase of EQIP were achieved in 2003,
as follows:
    (i)      Generalization of CbA program for grades 3 and 4 in all schools was completed by
             the beginning of the school-year 2003-2004, and all grade 5 teachers were trained.
    (ii)     Generalization of two-grade sub-cycles in grades 1 through 4 in all schools was
             completed by the beginning of the 2003-2004 school-year.
    (iii)    Extension of school self-assessments, as defined by school charters, in at least 25
             percent of schools. Self-assessments were carried out in 90 percent of schools.
    (iv)     Development of a sector-wide strategy to manage student flows was completed.

3.3 Efficiency

This section summarizes the cost-effectiveness analysis that is presented in Annex 5.

The share of public expenditures to secondary and higher education has increased significantly
over the past six years due to the rapid generalization of secondary education and the growing
demand for post-secondary education and training. Primary education's share of expenditures has
decreased from 43 percent in 1999 to 34 percent in 2005, which is in line with the decline in
enrollments and thus financing needs. At the same time, overall unit costs as a percentage of per
capita GDP in primary education increased from 16 percent to 18 percent, while unit costs in
higher education declined from 62 percent to 46 percent.

The share of non-salary expenditures at the primary level increased from 22 percent to 27 percent
and ultimately permitted improvements in efficiency as demonstrated by the reduction in primary
repetition rates and the improvement in completion rates. Inefficiencies still persist as high drop-
out rates in post-primary indicate a significant waste of resources. In upper basic and secondary,
a larger share of non-wage expenditures is needed to finance improvements in quality.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
The project development objective has been rated satisfactory because:
    · The transition of students to secondary surpassed the 80 percent target.
    · Repetition rates declined at all levels due to the introduction of pedagogic reforms and
         trends are favorable; drop-out rates declined significantly in primary;
    · Student flows improved in the system.


                                                 16

    · The new competency-based approach to teaching and a system of continual student
         evaluation was systematically integrated in all primary schools and according to national
         assessments' analyses, which had a positive impact on student achievement in grade 2
         and supported a reduction in repetition rates at the primary level;
    · Equipment and materials needed were delivered to all schools and a regional in-service
         training system for teachers was established;
    · Schools in the most disadvantaged areas received additional support which allowed them
         to improve their work environments; access to upper basic and secondary schools was
         improved in underserved areas;
    · A computerized school management system was incorporated (EduNet) allowing a more
         efficient and secured management of schools;
    · The student evaluation system was strengthened and national assessments of grades 2
         and 4 were carried out in 2005.

Areas of weakness include:
      · The implementation of the reforms aimed at improving school management via
         introducing school charters and school committees were slow.
      · Despite improvements in student assessments and evaluation, the monitoring and
         evaluation capacities were not strengthened enough to allow decision-makers to have
         quantifiable and informed analysis about reform implementation;
      · Targets for drop-out rates in upper basic remain were not met.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project directly targeted most disadvantaged areas by allocating additional resources to
PEPE schools, mostly attended by children from poor families. In addition, expanding access to
upper basic schools, mostly in rural areas, provided additional incentives for children from poor
families to complete primary school as they were now able to complete basic schooling.
Regarding gender issues, currently enrollment and completion rates are higher for girls than boys
at all levels.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project contributed fundamentally to a profound change in the Tunisian education system
through the introduction of a competency-based approach to educating children. The project
developed tools to design and implement reforms, trained administrators, teachers, and school
directors, and strengthened the capacity of departments and other structures responsible for
implementing reforms such as CNIPRE, CREFOC and CNAFE. The introduction of pedagogic
reforms in upper basic in 2006 took into consideration the importance of involving teachers and
unions in the design of new programs. Through EduNet and EduServ, an integrated and
electronic management system, the project has rendered the management of the education system
more reliable, allowing for a comprehensive management of students, personnel, financial and
administration function of the MET.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

Implementing the project underlined the importance of evaluating reforms. This aspect was
strengthened in the second phase.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The overall risk to attaining the development outcome is moderate. The Government continues
to be committed to carrying out this extensive reform and has an efficient administration capable
of successfully doing so. Tunisia's economic performance remains satisfactory which will
permit the continued financing of the education sector and the completion of its reform program
in education. The main risks to sustaining the achievement of development outcomes are: (i) the
lack of a solid evaluation framework which would provide adequate feedback on policy choices
and activities and provide necessary adjustments and guidance to decision makers on how to
improve learning and teaching; and (ii) the still limited involvement of stakeholders, such as
parents, communities, teachers, researchers and media in the design, implementation and
evaluation of education reforms, which in turn would strengthen accountability mechanisms for
schools and the drive for measurable results.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance to ensure quality at entry is rated satisfactory. Introducing a major,
system wide pedagogic reform was a relatively new area of policy reform for the Bank in the
Middle East and North Africa region. The Bank team was highly skilled, experienced and had
the necessary sector and country knowledge to provide solid policy advice to government on
quality reforms and this is reflected in the relevant project design. The project was coherent with
government policy and priorities to provide a quality education geared towards a knowledge
economy and improving competencies and skills of students. It was also aligned with the CAS.
The choice of the lending instrument through an APL was very appropriate for an ambitious and
long-term reform. Using the MET as executing agency allowed for institutional capacity and
sustainability of reforms. In addition, the project did take into consideration fiduciary
management and environmental protection measures and an adequate assessment was done
consequently. Performance indicators could have focused on more outcomes. The project did not
fully assess the fiscal sustainability of investments in civil works and the information and
communication technologies (ICT) in schools.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

Project supervision by the Bank team is rated satisfactory. Supervision missions were conducted
on a regular basis. Support to strengthening procurement capacity and project management
during supervision missions was extremely useful. Consultants were hired to advise the
government on school construction, financial management, teacher training and ICT. High
quality project status reports and implementation status reports were regularly updated.


                                                 18

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory



The overall performance of the Bank is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

There is no difference between the Government and the Executing Agency as there was no
project implementation unit. Activities that were to be implemented by departments outside MET
were executed in a satisfactory manner. Government participation in project preparation was
satisfactory.  The Ministry of Finance ensured regular government contribution to project
financing and that audit reports were submitted within deadlines.         Governorates assured a
satisfactory coordination for civil works at the regional level between Regional Directorates of
Education (DRE) and Regional Directorates of Equipment, Housing, and Territorial Management
(DREHAT). Additionally, the National Institute for Information Technology (INBMI) provided
remarkable service and technical support in introducing information and communication
technology into schools. However, the National Tender Board caused unwarranted and significant
implementation delays due to its insistence that MET adhere to national procurement regulations
instead of complying with guidelines agreed upon in the Loan Agreement.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Implementing
                  Performance
Agency
                  The MET was professional in efficiently delivering planned project outputs.
                  Technical and fiduciary management were conducted in a satisfactory manner.
                  Programmed activities were implemented before the closing date. The
                  competence-based approach to teaching was introduced in the entire education
                  system, planned schools were built and planned school equipment procured and
                  delivered. Training of teaching and supervisory personnel was carried out.


Ministry of       Fiduciary management was done in accordance with norms, safeguard
                  measures were respected during project implementation and monitoring and
Education and     audit reports were done and submitted in a timely manner. .
Training
                  Difficulties were encountered in monitoring disbursements.       A change in
                  management toward the end of the project, combined with the increased
                  workload due to implementation of EQIP II at the same time as EQIP I and the
                  lack of regular steering committee meetings, undermined the systematic
                  monitoring of the project and created confusion around the uncommitted
                  balances of the project. US$2.7 million was cancelled but the exact amount
                  was not known until late 2006 just prior to the closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


                                               19

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The use of an APL provided flexibility to the Government to move ahead quickly with the
second phase of their 10-year education strategy, move some activities to the second phase, and
to improve areas such as monitoring and evaluation, and involve teachers and unions in the
design of pedagogic reforms.

Monitoring and evaluation systems should be aligned with reform programs allowing the
monitoring of reform implementation and the development of evidenced-based policy decision-
making. A better alignment of systems could have included: (i) clarifying who had overall
responsibility to monitor the implementation of overall sector reforms; (ii) a change in the role
and responsibilities of general inspectors which traditionally focuses on evaluating teachers'
mastery of subject matter to one of assessing and supporting teacher capacity to apply the new
pedagogic approaches and school performance; (iii) clarifying roles and responsibilities in
existing and new structures responsible for monitoring and evaluation, such as the planning unit,
inspectors and CNIPRE; and (iii) more rigorous external evaluation of policies and new programs
such as in-service training, school performance and student learning outcomes. For future
operations, an in-depth assessment of the roles, responsibilities and procedures for the various
entities responsible for monitoring and evaluation should be carried out.

In managing education sector reforms, involving stakeholders at key points of the design,
implementation and evaluation of reforms helps build their commitment to reform programs and
ensures that planned activities are able to be implemented sequentially. This is especially
relevant for reforms where stakeholders are involved or responsible for implementation.

Major pedagogic reforms such as the introduction of a competency-based approach aims to
change significantly the approach and behavior of teachers in classrooms. Post-training support
to teachers would boost the impact of training to ensure that what is being taught in training
programs is being applied in the classroom and also to provide a feedback loop to improve the
content of the initial training.

The preparation of new projects in Tunisia must have prior discussion with the National Tender
Board to apprise them of the procurement procedures that will be agreed upon in the Loan
Agreement. If the National Tender Board understands the procurement procedures to be used for
project implementation, lengthy and unnecessary delays may be avoided.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies


In addition to its own end-of project report, The Government provided detailed comments on an
earlier of this ICR and most comments were integrated into the final version. The main point of
contention concerns the involvement of stakeholders in project design for which it is Government
policy to consult stakeholders during the development of strategies but not for discussions with
the Bank or other funding agencies on the specifics of project design and implementation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: School-level interventions

Sub-component 1.1: Support quality teaching innovations
The objective of this sub-component was to implement an achievement-oriented approach to
teaching which enables students to acquire sustainable knowledge and know-how that develop
both cross-cutting and subject-specific skills. The activities to be implemented were to: (a) train
all types of educators responsible for the implementation of the CdB program (teachers,
principals and inspectors) in lower basic education; (b) equip primary schools and inspectorates
with photocopying machine, to enable them to produce materials adapted to the needs of their
students ; and (c) produce a range of documents for teachers of Arabic, French and mathematics
(subject guides, assessment handbooks, and teaching methodologies and training modules).

Regarding innovations concerning the quality of teaching and learning, 61,721 teachers, 4,468
school directors, 408 inspectors and 860 pedagogic assistants have been trained in competency-
based approach or an execution rate of 100 percent. For equipment and material of primary
schools and inspectorates, 1800 planned photocopiers were procured and delivered. As far as the
teaching and learning materials are concerned, 50,000 reference guides and modules of situation
assessment in mathematics, French and Arabic were procured and made available to teachers.
Additionally, 8850 teacher training modules were provided. A team of curriculum specialists and
textbooks editors were trained and curricula reviewed and corresponding textbooks edited.

Sub-component 1.2: Use new information and communication technologies

The objective of this sub-component was to provide students with cross-cutting skills that enable
them to learn, to obtain information and to solve problems through the use of information and
communication technologies.

Regarding the equipping of primary schools with computers, 1260 cyber spaces were installed in
all primary schools. CD-ROMs were developed with INBMI support and 1,500,000,000 copies
were distributed to schools for students and teachers.      For middle schools and high schools,
cyber spaces, teaching laboratories for computers, NTIC learning classrooms were established.
Technical assistance was hired for the creation and installation of the Tunisian virtual school
(EduServ).    Secondary schools teachers (46,025), primary school teacher (29,171) and
administrators (20,150) were trained in ICT. Technical assistance was hired to integrate ICT in
teaching and learning, for the installation and assessment of ICT projects in various schools and
to improve Tunisian virtual school services (including the training of 40 staff of VET team).
Regional INBMI centers were equipped.

Sub-component 1.3: Extend, equip and maintain school infrastructure

The objective of this sub-component was to increase school capacity and improve teaching and
learning conditions, by building and equipping new upper basic education schools and high
schools and by rehabilitating existing schools.

The construction and equipping of 48 upper basic education schools and 17 new high schools
were completed as planned. School facilities were rehabilitated and multi-usage classrooms were
built in 126 primary schools and 198 were equipped. Additionally, 104 upper basic education
schools acquired a multi-usage classroom. Damaged schools were rehabilitated, of which 650
were primary schools, 282 upper basic education schools and 256 high schools, as initially
planned.



                                                23

Sub-component 1.4: Reinforce in-service training capacity

The objective of this sub-component was to strengthen the quality and effectiveness of in-service
training in order to meet the skill needs of the education system.

Concerning the in-service training of school administrators, 3 administrators from the central
level and 24 directors of CREFOC were trained in curriculum and pedagogic engineering.
Training    modules    for   the   competency-based     approach,   group   interaction  methods,
communication and maintenance as well as human resources and time management were
developed. Regarding the training of trainers, 1,940 trainers were trained (including primary and
secondary schools inspectors, primary pedagogic assistants, and secondary pedagogic counselors)
and trainers of teachers were trained in teaching engineering and analysis of professional
practices.

Concerning distance learning modules, 6 modules were developed for new colleges and high
schools teachers. Pedagogic training in Arabic, French, history, geography, physics, natural
sciences and mathematics were completed, although only 3 were of acceptable quality.

Concerning the training of trainers for school directors, 180 directors were trained in developing
and assessing school grants, piloting changes and conflicts management, in leadership and
strategic decision-making, in group interaction and effective communication were held.

For the training of trainers for schools counselors, 120 supervisors and general supervisors were
trained. Four CREFOCs were equipped with video-conference materials which included 24
computers and audiovisual equipments, 24 video players and video cassettes and 23
photocopiers.

Component 2: System-wide interventions

Sub-component 2.1: Systematize the assessment of students, teachers and institutions

The objective of this sub-component was to implement a culture and practice of assessment with
respect to students, teachers and institutions--that increases student achievement and makes the
various actors accountable for the outcomes of their interventions.

Training in various assessment methods was held for 44,921 teachers out of 61,721 for lower
basic education, about 8,000 teachers for upper basic education level (a third of enrollments), 408
inspectors, 860 pedagogic assistants, 4,486 primary schools directors, 1,300 upper basic level
directors and 250 directors of upper basic education schools.

Regarding the training of school directors to carry out assessments of their own schools, 4,486
primary schools directors, 1,100 directors of upper basic education schools and high schools were
trained.  Additionally, 45 inspectors were trained in 4 modules for measurement, and the
assessment of coordinators and committees members in designing exam questions. A database
with 3 modules was developed to design a unified framework for planning and interpreting
national examinations. Three assessment guides were developed and are being used by teachers.

Sub-component 2.2: Strengthen education research capacity

The objective of this sub-component was to provide CNIPRE with the means to monitor the
development of teaching and learning quality. It was to (i) implement a school performance
indicators system to evaluate the comparative performance of schools as well as the performance


                                                  24

of the overall school system; and (ii) develop a national assessment data base to provide teachers
with formative assessment instruments.       Activities planned for the indicators system were
partially completed. The Government contends that the consultant firm did not provide qualified
experts. However, the national database in formative assessment was not implemented.

Sub-component 2.3: Improve knowledge of the management techniques and tools of the
education system

The objective was to support the MET in decentralizing the management of the education system.
It was to: (i) introduce senior MET managers to good policy and practice in deconcentration and
decentralization in selected countries; (ii) train staff in charge of monitoring project
implementation; and (iii) put in place an information system in all schools.

During the implementation of EQIP1, 30 regional and central administration directors were
trained in the following areas: (i) the design of individual training program; (ii) piloting changes
and education innovation; (iii) motivating work teams, communicating and managing conflicts;
and (iv) leadership.

Concerning the training of project managers, 10 top and 22 mid-level managers were trained in
project management, results-oriented management, strategic planning and human resources
management.

The development of the integrated management information system included the needs
assessment, architecture of the system, a procedures manual, the policy for information security,
various software applications and a network. Aspects which are being completed under EQIP 2
include the system nomenclature, software for in-service training and human resources
management.

Sub-component 2.4: Regulate student flows

The objective was to put in place a sector-wide strategy to manage both the impact of declining
enrollments at the lower basic education level and the increase in student enrollments at the post-
basic education level.

A study was undertaken in 2003. The findings were analyzed and allowed to implement a
strategic management of students' flow in the context of EQIP2.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

This annex summarizes the economic analysis that was undertaken for the ICR for the project, which
covered a six-year period (2000-2006). It summarizes: (i) macroeconomic and social trends; (ii)
financing of the education sector in Tunisia; (iii) current results in the education sector; and (iv) an
equity and efficiency analysis of public expenditures.

I. Macro-economic and demographic context

Macro-economic situation: During the period of the project, Tunisia continued to register
sustainable progress in both economic and social domains. Growth reached 6.0 percent in 2004 and
4.2 percent in 2005 and averaged more than 5 percent over the last decade. Tunisia's economic
performance is one of the best in the region. It has been sustained by the cautious pursuit of macro-
economic policies and the relatively diversified nature of the economy which has allowed it to
manage external and climate shocks. Tunisian growth rates exceed the average for middle income
countries, even if it was slower than rapid growth countries. The GDP per capita in real terms
moved from 2609 TDN in 1999 to more than 3709 TDN in 2005, an increase of 40 percent.

Demographic context and living conditions: Population growth has declined slightly from 2.4
percent in 1984 to 1.2 percent between 1994 and 2004. The population is mainly located in urban
areas, accounting for 65 percent of the population with more than 20 percent in Grand Tunis.
Coastal regions account for two-thirds of the population. The population of 6-11 years old had
slightly decreased from 1.23 million in 1999 to 1.03 million in 2005. During the same period, 12-14
years old population declined from 0.65 million to 0.61 million in 2005.




                                                          26

Living conditions have improved considerably: life expectancy increased to 73 years old and the
percentage of the population living in poverty represented only 4 percent in 2000. In terms of
education, universal primary education has been reached without discrimination. Literacy rates
decreased by 10 points during the last decade, from 32 percent in 1994 to less than 22 percent in
2005, and the population having a level of higher education level is approximately has risen from 3.4
percent in 1994 to 8.0 percent in 2005.

Public expenditures Public finances also improved during 1999-2005. Between the first half of
1980s and 2005, the budgetary gap moved from 5.6 percent of the GDP to 2.6 percent (average of
2002-2005); current account of balance of payments declined from 7.9 percent of GDP to 2.4
percent, and the GDP growth rate averaged 5 percent during the same period. The inflation rate has
averaged around 3 percent compared to more than 7 percent in the early 1990s. On the revenue side,
customs duties as a share of GDP declined from 8 percent of GDP to less than 3 percent.
Consolidated public revenues increased and expenditures decreased as a proportion of the GDP. In
2005, fiscal pressure was 21.3 percent of the GDP. Public revenues represent two-third of budgetary
resources compared to one-third from loan sources. Debt service did not improve favorably during
past five years, increasing from 3,150 million TDN in 1999 to 3.833 million TDN in 2005,
representing approximately one-third of pubic expenditures.

II. Education Expenditures

Sector Allocations: Education expenditures as a percentage of GDP increased from 5.6 percent in
1999 to 6.1 percent in 2005 compared to an average of 5.1 percent for middle income countries and
4.9 percent for OECD countries.              Regarding total government expenditures (operational and
investment), education expenditures increased over the same period from 14.7 percent to 17.6
percent. About 32 percent of recurrent government expenditures are allocated to the education
sector.

During the implementation of EQIP1, the intra-sector allocation of education expenditures was
modified as a result of the changing needs of the education system. With the rapid expansion of
post primary levels and the concomitant increased financial needs for these levels, expenditures for
lower basic declined from 43 percent of education expenditures to 34 percent, whereas secondary
and higher education noted significant increases in their shares of expenditures as shown in Table 2
below.

Table 2: Intra-sector allocation of education expenditures
                                      1999       2000      2001   2002    2003    2004     2005

  Lower and upper basic education      43.2%      40.2%    39.9%   39.4%   36.2%   34.9%    34.2%

Economic composition of expenditures and unit costs: The economic composition of education
expenditures reflects an improvement in quality as a larger share of expenditures has been used for
non-salary expenditures than for quality inputs. Between 1999 and 2005, non-salary expenditures
increased from 22 percent to 27 percent of total primary expenditures. For upper basic education
and secondary levels, a similar improvement was not registered, mainly because of the considerable
needs for investments and teachers to expand the system due to the improvements in transition rates
between upper basic education and secondary levels resulting from the elimination of the
compulsory Grade 9 exam.

Unit costs within the education sector have improved significantly between 1999 and 2005. As
shown in Table 3 below, unit costs in real teams and as a percentage of per capita GDP have
improved considerably for basic and secondary levels. For higher education, unit costs have not
changed much in real terms, while as a share of per capita of GDP per capita they have declined
substantially.

III. Results

Students' flows and enrollment rates: At the beginning of EQIP1, Tunisia had almost reached
universal primary education with a net enrollment rate of 97 percent. In 2005-2006, this rate was
97.1 percent (95 percent for boys and 97.1 percent for girls) compared to 96.9 percent in 2004-2005.
The net enrollment rate for Grade 1 of lower basic education is 99 percent (of which 98.9 percent for
boys and 99 percent for girls) while the gross enrollment rate is 113 percent. During the 2005-2006
school-year, enrollment at all levels of the education sector in Tunisia was 2.8 million as shown in
Table 4 below.

However, contrary to primary education, access to secondary education is still limited. The gross
enrollment rate of 12-18 years old children is 75.1 percent and 77.7 percent for girls. Children
dropping out of upper basic and secondary education are thus estimated at more than 250,000
children. Despite the decline in the population of the 12 to 18 year old population, enrollment at the
secondary level will still increase substantially.

Repetitions and Drop-outs: The repetition rate at the lower basic education level indicated a
significant decrease from 16 percent in 1999 to 6 percent in 2005. This reduction has a significant
impact on the cost-effectiveness of the Tunisian education system. However, the decline for the
upper basic education level was not as significant, going from 20.7 percent to 18.7 percent.

There was a slight improvement in the drop-out rates at the lower basic education level moving from
3.3 percent in 1999 to 1.7 percent in 2005. For upper basic level, these rates increased slightly from
10.1 percent to 10.9 percent over the same period. The increase in upper basic was primarily due the
difficulties that students from very varied backgrounds had in transitioning from primary to middle
school. With the extension of new pedagogic approaches to upper basic school in 2006, it is
anticipated that children leaving exiting primary schools where they have been learning under the
competency-based approach will perform better and thus transition rates and drop-out rates will
improvement also intends to strengthen pre-service training of teachers in post-secondary.

Impact of the competency-based approach: Regarding the impact of the CdB approach for
teaching and learning and students' achievement, MoE started to assess the impact of various
reforms on students' achievement through a national assessment of Grade 2 and 4 students
(CNIPRE, 2004), even though the reform had only been introduced the same year for Grade 4. The
study showed an improvement concerning the minimum level required for both grade, improvements
in learning outcomes of Grade 2 students and confirmed the significant variations between schools,
particularly between schools in the eastern part and those of northern and southern parts of the
country.

IV. Equity and Efficiency

Disparities by gender: The disparities by gender have been shrinking in Tunisia not only in terms of
access to schools, but also in terms of completion within the system. At lower basic levels,
enrollment is higher for girls than for boys as shown in Table 6. Regarding school survival, the
results of school cohort show analysis show that currently out of 100 boys and 100 girls being
admitted in Grade 1, 47 boys and 62 girls reach Grade 10 of secondary education.

Geographic disparities: There are still strong regional disparities in the country. The Middle-
Western and North-Eastern regions have enrollment rates of 90 percent and 93.7 percent respectively
for 6-14 years old which is below the national average of 95 percent.

Drop-outs and Repetitions: High drop-out and repetition rates increase operating costs and
the efficiency of the education sector. Losses from repetitions and drop-outs in upper basic and
lower secondary are equivalent to approximately 63 percent of the recurrent costs at these levels and
constitute a waste of educational resources. Drop out rates are approximately 11 percent, and higher
for boys, for upper basic and secondary education levels. Drop-outs can be considered a kind of
social discrimination as children are leaving the system without adequate skills. Additionally, high
repetition rates contribute to overcrowded classrooms. This poor school performance by boys should
be analyzed in order to put mitigation measures and strategies in place.

At the basic education level, cost-effectiveness policies were introduced to improve the efficiency of
the education system. Thus, with the introduction of the competency-based approach, GRT decided
to classify lower basic education into three cycles of two grades each and abolish repetitions between
the two grades of the same cycle. This decision contributed to considerably reducing the repetition
rates, from 13.8 percent in 1999 to 5.9 percent in 2005.

The elimination of the Grade 9 exam to move to secondary level contributed to increasing survival
and completion rates as the transition rate to secondary increased from 70 percent in 2000 (with
DFEEB) to 83 percent in 2005 after the abolition of the exam.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government did an assessment of EQP1. A summary of this assessment is provided below
and focuses on: (i) the success of EQIP; (ii) the challenges; and (iii) an assessment of the Bank
and Government performances.

Successes
       (i)      Increase in access and the improvement of working and learning conditions in
        schools, on one hand, because of the construction of new colleges and high schools (65);
        and on the other hand the expansion of existing schools and the rehabilitation of an
        important number of school facilities, of which over hundreds of primary schools.
        These permitted to answer to the growing needs of seats--students of upper basic and
        secondary education, and triggered a renovation process of damaged school
        infrastructures, which must be conducive to necessary pedagogic conditions for a quality
        education.

       (ii)     Introduction of pedagogic innovations in terms of curricula and teaching
        methods, with planned schedule, the generalization of competency-based approach in
        lower basic education.

       (iii)    Implementation, within the context of generalizing competency-based approach
        in lower basic education, of formative assessment procedures and, in the same taken, a
        new correspondence guide for parents in which are mentioned various skills to be
        acquired in different fields of learning and the level of mastering achieved by students in
        each one of them.

       (iv)     Increase of intra and inter cycles' completion rates and the simultaneous
        reduction of repetition and drop-out rates, particularly in lower basic education.

       (v)      Teachers training in compliance with the requirements of the position, and
        particularly in the assessment and the strategies and methods of coaching students in the
        context of different pedagogy.

       (vi)     Creation of a group of trainers of trainers called to ensure the recycling and
        upgrading of different categories of teaching personnel.

       (vii)    Logistical accompanying of the process of generalizing competency-based
        approach by progressively equipping schools in necessary photocopiers for assessment
        and remediation activities.

       (viii)   Provision of additional learning resources through the acceleration of
        progressively equipping schools in computers and their connection to internet.

       (ix)     Implementation, with the same context, of a distance learning system (for
        students) and (for teachers) with the launching of Tunisian virtual school (BVE) and the
        development of FAD modules.

       (x)      Profound review of the certification and assessment system by taking into
        account, as of school-year 2001-2002, continued assessment results, in a exclusive
        manner, during the transition between lower and upper basic education and secondary
        education; and in partial manners--up to 25 percent--in baccalaureate, which allows
        accessing the university.


                                                35

       (xi)     Introduction of the "school grant" concept in the education orientation law of
        2002 and the beginning of its implementation, on pilot basis in a certain number of
        schools, particularly those in ZEP/PEPE areas. Since the beginning of school-year
        2006-2007, and in application of the clauses of 2002 law and the decree on school life of
        October 2004, designated departments were established in all schools ; which major
        mission is to develop and ensure the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of
        charter schools.

       (xii)    Effective implementation of ZEP/PEPE in September 2001 concerning 796
        primary schools and 104 upper basic education schools which accomplishments were
        below the regional and national averages. Since 2004, 104 of these schools were
        classified as being high priority schools and benefited from a special support program.

       (xiii)   Reform of educational "research/studies" functions and "macro assessment of
        education" through restructuring the former National Institute of Education which
        became CNIPRE in 2002. In this context, teams for supervisory pedagogic fields and
        disciplines considered as strategic--technology, mathematics, English, competency-
        based approach, ZEP/PEPE. Moreover, this institute organizes and manages Tunisia
        participation in international assessments (PISA, TIMMS and MLA) as well as
        monitoring periodic assessments initiated by 2002 law.

Limitations and challenges

       (i)      In the opposite of improvement of achievements in lower basic education, there
        is a persistence of phenomena related to repetitions and drop-outs, particularly in Grade
        7 where by end of school-year 2004-2006 there were 26 percent repetitions and 14.3
        percent drop-outs in upper basic education. A far-reaching strategy was enacted to
        compensate these phenomena over the five upcoming years.

       (ii)     Regarding educational returns, quantitative increases are combined with modest
        students' achievements in key areas of languages and sciences; which resulted in the
        implementation at all levels of a remediation program. This program is composed of
        many sub-components, including strengthening of teaching and learning, improving
        pedagogic methods, and procuring support materials (language laboratories in
        particular); and mainly revising teachers' in-service training system.

       (iii)    In-service training system was very operational, since it succeeded in satisfying
        the demand of a large scope mass training in the history of Tunisian education system;
        yet, various constraints (optional training, unions' attitude, and unequal qualifications of
        teachers) reduced the impact and quality of provided trainings, particularly those related
        to competency-based approach. This has obviously affected the way the approach was
        carried out in a certain number of classrooms.

       (iv)     Despite obvious progresses made in the assessment field, efforts must be geared
        towards integrating a culture of assessment at all levels (classrooms, schools, regions,
        system); besides, for permanent and operational mechanisms be effectively
        implemented, they must not only supplement pedagogic innovations, but also help with
        the education reform teaching and learning and the operationalization of the system.

       (v)      Issues related to maintenance are similar to what had been stated above, which
        could not only be reduced to a series of sporadic interventions for rehabilitating and/or


                                                36

          maintaining school infrastructures and equipments. In fact, it is an overall strategy that
          should be implemented to make sustainable school facilities and put an end to
          significant wastage resulting from a lack of preventive maintenance, sabotage, and a
          lack of professional consciousness for many staff about the necessity of safeguarding
          equipments, facilities and green spaces.

          (vi)    Difficulties of creating charter schools according to the planned rhythm and
          schedule; which are results of a combination of certain number of important factors such
          as (i) delays in implementing school committees that constitute the most adequate
          entities to develop school improvement projects and ensure the monitoring of their
          implementation; (ii) lack of a true leadership both at the school and region levels
          because of a lack of training and appropriate structures ; (iii) weak decentralization
          capacity at the regional level that results on DREs having neither resources or
          competencies in terms of management to structure charter schools and even school
          improvement projects of the region.

          (vii)   Delays recorded in procurement, especially those linked with equipments. These
          delays--that are important regarding significant procurement of pedagogic materials
          and computers--are accountable to (i) first on longer procedures that further make
          cumbersome the obligation of obtaining in each phase the double "visa" of the Bank and
          the Committed for public procurement; (ii) then persistent difficulties in terms of
          identifying technical specifications of materials to be procured on one hand, and bids'
          evaluation on the other hand, those difficulties are essentially related to inefficiencies
          and non-availability of qualified personnel.

          (viii)  Despite numerous initiatives taken by the Ministry for the adequate management
          of the project (recruitment of personnel especially assigned to project, reinforcement of
          management and monitoring positions; training of agents and officials; equipments)
          difficulties persisted. Difficulties were not completely resolved since financial
          previsions remained rough estimates, which would have a consequence of the non
          commitment of US $1.5 millions at the definitive closing of the project.

Assessment of Bank and Government performances

Ministry of Education (Borrower) services: Regarding the description of the project and its
objectives, which can not be dissociated from the policy reform conducted by MoE within the
framework of Government development plans (9th and 10th plans) which end result was (and
still remains) promoting education efficiency, quality and equity. All departments within the
Ministry and all its resources were thus mobilized for carrying out the planned activities; because
these were not developed (nor viewed) as ad hoc activities, but as integral part of MoE's activity
program.

Project management: Special decisions were made to ensure an effective project management,
particularly:
     (i)      The appointment of a coordinator to assist the director of DGSE at the cabinet level
              for monitoring soft activities and project strategic indicators;

     (ii)     The recruitment of top managers and their appointment to the DBE for the
              preparation and management of procurement documents.

     (iii)    The upgrading of specific software in order to monitor (i) operations linked with
              procurement, and (ii) project financial management. Nonetheless, badly configured


                                                  37

            and containing numerous inefficiencies, this software could not be used. It became
            necessary to develop new software by consulting a qualified consulting firm, in order
            to have an operational application allowing an efficient monitoring of procurement
            documents and disbursement operations as well as the production of statements of
            expenses acceptable to the Bank.

Project implementation schedule: At the initial closing date of the project (12/31/2004), more
than 90 percent of planned activities were implemented. Some were totally achieved a year prior
to the closing, which made the Government to request the acceleration of EQIP2. Yet, delay
noted in the procurement of computers (AOI No.24) and a study on the information system
resulted in a request of the closing date, which was then set for 8/31/2006. At this date, the
execution rate was 100 percent. The last disbursements are on track and should normally be
achieved as of 12/31/2006.

Bank services (Lender): Regarding the project preparation, the Bank team efficiently and
effectively committed with professionalism in the project preparation. It was a multi-disciplinary
team that learned from (i) discussions in 1998-1999 about Ecole de demain ; (ii) testing on the
field pedagogic program such as the competency-based approach ; and (iii) numerous studies
conducted in collaboration with MoE departments as well as national and international experts
through PHRD financing.

Concerning project monitoring and supervision, a regular monitoring was conducted by both side
which allowed not only an effective implementation of project activities, but also profound
reflection on certain aspects of schooling which would be a cornerstone of the second phase of the
project (regulation of students' flows, orientation, school management, information and
communications).

As far as monitoring the management of the project is concerned, the support quality of the Bank
technical team, mainly in terms of procurement, provided advices, training and support as well as
pertinent interventions to simplify procedures and face challenges; which cut-crosses with the
monitoring of the financial management that was done with the required rigor, especially during
the last two years, since--as mentioned above--approximate previsions were the result of the
non-consumption of more than one million dollars.
