Quality Improvement\n            Program (EQIP) Project's objective is to support the\n            government's efforts to a) achieve near-universal\n            completion of basic education (Grade 1 through 9); b)\n            provide a greater number of students with opportunities for\n            post-basic education; and c) modernize the sector in ways\n            that improve the quality of outputs and the efficiency with\n            which they are produced. There are two project components.\n            The first covers school-level interventions designed to\n            support the government's efforts to improve the quality\n            of both the teaching/learning processes and the physical\n            surroundings in which basic education students learn. The\n            subcomponents will a) support quality teaching innovation;\n            use new information and communication technologies; extend,\n            equip, and maintain school infrastructure; and reinforce\n            in-service training capacity. The second component covers\n            system-wide reforms aimed at strengthening evaluation and\n            remediation, research, and school- and regional-level\n            management capacities. The subcomponents will systematize\n            assessment of students, teachers, and institutions;\n            strengthen education research capacity; improve knowledge of\n            the management techniques and tools of the education system;\n            and regulate student flows."}, "docdt": "2000-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
