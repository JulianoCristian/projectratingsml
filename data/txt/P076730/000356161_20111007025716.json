  Recovery Project for Croatia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: like most demand driven\n            community-based investments, the project required about two\n            years before substantial disbursements could be made.\n            Combining the 'top down' and 'bottom up'\n            approaches was effective for implementing this demand driven\n            social development investment. Grant financing is\n            particularly useful to small enterprises when there are\n            transitory constraints in the financial system. In a project\n            where grant allocations will be made to applicants on a\n            competitive basis, it is important to ensure that the\n            selection takes into account that the applicant has the\n            necessary permits and licenses. Community-based,\n            demand-driven subprojects are sustainable. Monitoring and\n            evaluation systems must be carefully designed to ensure that\n            monitoring efforts can start early in the project\n            implementation period and produce data that can be useful\n            for assessing project outcomes and impacts. In a\n            post-conflict situation, a demining component can be used\n            strategically to unlock local economic potential and promote\n            social cohesion."}, "docdt": "2011-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
