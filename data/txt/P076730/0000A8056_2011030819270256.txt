                         way to increase social inclusion has effectively been met in advance of the revised closing date, December 31, 2010. Most of the end project targets have been reached or
                         surpassed. As of December 2010, over 84,000 beneficiaries residing in the areas of special state concern had been reached (98 percent of the target); 1,341 new jobs (134 percent

                         community infrastructure; and 211 in support of SMEs, crafts and cooperatives). While the overall end of project revenue target was not met due to global financial crisis and the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The preparation of the project's Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) has been initiated during the mission. The Ministry's staff has been informed that the Bank
                         requires an ICR to be prepared and circulated to the Bank's Board of Directors no later than six months after the project closing date. Thus, the ICR for the project will need to be
                         submitted to the Bank's Board of Directors by June 30, 2011 and disclosed to the public.
