F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objective of the Project was to support the Government of Honduras (GoH) to
increase the coverage, quality, accountability and governance of its basic education
system. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was defined more specifically in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) as follows:
1. Expand pre-school coverage in disadvantaged communities;
2. Improve completion rates in PROHECO schools;
3. Improve teacher accountability; and
4. Improve accountability of schools to citizens.

              Target surpassed. Target was revised upward in the 2012 restructuring
              due to improved data on population projections, which are used in the
              denominator of enrollment rates. However, all values reflect: (i) data at
Comments
              the national level, not targeted areas specifically, and (ii) data for the
              kindergarten year (year prior to starting primary education), not for the
              whole pre-primary education level (3- to 5-year-olds).

Achieved
                Target achieved. Target and baseline were revised upward in the 2012
                restructuring due to improved data generated under the Project
                specifically for the Honduran Community-Based Education Program
                (Programa Hondureño de Educación Comunitaria or PROHECO)
                schools, whereas the original target was set on the basis of national
Comments        averages. Gross completion rates were also redefined at restructuring as
                equivalent to graduation rates, or the number of students graduating from
                6th grade, divided by the number of students that enrolled in 6th grade at
                the beginning of the year. The revised baseline (82.3% for the year 2010)
                was based on the earliest data generated by the Project.

                Target surpassed. This indicator was revised in the 2012 restructuring to
                absorb two previous indicators: “Compliance with the official school
                calendar in targeted regions” and “Reduction in teacher absenteeism in
                targeted regions”. Through the PROHECO module of the Integrated
                System for the Administration of the Education System (Sistema de
                Administración de Centros Educativos or SACE), the Ministry of
                Education (Secretaría de Educación or SEDUC)’s web-based school
                management information system, schools were to report the number of
                school days and the rate of teacher absenteeism.

                In 2013, SEDUC collected information on enrollment, number of school
                days, and student absenteeism through a one-time manual survey from
Comments
                2,311 out of a total of 3,880 PROHECO schools (about 60%), which was
                uploaded into the SACE. By September 2013, only 243 PROHECO
                schools had not reported data through SACE (less than 7% of all
                PROHECO schools). However, a specific PROHECO module was not
                created because the same information, i.e. enrollment and number of
                school days, is being collected systematically for all schools, including
                PROHECO schools. Although teacher absenteeism data is not being
                collected through SACE, in the case of PROHECO schools, teacher
                absenteeism is collected by the Associations for Community-Based
                Education (Asociaciones Educativas Comunitarias or AECOs), which
                pay teacher salaries. For every day a PROHECO teacher is absent, a
                proportion of the monthly payment is deducted. For the rest of schools,

              Target partially achieved (58%). There were two original PDO
              indicators to measure governance/improved accountability of schools to
              citizens: “Increased proportion of schools who involve parents in social
              audits of the schools using the 60 words per minute fluency test in second
              grade in targeted areas”, and “Development of a balance score card for
              the national, departmental and the school level and its distribution to all
              departments and schools.” The first indicator was dropped in the 2012
              restructuring: it had been conceived as a measure of social accountability
Comments      of school quality through parents’ testing of their children’s reading
              abilities through the Early Grade Reading Abilities (EGRA) test, but the
              test was not meant to be administered by parents who were illiterate or
              had limited education. The second indicator was revised and replaced
              balance score cards with Transparency School Boards (TSBs), also
              known as Transparency Bulletin Boards (TBBs), which were considered
              a stronger mechanism for improving governance of the system and its
              grievance redress mechanism.

Comments       Target partially achieved (98% of the total, surpassed for IBE). This
               Indicator was revised in the 2012 restructuring and merged two original
               Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs): “Number of new Community-
               Based Pre-Primary Schools (Centros Comunitarios de Educación Pre-
               Básica or CCEPREBs) opened” and “Number of CCEPREBs equipped
               with fungible materials per year”.

               More CCEPREBs were opened than the target throughout the lifetime of
               the Project (946, of which 344 were IBE), but roughly 20% were closed
               due to different reasons (insufficient enrollment, reduction in payments
               to volunteer teachers, political crisis of 2009, etc.). Furniture,
               pedagogical packages and related equipment, and school supplies were
               distributed between May and August 2013 to all 781 CCEPREBs that
               remain open, including all IBE CCEPREBs.

               An additional 1,130 pre-primary PROHECO teachers (in pre-existing
               PROHECO preschools) also received pedagogical packages and
               equipment.

Achieved
Comments        Target partially achieved (98% for the total, 93% for IBE). This
                indicator was meant to ensure that each CCEPREB had its volunteer
                teacher trained in the use of the pedagogical package for pre-primary
                education. The target was based on 50% expected turnover for
                volunteers; as such, 1,200 volunteers would need to be trained (one for
                each of the 800 CCEPREBs that were expected to be opened, plus
                another 400 assuming 50% turnover). Assuming equal turnover for
                Intercultural and Bilingual Education (IBE) volunteers, the target was
                revised upward in the 2012 restructuring to 450 (so that each of the 300
                IBE CCEPREBs would have 1 trained volunteer if 50% of them quit).

               At Project closing, 82% of CCEPREBs opened with Project funds had a
               trained volunteer teacher (645 teachers in 781 CCEPREBs). Of those,
               292 IBE teachers were also trained in IBE methods as well as use of the
               pedagogical package.

                  Natural Sciences”; and “Teacher manual/toolkit for the usage of the
                  package of didactic materials designed”. Didactic materials for Spanish
                  and Math, however, were eliminated from the Project, as these were
                  prepared and distributed separately with financing from the Common
                  Fund of Education Donors, a pooled-fund investment from 5 donors

Comments        Target partially achieved (89%). This indicator was revised in the
                2012 restructuring from the original “Number of PROHECO teachers
                trained in active-participatory methodologies and in the usage of multi-
                grade didactic materials”. Training in active-participatory methodologies
                was eliminated since it was no longer considered a relevant
                methodology by SEDUC.

                  The goal of this indicator was to train every multi-grade PROHECO
                  teacher in multi-grade teaching techniques. As of 2013, the number of
                  multigrade PROHECO teachers is 4,298, so the target was
                  underestimated. Based on the Project target, 89% of teachers were
                  trained; based on the actual number of multigrade PROHECO teachers,
                  86% were trained.

               teachers receiving training and teacher workbooks; and (iii) PROHECO
               students receiving textbooks. The final numbers were: (i) 1,179
               CCEPREB volunteer teachers trained in the pedagogical package, 292
               of which were also trained in IBE methods; (ii) 5,376 PROHECO
               teachers that received teacher workbooks for Natural and Social
               Sciences, 3,711 of which were also trained in multi-grade techniques;

                and coordinators had already been trained by the Project. After the
                political crisis of 2009 (before restructuring), the new administration
                replaced all promoters and coordinators, so the restructuring included
                training for the new set (an additional 220 people). In the end, the

                including Community Based Educational Associations (AECOs), in
                their 6 targeted provinces. The indicator was revised to complement

                AECOs was removed since school networks in all 12 departments would
                be targeted, regardless of whether a PROHECO school was part of the
                school network or not.

Comments        Target not achieved. This indicator was revised in the 2012
                restructuring and merges two original IOIs: “Managerial information
                systems developed and implemented in targeted schools and networks”;
                and “Participatory school management monitoring and evaluation
                system to monitor school, teacher and student performance developed
                and implemented in targeted schools and networks”. The goal was two-
                fold: (i) to have a single, integrated system, thus necessitating a single
                indicator, and (ii) to refocus efforts on the 12 non-GIZ financed
                departments.

                The system is being finalized and is expected to go “live” by mid-
                January 2014. Meanwhile, surveys have been distributed to all school
                networks, information from which will be used to populate the web
                portal.

                The EMIS (which is known as the SACE) integrates all school
                management systems within SEDUC into a single platform. All
                departments have fully updated information on enrollment, teachers, and
                other indicators. Continuous additions are being incorporated into the
                SACE, expecting to have a fully integrated system by end-January 2014.

Comments        Target surpassed. This indicator was added in the 2012 restructuring in
                line with the creation of the Transparency and Human Rights Unit
                (THRU) after Project approval and the deployment of Transparency
                Bulletin Boards (TBBs) that was launched with financing from GIZ in 6
                targeted departments. The new indicator focused on installing TBBs in
                all schools in at least 3 municipalities within Honduras’ 12 remaining
                departments.

                In 2013, the THRU decided to expand deployment to 4 municipalities in
                each department. The number of TBBs deployed, 6,308, is an estimate
                based on a representative sample of centers with TBBs verified by
                consultants hired by the Project in 10 out of 12 departments (centers are
                currently being verified in the other 2 departments).

               restructuring from its original version “HRM system strengthened and
               SIARHD decentralized to departments”

               The Human Resources Management (HRM) system within SEDUC was
               significantly strengthened through a series of systematic measures to
               improve accountability and governance. The Integrated System for the
               Administration of Teachers’ Payroll (Sistema Integrado de
               Administración de los Recursos Humanos Docentes or SIARHD) did not
               need to be migrated to the Integrated System for the Financial
               Management of the Public Sector (Sistema Integrado de Administración
               Financiera or SIAFI) because the validity and integrity controls in the
               revamped system are compatible with SIAFI requirements.

               The target, however, was only partially achieved because the HRM
               system has yet to be decentralized to all 18 departments. It has only been
               implemented in 5 thus far. By December, the HRM system is expected
               to be decentralized to another 2 departments.

1. In 2007, Honduras’ education sector was mired in challenges including limited
coverage, especially at the pre-primary and secondary education levels, low quality and
weak student performance, inequitable access by geographic and socioeconomic status,
and low transition and graduation rates at all levels. Challenges were more prevalent in
rural areas and among poorer segments of the population. These issues featured
prominently in spite of increased expenditures (from 5% of GDP in 1990 to 6.8% in
2007 1 ) for education, mostly biased towards the wage bill 2 . Low administrative and
management capacity within the Ministry of Education (SEDUC), coupled with a dearth
of information and reliable data that could feed into an institutionalized monitoring,
evaluation, and strategic planning function, were affecting educational outcomes.
Accountability at all levels was minimal and weak governance, especially in human
resources management (HRM), was seen through the lack of compliance with the school
calendar, due to the high number of teacher strikes and high teacher absenteeism.

2. The Bank’s rationale for involvement stemmed from a long-standing commitment to
fulfilling unmet needs in the education sector, helping the Government of Honduras
(GoH) overcome governance and capacity challenges, and continued support for prior
education coverage and quality interventions to ensure their sustainability. Since 1999,
the Bank (and other donors) had supported the Honduran Community-Based Education
Program (Programa Hondureño de Educación Comunitaria or PROHECO), to enhance
access to education in rural areas and foster community participation in schools.
PROHECO was relatively successful in addressing some of the afore-mentioned
challenges, specifically coverage and accountability, as PROHECO teachers were only
paid for days worked. PROHECO schools came the closest to achieving the nationally
mandated goal of 200 days of school (at 175 days), compared to regular schools (72
days) 3. The program also appeared to have increased quality, especially in rural areas 4.

3. The Project was also aligned to: (i) the GoH’s long-term vision to improve the quality
of education in order to achieve social equity, under the 2007-2030 National Strategic
Plan (Plan de Nación 2007-30); (ii) Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) goals,
namely improving the quality and efficiency of education at all levels, supporting
decentralization and community participation in education management, improving
teachers’ performance and supporting programs to improve their qualifications, and
promoting PROHECO and Intercultural and Bilingual Education (IBE); (iii) Honduras’

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4. The objective of the Project was to support the GoH to increase the coverage, quality,
accountability, and governance of its basic education system, as reflected in the
Financing Agreement. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was more specific, listing
the four parts of the PDO with their corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
consistent with Project design, as follows:

Coverage: Expand pre-school coverage in disadvantaged communities.
 • KPI 1. Increased preschool enrollment in targeted areas.
Quality: Improve completion rates in PROHECO schools.
• KPI 2. Increased 6th grade gross completion rates in PROHECO schools.
Accountability: Improve teacher accountability.
• KPI 3. Improved compliance with the official school calendar in targeted regions;
• KPI 4. Reduction in teacher absenteeism in targeted regions.
Governance: Improve accountability of schools to citizens.
• KPI 5. Increased proportion of schools who involve parents in social audits of the
   schools using the 60-words-per-minute fluency test in second grade;
• KPI 6. Development of a balance score card for the national, departmental and school
   level and its adoption by departments and schools (national and in targeted regions).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

5. The PDO was not revised. Some KPIs were changed in the 2012 restructuring:

                          fluency test in second grade                      School Boards
                       6. Development of a balance score card for the
                          national, departmental and school level and
                          its adoption by departments and schools

                                                           2
6. Improve teacher accountability: The KPI was revised to absorb the two previously
existing KPIs, and to reflect that absenteeism (former KPI 3) and number of school days
(former KPI 4) would now be reported through the portal.

7. Improve accountability of schools to citizens: KPI 5 was eliminated because parents
needed training in order to perform social audits through fluency tests and many parents
were either illiterate or had limited schooling. KPI 6 was revised to reflect a new
modality, Transparency Bulletin Boards (TBBs, referred to as Transparency School
Boards in the restructuring) 5, which were already being implemented with funding from
German GIZ in 6 departments, and were considered a stronger system for improving
governance with a better grievance redress mechanism than the balance score cards.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8. The Project’s main beneficiaries belong in four main categories. 1) Students: pre-
primary students in underserved areas attending new CCEPREBs; PROHECO students at
all levels receiving new materials and benefitting from newly trained teachers, including
IBE students; low income students from the National University of Agriculture (UNA)
receiving shoes in order to undertake the Infrastructure School Census, plus all Census
student participants trained. 2) Teachers: PROHECO teachers trained in multi-grade and
IBE pedagogy and affiliated with the National Teachers’ Pension Fund Institute (Instituto
Nacional de Previsión del Magisterio or INPREMA), and new CCEPREB volunteers
trained. 3) SEDUC staff: 18 line units involved in Project activities trained in financial
management, administrative support for activities, information systems upgrades and
other essential functions; several units equipped with computers and furniture;
decentralized staff trained for SACE and SIAHRD decentralization and other essential
functions; all staff from increased governance and accountability through the SACE, the
School Infrastructure Census and cleanup of SIARHD. 4) Community participants and
stakeholders: members of the school networks’ administration trained in implementing
PECs and PERs; members of the Municipal Councils for Educational Development
(Consejos Municipales de Desarrollo Educativo or COMDEs) trained in the new legal
framework for community-based participation; stakeholders with access to TBBs.

1.5 Original Components

9. Project components are the same in the PAD and Financing Agreement, but Sub-
components are worded differently. The ICR is based on the language of the PAD, which
is more detailed and comprehensive.

10. Component 1: Enhancing and Scaling-Up Interventions that Address the Needs
of the Poor. This component would support pre-primary and primary school


5
 The term Transparency Bulletin Board (TBB) will be used throughout the ICR as it better explains the tool. TBBs are
bulletin boards that must be placed visibly on school grounds with information about enrollment, teacher lists, school
budget, etc.




                                                          3
interventions focused on the poorest segments of the population. It had two
subcomponents: (1.1) Expanding coverage for preschool education in rural areas; and
(1.2) Quality improvement in PROHECO multi-grade schools through teacher training
and provision of materials.

11. Component 2: Community Participation in School Management. This component
would foster community participation within an Integrated School Management System.
It had three subcomponents: (2.1) Consolidation and Institutionalization of the School
Management System: This sub-component would finance analysis of existing school
management modalities among traditional, PROHECO, and PROHECO-IBE educational
networks to develop consolidated policies for community participation, social
management, school planning, school systems for information, monitoring and evaluation,
and financial administration. (2.2) School Planning and Resources for Quality Education:
This sub-component would finance the review and development of instruments to support
school and network planning and resource management through cooperative school
networks. (2.3) School Management and Education Performance Monitoring and
Evaluation: This sub-component would finance the development and implementation of a
participatory monitoring and evaluation system for school management.

12. Component 3: Governance and Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of
Education. The component would finance efforts to strengthen SEDUC, including
improving governance and management capacity. The component was divided into three
sub-components: (3.1) Information for improved performance and greater
accountability: This sub-component would finance: a web-based technological platform
to allow for improved decision-making and monitoring of performance; improved
statistics about sector performance at all levels available to the general public, including
capacity building of the statistics unit; expanding, strengthening, updating and
maintaining the SIARHD at central and sub-national levels to provide reliable
information on teachers at all levels, and integrating SIARHD into SIAFI; and
strengthening the capacity for educational planning and the use of information for
decision-making at the central and departmental levels. (3.2) National System of
Assessment of Learning Outcomes: This sub-component would finance the country’s
participation in international standardized assessments of student learning and strengthen
the institutional capacities of SEDUC to use the information for monitoring of learning
outcomes and decision-making, and to increase overall transparency through
dissemination of the results. (3.3) Human Resource Management and Evaluation: This
sub-component would finance the improvement and implementation of critical human
resource management processes and procedures for a more effective personnel system for
teachers.

13. Component 4. Project Administration: This component would finance the cost of
technical personnel (local consultants) and operating costs. The proposed administration
arrangements foresaw the EFA-FTI Project Implementation Unit within SEDUC to be the
main implementing agency, supported by five dedicated consultants.

1.6 Revised Components



                                             4
14. All components were revised during the June 2012 Level II restructuring.

15. Component 1: Enhancing and Scaling-Up Interventions that Address the Needs
of the Poor. Sub-component 1.2 was reduced in scope to focus only on didactic materials
for PROHECO schools in the social and natural sciences, since packages in Math and
Spanish for PROHECO schools were being provided by the Common Fund of Education
Donors (Fondo Común).

16. Component 2: Community Participation in School Management. This component
was decreased in scope and budget to account for a shorter implementation period post-
restructuring. The remaining activities under Sub-component 2.1 were geared toward
specific support to strengthen the PROHECO program and capacity of its teachers,
including training on their newly acquired pension rights, and to train AECOs to
strengthen financial management capabilities. The remaining activities in Sub-component
2.2 focused on distributing operational manuals to prepare and monitor outcomes of
PECs and PERs and training management entities within rural school networks to prepare
and monitor PECs and PERs. Sub-component 2.3 was unchanged.

17. Component 3. Governance and Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of
Education. Activities under Component 3 were revised to account for a shorter
implementation period, since a separate withdrawal condition affecting Sub-component
3.1 had been waived in the March 2011 restructuring; Component 3 increased in scope.
The scope of Sub-component 3.1 was increased to finance the deployment of TBBs in 12
departments of the country, building on those already launched in the other six western
departments with funding from GIZ. It would also finance data collection for the School
Infrastructure Census, a consultancy to evaluate human resources in SEDUC and its
departmental branches and propose a new organizational chart for SEDUC under the
newly decentralized structure, and a series of consultancies to provide technical support
to key SEDUC authorities to strengthen their capacity to implement the Project.

18. Component 4: Project Administration. This component increased significantly
since the Project had to finance additional staff critical to its operation, for which funding
had not originally been set aside.

1.7 Other significant changes

First restructuring: March 22, 2011
19. The withdrawal condition affecting Sub-Component 3.1 (Schedule 2, Section
IV.B.1(b) of the Financing Agreement dated July 2, 2008) was waived. The condition
called for an update of the SIAHRD on the basis of a teachers’ census and post audit,
which would be tested by way of random audits. The condition was partially met upon
completion of a teachers’ census and post audit, and the subsequent updating of SIARHD
to reflect census and post audit recommendations. The partial waiver referred to the
pending verification of the updated SIARHD by independent audit.




                                              5
Second restructuring: June 29, 2012
20. The withdrawal condition affecting Component 2 (Schedule 2, Section IV.B.1(c) of
the Financing Agreement dated July 2, 2008) was waived. The condition called for the
deposit of the amount owed for PROHECO teachers’ pension benefits dating back to
January 1, 1999 into a separate account, for the benefit of PROHECO teachers. It was
determined that the spirit behind the condition had been met since INPREMA had
reinstated pension rights for PROHECO teachers by signing an Agreement to
reincorporate PROHECO teachers and put a plan in place to fully refund teachers who
were eligible for pension payments since 1999. The remaining legal covenants were
revised accordingly. Project activities, especially those originally linked to Component 2
and Sub-component 3.1, were revised to adjust for the shorter implementation period,
new GoH priorities, and funding from other sources for complementary activities. The
Results and Monitoring Framework, including several IOIs and targets, were revised to
reflect new activities and data generated by the Project. Out of 16 original IOIs, 2
remained unchanged, 14 others were consolidated into 9, and 3 more IOIs were added
resulting in 14 IOIs. Project costs were revised, consistent with revised activities (with
significant decrease in scope for Component 2 and increase in scope for Components 3
and 4), and Credit proceeds reallocated accordingly across the five categories.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21. The Project benefited from its complementarity with Honduras’ long-term education
strategy, contributing to coverage and quality goals in basic education, especially for
poorer segments of the population, and strengthening governance and accountability.
Two main risks emerged from evaluations of previous IDA financed projects in the
education sector: sustainability of multiple interventions and a consistent inability to
improve institutional weaknesses. The Project’s aim was thus to strengthen and
streamline existing structures and processes that would support sustainability of
successful past interventions (e.g. the PROHECO model) through a simple design with
selective interventions (the focus on pre-primary education).

22. The original design was rather complex, however, especially with regard to the high
number of line units involved in Project implementation (18 in total), and the PDO’s
focus on four broad areas (coverage, quality, accountability and governance). Project
design benefited nonetheless from consultation with other donors and with the GoH to
ensure that EFA goals (as the overarching platform in the country) remained at the
forefront and Project activities did not overlap with other donors’. Project components
and activities were aligned with these four goals, more so to the PDO indicators.

23. During preparation, the Bank was made aware that INPREMA had stopped collecting
pension contributions from PROHECO teachers and granting them benefits, in spite of
cumulative contributions received since 1999 in the amount of US$ 1.8 million, a portion
of which had been financed by the International Development Association (IDA) under
the previous Bank Project. Given the Bank’s long-standing investment in the PROHECO



                                            6
program, two withdrawal conditions were added to the Financing Agreement. These
conditions pertained to Component 2 and Sub-Component 3.1, which amounted to about
50% of Credit funds. Section V of the Financing Agreement (Other Undertakings)
provided a schedule for the PROHECO-related condition to be fulfilled by March 1, 2009.

24. Another sustainability risk identified was the use of a self-contained implementation
unit within SEDUC. To mitigate that risk and improve coordination with other donors,
Project management would fall to the existing EFA Coordination Unit (ECU) within
SEDUC. Prior assessments of the ECU had determined that it had no internal capacity to
maintain financial management and procurement procedures consistent with IDA
standards. As such, five consultants would be hired to exclusively manage Project
fiduciary aspects and coordination. Additional training and guidance on IDA fiduciary
procedures would be built in for other ECU staff.

2.2 Implementation

25. Prior to Effectiveness, SEDUC (with the Bank’s approval) decided against
transferring project administration responsibilities to the ECU as planned, given
mounting concerns over its capacity. Instead, a new Project Management Unit (PMU)
was created within SEDUC to manage the Project, with additional staffing and budgeting
needs, plus the originally envisaged five consultants. The strengthened PMU was better
able to manage the complex design and numerous implementing units involved.
Financing for the PMU initially came from counterpart funds but, by November 2011,
SEDUC was unable to sustain financing for the PMU and fund other activities, like
stipends for CCEPREB volunteers. The Bank absorbed the PMU costs, freeing up
counterpart funds to pay all stipends through Project closure.

26. There was a 10-month delay between Board approval (January 24, 2008) and
Effectiveness (November 14, 2008). This was mostly due to delays in ratifying the Loan
Agreement, which required the President’s signature. Further delays resulted from the
political crisis that ensued when President Zelaya was ousted on June 28, 2009, and the
Bank (and all other donors) put operations on hold. Operations resumed when President
Lobo took office in January 2010. High turnover in the Executive also filtered down to
the ministerial level and to heads of line units, departmental and municipal offices, and so
forth. This resulted in a total of four different Ministers of Education throughout the life
of the Project, and, with each one, a reshuffling of SEDUC staff, especially those in
managerial positions. These changes curtailed institutional memory, including knowledge
of the Project and Bank fiduciary procedures among implementing units.

27. There were delays by the GoH in satisfying the withdrawal conditions, in part due to
the political crisis. As a result, about 50% of Credit funds was blocked until 2011;
another 25% was blocked until 2012. The Bank also incorporated critical steps related to
the withdrawal conditions into the design of two complementary Development Policy
Lending (DPL) operations. The Bank restructured the Project in March 2011, as soon as
the first of the withdrawal conditions was waived (the SIARHD-related condition),
releasing that portion of the funds. When the second condition was met satisfactorily, the



                                             7
Bank restructured the Project a second time (in June 2012) to account for a shortened
implementation period for previously blocked components, and delays caused by the
political crisis.

28. At restructuring, the Bank successfully revised activities under all Components to
leverage efforts by other donors. Given delays in Project implementation, GIZ
commenced several activities under Component 2 (development of PEC and PER
manuals, development of PER for all school networks, and laying the groundwork for an
integrated management information systems for school network management) but only in
the country’s 6 western departments. Project activities were revised to complement their
efforts in Honduras’ remaining 12 departments, using the GIZ-financed PEC and PER
manuals. GIZ was also financing a new modality, the TBBs, in the 6 western
departments; the Bank chose to finance this activity in the other 12 departments under
Component 3. KfW and Swiss cooperation had also committed funds to a new SEDUC
priority, the Plan Maestro de Infraestructura (Master Plan of Infrastructure). Given its
complementarity with the Project, the Bank increased the scope of Component 3 to
contribute financing to School Infrastructure Census activities, namely data collection for
the Master Plan.

29. The PMU, with support from the Bank, was able to successfully navigate delays and
capacity challenges, and implement Component 2 and Sub-component 3.1 more rapidly
than expected, allowing the Project to close as scheduled. High turnover in the final year
for the PMU Coordinator, Financial Management Specialist, and M&E Specialist (the
latter was replaced twice within a 2-month period) did not negatively affect
implementation.

30. Two important factors were instrumental in the successful closure of the Project. The
first was that in mid-2011, the Bank located the new TTL in-country. This allowed for
more intensive supervision and guidance and more effective communication with
SEDUC. The second was the appointment of a new Minister of Education in February
2012, whose priorities were strongly aligned with Project objectives. The subsequent
appointment of SEDUC’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as the institutional focal point
for the Project significantly boosted implementation, first, by helping to collect all legal
evidence needed for the satisfaction of the second withdrawal condition, and, second, by
expediting communications and clearing up bottlenecks between implementing units and
the PMU.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design:
31. The PAD identified a RFM table with annual targets, KPIs, and intermediate
indicators linked to PDOs and Project components. Several baseline values and Project
targets were based on questionable estimates. Indicators and targets were also poorly
linked to measurement of outcomes; for example, although many Project activities were
clearly linked to improving governance, the governance KPI was more akin to measuring
accountability (given its focus on providing information about school management and



                                             8
performance to parents). Likewise, the accountability indicator, which measured teacher
absenteeism and number of school days, would have been a better governance indicator,
as improvements in these areas imply accountability within the system and improved
management within SEDUC.

32. Specifically, one PDO indicator (Gross Completion Rates in PROHECO schools) did
not explain how the baseline was calculated or how to track progress, and mislabeled the
indicator (which was more likely survival rates, given that it was tracking completion for
a specific group within the education system), generating confusion within the PMU.
This indicator may also be misleading, as completion rates do not necessarily denote
better schooling or quality. They may indirectly indicate that the value of more education
has become greater than the alternative, for which improved quality could be one reason,
but the indicator did not tie together Project activities (training of PROHECO teachers)
with outcomes. The RFM focused on completion rates, and the PAD focused on quality;
though related, these are different objectives. The GoH conducted a beneficiary survey in
November 2013 to show the contribution of Project activities to quality as well as
completion rates.

33. In the case of governance, one of the KPIs, Increased proportion of schools who
involve parents in social audits of schools using the 60 words per minute fluency test in
second grade in targeted areas, inferred that parents were literate and capable of
administering the test, which was unrealistic.

M&E Implementation:
34. Annual and intermediate indicators were monitored by the PMU, and the Project
itself contributed to the improvement of SEDUC’s education statistics through training of
SEDUC personnel, digitalization of records, and the integration of disjointed information
platforms within the SACE. Design weaknesses in M&E were addressed in the 2012
restructuring. Several baseline and target values were revised to reflect new data
generated by the Project. Several PDO and intermediate indicators were also revised,
merged, or eliminated entirely.

35. Baseline and target values were revised upward for the coverage indicator (increased
pre-school enrollment in targeted areas) and the quality indicator (increased 6th grade
Gross Completion Rates in PROHECO schools), based on new data generated by the
Project. Changes to the latter were also partly due to the way Gross Completion Rates
were defined in the 2012 restructuring (the number of students completing 6th Grade,
divided by the number of students who entered the 6th Grade at the beginning of the
year), which was actually the graduation rate. The new definition, though clearer, was an
inadequate measure of quality. Survival rates, measured as the proportion of 1st graders in
year t that graduate from 6th grade in year t+5, would have been a better indicator of
long-term quality impact.

36. Changes to the accountability and governance indicators made in the 2012
restructuring did not correct for their apparent mix-up. Revisions to the accountability
indicator were re-focused on PROHECO, specifically the completion of the PROHECO



                                            9
module of SEDUC’s web portal, which would provide a sustainable and accessible
method for monitoring enrollment, teacher absenteeism, and number of school days.
However, since PROHECO schools represent about 11% of the basic education system,
and historically had a higher record of attendance and accountability, this indicator does
not truly reflect accountability of teachers throughout the public education system.

37. The original governance indicators were dropped or revised in the 2012 restructuring.
The original balance scorecard indicator was revised to measure improved governance
through the use of TBBs to submit complaints as an indicator of increased school
accountability to citizens (the PAD’s questionable definition of governance). The
indicator only measured the importance of TBBs relative to other tools that would
promote transparency and governance. The deployment of TBBs and their impact (no
complaints would indicate they are generally ineffective) are also important measures of
accountability; it would have been useful to track whether the total number of complaints
increased over time, or the impact of other governance-related activities supported by the
Project (teachers’ census and cleanup of the payroll system, for example).

M&E Use:
38. Data generated by the Project underscored the revision of several baseline and target
indicators in the 2012 restructuring.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards:
39. As the Project included no civil works, the only safeguard triggered was Indigenous
Peoples (OP/BP 4.10). The Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Peoples Plan (IAPP) was
approved in December 2007 and implemented. The Project opened CCEPREBs in
Indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities and trained pre-school volunteers in IBE
methods for CCEPREBs in these communities. Through sustained support for IBE from
Bank Projects since 2003, and with special support from the current Minister, the
National Education Program for Ethnic Groups in Honduras (Programa Nacional de
Educación para las Etnias Autóctonas y Afroantillanas de Honduras or PRONEEAAH)
became a Directorate of Intercultural Multilingual Education in 2013.

Fiduciary compliance:
40. The Project suffered shortcomings in Financial Management (FM), as evidenced by
having qualified opinions in the 2010 and 2011 External Audits of the Financial
Statements. The 2011 Audit Report detected US$975,714 in expenditures for Component
2, for which the withdrawal condition was still in effect—however all but US$357,684.43
were incorrectly classified under this component. Further investigation by the Bank
revealed that US$40,727.92 had also been spent on activities under Sub-Component 3.1
prior to the waiver of the withdrawal condition. The Bank did not render these
expenditures ineligible, but prompted SEDUC to develop a thorough FM Action Plan to
rectify this situation and avoid future occurrences. Subsequent changes in the PMU in the
areas of General and Financial Management, led to improvements in this area.




                                           10
41. Procurement was affected by internal and external factors (political crisis, SEDUC
staff turnover). Limited understanding of fiduciary procedures by SEDUC staff, most
notably its Legal Department (as far as procurement regulations were concerned) led to
delays. Haphazard planning of activities by implementing line units and frequent
revisions of yearly Annual Operational Plans also caused delays and stretched the PMU’s
capacity. Implementation was impacted by slow bidding and contracting processes, and
in many cases, an insufficient number of bidders. Finally, contract monitoring, especially
of individual consultants, was weak at times and led to downgraded ratings in this area.
Several action plans were put in place to rectify issues under PMU and SEDUC control,
with some success, especially toward the end of the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42. To ensure continuity of reforms, the Bank is working closely with SEDUC and 15
other donor agencies which are active in the sector and are members of the International
Donors' Education Round Table (Mesa Redonda de Cooperantes Externos en Educación
or MERECE). The Bank is currently part of the coordinating troika through end-2013,
and remains committed to supporting Project objectives. Other donors, such as the Inter-
American Development Bank (IADB) and GIZ, continue to support common objectives
to those of the Project. For example, IADB continues to support CCEPREBs around the
country; GIZ is supporting capacity building for the development of network and school-
level development plans. KfW is supporting the next phase of the Infrastructure Master
Plan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives:
43. Relevance of Project objectives is Substantial. All four objectives (coverage, quality,
accountability, and governance) remain highly relevant today with respect to Honduras’
strategic national plan (“The Vision for a Country 2010-2038 and the Plan for a Nation
2010-2022”), the current education strategy (“The National Education Strategy 2010-
2014,” NES), and the current SEDUC strategy. The overarching medium- and long-term
strategies incorporate ambitious development plans with a strong focus on improved
educational quality and coverage. The NES notes all four objectives as part of its ongoing
strategy, and teacher accountability (through performance reviews and improved
attendance) and improved governance and transparency (through continued efforts to
decentralize HRM and integrate SEDUCs information systems) are among the main
pillars of SEDUC’s current strategy. A national student learning assessment in 2012 also
revealed that Honduras has yet to reach its 2015 EFA goals related to student test score in
Mathematics and Spanish, underscoring the need for continuing to improve quality.

44. In January 2012, the new Fundamental Law of Education was approved by Congress,
enhancing the relevance of all four objectives. The new Law made the kindergarten year
compulsory for all children, and the GoH is more than ever committed to achieving



                                            11
universal pre-school coverage. Secondary schooling (grades 7-9) was also made
compulsory, for which primary completion is an essential first step. The Law makes
special emphasis on the need for greater transparency, accountability, and governance
and sets the legal groundwork for decentralization of administrative (including HRM)
and financial responsibilities to decentralized SEDUC branches in the 18 departments,
and continued efforts within the Ministry to strengthen its EMIS and mainstream data
collection efforts.

Design:
45. Relevance of Project design is Substantial. Key design elements of the Project are
considered best practices in education with respect to the objectives. Teacher training and
access to didactic materials are key to improving education quality; the focus on
PROHECO schools, most of which are rural and 94% of which are multi-grade (the two
lowest performing groups [rural and multi-grade] in national learning assessments in
2012), was sound. Efforts to streamline school information systems, teacher attendance,
and HRM, are essential for improved governance and accountability. Increased pre-
primary coverage has been shown to decrease dropout rates in 1st and 2nd grades, and
improve skills retention. Inclusion of all these elements, however, rendered the design too
complex and wide-reaching, with a high number of implementing units involved.
Implementation arrangements were also inadequate.

Implementation:
46. Relevance of implementation was Substantial. The 2012 restructuring allowed for
implementation of most Project activities, and rendered the design more relevant to GoH
priorities and implementation arrangements more realistic. For example, support for new
sector priorities like the School Infrastructure Census and TBBs adapted the design to
changing priorities. Revised activities were aligned with those financed by other donors,
avoiding overlap, leveraging other investments, and improving overall sector
coordination. The M&E framework was revised for clarity and accuracy, with updated
baselines and targets and fewer, more monitorable IRIs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47. The evaluation of the PDO uses PDO indicators and additional evidence of outcomes
collected at the ICR stage to show progress made toward achievement of objectives.
Three out of four PDO indicators were achieved or surpassed, and the other was partially
achieved.

Coverage / Expand pre-school coverage in disadvantaged communities: High
48. This objective was achieved through expanded pre-school coverage 6 at the national
level from a (recalculated) baseline of 56.5% in 2007 to 66.6% in 2013, 1.6 percentage


6
 Pre-school coverage here measures the proportion of children of age 5 attending pre-primary education. In other
words, coverage is only being calculated for the kindergarten year, the only pre-primary education year that is
compulsory in Honduras, and which was targeted by the Project.




                                                      12
points over the 65% target. CCEPREBs were created by SEDUC in 1979 7, primarily as
an alternative method of pre-primary education (namely the kindergarten year for
children aged 5) in areas where no pre-primary institutions existed. Most children attend
CCEPREBs for one year and then transition to primary school. By definition,
CCEPREBs are only opened to fulfill unmet needs, and staffed by volunteers.

49. The Project provided pre-primary education for 29,724 8 children in disadvantaged
communities between 2009 and 2013, who otherwise would not have had access to
school. In 2013, 7,565 children attended Project-financed CCEPREB’s, representing
12.5% of all children enrolled in CCEPREBs. In terms of total pre-school enrollment,
CCEPREBs represent 25.5% of the pre-primary system in 2013. CCEPREBs financed by
the Project represent 4.9% of total pre-primary enrollment, up from 0% in 2008.

Enrollment in Project CCEPREBs (as % of all pre-school enrollment)                0                         4.9%


50. The Project contributed to this objective by creating and equipping 946 CCEPREBs,
including 344 IBE CCEPREBs, of which 781 remain open today, and 316 of which are in
IBE communities. The Project also trained 1,179 CCEPREB volunteer teachers,
including 417 IBE CCEPREB teachers. Disadvantaged communities were identified
through a national mechanism for targeting the extremely poor in Honduras, known as
Solidarity Net (Red Solidaria) 9. In 2010, the targeting mechanism was changed to the
Bono 10Mil, a Conditional Cash Transfer program that targeted Honduras’ poorest
300,000 people. In addition, targeted areas were those where no other pre-primary
schools existed. There was a 63% increase in the number of CCEPREBs between 2007
and 2013, from 2,567 to 4,181, and the Project financed 48% of that increase; in 2013,
Project-financed CCEPREBs represent 19% of the total.

Quality / Improve completion rates in PROHECO schools: Modest
51. Graduation rates in PROHECO schools increased to the targeted 98% in 2012 from
82.3% in 2010. Since activities were launched in 2009, survival rates for the student
cohort that entered 1st grade in 2009 (they would be in 5th grade in 2013) cannot be
calculated as an indicator of quality; there would also be no data to compare to over time.



7
  They were called Non-Formal Pre-Primary Education Schools (Centros Preescolares de Educación No Formal or
CEPENF) at that time.
8
  Most children that attended CCEPREBs financed by the Project were aged 5, but in a few cases, younger children also
attended. The ages of enrolled students were not systematically monitored, so the total number of beneficiaries may be
lower if some children attended for more than one year.
9
  This targeting mechanism combined information from the 2004 Living Standards and Measurement Survey and the
2001 Census data to target different programs toward people living in extreme poverty.




                                                         13
Instead, a proxy 10 for survival rates was calculated for 2009 and 2012. This additional
evidence gathered at the ICR stage shows that survival rates in PROHECO schools, and
in the system overall, have increased. Table 3 shows that survival rates in the entire basic
education system increased by 11.4% between 2009 and 2012, and by 25.6% in
PROHECO schools, by comparison.

52. The Project’s contribution to improved quality/improved completion rates in
PROHECO schools was through training 86% of all multi-grade PROHECO teachers in
multi-grade pedagogy, and the provision of teaching guides and texts in social and natural
sciences, which complemented the provision of math and science texts by other donors.
A 2010 study in Honduras showed that access to and use of quality texts had a
statistically significant impact on students’ learning outcomes in math and Spanish,
compared to students who lacked access (SEDUC 2012). PROHECO schools currently
make up about 11% of public primary schools (in terms of enrollment), but most of their
teachers are not certified. The Project also provided training for IBE PROHECO teachers
in relevant methods to improve quality in IBE areas. Expansion of pre-schools to
disadvantaged areas and provision of materials to PROHECO pre-schools also
contributed to improved quality, as pre-primary schooling has been linked to improved
performance and lower dropout rates in primary school.

53. A beneficiary survey of teachers who benefitted from training in multi-grade and IBE
techniques and parents of children in PROHECO schools was carried out. The teacher
survey revealed that 85% of 470 multi-grade teachers surveyed considered the training
received through the Project as excellent or very good, and 89% of teachers saw
improvements in their students’ academic performance. Of 947 parents surveyed, 90%
were aware of these teacher trainings, and nearly 100% of parents saw improvements in
the quality of their children’s education, in their children’s attitudes toward their
education, and in their academic performance over the past year.


10
  Assuming no significant fluctuations in population growth, the proxy survival rate was calculated as the number of
children that finished 6th grade divided by the number of children that finished 1st grade. There was no data available on
the number of children entering 1st grade in 2009 (the more accurate denominator for measuring survival rates). Data
was available for 2012 but the denominator was also children finishing 1st grade to ensure comparability. Although the
numbers are only a proxy given the underlying assumptions, the results are significant enough to suggest progress.




                                                           14
Accountability / Improve accountability of schools to citizens: Substantial

54. Increased efforts to collect information about the education system, and to make it
public, have improved schools’ accountability to parents and citizens. Increased
accountability is evidenced by the growing number of complaints submitted each year,
and the high incidence of resolution. Although the targeted proportion (40%) of
complaints submitted to SEDUC’s Transparency and Human Rights Unit (THRU) was
not met, 21% of these originated from TBBs from January to June 2013. That TBBs were
installed (with financing from the Project) in approximately 6,308 schools in 12 targeted
departments (plus those installed with GIZ financing in 6 other departments) is a
substantial measure of improved accountability, as citizens are now informed through
TBBs about school budgets and expenditures (during the ICR mission it was observed
that parents’ associations are often involved in spending decisions at the school level),
official teacher lists, enrollment, etc.

Indicator                                                            2010 / 11                   2012 / 13

55. The Project contributed to this objective by financing TBB deployment (to make
information available on schools grounds, which is especially relevant for rural or poorer
schools where access to internet is limited), and capacity building and equipment for the
THRU and updating of their web portal, through which complaints can also be lodged.

Governance / Improve teacher accountability: Substantial
56. Governance through teacher accountability was substantially improved. New internal
management controls within SEDUC through a school administration system, the SACE,
are tracking average school days, teacher information (credentials), student enrollment,
student absenteeism, and student performance. To date, 95% of all schools (PROHECO
included) are reporting this data through the SACE. The Project target was to have 50%
of PROHECO schools reporting information through a dedicated portal within SACE; in
2013, 59.6% of PROHECO schools were manually surveyed and results transferred to
SACE (the decision to track this information for all schools rendered the specific
PROHECO portal unnecessary). Average school days increased from around 135 in 2007
to over the mandated 200 in 2013. Given that average school days were low because of
frequent teacher strikes and high absenteeism, the substantial increase in average school
days is used as a proxy for lower teacher absenteeism. 11 Although SACE does not track
teacher absenteeism as previously envisaged, SEDUC departmental offices collect this
data, which the Office of the Minister is tracking. In 2012, the Office published a list of


11
  The PAD equates higher number of school days with lower absenteeism (pp.4): “In the last three years the number of
school days in regular schools has been about 72, compared to 200 mandatory school days. Teachers' strikes […] have
been the main culprit for the shortened school calendar which disrupts education and affects quality.”




                                                        15
schools that achieved zero absenteeism (4.5% of schools); given the low percentage with
zero absenteeism, SEDUC extended that academic school year from November 30 to
December 21, 2012. For PROHECO schools, average school days increased from 201 in
2010 to 206 in 2013, and teacher absenteeism decreased to 0.6% in 2013 (AECOs track
teacher absenteeism in PROHECO schools, which they report to the PROHECO Unit of
SEDUC).

57. SIARHD cleanup and teaching post reassignment also led to improved governance by
ending double payments, eliminating ghost teachers, and verifying teacher credentials on
which the salary scale is based. Through post reassignment, SEDUC has begun to fill
vacant posts by reassigning teachers from schools with excess capacity, freeing up about
US$15 million yearly that were used to fill vacant posts based on expected population
growth. Cross validation between SIARHD and SACE underscores the integrity of both
systems, which also dovetail with the School Infrastructure Census. The census gathered
information about the exact location and physical condition of every school in the
country, and also the number of teachers in each one (as a third point for cross-
referencing posts and payments). This will help clarify salary bonuses based on location,
as teachers working in border areas are entitled to additional pay.

58. The Project contributed to improvements in governance by financing the creation of
SACE and all the technical support, training, and equipment needed to maintain it in all
18 departments and at the central level. The system is being updated at the decentralized
level by 5 departments (those to which administrative functions have been decentralized),
and at the central level for the other 13—one week after the last day of school (November
30, 2013), 60% of all SACE-registered schools had already uploaded students’ final
scores. The Project also contributed to improved teacher accountability in some cases
through the TBBs. During the ICR mission, it was observed that some principals use
TBBs to post information about teacher absenteeism. Likewise, the Project purchased and
distributed 300 biometric clocks and webcams, which are being installed in the largest
public schools (including secondary schools) in the country, in addition to SEDUC
departmental offices, to monitor attendance of about 13,000 teachers and administrative
staff. Lastly, the withdrawal condition pertaining to SIARHD cleanup and post
reassignment made significant contributions to this objective.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

59. Efficiency was measured through a cost-benefit analysis and a counterfactual exercise,
based on the fact that most of the investments made by the Project were considered


                                                    16
atypical and more in line with a “fine-tuning” of the system. Internal rates of return
(IRRs) for two of the interventions were also calculated to complement the analysis.

60. The Project yielded significant economic benefits from investments made in coverage
(defined as pre-primary interventions to open and make operational CCEPREBs in
disadvantaged communities), quality (defined as training interventions for PROHECO
multi-grade teachers and the provision of texts and teaching guides in the social and
natural sciences for all PROHECO students), and institutional strengthening (defined as
investments for creation of the SACE, improvement of the National Statistics Information
System [SINIEH], strengthening of SIARHD, all of which include purchase of equipment
and significant training). Investments in coverage (US$2.5 million), based on
assumptions of future earnings per extra year of schooling, yield a total net benefit of
$21.7 million, or $8,055 per CCEPREB per year. Investments in quality (US$3 million),
based on the same assumption of increased lifetime earnings per additional year of
schooling, yield a total return of US$5.2 million. The IRRs for these two investments
were 15% and 5%, respectively. The IRR for the quality intervention is, however, a
minimum threshold (see Annex 3).

61. A counterfactual exercise was used to measure the efficiency gains of investments in
institutional strengthening. The PAD concluded that efficiency savings of US$0.8 million
per year for a period of ten years, would justify an investment of US$5.5 million in
institutional strengthening. The savings alone resulting from improvements and cleanup
of the SIARHD are in the order of US$20 million, with a total investment in institutional
strengthening of US$4.7 million.

62. The Project also achieved efficiency gains by leveraging its own resources with those
from other donors (most notably German Cooperation), avoiding overlap and ensuring
the future sustainability of investments. One example is the School Infrastructure Census,
whose total cost was US$3.3 million, of which the Project contributed 41%. The Census
has provided an instrument for prioritizing future infrastructure investments of around
$60 million from different donors.

63. Project administration costs (Component 4) increased to US$2.96 million (or 18% of
total Project costs) from US$0.68 million estimated at appraisal. This diverted funds from
other components, thus impacting efficiency, but was necessary to sustain an extended
PMU. Failure to create the new (and larger) PMU would have likely led to additional
challenges and delays, since prior to Effectiveness, the ECU was already lagging behind
on implementation of ongoing EFA-financed projects for which it was also responsible.
Although administration costs rose significantly, they are in line with costs incurred by
previous Bank-financed Projects in Honduras’ education sector: a) US$3.2 million for the
Community-Based Education Project (P007397) or 6% of Project costs; and b) US$6.98
million for the Basic Education Project (P007399) or 13% of Project costs (high costs
incurred by the latter were the result of emergency efforts after Hurricane Mitch, but the
appraisal estimate was US$2.1 million, which was considered at the ICR stage a severe
underestimation, even in the absence of emergency efforts).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64. Relevance is Substantial (Objectives are Substantial, Design is Substantial and
Implementation is Substantial); Achievement of Objectives is also rated Substantial
(High for Coverage, Modest for Quality, Substantial for Accountability, and Substantial
for Governance); and the Efficiency rating is Substantial. The Overall Outcome Rating
is therefore Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
65. Poverty impact. The Project focused on students in disadvantaged communities,
particularly indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities who have a history of economic
and social marginalization. The Project also led to job creation through the creation of
new CCEPREBs, which were staffed by a volunteer teacher from nearby communities.

66. Gender impact. The Project made it a point to ensure that female beneficiaries were
equally represented in Project activities. Though systematic data on volunteer teachers
was not collected, anecdotal evidence suggests that many are young women who were
previously unemployed.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67. The Project made significant inroads into strengthening capacity and governance in
SEDUC. Many SEDUC staff received training, including those working in line units in
charge of M&E, Info-technology, Planning, Modernization, Transparency, and Statistics,
among others. The Project also financed digitalization and decentralization efforts within
SEDUC. The Infotechnology unit was institutionalized, and its functions expanded to
M&E, data collection, and management of the SIARHD, whereas it was previously only
assigned to the latter duty. The Minister, who strongly supports the Project and its
underlying objectives, has retained 20 out of the 48 Project consultants, working on
different initiatives such as SACE, SIARHD administration, the Master Plan of School
Infrastructure, and an advisor on IBE and other issues in the Minister’s Office.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

68. Two surveys were administered in November 2013 by the PROHECO Unit of
SEDUC to assess the benefits of multigrade PROHECO teacher training administered
under the Project, and whether this training had any impact on education quality. One
survey was administered to the parents of PROHECO students, and another to
PROHECO teachers who were trained with Project funds. Both surveys were
administered to teachers and parents in 13 out of 18 Departments and a total of 470
teachers and 947 parents responded to the survey.


                                           18
69. The majority of multigrade PROHECO teachers, or 64%, rated their training as
Excellent; another 21% rated it as Very Good. As a result of their training, 92% of
teachers reported a positive impact on their teaching techniques, and 89% noticed a
positive change in students’ academic performance as a result of these techniques. IBE
PROHECO teachers represented a minority of respondents, as only 8% of respondents
claimed to teach in classrooms comprising students of multiple ethnicities. Out of the
respondents who rated their training in IBE pedagogy (38 total), 25 rated their training as
Excellent. All 38 noticed improvements in their teaching techniques and in student
performance as a result of their training.

70. About 64% of parents of children in multi-grade PROHECO schools reported that
their children have had the same teacher for more than one year, about 2.5 years on
average. Most parents (90%) were aware that teachers had recently received some form
of training. Almost 100% of parents noticed improvements in the quality of their
children’s education in the past year, improvements in their children’s attitudes toward
school, and improvements in their children’s academic performance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

71. The risk to development outcomes is Significant in the aftermath of the 2009
political crisis. Sustainability of accountability and governance outcomes in particular
requires political and financial commitments down the line, and these continue to face
opposition from the teacher unions. The sector remains dependent on external funds to
sustain all outcomes, including coverage and quality improvements, although all donors
in the sector have aligned their interventions along similar priorities consistent with EFA
goals and Project interventions. Capacity building within SEDUC for strategic planning
and M&E, plus the streamlining and cleanup of information systems (financed by the
Project), along with increased accountability to citizens, has already led to efficiency
gains; some resources have already been reallocated toward hiring technical consultants
as permanent staff to ensure that progress in integrating and maintaining information
systems is sustained, and also toward the payment of CCEPREB volunteers to sustain
increased pre-primary coverage. Some design elements were institutionalized through the
New Fundamental Law of Education and changes within SEDUC (creation of the
Infotechnology Unit, THRU, and the Directorate of Intercultural Multilingual Education,
and strengthening of the M&E, Planning, Statistics, and other units).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

72. The Bank incorporated lessons from previous projects into the design, ensuring that
Project objectives were in line with GoH and Bank priorities and activities coordinated
with other donors in the sector. However, there were significant shortcomings.



                                            19
Component costs were not properly estimated, specifically the Project Administration
component, which was significantly underestimated; on the other hand, capacity for
implementation was overestimated. Similarly, the Results Framework was inadequate to
measure achievement of outcomes. Although the withdrawal conditions helped to achieve
some Project outcomes, their potential impact on Project implementation was not
carefully thought out. The inclusion of withdrawal conditions in a Specific Investment
Loan (SIL) was more akin to the type of prior actions in a DPL.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

73. The Bank worked closely with the GoH and PMU to ensure continuity in
implementation through the political crisis, SEDUC turnover, and other delays. The Bank
was proactive in incorporating critical steps related to the withdrawal conditions into the
design of two DPLs. The Bank restructured the Project twice, which enabled the
achievement of Project objectives within the designated timeframe, stronger alignment
with GoH objectives, and disbursement of nearly half of the Credit funds in the final year.
There were frequent supervision missions and provision of training to the PMU on
fiduciary procedures. TTLs were supportive to the PMU, and a locally based TTL since
2011 facilitated supervision and communication. Minor shortcomings were related to: (i)
oversight of fiduciary matters, though these were identified and rectified once detected;
(ii) missed earlier opportunities to modify the results matrix.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74. Quality at Entry was Moderately Unsatisfactory, and Quality of Supervision was
Satisfactory. Since the Overall Outcome Rating is Moderately Satisfactory, Overall Bank
Performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75. The GoH was supportive of the Project and provided counterpart funds ($1.23
million) in excess of the originally agreed amount ($1.03 million). It satisfactorily met
the withdrawal conditions, which had a strong impact on Project outcomes. On the other
hand, there were moderate shortcomings, since delays in satisfying the withdrawal
conditions and other legal covenants (as revised in the restructuring papers) caused delays
in Project implementation, as funding for several components was tied to the conditions.
In addition, there was a 10-month delay in Project Effectiveness.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                            20
76. The PMU successfully brought the Project to completion in spite of numerous delays
beyond its control. It was staffed through a competitive process, and the core team
remained in place until late-2012. The PMU successfully coordinated implementation
through 18 SEDUC line units, many of which had limited capacity and a high degree of
turnover. In the last year of the Project, the PMU was able to manage implementation of
activities corresponding to 50% of Credit funds. There were moderate shortcomings in
the PMU’s performance, mostly related to fiduciary matters, which were resolved
satisfactorily in coordination with the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77. Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory, and the Implementing
Agency’s performance Moderately Satisfactory. Since the Overall Outcome Rating is
Moderately Satisfactory, Overall Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

78. Withdrawal conditions with no direct link to Project activities or outputs should be
avoided in SIL projects. Policy-related conditions are better suited to a complementary
DPL operation, even if they can contribute to positive outcomes under SIL projects.

79. More frequent training on fiduciary procedures is needed for PMU staff in countries
with known capacity constraints, such as Honduras. Project design should consider these
when allocating funds to Project administration, and explore alternatives for more
efficient administration. Trainings should not be limited to PMU staff, and should also
include line unit staff, with yearly refresher courses in light of high turnover. Training
should also include planning and budgeting.

80. Complicated projects with associated high risks require intense supervision, ideally
through a locally-based TTL. Similarly, project design in these contexts should remain
simple and focused, with fewer activities that are more clearly tied to fewer and narrower
objectives and outcomes.

81. Donor coordination as seen in this Project is highly beneficial to donors and
beneficiaries alike. The potential return of Project funds is leveraged through
coordination, and activities can be taken to scale to encompass more beneficiaries.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Enhancing and Scaling Up Interventions that Address the Needs of
the Poor

Activities under Component 1 were designed to contribute toward improved coverage
and quality of basic education. Sub-Component 1.1 (Coverage expansion for preschool
education in rural areas) focused on coverage; Sub-Component 1.2 (Quality
improvement in multi-grade PROHECO schools through teacher training and provision
of materials) focused on quality.

Activities carried out under Sub-Component 1.1 emphasized the expansion of preschool
education in rural areas. The main activities financed under this Sub-Component
included: i) technical assistance for the evaluation, adjustment, and validation of
pedagogical materials for pre-primary education; ii) technical assistance for the
identification of areas where to open CCEPREBs; iii) the opening of a total of 946
CCEPREBs, out of which 781 remain open, and have been fully equipped with furniture,
instructional material, and school supplies; iv) the training of 1,179 volunteer teachers in
the use of pedagogical materials, 292 of which were also trained in IBE techniques. In
addition to that, the Project paid for stipends for every volunteer teacher that started
working on any of Project-funded CCEPREBs; the GoH took responsibility for volunteer
stipends thereafter. The Project also purchased the same instructional materials for all
pre-primary classes in PROHECO schools around the country. Several capacity building
activities were also built into this component, namely for the Pre-Primary Unit of
SEDUC, and 3 consultants were hired to assist with implementation and supervision. The
only activity that was not carried out was an impact evaluation of this intervention. A
detailed list of outputs is in Table A2.1.

Activities carried out under Sub-component 1.2 emphasized quality improvement in
multi-grade PROHECO schools through teacher training and provision of materials,
seeking to replicate successful experiences from other multi-grade models in the region.
Specifically, this Sub-component financed teacher training for 3,711 PROHECO teachers
with pre-validated (also with funding from the Project) methodologies and didactic
materials, both for PROHECO and IBE-PROHECO schools, in addition to the purchase
and distribution of 263,680 texts in the Social and Natural Sciences for students and the
64,512 accompanying teacher guides in all PROHECO schools. Coordination with the
activities in Sub-Component 1.1 was achieved through the distribution of pre-primary
pedagogical materials to all PROHECO pre-schools, benefitting the full range of students
in these schools. The only activity that was not carried out under this Sub-component was
an impact evaluation of the intervention. However, this component did undertake a 2008
baseline study of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) where PROHECO and
non-PROHECO schools were assessed in comparative perspective

Intermediate indicators (1 through 4) were designed to measure the progress of activities
related to these Sub-components. A fifth IRI measured the number of beneficiaries of
Component 1, and specifically tracked the percentage of female beneficiaries.



                                            24
Component 2: Community Participation in School Management

Activities under Component 2 were designed to improve the quality of education by
fostering community participation within an integrated school management system. The
Component was affected by one of the withdrawal conditions and saw no activity until
the 2012 restructuring, when the scope of activities was reduced. Sub-component 2.1
(Consolidation and Institutionalization of the School Management System) focused on
developing an Integrated School Management System through the consolidation of
school management rules and the strengthening of school management modalities like
PROHECO schools and Rural School Networks (RSNs). Sub-Component 2.2 (School
Planning and Resources for Quality Education) aimed to strengthen school planning
capacity and resource allocation for quality education. Sub-Component 2.3 (School
Management and Education Performance Monitoring and Evaluation) focused on
supporting the development and implementation of a participatory monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system for school management. A detailed list of outputs is in Table
A2.1.

Sub-component 2.1 supported activities to strengthen the PROHECO program and
support its institutionalization, including 89 workshops to inform teachers of their new
pension benefits and rights (resulting from the PROHECO-related withdrawal condition).
The PROHECO Unit within SEDUC was also supported with funding for equipment,
assistance with organizing its documentation center and record archiving system, and
training of 465 PROHECO Departmental Coordinators and Promoters both in managerial
and financial management skills. This Sub-Component also financed the printing and
distribution of 6,056 manuals on School-Based Management for AECOs, PROHECO’s
school management entities, and the distribution of 3,000 filers for handling and
preserving documents. Finally, this Sub-Component financed the 2nd National Meeting of
Coordinators for RSNs of the decentralized branches of SEDUC and the printing of
91,450 Manuals for RSNs, 24,216 of which were distributed to schools in Honduras’
RSNs.

Sub-component 2.2 focused on integrated school planning systems based on the PEC,
training school management entities to prepare and monitor PEC outcomes, and also PER
outcomes through RSNs. This Sub-component financed a number of trainings held for
SEDUC staff in the PROHECO, PRONEEAAH, Educational Supervision and
Modernization Units: (i) on school management and reporting, especially in RSNs,
PROHECO schools and schools in IBE areas; (ii) on the preparation and use of PECs and
PERs in in RSNs, some of which also include PROHECO and IBE schools; (iii) on the
elaboration of school institutional prognoses for educational supervision; and (iv) on the
implementation of the new IBE strategy and educational model for schools in IBE areas.
This Sub-Component also financed a series of consultants in these four units, who helped
support critical areas in school planning, school-based management for improved quality,
M&E and school supervision.




                                           25
Sub-component 2.3 supported the following activities aimed at strengthening school
management and enhancing education performance through M&E and formation in
values: (i) the printing and distribution of 4,800 copies of the 2011 Law for the
Strengthening of Public Education and Community Participation; (ii) the training of
1,845 members of the COMDEs in school management and M&E of schools at the
municipal level; (iii) the training of 99 people working in RSNs on the strategy for
implementing the new Integrated M&E System for RSNs; and (iv) the printing and
distribution of 288,864 “Strengthening the Education of Values at School” books for
students and teachers in grades Pre-K through 4. This Sub-Component also financed a
few technical consultancies related to the Reconciliation and Dignifying of the Honduran
Education Program (REEDUCAH).

Component 3: Governance and Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of
Education

Activities under Component 3 were focused on institutional strengthening, namely on
increased institutional capacity within SEDUC for information gathering, processing, and
analysis for improved decision making and educational planning. Sub-component 3.1
(Information for improved performance and greater accountability) was affected by one
of the withdrawal conditions—as such, funds were not available for activities in this Sub-
component until end-March 2011. The scope of this Component was increased in the
2012 restructuring, however, during which several new activities, in line with SEDUC’s
new stated priorities, were added. Sub-component 3.2 (National system of assessment of
learning outcomes) would complement information gathering efforts by promoting
participation in international standardized learning assessments, and strengthening
SEDUC’s capacity to use the results as another input for planning purposes and decision
making. Sub-component 3.3 (Human resource management and evaluation) would
support the design, modification, and implementation of critical HRM processes and
procedures for a more efficient and transparent HRM system for teachers. A detailed list
of outputs is in Table A2.1.

Sub-component 3.1 activities focused on building capacity within the Infotechnology
Unit of SEDUC, both at the central and departmental levels, and building a web-based
platform (the SACE) to monitor performance of the system and improve decision-making
at all levels. To this end, the Project financed the acquisition of hardware, software,
licenses, equipment, air conditioners and power plants, technical assistance, and training
to improve and articulate a new information organizational structure. Several consultants
were hired to support increased activity of the Infotechnology Unit, several of which have
been retained by the Ministry as staff. The Unit was strengthened, with new
responsibilities pertaining to oversight and maintenance of all information systems, and
later incorporated into a new unit, the Honduras Information System for the Education
Sector (Sistema Nacional de Información Educativa de Honduras or USINIEH). The
SACE is being constantly updated and some of its core modules, one of which is the
revamped SIARHD system, have already been decentralized to 5 Departments
representing 30% of the teacher payroll.




                                           26
Activities were also focused on upgrading and strengthening the Statistics Unit of
SEDUC to develop a system of reliable educational statistics. The Project provided
funding for technical assistance for data collection, automation and analysis to both the
Statistics Unit of the Planning and Management Evaluation Unit (Unidad de Planeación
y Evaluación de la Gestión or UPEG) and the mini-unit especially created within the
UPEG for handling the bulk of the processing of statistics within SEDUC, the Program
for the Modernization of Educational Statistics (Programa de Modernización de la
Estadística Educativa de la Secretaría de Educación or PROMEESE). Support from
Project funds also came in the form of provision of computer equipment and furniture at
the central and departmental levels, and training for staff at all levels. Historical
education data was checked for consistency, re-estimated for precision, and loaded into
the system, including a diagnostic census of all schools located in Afro-Honduran and
Indigenous areas. The system is also generating information at the school level including
the number of school days, student performance, and student absenteeism. In addition to
strengthening capacity for gathering data, the Project financed technical assistance and
capacity building for UPEG staff to utilize educational data for educational planning both
at the central and departmental levels.

This Sub-component also financed the deployment of 6,308 TBBs in 12 departments, as
well as technical assistance and training to the Transparency and Human Rights Unit of
SEDUC. This included technical assistance for the deployment and supervision of TBBs,
for the development of a grievance redress mechanism, and for redesigning the Unit’s
web portal. It also funded data collection for the database on school infrastructure
(School Infrastructure Census) which underlies the Master Plan of Infrastructure,
including training for students who would gather the data, purchase of equipment (boots,
GPS, etc.) needed to carry out the census, and technical assistance to SEDUC through
several consultancies, in addition to equipping its Department of School Construction and
Facilities with computers. The Master Plan database has also been streamlined with the
SACE.

Sub-component 3.2 financed Honduras’ first ever participation in the TIMMS and PIRLS
international student learning assessments, and trained staff to pilot the TERCE
assessment, which was finally held after Project closure (end-October 2013). It also
supported activities like technical assistance and training for DIGECE staff (about 450
DIGECE and other relevant staff trained) to use the results of learning assessments to
monitor system performance and establish a feedback mechanism to influence decision
making in SEDUC. DIGECE staff were also trained in specific instruments for measuring
the time spent on tasks by teachers (Stallings method), and on building the teacher
assessment that was undertaken after Project closure (mid-July 2013).

As part of its efforts to promote increased governance, Sub-component 3.3 financed the
update and strengthening of the SIARHD (in parallel to progress achieved by satisfying
one of the withdrawal conditions to clean up the SIARHD based on the results of the
teacher census and post audit). This included technical support for the restructuring of
organizational responsibilities relating to HRM in general (at the central and
departmental levels) and the update of the SIARHD, training for SEDUC staff, updates of



                                           27
teacher personnel files, and streamlining of the SIARHD with the SIAFI. The SIARHD is
also linked to other information systems like the SACE. In order to track teacher
attendance, the Project also funded the purchase of 300 biometric clocks, to be installed
in the largest public schools in Honduras, where teacher absenteeism was most difficult
to monitor in a consistent way.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This Annex includes an Economic and Financial Analysis (EFA) for the Project. The
methodology for this EFA fully draws upon Section 3 of the Project’s PAD’s EFA, where
only Components 1 and 3 were assessed 12. The analysis is of a cost-benefit type and takes
all the assumptions at appraisal as given.

1. Evaluation of the Economic Gains of Component 1


       1.1 Intervention to increase coverage at the pre-primary level

The PAD’s EFA calculated that if this intervention could raise educational attainment of
each child by one year, the expected average lifetime earnings of the child could be
increased between US$2,000 and US$2,300 13. With Project funding, a total of 946 new
pre-primary community-based schools were opened, out of which 781 remain as of
Project closure. As a result of this investment, an estimated 21,558 new children
benefitted anywhere from 1 extra year of schooling (12,126 of them) to 3 extra years of
schooling (654 of them). This meant an aggregate total benefit in the amount of US$25.3
million of expected average increase in lifetime earnings, as seen in Table A3.1 14.

The aforementioned economic benefit needs to be compared against the total investment
made for the purposes of increasing coverage. The costs incurred by the Project for the
creation of CCEPREBs were $2.5 million, which includes $1.0 million for the payment
of stipends to non-certified volunteer teachers, $1.1 million in goods (furniture,
instructional material and equipment for teachers and students, and school supplies), $0.3
million for teacher training, and $0.1 million for institutional strengthening. As a result,
the net benefit of this particular investment was in the order of $27.1 million, which
is a substantial benefit. If we divide this net benefit by the number of years of the
Project, we obtain an annual benefit of $4.3 million. Dividing this amount by the number
of average CCEPREBs (funded by the Project) in operation per year of the Project (540),
the net benefit per CCEPREB is roughly $8,055 per year 15. Investment in CCEPREBs
was therefore a high-return investment to address the needs of the poor. A calculation of
the internal rate of return (IRR) of this particular investment shows a 15% IRR for this
intervention, well above the traditional 8% that usually justifies investment of this kind 16.

   The assumption is that all children that got schooled prior to the kindergarten year also continued into kindergarten
benefitting from, at least, two extra years of schooling. A detailed analysis of the income stream derived for each age
cohort is available upon request.
15
   According to statistics by SEDUC’s Department of Pre-Primary Education, the annual cost per CCEPREB is about
$1,795.

   The IRR calculation was not included in this Annex. However, it is available upon request by any interested reader.

Note: This analysis assumes that all new 3-year-olds complete a full pre-primary education, therefore benefiting from 3 extra
years of education. Similarly, all new 4-year-olds benefit from two full years of pre-primary education, therefore benefitting
from 2 extra years of education.



1.2 Intervention to increase quality of PROHECO schools through multi-grade
    teacher training

The Project’s core intervention to increase the quality of basic education in Honduras was
through targeting rural, and presumably the poorest, schools. Most of these schools are
part of the PROHECO Program that was initiated back in 1999 with funding from a
previous Bank Project; the majority of these are multi-grade teaching schools, either with
one or two teachers 17 . As of 2007, there were roughly 23,000 1st-grade PROHECO
students in multi-grade schools, with a probability of about 45% of primary school
completion. The Project’s intervention attempted to ensure that more children could
complete primary education through the higher quality of their teachers. The PAD’s
Economic and Financial Analysis estimated that the increase in average lifetime earnings
of rural students with 6 years of education (primary school graduates) over those with
only 5 years of education is Lp.25,326 (or approximately US$1,242) 18.

Table A.3.2 provides a similar analysis to the one undertaken to determine the value
added by the investment in CCEPREBs. In this case, however, “increases in the quality
of education” are measured through the extra year of education obtained by those
students that, in terms of the survival rate in 2007, would not have been expected to
graduate from 6th grade had the Project not intervened. The net number of students that
were “retrieved” by the intervention was 6,592. The benefit of this intervention is


17
   As of 2013, 94% of PROHECO schools have multi-grade classes, 86% of PROHECO teachers are multi-grade
teachers, and 85% of the total enrollment at PROHECO schools is in multi-grade classes.

valued at $8.2 million for the entire Project 19, compared to a total investment for
PROHECO multi-grade schools of $3 million ($2.4 million in textbooks and $0.6
million in teacher training), yielding a total net benefit of $5.2 million, or $1.0
million per year. Again, the benefit of this investment is significant, though it is
important to note that no civil works were undertaken, i.e. CCEPREB facilities were
usually donated buildings or rooms. As a result, this cost is not being factored into the
analysis.

* The "proxy" survival rate is calculated as the number of 6th graders that finished a given year divided
by the number of 1st graders that started that same year. Due to unavailability of information on initial
enrollment for the years involved, the "proxy" survival rate is calculated as the number of 6th graders that
finished a given year divided by the number of 1st graders that finished that same year.


An IRR analysis of this intervention on quality was also undertaken. The dimension of
quality that was analyzed was, again, that of primary school completion or graduation,
compared to the alternative of dropping out of primary school in 5th grade. In other words,
the analysis estimates only the benefit to those students who obtained one extra year of
education and implicitly assumes that this is the last year of education the individual will
complete. Although we know that a certain number of PROHECO students will move on
to lower secondary education, there are no reliable statistics showing the path of
PROHECO students after primary. As such, the IRR for this intervention is certainly a
“floor IRR,” or the minimum threshold.




19
  Note that school year 2013 is not incorporated into the analysis due to the lack of information on final enrollment as
of the date of this ICR.




                                                          34
The IRR for this investment alone was 5%, which is much lower than for the pre-school
coverage intervention. However, it is worth noting again that, compared to the analysis of
increased coverage, this IRR analysis only takes into account the benefits for the
estimated number of PROHECO students that finished 6th grade (completed primary
education), presumably due to the Project’s intervention. Students from grades 1 through
5 in PROHECO schools have benefitted as well, of course, and this could presumably be
one of the causes of the higher increase in survival rates in PROHECO schools,
compared to other types of primary schools.

2. Evaluation of the Economic Gains of Component 3

This analysis also draws upon the assumptions made in the PAD’s EFA. That analysis
came to the conclusion that investments geared toward improving the governance
features of the system (e.g. through improvements in the SIARHD) would be justified if
it could generate $0.8 million in savings annually for 10 years, under a projected $5.5
million investment in institutional strengthening 20.

The Project spent a total of $4.7 million on significant improvements to SEDUC’s EMIS,
among which were $4.0 million in equipment, training, intensive data collection and
institutional strengthening of the newly created National Statistical Information System
for Honduras’ Education (SINIEH), that integrated all previous information systems
within SEDUC. Of particular interest is the case of the investments made in the SIARDH,
which accounted for an extra $0.4 million earmarked for improving the validity and
integrity features of the payroll system.

These investments were delayed until the start of the third year of the Project, due to the
lack of fulfillment of one of the loan’s withdrawal conditions. Still, in the very last year
of the Project, the enhanced payroll system granted savings in the amount of $20 million
due to the elimination of ghost teachers and the cancellation of teacher bonus payments
that had been customarily paid on unfounded bases (e.g. the extra pay for teachers
working in schools that are located within 10 kilometers of the national border). These
savings are not temporary, but permanent savings, since the “extras” were eliminated for
good. Since only $0.8 million in annual savings would have been sufficient to justify
the investment, the economic benefit of this particular intervention was high and,
therefore, justified.




20
   Note that the Project’s PAD’s EFA utilized a total investment in Component 3’s governance interventions (Sub-
Components 3.1 and 3.3) which was a bit higher ($5.5 million) than the one finally established as the final forecast in
the PAD ($4.8 million). See Table A9.6 on p.89 versus Table 2 on p.57.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Two surveys were administered in November 2013 by the PROHECO Unit of SEDUC to
assess the benefits of multigrade PROHECO teacher training administered under the
Project, and whether this training had any noticeable impact, from the point of view of
beneficiaries, on education quality at multigrade PROHECO schools. One survey was
administered to the parents of PROHECO students, and another to PROHECO teachers
who were trained with Project funds. Survey questionnaires (translated) are below.

PROHECO teacher survey:

The PROHECO teacher survey was administered to teachers in 13 out of 18 Departments
including Colon, Comayagua, Copan, Cortes, El Paraiso, Francisco Morazan, Intibuca,
Islas de la Bahia, La Paz, Lempira, Olancho, Santa Barbara, and Valle. A total of 470
teachers responded to the survey.

Respondent profile for PROHECO teachers:

The average age of respondents is 29 years, and 67 percent is female. In terms of
education, 67 percent of respondents attended university or received teacher certification
at “Normal” schools. Less than one percent did not complete secondary school. The
majority of teachers began teaching in PROHECO schools within the last two years
(since 2011). Multigrade teachers (which were the overwhelming majority of those
surveyed), on average, teach four different classes (grades), though there is wide
variation by Department; in El Paraiso, for example, most teachers teach an average of 6
classes (in other words, all grades, since PROHECO schools only comprise 1st - 6th
grades). The average number of students per teacher of the total surveyed is 22.

Survey results:

Most multigrade PROHECO teachers received training in multigrade pedagody and
techniques in 2012. The majority was satisfied with their level of training: 64 percent
rated their training as Excellent and another 21 percent rated their training as Very Good.

As a result of their training, 92 percent of teachers reported a positive impact on their
teaching techniques, and 89 percent have noticed a positive change in students’ academic
performance as a result of these techniques.

IBE PROHECO teachers represented a minority of respondents, as only 8 percent
claimed to teach in classrooms comprising students of multiple ethnicities (of those, the
minorities taught are mostly Lenca). Those who received training in IBE pedagogy did so
mostly in 2011 and 2012. Out of the respondents who rated their training in IBE
pedagogy (38 total), 25 rated their training as Excellent. All 38 noticed improvements in
their teaching techniques and in student performance as a result of their training.

Parents’ survey:


                                            38
The survey for parents of PROHECO students was administered in 13 out of 18
Departments including Colon, Comayagua, Copan, Cortes, El Paraiso, Francisco
Morazan, Intibuca, Islas de la Bahia, La Paz, Lempira, Olancho, Santa Barbara, and Valle.
A total of 947 parents responded to the survey.

Respondent profile:

About two thirds of respondents, about 64 percent, were mothers (females). In terms of
education, about 53 percent of all respondents did not complete primary school, another
38 percent completed only primary school, and less than 1 percent obtained a university
degree or higher. The survey did not, however, ask about parent’s literacy. The majority
of respondents, or 96 percent, are parents of children in multigrade PROHECO classes,
and only 19 percent of respondents have children in IBE PROHECO schools (another 7
percent was unsure if their child’s school is IBE or not).

Survey results:

Most parents surveyed have children in multi-grade PROHECO schools, and about 64
percent reported that their children have had the same teacher for more than one year, or
about 2.5 years on average. Since only 15 percent reported that their children had
repeated a grade in school (of those, most repeated the 1st grade), having the same teacher
was due to their attendance in multigrade schools. This would also imply that any
observable changes in student or teacher performance could be the result of training
imparted on the teacher and the purchase of new texts for students, all else being equal.

The majority of parents (90 percent) were aware that teachers had recently received some
form of teacher training. Almost 100 percent of parents noticed improvements in the
quality of their children’s education in the past year, improvements in their children’s
attitudes toward school, and improvements in their children’s academic performance.

1. Introduction

This report summarizes the main activities financed by the Education Quality,
Governance and Institutional Strengthening Project, Loan number 4381-HO as per the
terms of the Financing Agreement signed on July 2nd, 2008, between the International
Development Association (IDA) and the Government of the Republic of Honduras in the
amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 9.8 million (equivalent to US$15.37 million).
Upon Project restructuring on June 29, 2013, the loan amount was modified to US$14.84
million, due to variations in the exchange rate between USD and SDR.

   1.1. Background

The Project was approved on January 24, 2008, and became effective on November 14,
2008. It was restructured twice: first on March 22, 2011, and a second bank-approved
restructuring took place on June 29, 2012. In 2008, the Ministry of Education
commenced implementation of the Education Quality, Governance and Institutional
Strengthening Project, which would contribute to higher level goals as spelled out in (i)
Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS); (ii) Education for All in Honduras 2003-
2015; and (iii) the Strategic Sectorial Education Plan 2005-15.

The Project had four components: i) enhancing and scaling up interventions that address
the needs of the poor; ii) community participation in school management; iii) governance
and institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education; and iv) project
administration.

   1.2. Implementing Agency

The Project was technically implemented through a Steering Committee (SC), line units
within the SEDUC (two vice ministers and advisors), and one Project Management Unit
(PMU) in charge of managing Project funds. The SC was the highest authority for
strategic coordination and Project monitoring, and line units were responsible for technical
and administrative implementation details. The PMU was in charge of managing Project
funds, both externally and domestically financed.

2. Project Development Objectives

The objective of the project was to support the Government of Honduras to increase the
coverage, quality, accountability, and governance of its basic education system.
Specifically, the Project Development Objectives were: (i) expand pre-school coverage in
disadvantaged communities; (ii) improve completion rates in PROHECO schools; (iii)
improve teacher accountability; and (iv) improve accountability of schools to citizens.

3. From Design to Implementation




                                            45
In order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, the Project had the following
components: (i) Enhancing and scaling up interventions that address the needs of the
poor; (ii) Community participation in school management; (iii) Governance and
institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education; and (iv) Project administration.

   3.1. Project Components

       3.1.1. Component 1. Enhancing and scaling up interventions that address
            the needs of the poor

This component supported interventions at the pre-primary and basic levels, focused on
the poorest segments of the population where Programa Hondureño de Educación
Comunitaria (PROHECO) schools are concentrated.

This component included the following sub-components:
       1. Expanding coverage for the preschool level in rural areas
       2. Improving quality in PROHECO multi-grade schools through teacher training
          and provision of materials.

       3.1.2. Component 2: Community participation in school management

The objective of this component was to promote community participation in school
management to improve the quality of education. Community participation would
provide a feedback mechanism for information about community needs: parents and
other community members would complement teachers’ inputs. To achieve this objective,
the Project supported the following three sub-components:

   1. Consolidation and institutionalization of the school management system
   2. School planning and resources for quality education
   3. School management and education performance monitoring and evaluation

       3.1.3. Component 3: Governance and institutional strengthening of SEDUC

The objective of this component was to support the GoH initiative to strengthen
institutional capacity within SEDUC to improve governance and to produce data that
would enable social monitoring of the education sector.

This component included the following sub-components:

   1. Information for improved performance and greater accountability
   2. National system of assessment of learning outcomes
   3. Human resource management and evaluation

       3.1.4. Component 4: Project Administration




                                           46
The Project was originally structured in the following way: one Coordinator, one
Procurement Specialist, one Financial Management Specialist, one Monitoring and
Evaluation Specialist, and Assistants for Procurement and Financial Management.

When the Project was restructured, however, a Project Management Unit was created
specifically for the Project to manage all fiduciary and administrative matters, in lieu of a
Coordination Unit within the Education for All initiative. This mechanism was proposed
by the Government, and was satisfactory to the Bank from both technical and fiduciary
standpoints.

      3.2. Areas of Support / Line Units

Several Line Units within the Ministry of Education were directly involved in the
achievement of Project Development Objectives and the implementation of project
activities as defined in yearly POAs. The following Line Units were involved in the
Project:

 Operating within the context of yearly POAs for the Ministry of Education, for the
 Education Quality, Governance and Institutional Strengthening Project, and for other
 donors, Line Units were responsible for defining their own needs and designing action
 plans to achieve strategic institutional goals. As such, they assessed, approved,
 supervised and controlled the implementation of activities for their corresponding
 subcomponents. They also met periodically with the PMU to make adjustments or
 modifications as needed.

 Line Units within the Ministry of Education were in charge of implementing each
 component and their respective subcomponents as defined in yearly POAs.

 4. Measuring Results

 The Project originally included 6 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) linked to Project
 Development Objectives and 16 intermediate results indicators. Changes to the Results
 Framework resulted in 4 KPIs linked to Project Development Objectives and 14
 intermediate results indicators. In addition to these changes, targets were modified for
 some indicators, owing to progress achieved by the Project at the time of restructuring
 (June 29, 2012).

 The World Bank’s Country Office in Honduras was in charge of monitoring Project
 outcomes based on information from yearly POAs, Quarterly Reports, and annual
 Financial Statements from the Project.

     4.1. Results Indicators

 The Project’s success was measured through the following Key Performance Indicators,
 linked to Project Development Outcomes:

5. Financial Results

Based on the financial restructuring approved on June 29, 2012, a total of US$15.07
million, out of a US$15.01 million IDA credit (based on the current exchange rate
between SDR and USD at the time of restructuring), were disbursed between September
2008 and October 31, 2013. This represents 100.41 percent of all Project funds. Another
US$1.21 million in national counterpart funds were disbursed for the Project, out of US
$1.25 million committed, or 96.64 percent.

6. Assessment of Project Outcomes




                                                53
The Government of Honduras, through the Ministry of Education, was able to reach the
following objectives through implementation of the Project: (i) expanded preschool
coverage in disadvantaged communities to 67 percent; improved 6th grade gross
completion rates in PROHECO schools to 98 percent; (iii) improved teacher
accountability, whereby 59.56 percent of schools are reporting teacher absenteeism; and
(iv) improved accountability of schools to citizens, as 21 percent of complaints are
submitted through Transparency School Boards.

   6.1. Key Factors Affecting Outcomes

Project outcomes were impacted by the interruption in Bank operations in 2009, which
resulted from the ouster of then President Manuel Zelaya on June 28, 2009.

Component 2 and one subcomponent of Component 3 were severely impacted by delays
in meeting the withdrawal conditions for these components.

Project outcomes were also impacted by the high turnover of political and technical staff
within the Ministry of Education. There were four (4) different Ministers throughout the
life of the Project and, as such, several changes in Coordination units and key positions
within Line Units, and Departmental and District Directorates in charge of implementing
Project activities. Limited institutional memory within the Ministry of Education, largely
due to mid- and high-level staff turnover, was also a factor.

7. Lessons Learned

   7.1. Regarding enhancement and scaling up of interventions that address the
        needs of the poor

• The Government of Honduras must guarantee the sustainability of Educational
  Centers (schools) while providing fair salaries for teachers, didactic materials for
  classes, and adequate supplies and installations that respond to the needs of students
  and teachers alike.
• The Ministry of Education must be more vigilant of decentralized authorities, such as
  District and Municipal Directors, the majority of whom do not support or give
  importance to alternative models of education that address the needs of so many
  children in the poorest (rural) areas of the country.
• Many educators resist change and seldom make use of the tools provided by the
  Ministry of Education: trainings, manuals, guides, didactic materials, etc. It is only
  when they are being monitored or supervised by the central level that they put new
  practices or tools to use.

   7.2. Regarding community participation in school management

• The best results are obtained by educational centers with explicit community
  commitment and direct follow up by parents.



                                           54
• Teachers at different levels perform their duties better when they know they are being
  supervised by the community (social supervision), in areas like effective school days,
  student performance, etc.
• Municipalities lacking leadership and commitment by District or Municipal Directors
  have the greatest difficulty implementing SEDUC policies, and often fall short of the
  desired results.
• Distribution of textbooks, educational materials, and uploading of information is much
  more efficient through PROHECO channels than through the SEDUC Departmental or
  District Directorates.

   7.3. Regarding governance and institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
        Education

• There is need for greater commitment from Department/District/Municipal Directors
  to strengthen the SEDUC, install transparency school boards, pursue greater teacher
  accountability, and collect and process data from educational centers. Better results are
  observed when decentralized authorities are aware of external supervision of
  educational centers.
• There is need for greater institutional memory or streamlining of technical, operational,
  and financial procedures to ensure continuity and sustainability of actions taken by
  different units of the SEDUC.
• It is necessary to conduct joint planning exercises between donors and SEDUC
  financial entities to avoid duplication of efforts in carrying out project activities and
  inefficient use of funds that may negatively affect the SEDUC’s established budget.

   7.4 Regarding Project Administration

• In light of the Project’s final administrative costs, it would be useful to analyze
  alternative administrative mechanisms that would incur lower costs while maintaining
  or even improving administrative efficiency.

8. Bank Performance

The World Bank undertook several missions during the life of the Project, usually no less
than two (2) Supervision Missions per year. In October 2010 there was an additional
Procurement Mission. Some Supervision Missions included visits to the field to monitor
activities financed by the Credit, including visits to CCEPREB, Educational Networks,
Transparency School Boards, Departmental Directorates, PROHECO educational centers,
etc.

There were two Project Team Leaders by the Project closing date who participated
directly in Project development and implementation. Several other specialists from the
World Bank shared their experiences with and provided support to the Project
Management Unit and Lines Units, thereby helping to achieve Project objectives.




                                           55
The World Bank Country Office in Honduras and its staff provided continued support by
lending their office space for meetings, videoconferences, etc.

The current Project Team Leader took over Credit 4381 in July 2011. His consequent
relocation to Honduras in August 2011 allowed for more consistent supervision of Project
activities, including frequent supervision meetings on the following topics: revisions of
budgeted activities and disbursements, overview of Project activities as outlined in POAs,
follow up on critical activities that created bottlenecks for the Project, and monitoring of
Project outcomes and targets in the Results Framework, among others.

The Bank’s overall implementation performance is evidenced by the achievement of
most Project objectives by the Project closing date.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

From KfW, which was a significant Partner with respect to Component 3 activities
related to the School Infrastructure Census:

Thanks to the good and trustful co-ordination between World Bank and KfW, under the
guidance of the Ministry of Education, the Census of School Infrastructure and Master
Plan of Infrastructure, an important planning tool for investing in school infrastructure,
was completed in 2013.

In the international donors’ education round table, MERECE, we highly appreciated the
openness of World Bank for interchanging their Project planning to improve
coordination of donors. Also we highly appreciated the contribution of World Bank to
promote a good relationship between donors and Staff of Ministry of Education including
Education Minister.
