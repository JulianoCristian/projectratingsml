The major changes and rationale are\n            as follows: 1) a waiver of the withdrawal condition\n            affecting component two (Community Participation in School\n            Management for Better Performance) insofar as the spirit\n            behind the withdrawal condition - the reinstatement of\n            pension benefits to teachers from the Honduran Program for\n            Community-based Education (Programa Hondureno de Educacion\n            Comunitaria or PROHECO) - has been met; 2) a revision of all\n            the remaining dated legal covenants (other undertakings) in\n            light of the set of administrative acts undertaken by the\n            Government to regularize the social security situation of\n            PROHECO teachers; 3) a revision to Project activities to\n            adjust them to: i) a shortened implementation period due to\n            the 2009 'pause' and delay in satisfying the\n            Project's withdrawal conditions; ii) funding from other\n            sources outside of the Project, and iii) the\n            Government's strategy; 4) a revision to the indicators\n            in the results framework and monitoring to reflect the\n            changes in Project activities; 5) a revision in Project\n            costs consistent with the revised Project activities and\n            scope; and 6) a reallocation of credit proceeds across all\n            five categories that reflect the changes in Project\n            activities and costs."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
