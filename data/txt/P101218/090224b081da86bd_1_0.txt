                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project contributed to increased coverage at the pre-primary education level in targeted areas. Net enrollment rates for the kindergarten year – which became a compulsory
                         education year since the approval of the new Fundamental Law of Education in January 2012 – went from 46.3% in 2007, when the Project was approved by the Board, to 64.6% at
                         the end of 2012. This improvement was boosted by the Project's creation of almost 800 Community-Based Centers for Pre-Primary Education (Centros Comunitarios de Educacion

                         Pre-Básica or CCEPREBs), mostly in rural and disadvantaged areas of the country. CCEPREBs were opened through the Project, with two-thirds of them being fully equipped with
                         desks, educational materials for students and teachers, and stationery for students and teachers.

                         The increase in quality at the basic education level has also been significant, especially for schools from the Honduran Program for Community-Based Education (Programa

                         Hondureño de Educación Comunitaria or PROHECO), which were the ones targeted by the Project. While only 45% of students graduated from grade 6 in 2007 in PROHECO
                         schools, a 98% graduation rate was reached by the end of 2012. The Project contributed to this improvement in graduation rates not only by ensuring training for all PROHECO
                         teachers in multi-grade classes, with special emphasis on schools within Intercultural Bilingual Education (IBE) settings, but also by delivering materials to all PROHECO schools,
                         both to teachers and students.

                         The increase in accountability of the basic education system has also been sizeable. As of the end of the Project, all schools in the country (pre-primary, primary, and secondary)
                         have been registered in the System for the Administration of Schools (Sistema de Administracion de Centros Educativos or SACE), the integrated system of education management
                         of the Ministry of Education (Secretaria de Educación or SEDUC). The SACE presents a couple of modules that are of particular interest: 1) the PROHECO module, which presents
                         information for all teachers working for this school-based management program, and detailed information on student enrollment, teacher absenteeism, and effective number of days
                         with classes; prior to the system completion all PROHECO schools had already reported information to SEDUC to populate the system. Schools can now report this information
                         electronically, and are expected to do so by the end of the ongoing 2013 school year. This will increase accountability by showcasing the potential of such a module if extended to
                         the rest of the education system (PROHECO schools are approximately 10% of the schools in the Honduran system); 2) the SIARHD module, where SIARHD stands for the System
                         for the Administration of the Teacher Payroll, and which contains complete information on the total number of teachers in the country and their characteristics; this information is being
                         used by SEDUC to increase accountability by ensuring teachers are only entered once into the system and the different teacher characteristics that inform teacher salaries are
                         accurately recorded and 3) the Plan Maestro module, a new dataset with detailed information on the conditions of each and every school in the country. This module has enabled
                         SEDUC to have a complete dataset of all schools in the country, which can be used to prioritize investments according to specific needs (e.g. rehabilitation of infrastructure, furniture,
                         etc.) The Project contributed to this achievement through the purchase of equipment (hardware and software), the financing of core capacity building activities, and the financing of
                         the surveys that took place to collect the data, especially for the Plan Maestro.

                         Finally, there was an increase in the governance of the basic education system, although it was of a smaller size compared to the improvements in the other three areas of the PDO.
                         For example, with support from the Project, many schools nationwide were able to install Transparency School Boards (Murales de Transparencia or TSBs) within their school
                         premises. In the last year, 23% of total complaints submitted to SEDUC’s Transparency Unit were channeled through TSBs compared to a 40% target.
