                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The increase in coverage at the pre-primary education level in targeted areas has been significant. Net enrollment rates for the kindergarten year – which became a compulsory
                         education year since the approval of the new Fundamental Law of Education in January 2012 – went from 46.3% in 2007, when the Project was approved by the Board, to 64.6% at
                         the end of 2012. This improvement was fostered by the Project's creation of almost 800 Community-Based Centers for Pre-Primary Education (Centros Comunitarios de Educacion

                         The increase in quality at the basic education level has also been significant, especially for schools from the Honduran Program for Community-Based Education (Programa
                         Hondureño de Educacion Comunitaria or PROHECO), which were the ones targeted by the Project. While only 45% of students graduated from grade 6 in 2007 in PROHECO

                         schools, a 98% graduation rate was reached by the end of 2012. The Project contributed to this improvement in quality not only by ensuring training for all PROHECO teachers in
                         multi-grade classes and in intercultural bilingual education (IBE) settings, but also by delivering materials to all schools, both to teachers and students.

                         The increase in accountability of the basic education system has been sizeable. As of the end of 2012, roughly 60% of all PROHECO schools in the system had already reported to
                         the Ministry of Education’s (Secretaria de Educacion or SEDUC) Statistical Division detailed information on student enrollment, teacher absenteeism, and effective number of days
                         with classes. Prior to the Project, no PROHECO school reported on any of these relevant indicators. A web platform for future reporting is under development.

                         Increase in governance has been slower than expected, but is gaining momentum. For example, a lot of progress was made in this last semester in terms of finalizing the software
                         that will help ascertain how many complaints sent to SEDUC’s Transparency Unit are made using the information in Transparency School Boards (Murales de Transparencia or
                         TSBs).
