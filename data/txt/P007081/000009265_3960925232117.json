The loan was approved by the Board of Directors on\n            October 22, 1985. The original loan closing date of June 30,\n            1988 was extended to June 30, 1989. Final disbursement was\n            made on July 12, 1988. US$1.44 million was cancelled. The\n            loan did relieve a serious foreign exchange constraint as\n            intended, but it did not accomplish most of its policy\n            conditions. Some temporary improvements in the terms of\n            trade and export incentives were achieved through: (a) a\n            reduction in quantitative restrictions and import duties for\n            industry; (b) a reduction in export taxes for agricultural\n            products; and (c) devaluation of the exchange rate. However,\n            there was little or no permanent change in agricultural policy."}, "docdt": "1991-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
