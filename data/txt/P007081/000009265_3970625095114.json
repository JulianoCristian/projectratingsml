The specific additional steps\n            supported by the loan would be to improve terms of trade of\n            agriculture relative to other sectors of the economy; remove\n            remaining support prices and subsidies; maintain positive\n            interest rates; and unify lending rates for the agricultural\n            sector. Institutional strengthening in the area of sectoral\n            policy analysis would also be supported. The proposed loan\n            would finance the general imports of agricultural inputs."}, "docdt": "1985-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
