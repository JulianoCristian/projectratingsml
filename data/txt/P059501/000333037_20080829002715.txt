1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

By improving access to technical expertise and advisory services, the project was aimed at
assisting reform-minded governments (central, state, and municipal) to design, and possibly

were those enabling the public sector to retrench from areas where the private sector is more
effective, and to expand its involvement and resources in priority social sector spending and
poverty alleviation, in particular in health and education. Facilitating private sector growth would
also be beneficial to the poor by expanding employment opportunities.

The project was designed as a credit facility, where funds are allocated to a sub-project after it has
been prepared, appraised, and approved, within the common objective of the project as stated
above.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Bank's India Country Strategy was focused on supporting reforms, in particular in states
which embark upon comprehensive restructuring programs aimed at implementing fiscal, pricing
and regulatory reforms that will put their finances on a sustainable course and establish a better
environment for private investment.        This project aimed to complement the Bank's efforts
through operations in the power sector, fiscal and public sector reforms, education, health, and
agriculture at the state level by assisting reform-minded government agencies to formulate,
design, and possibly implement selected reforms. While reforming states were expected to be the
main beneficiaries of the project, as was evidenced by the then pipeline of applications for
funding under this credit, any reform minded entity was eligible for support as well. Hence,
central and municipal agencies (through their respective state governments), engaged in similar
reforms in similar areas were also able to access this credit facility.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

By improving access to technical expertise and advisory services, the project will assist reform-
minded governments (central, state and municipal) to design, and possibly implement, selected
reforms.

Since almost all the sub-projects were appraised after Board approval, key indicators were
designed at the aggregate project level.

Key Indicators:

1.      The number of signed Participation Agreements (PAs)

2.      Utilization of funds

3.      Production of consultant reports and delivery of capacity building programs




                                                  1

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

Not Applicable.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries:
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The main beneficiaries of the project were central, state and municipal government agencies.

These included:

1.      Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, Government of India
2.      Ministry of Personnel, Government of India
3.      Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India
4.      Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India
5.      Government of Assam
6.      Government of Uttarakhand
7.      Government of Karnataka
8.      Government of Tamil Nadu

While in most of the sub-projects, the central or state government departments undertook studies
and implemented changes for better performance, the ultimate beneficiaries are the people who
would benefit through improved systems or better service delivery by the government.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1 (US$5.50 million): Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP)

This component had been appraised when the project went to the Board, but eventually did not
disburse (see below). It was aimed at supporting the following reforms in UP:

    i)      Tax Reform
    ii)     Expenditure Management
    iii)    Public Enterprise Reform
    iv)     Municipal Management and Finances
    v)      Monitoring of Poverty Impacts
    vi)     Reform in the Irrigation Department

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The project went through significant changes as most of the sub-projects identified during project
preparation did not materialize after the project became effective. It became clear within the first
year of implementation that the funds available under this facility could be more effectively
utilized if they are linked with the Bank's existing engagements and projects. For example, the
Bank was supporting a broad-based reform program in Karnataka through a DPL and the project
team identified capacity gaps and areas where TA funds were needed. This led to the preparation
of 3 sub-projects in the state, namely, introduction and implementation of Value Added Tax
(VAT); preparation of power sector reforms; and computerizing the human resource database of
state employees. The three sub-projects totaling $13 million, eventually accounted for 40% of the
total net credit proceeds.

Yet, nearly three years after the project became effective, there were uncommitted funds. Some
sub-projects were cancelled/downsized and $12 million was reallocated to post-tsunami
reconstruction effort in 2005. Component 1 of the project did not disburse any funds as the
Government of Uttar Pradesh (the main beneficiary of this component) decided to fund all
activities under this component from state government's own funds or undertake the same
reforms under other Bank or non-Bank projects. Component 2 was downsized from $3.1 million
to $0.73 million due to poor capacity and lack of will on the part of the Department to implement
the sub-project.    Further, the On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS) involving
hardware and software were funded through government budget and Project Management Centre
(PMC) was integrated with National Academy of Statistical Administration (NASA). Hence
these two activities were not eligible for funding under this sub-project

Having addressed component 1 and 2, the implementation support team took a two-pronged
approach: first, allocate the unallocated funds from component 3 and the savings from component
1 and 2 to eligible sub-projects with existing or potential linkages with Bank-financed programs
and projects; and second, ensure that sub-projects under implementation are implemented well
and are on-track to meet their developmental objectives. What followed was the preparation,
appraisal and implementation of seven more sub-projects, bringing the total number to ten and
full allocation of revised credit proceeds (after reallocation to Tsunami relief).

This Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRR) does not cover the activities funded
through the $12 million re-allocated to Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Project (TERP), as
these will be evaluated separately, as part of the ICRR for the TERP.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

This project was designed with the objective of retaining flexibility in the use of TA funds that
could be accessed by reforming entities. However, an effective implementation strategy was
missing. The task team preparing the project recognized that TA projects have had mixed results
and reasons for the same were documented as "lessons learnt" in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD).     The lessons learnt from earlier TA projects were that such projects need better



                                                   4

monitoring and financial management system; support to implementing agencies on procurement
procedures and clear up-front eligibility criteria. Further, based on an Operations Evaluation
Department's (OED's) report on TA projects, it was recognized (in the PAD) that this operation
would require intense supervision. While a Project Management Unit (PMU) was set up in DEA,
it neither had the expertise, nor the knowledge to help implementing agencies with Bank's
procurement procedures and processes.         Neither was there any effective monitoring and
evaluation system in place. The Financial Management and reporting arrangements were weak
(this has been discussed in detail in the fiduciary section of the ICRR). However, an "above
average" budget for supervision (as documented in the PAD) was a recognition of intense
supervision requirements of this project.

Another important lesson raised by the OED review of TA projects was that borrower and user
ownership should be established at appraisal. At the time of appraisal, funds had been committed
for only one sub-project (amounting to only 5% of the credit proceeds) and the fact that it took
more than four years to commit funds showed that there was a huge perception problem at both
the client's end and the Bank side. A very large number of entities who had expressed interest at
appraisal stage backed out.     The terms and conditions of borrowing this facility were not
communicated clearly to the potential borrowers as many of the interested parties did not follow
up on the sub-projects when they found out that this was not a grant facility. Further, the main
beneficiaries were those states where Bank staff were actively engaged either through investment
projects or DPL's and were able to use TA funds effectively, as discussed above, in the case of
Karnataka.

Due to reasons quoted above, namely, a PMU that lacked the required expertise; a weak financial
management system; absence of an M&E framework and lack of user ownership, this project
faced yet again the same issues that the previous TA projects in India had faced.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Implementation of this project involved a lot of work which should have been a part of project
preparation. The first four years of implementation (2001-2004) included helping the client
identify TA needs, prepare sub-projects and present them to the Bank through DEA. Given the
differences in size, timing of approval and varied nature of activities and reforms under the eleven
sub-projects, implementation was a challenge throughout the seven year project period. All sub-
projects were on different supervision cycles.

The strategy of linking these sub-projects to existing Bank engagements paid off well and had
two major advantages: first, the Bank supervision team was focused on ensuring that they are
implemented well as they complimented the larger reform program; and second, the client saw
the merit and advantage of using these funds effectively, leading to greater ownership on their
part.

The mid term review was completed in February 2004, at which time 2 sub-projects were
cancelled due to poor performance and allocations to several others reduced. Only 18% of the
credit proceeds had been disbursed thus far. In 2005, $12million was reallocated to post-tsunami
reconstruction effort.

Most implementation delays were bureaucratic in nature. In some cases procurement took much
longer than anticipated, but in the end most sub-projects completed nearly all activities that were


                                                 5

planned and achieved the desired outcome. This project was able to support a wide range of
impressive reforms that include: introduction of VAT in Karnataka, capacity building for good
governance, several e-governance initiatives in Uttarakhand, capacity building in rural roads,
procurement reform in Tamil Nadu and preparation for reforms in the power sector in Karnataka,
amongst others (Also see sections on achievement of PDOs, and post-operation results and Annex
2).

The project was at risk for a year due to financial management lags. The Bank had downgraded
the FM rating to `unsatisfactory' in December 2006, as Financial Management Reports (FMRs)
had not been received since October 2005 and several audit reports were due since September
2006. It was agreed with DEA that PMU will follow up and liaise with all participating entities
to address both the FM requirements. However, the project was upgraded and was out of risk
category only after a year in December 2007, when the FM actions were completed.

Despite the initial implementation and FM delays, these ten sub-projects were extremely useful in
building capacity; funding training activities and consultants; and strengthening institutional
capacity in some cases. These sub-projects were well implemented and closely supervised and
they all achieved their developmental objectives.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

There was no M&E framework under this project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The project design included many sub-projects pertaining to different sectors across various
central, state and municipal entities.         This in itself presented significant challenges in
coordination on various financial management issues like information on expenditure details,
disbursement position and receipt of audit reports. In such a project the role of the PMU becomes
extremely important in monitoring financial flows.             In particular, the multiplicity of
Implementing Entities and the structuring of coordination and information flow aspects by the
principal implementing entity, the DEA, reflected key weaknesses that were not addressed at the
preparation and early implementation stage of the project.

The project had problems in receiving the quarterly FMRs that reflect the component wise and
sub-project wise expenditures incurred. FMRs were the responsibility of the DEA through a
PMU formed for the purpose.           This PMU was staffed by personnel from WAPCOS, an
independent entity under the Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India, who were
contracted for the purpose. There was a long period of about 18 months during implementation
when WAPCOS was not working on this project, since their contract was not renewed by DEA.
During this period no quarterly FMRs were prepared by the PMU and the Bank did not receive
timely financial information. Further, there were weaknesses in the coordination mechanisms
between the DEA and the agencies responsible for implementing the sub-project components in
various states/central ministries.     This resulted in delayed FMRs, delayed receipt of audit
reports/audit certificates and significant variations between the expenditure figures as indicated in
the FMRs and those in the audit reports. Considerable time and effort was taken up during the
final year of the project in getting these differences examined and figures reconciled.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase



                                                   6

(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Despite the several shortcomings in project design, most of the sub-projects have achieved their
development objective and many have led to further reforms, institutional strengthening and
scaling up of pilots. At least two sub-projects have led to follow-up operations which are under
preparation. Some of them are tabulated below:

       Name of the Sub- Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
       project
1.     Implementation        of Value Added Tax has been successfully implemented in
       VAT, GoK                 Karanataka. The State has a fully functional system which has
                                been running successfully now for the last three years and has
                                enhanced the efficiency and transparency of tax collections.
2.     HR     Database      for The pilot Human Resource Management System set up under
       employees, GoK           this sub-project is already being used for monthly payments to
                                employees.
3.     Capacity Building for The Government of India is committed to implement the
       the PMGSY, GoI           PMGSY programme and providing connectivity to all
                                unconnected villages. Capacity of State road agencies has
                                improved under this subproject to implement PMGSY and
                                similar projects in the future.
4.     Use of IT for better The Government of Uttarakhand is using the platform created
       Service      Delivery, under this TA sub-project for scaling up its e-governance
       GoU                      projects under the National E-Governance Project funded by the
                                Bank.
5.     India        Statistical Following the completion of the Tier 1 ISSP components
       Strengthening            financed from this sub-project, GoI has sent a request for an
       Project, Tier I, GoI     investment lending project, which is now in active preparation,
                                with a view to being submitted to the Board in the last quarter of
                                FY08 or the first quarter FY09. Based on the GoI request the
                                project will focus on strengthening the statistical capacity of all
                                35 States and Union Territories.
6.     Computerization       of The pilot Enterprise Resource Planning implemented in the
       PWD, GoA                 Assam Public Works Department is expected to be scaled up
                                under the GoI's PMGSY Project being supported by the Bank.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

In a vast country like India, with 29 states, the development reform agenda is far from complete.
Further, there are huge inter and intra-state disparities because of which some reforms may forge
ahead while others lag behind. Under these circumstances, a project like this one, that aims to
assist reform-minded governments to design and possibly implement reforms remains valid.
Most of the reforms/activities undertaken are highly desirable.       These range from capacity
building of central and state departments, tax reform, procurement reform, and restructuring the
power sector to use of information technology for better service delivery, amongst others. Many



                                                  7

of these reforms like statistical strengthening, procurement and service delivery are an area of
concern for the Bank, and are now seen as a core component of the results agenda. It was and is
very important to assist state and project entities to build capacity in these areas. This also helped
improve the quality of Bank operations and projects.

While the objectives remain valid both in the context of the country and CAS priorities, there is
ample scope to improve both the design and implementation of TA projects of this nature. On
design, a simplified, clearly communicated process to access funds from such a facility needs to
be put in place. Identification of TA fund needs in different Bank projects and programs that are
under preparation or implementation and linking the same with such a credit facility would ensure
effective utilization of funds.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

At the outset one must mention that there was no real link between the PDOs and key indicators
at the project level. In the end this project as a whole essentially added up to what each of the
sub-projects had achieved as the broad project level indicators had no real relevance and were not
linked to outcomes. This can be explained as follows:

Key Indicators:
    1. Number of Participation Agreements (PAs) Signed: In the end, there were 11 PAs and it
        is not clear what number would have been a good indicator. One cannot say whether 5,
        15 or any other number of PAs would have led to better or worse achievement of PDOs.
    2. Utilization of Funds: On this account, the project certainly faired badly as 27% of the
        original project amount ($12 million) was re-allocated to Tsunami Relief and of the
        remaining about 93% (of the net credit proceeds) were finally utilized after an extension
        of the project by two years.
    3. Production of Consultants Reports and Delivery of Capacity Building Programs: A large
        number of technical reports were produced under the sub-projects that were implemented
        (Also see Annex 2). A number of training and other capacity building programs were
        delivered. Capacity building also took place through strengthened systems and processes
        in government departments.

Despite the shortcomings in design of the project, in the end several sub-projects have achieved
their desired objective. From 2001 to 2004, ten highly relevant, well-designed sub-projects were
prepared for implementation. Also, the project was extended by two years. With better design
and implementation strategy, perhaps the same objectives would have been achieved within the
original project period of five years rather than seven. Hence, while the issue of whether or not
this was an efficient project is debatable, the fact that eventually the PDOs were achieved remains
unquestioned and the overall outcome rating of the project is `Satisfactory'.

The following table gives a snap-shot view of the PDOs under the various sub-projects:

     Implementation    management and                        performance was unsatisfactory as

(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

It is not possible to calculate quantitative measures of efficiency for the sub-projects under this
umbrella TA credit. These eleven sub-projects ranged from a minimum value of $0.47 to a
maximum of $8.5 million.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

A total of 11 sub-projects were implemented under this project. All the sub-projects, barring one
or two, achieved their developmental objective of introducing a particular reform (VAT in
Karnataka), establishing better systems (PWD Assam), Human Resource database in Karnataka,
capacity building in Departments or Institutions (PMGSY or Good Governance). In several cases
the sub-projects have contributed to an ongoing process of reform and capacity building. Several
training programs, models and modules created under the various sub-projects are being used
either in the design of new projects or for better functioning of government departments.

                                        since become the model for implementation of e-governance
                                        projects in the state.
5.      India Statistical Strengthening The ISSP component has contributed to strengthening the
        Project, Tier I, GoI            national statistical system and has supported the development
                                        of the role of Ministry of Statistics and Plan Implementation
                                        (MOSPI) as the lead agency.

6.      Computerization of PWD, GoA     The implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning in
                                        PWD, the state has built the capacity to process the entire
                                        process of roads project conception to approval and
                                        implementation online. The pilot divisions send and receive
                                        DPR (Detailed Project Reports) online and approvals are
                                        received online. This has substantially reduced the cycle time
                                        for project approval.



(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Some of the reforms/pilots/initiatives undertaken by states/implementing agencies are now being
disseminated, though in an ad-hoc manner. A very good example of this is the Capacity Building
for PMGSY sub-project, which was the largest and the most successful sub-project under this
facility ($8.5 million). The Indian Roads Congress (IRC) has recently published pavement design
guidelines for rural roads. These were prepared with the help of highly experienced consultants
(who brought in best-practice international knowledge), funded through this sub-project. It
generally takes a very long time to bring out such documents (running into many years). The
draft guidelines prepared by the consultants were reviewed and approved by various Committees
of the IRC before publication. The consultants were also able to handle the tough resistance from
various states against lowering down the costs and use of gravel roads and have helped bring in a
lot of technical issues to the fore. The use of the guidelines will significantly reduce the cost of
construction of rural roads. Funds provided by the Bank, even though not significant, have filled
the critical gap of international knowledge which is generally not possible under the current
government rules. The Agency plans to distribute the guidelines to all the engineers engaged in
rural roads projects and has planned to organize 6 regional workshops to widely disseminate the
same.

Some of the sub-projects like the Assam PWD Computerization and the Karnataka Human
Resource Database have had demonstration effects with other states wanting to know the reforms
these departments undertook and visiting them to see if these can be replicated in their own state.

A self-assessment model for service delivery that was developed under the "Capacity Building
for Good Governance" sub-project, using international expertise is now being rolled out in phased
manner across various government organizations and states.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

A stakeholder workshop was organized under the largest sub-project under this credit, namely,
Capacity Building for Pradhan Mantri Sadak Gram Yojana (PMSGY). This sub-project accounts
for 25% of the overall net credit proceeds (US$8.5million).

The workshop covered the achievements, their impact, implementation experiences and further
requirements in the various components under this sub-project (training; manuals and pilot
projects; laboratory and special equipment; and external exposure).

The achievement of the objectives of the subproject was rated by the participants on a scale of 1
to 5 (unsatisfactory to highly satisfactory). The sub-project is rated as highly satisfactory in
achieving its objective with an average rating of 3.75
(Details in Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to Development Outcome is categorized as Moderate as most of the activities/reforms
undertaken under this project are irreversible.      For example, Value Added Tax (VAT) in
Karnataka was introduced 3 years ago and it is unlikely that the state will switch to another tax
system. Similarly, computerization of Human Resource Database in Karnataka and the PWD
Department in Assam are activities that are unlikely to be reversed. These are up and running and
the state government's are unlikely to resort to manual systems again. The training imparted and
manuals written under the PMGSY sub-project are being used for the larger investment operation
under implementation.

In some sub-projects like the one on service delivery through e-governance in Uttarakhand, some
pilots were undertaken which were successfully tried. However, the ultimate objective was to up-
scale these and roll them out on a state-wide basis. It remains to be seen whether the state will
allocate the required resources from their own funds to do this.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory




                                                13

While the project fell under the "Substantial Risk" category, and issues of `poor project
management' including financial reporting were recognized as risks at appraisal, not enough
safeguards were put in place to mitigate the same. Loan effectiveness conditions were very weak
and signing only one Participation Agreement with only 5% of credit proceeds committed did not
prove to be effective.

Key indicators at the project level had no link with the PDOs and were not relevant in assessing
the outcomes. While lessons learnt from earlier TA projects were noted, they were not taken into
account in project design.

The terms and conditions of borrowing this credit facility were not communicated clearly to the
potential borrowers as many entities who had expressed interest during the time of project
appraisal, did not follow up on the sub-projects when they found out that this was not a grant
facility.

The financial management system under this project was not able to capture expenditures under
each component and category in each sub-project. Therefore, at any point in time one could not
get information on a particular sub-project and one could not assess financial performance of any
particular sub-project.

The PMU at DEA neither had the capacity nor the expertise to deal either with the technical or
financial aspects of a multi-sector TA project like this one. The Bank team could have played a
more proactive role in resolving this with DEA.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

For the first three to four years of implementation (2001-2004), the supervision team was
involved both in assisting clients in preparing new sub-projects and supervising those already
under implementation. Since the new sub-projects had linkages with other Bank programs, there
was an in-built incentive to ensure that they are implemented well. A number of these sub-
projects were supervised along with the supervision of on-going projects or programs. For
example, in the early phases of implementation of the three sub-projects in Karnataka, they were
supervised by the DPL team, along with sector experts as and when required.

However, some sub-projects were not supervised as rigorously as desired either because the
sector experts did not have the time, or because there was no incentive to spend the required time
on a small component of an overall TA project which was not linked to any large lending
operation under implementation or in pipeline. At the same time there were some sub-projects,
especially the large ones like the PMSGY sub-project ($8.5 million) and the E-governance sub-
project in Uttarakhand ($8.53 million) which were very well supervised. (Details of individual
sub-project supervision missions can be obtained from aide-memoires or BTORs filed in IRIS).

Financial reporting issues (resulting from poor project design), surfaced and increasingly became
a problem in the fourth year of project implementation, by which time most sub-projects were
under implementation. However, the Bank team did not play a pro-active role by recommending
any innovative solutions to address or resolve this with DEA.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance



                                                14

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Since there were several shortcomings both in the design and supervision of this project, as listed
above, the overall performance of the Bank has been rated as "Moderately Unsatisfactory".
However, this needs to be qualified, as the supervision team did manage to turn around a badly
designed project to one that yielded some excellent outcomes, with nearly all sub-projects ending
with a `satisfactory' rating. As discussed in earlier sections, institutional strengthening and
demonstration effects of these sub-projects are an on-going process. In some cases the pilots are
being scaled up and in some other cases, teams from other States are visiting to see if these
activities can be replicated in their State.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

While the Department of Economic Affair's agreement to set up the PMU in their Department
was viewed as "good client commitment", in the end it is clear that this project should not have
been housed in DEA. While DEA viewed the PMU as the custodian of this project, responsible
for all project management related issues, the PMU lacked the capacity to do so. It was an
ineffective body, which in the end only delivered quarterly FMRs, which were incomplete in
many respects. The borrower was not able to put in place an effective mechanism to implement
or monitor the project well.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Most implementing agencies, barring one or two, did a much better job in implementing their
sub-projects. In some cases there was high ownership and commitment and in others a dedicated
team. Except for the Capacity Building Sub-project with Ministry of Statistics and Program
Implementation, GoI, all sub-projects have been rated "Satisfactory" in achieving the desired
objectives. In some cases there were bureaucratic delays in implementation because of which the
project had to be extended by two years.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is rated as "moderately satisfactory" as most implementing
agencies (eight out of nine) eventually completed most activities/reforms that they undertook.
Overall project performance could have been much better if DEA, through the PMU had ensured
better financial management and information flows on the project.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The following lessons were learned:

1.    A flexible, open TA facility of this nature with no upfront links with other Bank operations
      should not be considered at all.




                                                15

2.    All new Bank projects should take into account lessons learned from similar projects done
      by the Bank, not only by documenting them in the PAD, but having risk mitigating
      strategies.
3.    A multi-sector TA of this kind, with multiple implementing agencies should have a well-
      designed information flow mechanism, with special attention to financial flows and
      reporting.
4.    When there are multiple implementing agencies spread across several states and central
      ministries, it may be better to have a single entity/ PMU for coordinating the flow of
      financial information, preparing FMRs, monitoring audit reports and disbursing claims.
5.    The capacity of the PMU to execute such complex multi-sector TAs should be assessed and
      addressed upfront.
6.    Projects should not be housed under the Fund-Bank division of DEA.                 A possible
      arrangement could be a representative group from 4 or 5 key line departments, which could
      monitor the project and PMU.
7.    At least 50 to 60% of the project funds for a project of this nature should be committed (in
      terms of contracts awarded) before the project goes to the Board.
8.    An agreed multi-sector supervision strategy should be a part of the project design.
9.    An M&E framework to assess impact of the overall project as well as the sub-projects
      should be a part of project design.
10.   Terms and conditions of accessing funds should be clearly communicated to all entities.
11.   For a project of this nature such a facility is likely to generate more interest if it's a grant
      rather than a loan.
12.   A small part of the credit proceeds should be earmarked to allow for learning across states
      and implementing agencies.

On all four areas mentioned above, that were covered in the various presentations, a
number of useful suggestions for what was most useful and what could be improved
going forward emerged. There were a number of suggestions on the design and
quality of training; implementation and administration of training programs; impact
and usefulness of training and future training needs.        A number of technical
suggestions on manuals, pilot project and laboratory and special equipment also
emerged. These are very important for design and implementation of future rural
road projects. For detailed recommendations on each of these areas please refer to
the consultants report on this sub-project (S.C. Sharma, March 2008).
