design,\n            and implementation of selected reforms. However, under the\n            operation, public sector reforms will be specifically\n            restrained from areas where the private sector is more\n            effective, to facilitate privatization growth in social\n            sector spending, and poverty reduction, particularly in\n            health, and education. The components will: 1) assist the\n            Government of Uttar Pradesh with the design, and\n            implementation of the tax reform, providing technical\n            assistance (TA) to improve corporate aspects of the Trade\n            Tax Department, and its organizational structure, through\n            computerization, and with the introduction of a value added\n            tax system; expenditure management will address the\n            medium-term macroeconomic, and fiscal policies; public\n            enterprise reform, will divest government enterprises, to\n            prod privatization within the commercial-public sector;\n            municipal management will improve property tax reforms in a\n            pilot city, to further assess urban finances, and\n            institutional aspects; the establishment of poverty\n            monitoring systems will be supported; and, comprehensive\n            capacity building, and training modules will address civil\n            service reform. 2) improve the Ministry of Statistics and\n            Program Implementation capacity, addressing current\n            management practices. In addition, The Government of\n            Karnataka will implement power sector reforms, through\n            restructuring, and privatization practices. The Ministry of\n            Urban Development, and five other states have submitted\n            proposals, currently under review."}, "docdt": "2000-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
