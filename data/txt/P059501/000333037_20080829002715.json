   Economic Reform Project for India were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: A\n            flexible, open technical assistance (TA) facility of this\n            nature with no upfront links with other Bank operations\n            should not be considered at all. A multi-sector TA project\n            of this kind, with multiple implementing agencies should\n            have a well designed information flow mechanism, with\n            special attention to financial flows and reporting. At least\n            50 percent to 60 percent of the project funds for a project\n            of this nature should be committed (in terms of contracts\n            awarded) before the project goes to the Board. A monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) framework to assess impact of the\n            overall project as well as the sub-projects should be a part\n            of project design. For a project of this nature such a\n            facility is likely to generate more interest if it is a\n            grant rather than a loan. Terms and conditions of accessing\n            funds should be clearly communicated to all entities. A\n            small part of the credit proceeds should be earmarked to\n            allow for learning across states and implementing agencies.\n            The capacity of the project monitoring unit  (PMU) to\n            execute such complex multi-sector TA should be assessed and\n            addressed upfront."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
