The original objectives of the\n            Fourth Education Project were to: (a) improve the quality of\n            the primary, secondary and technical education systems; (b)\n            strengthen sector management; and (c) adapt the vocational\n            training system to the needs of the labor market. Project\n            implementation was not satisfactory as most objectives were\n            not attained. There are four major lessons to be drawn from\n            the experience with the project. First, it is obviously\n            essential to the implementation of any project that the\n            counterpart funds be made available in the amounts and\n            according to the schedule agreed on. Secondly the absence of\n            a common policy framework among the three ministries\n            involved in implementing the project made it difficult to\n            coordinate the management of activities. Third the\n            inefficient management in the administrative and accounting\n            areas showed that implementation and management of an\n            education project should not be separated from the Ministere\n            de lI'Education N ationale (MNEDUC)'s operations\n            staff and that each activity should be assigned to the\n            pertinent operational Department. Fourth, the fact that the\n            demand for vocational training did not translate into a\n            demand for trained workers implies that employers were not\n            as involved in the planning and operation of the training as\n            they should have been."}, "docdt": "1995-10-06T00:00:00Z"}
