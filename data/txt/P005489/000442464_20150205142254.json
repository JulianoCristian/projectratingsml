For the foreign visitor to the rural areas\n            of countries such as Morocco, one of the chief attractions\n            is the absence of the material junk and blandness that seem\n            to accompany development. What difference does a road make?\n            What happens to people? Their farms? Their lives? In 1996,\n            the World Bank operations evaluation department asked these\n            questions to people living along rural roads in several\n            distinct Moroccan regions, each with different soils,\n            rainfall patterns, and economies. The four roads under study\n            were among 10 that were from 30 to 50 kilo meter (km) long,\n            which previously had been gravel or unimproved track with\n            traffic volumes generally below 100 vehicles per day. During\n            the course of the World Bank's fourth highway project\n            (1983-90), these roads were paved, with dramatic results.\n            Consistent with the government's strategic plan and in\n            record time, the World Bank responded with the emergency\n            drought recovery project. The project brought assistance in\n            agriculture and drinking water and supported the\n            construction and rehabilitation of 1,650 kms of rural roads.\n            The Bank is financing another 1,235 kms of rural roads under\n            the secondary, tertiary, and rural roads project (1996-2001)."}, "docdt": "2005-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
