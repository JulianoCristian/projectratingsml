Sustainability is\n            rated likely. World Bank performance was rated satisfactory\n            and Borrower performance is rated satisfactory, although\n            marginally. Some of the lessons learned were the following:\n            The decision to carry out implementation through the line\n            agencies, instead of a project implementation unit proved to\n            be correct. There is a need to centralize the monitoring\n            function. Objectives should not be overly ambitious; much\n            discussion is needed with new authorities to gain ownership\n            or modify the project if necessary. A key question road\n            agencies have to respond to is: what responsibilities and at\n            what pace should the center delegate, for the process to be\n            useful and effective? Morocco's approach aiming for\n            gradual deconstruction appears to be right: the Directorate\n            of Road and Road Traffic (DRCR) approach to gradually\n            develop Regional Directorates after a pilot trial, prudently\n            expanding their advice, planning, and review functions, and\n            supported by training, appears as an appropriate way to\n            delegate central functions while avoiding atomization of\n            resources. Other lessons were related to the role of\n            competition and stable funding of road works; road\n            maintenance budgets, accounting, and targets; local\n            community participation; defining accessibility objectives;\n            policy reforms, adapting institutions, and the Bank's\n            role; and the political economy of policy reforms and\n            government organization."}, "docdt": "2002-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
