During construction, dust and noise pollution will\n            occur, therefore water sprinklers will be available during\n            the dry season to control air pollution; construction\n            activities will be limited to daytime schedules in\n            compliance with noise ordinance regulations; and, noise\n            meters will be installed to control potential disturbances\n            to schools, and local populations. Workers will be provided\n            with noise abatement, protection devices. Solid wastes, such\n            as metals will be recycled, as specified in the bidding\n            documents; hazardous materials will be handled by licensed\n            companies, in accordance with government regulations; while,\n            existing PCBs content should be clarified, and transformers\n            tested for PCBs. Concrete, and scrap materials will be\n            removed to selected disposal sites, and, production of new\n            pipe insulation, will be in accordance with Government\n            regulations, as per the Montreal Protocol, and as specified\n            in the bidding documents. To control emissions, low nitric\n            oxide (NOx) burners, and oil with low sulfur content will be\n            used. Water leakage will undergo extended maintenance\n            measures, while fuel and oil spills, in addition to extended\n            maintenance measures will be collected through special\n            devices.
