C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING for CHPs, HOB units, Substations and Pipelines
1.   Equipment Purchases (Tabular Presentation Preferred)
No new additional instruments and/or meters are intended to be purchased within the project.
2.   Training/Study Tours
Training will be set up for operators and other specialists if the monitoring equipment and instruments will be replaced.
Duration of the training will be according to recommendation and requirements from the supplier.
Training of appropriate staff will be performed to inform and learn about handling of asbestos waste and if required of PCB in
order to manage correct purchasing and monitoring of the contracts works.
3.   Consultant Services
No consultants are planned to be involved in the environmental institutional strengthening


﻿D. SCHEDULE
The activities are identified in the Project Implementation Plan.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS for CHPs, HOB units, Substations and Pipelines
Collection of data:  RK-8 & CHP-3 - Computerized supervision system for collection, storage, handling of data as
charts, statistics, historical value, etc.
Other plants - Data is collected by operational staff once a week at each boiler plant or during
unusual situations process if required.
Analyze of data:     Analyze of data is performed by the chief of production plants by visual review and check of collected
data. Data is filed in the operational register.
Reporting:          Normal procedure is that the report with filed operational data is sent to the Production Department
once a month. If the data diverge from the ordinary, the report immediately is sent to the chief of
Technical Department for appropriate measures.
Decisions:          The decision to take action, to authorize expenditures, to shut down etc. is performed by the Technical
Director.
