rated likely, nonetheless. The\n            overall performances of the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            rated satisfactory. These were some of the lessons noted: It\n            may not be enough to have only manpower; more important is\n            to provide training and inculcating sensitivity for the\n            Project at all levels so that there is conceptual clarity of\n            the Project objective among its functionaries. Anganwadi\n            workers are the only visible Government functionary at the\n            village level and therefore their services are being\n            extensively utilized for delivery of most of the Government\n            Programs. Thus, there is need to have re-look at their roles\n            and responsibilities, with changing times. There is\n            considerable time lag between receipt of funds at the State\n            Treasury and transfer of the funds to the implementing\n            agencies. This is caused delay in executing the program. It\n            is, therefore, necessary to sensitize the Finance Department\n            or creating a system in the state so that the time lag is\n            reduced. Financial Management System (FMS) along with the\n            requisite infrastructure has been found to be weak in some\n            States. As distinct from the FMS software, which has been\n            recently developed, there appears to be lack of training and\n            orientation of personnel in this regard. Difficulties have\n            been faced by the State Governments in filling up World Bank\n            Project related forms and proformae. There is a need for\n            continuity of incumbents in the Project Management Units in\n            the States. Appointment of Supervisors in Bihar remained\n            partially fulfilled. Vehicles provided to CDPOs for field\n            visits are regularly requisitioned by the district\n            administration for other purposes; this has affected\n            supervision of the program. In designing the project, the\n            development objectives should have reflected the true nature\n            of the ICDS Program in the country and should have captured\n            its reality. ICDS is a multipurpose vehicle with six\n            objectives, only one of which constitutes the thrust of the\n            evaluation of the ICDS-II Project, viz.,\n            'nutrition.' The ICDS-I Project was rated as\n            'unsatisfactory'. The ICDS-II Project was\n            formulated with the similar development objectives as that\n            of ICDS-I. Therefore, the question arises as to whether\n            requisite precautions were taken to ensure that the later\n            Project (ICDS-II) was designed realistically and implemented\n            satisfactorily. The need for more thorough preparation and\n            more realistic lead-time for fixing the Project launch and\n            its effectiveness emerges. Apart from this, there is also a\n            need for timely completion of benchmark surveys, viz.,\n            baseline and end line surveys. Also, unsuitability of\n            Project lending for a multipurpose vehicle like the ICDS,\n            spreading across many States with varying levels of\n            development and Government capabilities emerges. Therefore,\n            it is necessary to shift focus from 'Project\n            lending' to 'Program lending', to incorporate\n            greater flexibility in design and implementation, and to\n            move from a \"blueprint Project\" to an\n            \"evolving Project\", so that resources can be\n            judiciously allocated in a way which provides incentives to\n            the better performing States/activities."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
