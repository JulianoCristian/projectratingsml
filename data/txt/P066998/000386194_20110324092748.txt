F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
PROADEL (Phase 1 of the Local Development Program) would assist the Government of
Chad in designing and implementing a decentralized and participatory financing
mechanism that will empower local communities and decentralized authorities to manage
development funds by (i) strengthening the capacity and responsibility of local
communities and decentralized authorities, (ii) implementing demand-driven subprojects,
and (iii) supporting the emerging process of decentralization.

                 Local Development Program Support Project (APL1)

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
(a) Country situation and main sector issues
1.    The Local Development Program Support Project (Projet d'Appui au
Developpement Local - PROADEL) was appraised in 2003.
2.     Poverty in Chad. At the time of appraisal, about 80 percent of the population
lived on less than one dollar per day. Average annual income per capita was estimated at
US$250, but there was a marked disparity between rural areas (US$133) and urban areas
(US$328). Because poverty in Chad has a distinctly rural character, Government
programs to reduce poverty and increase growth have traditionally targeted rural areas.
3.       Development constraints and rural services. The main constraints to rural growth
in Chad were identified as: (a) weak and inefficient provision of basic services to rural
communities, (b) poor organization of rural communities and their limited involvement in
development decisions, (c) the absence of rural financial services, and (d) the fragility of
ecosystems. Because PROADEL was designed to support decentralization and to help
Government authorities and local communities manage development funds at the local
level, the first two of these constraints were particularly targeted by the preparation team.
  (i)   Weak and inefficient provision of basic services to rural communities. At the time
        of appraisal, only 30 percent of the rural population had access to safe water, and
        even in villages that had pumps, many of these pumps were not working due to
        lack of maintenance. Schools were few in number and physically inadequate,
        enrollment rates were low, the quality of education was poor and showed wide
        regional disparities in performance, school attendance rates for girls lagged
        substantially behind those for boys, costs were high, and few students continued
        on to post-primary education. In N'Djamena, there was one doctor per 3,904
        inhabitants, but nationwide this number was more than 10 times higher (one
        doctor per 41,000 inhabitants). One-half of births in urban areas were assisted,
        compared with only 16 percent of births in rural areas. Five percent of adult
        Chadians were infected with the HIV, compared with only 2.9 percent in 1994.
        Out of 6,200 kilometers of roads in the national road network, only 300
        kilometers were paved. Since most unpaved roads were not accessible year-round,
        the cost of food was high; transport charges frequently made up 70 percent of the
        retail price, and food security was poor.
  (ii) Poor organization of rural communities and their limited participation in
       development decisions. Most rural communities in Chad were poorly organized
       and had limited involvement in decisions concerning their own development. The
       Government of Chad had started decentralizing administrative functions and
       shifting responsibility for the provision of administrative services to the local
       level, but this process was still in the early stages. There were as yet no elected
       decentralized authorities, and rural populations had little or no direct contact with
       decision-makers. Projects such as the Local Initiatives Fund (Fonds d'Actions
       Concertées d'lnitiative Locale--FACIL) and the Agency for Domestic Energy

                                             1
       and Environment (AEDE) had set up informal decision-making bodies for rural
       development, but these remained in the pilot stage and depended on international
       donors for financial support.

(b) Government strategy and rationale for Bank assistance
4.       Government strategy on poverty. The PRSP, adopted in 2003, calls for
sustainably increasing productivity and production, while at the same time reinforcing
institutional and human capacities. Key elements of the poverty reduction strategy
include:
 ·   Raising agricultural productivity and marketing.
 ·   Strengthening the capacities of existing rural organizations and promoting the
     emergence of new rural organizations.
 ·   Promoting sustainable management of natural resources.
 ·   Redefining the Government's role in rural areas through decentralization.
 ·   Improving the provision of basic services in rural areas (e.g., in education, health
     care, communications, transport).

5.      Government strategy on rural development. In 2003, the Government of Chad
prepared a comprehensive rural development strategy, which was to be implemented
through a series of programs and proects incuding the Rural Development Support
Program (Programme Intégré de Développement Rural - PIDR). Working within the
PIDR framework, the World Bank channeled its support to the rural development
strategy via two "sister" projects, which were prepared, evaluated, and implemented in
parallel. The Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Project (ASPOP), which
closed in 2009, focused primarily on productive investments: it was designed to raise
agricultural productivity, improve the performance of agricultural markets, and build
capacity among rural organizations. PROADEL meanwhile focused primarily on social
investments: it was designed to promote decentralization and accelerate development of
local communities through the provision of public goods, especially in the areas of water
and sanitation, health, and education.
6.       Government strategy to address other sector-specific issues. Rural development
activities in Chad are taking place in the context of an overall effort on the part of the
Government to decentralize decision-making power and management of public resources
The decentralization effort was launched in 1996, when the authorities introduced a new
system of government that includes five administrative levels (nation, region,
département, commune, and communauté rurale). Operationalization of the new
decentralized system lagged, however, and by 2003 when PROADEL was being
prepared, the legal and regulatory framework had not yet been put in place.
Consequently, an explicit objective of the project was to help the Government complete
the preparation of the new regulatory framework, implement the long-planned
decentralization measures, and accompany the future communautés rurales.
7.     It was anticipated that activities to be financed under PROADEL might have
unforeseen environmental and social impacts. To ensure that any such impacts would be


                                            2
managed responsibly, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF) were prepared before appraisal, with local
stakeholders involved in the preparation. Procedures needed to mitigate potential adverse
envronmental impacts of project-supported activities were spelled out in the National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) and the Fight Against Desertification National Plan
(FADN), both of which were prepared prior to appraisal.
8.      Rationale for Bank assistance. The overall goal of the CAS of 2003 was to
strengthen governance (including institutional arrangements for public resource
management and service delivery) and to enhance non-oil economic opportunities, while
reducing sources of vulnerability, particularly for the poor.
9.      PROADEL was seen as helping to expand opportunities for the poor, address the
unmet needs of rural communities in basic infrastructure services, and reduce sources of
vulnerability. Moreover, PROADEL was to contribute to the decentralization process. It
was anticipated that a share of the new oil revenues would be used to finance the needs of
rural communities, with these needs identified by the communities themselves. The
project was selected for grant financing because of its importance in the Bank's program
in Chad and its expected contribution to poverty alleviation.
10.     PROADEL was to be implemented using a Community-Driven Development
(CDD) approach; the beneficiaries were to become strong and effective participants in
their own development. The selection of a CDD approach was innovative in the Chadian
context and consistent with the objectives of decentralization.
11.    Interventions supported under PROADEL were intended to be complemented by
other Bank-supported activities aimed at developing market linkages and improving the
road network. Rural roads were to be constructed and maintained through PROADEL;
market infrastructure was to be developed through the Urban Development Project
(UDP); and complementary investments in transport were to be made through the
National Transport Program Support Project (PAPRONAT).
1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators
12.     PROADEL was designed as an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) facility, to be
implemented in three phases over a 12-year period. Following the establishment during
the first phase of a legally recognized decentralization framework, the idea was to pilot
investment activities in a few regions during the first phase and to scale up coverage in
subsequent phases into a fully-fledged national program.
13.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) for PROADEL-1 was to assist the
Government of Chad in designing and implementing a decentralized and participatory
financing mechanism that will empower local communities and institutions to manage
development funds in a transparent and sound way and according to their own priorities
and eventually contribute to the decentralization agenda. The PDO was to be pursued
through three main sets of activities: (a) strengthening the capacity and responsibility of
local communities and decentralized authorities, (b) implementing demand-driven
subprojects, and (c) supporting the emerging process of decentralization.
14.    PROADEL-1was intended to cover 19 of the 47 country's administrative
departments. Emphasis was to be placed on promoting community development in the 11


                                            3
southern departments that produce oil and cotton, as well as piloting models for
participatory development in eight northern departments in which pastoralism is the
dominant source of livelihoods. In addition, support would be provided to help the
Government complete the legal framework for decentralization and support
democratically elected decentralized authorities.
15.     Key performance indicators. The PAD included 21 key performance indicators
related to the PDO and to the four project components.1 Because the project was designed
as the first phase of a three-phase APL, a set of key performance indicators for
PROADEL-1 was selected as triggers for proceeding to PROADEL-2 (see Table 1).


    Table 1. Performance indicators for PROADEL-1 selected as triggers for PROADEL-2
    1. 50 percent of targeted communities have prepared and adopted their Local Development
       Plans in the 11 southern "strong intervention departments"
    2. 50 percent of these communities have at least one subproject whose first financing
       tranche has been disbursed
    3. 75 percent of decision-making committees are in place in these 11 departments and have
       met at least once
    4. Regulatory legal documents on decentralization have been enacted and adopted by the
       national assembly, and 50 percent of the application decrees are available
    5. Timetable for administrative elections (communes and communautés rurales) has been
       defined
    6. At least 0.5 percent of oil revenues devoted to priority sectors are disbursed for
       subprojects that come within the scope of Local Development Plans.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons / Justification
16.     Toward the end of 2008, when the Project had been under implementation for
nearly five years, the Government and the World Bank task team decided that the results
framework needed to be revised for two reasons. Because the Project uses a CDD
approach, the types and numbers of subproject funding requests submitted by local
communities could not be known with precision when the Project was being prepared,
and targets set at the time of appraisal had by then been shown to be off the mark.
Moreover, the indicators and targets in the results framework reflected the outcomes and
impacts expected at the conclusion of all three phases of the planned 12-year APL, not
those that could reasonably be expected at the end of the first phase only.
17.     In light of these considerations, during the Mid-Term Review (MTR) carried out
in June 2009, the World Bank task team and the Government agreed to modify the results
framework. The task team subsequently prepared a restructuring proposal that included
minor revisions to the PDO. The revised PDO formulated in the wake of the MTR reads
as follows: "Increase access to basic infrastructure services in targeted poor communes

    All performance indicators are displayed in Section 3.2, Table 3.



                                                     4
and improve the capacity of local institutions and communities to manage the
development process." In addition to proposing this change to the PDO, the task team
also proposed to introduce several new performance indicators and to modify the targets
for a number of existing performance indicators. The modified performance indicators
are presented in Annex 2.1.
18.    The revised PDO and the modified performance indicators prepared following the
MTR were never officially approved by the World Bank.2 Nevertheless, they are
mentioned here because the modified indicators were subsequently used by the project
M&E unit to track implementation progress, and they were also referred to during
supervision missions carried out after the MTR.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
19.    The main beneficiaries consisted of the people targeted by Local Development
Plans (LDPs) in the 19 departments in which PROADEL-1 was active.3 Underprivileged
groups were actively targeted, including women and transhumant herders.
1.5 Project Components
20.    PROADEL-1 included four components: (1) Financial support to local
development subprojects, (2) Capacity building for local development stakeholders,
(3) Support for decentralization, and (4) Project management and information support.
21.      Component 1: Financial support to local development subprojects (US$13.95
million, of which US$10.12 million in IDA funds). The objective of Component 1 was to
provide matching grants to cofinance subprojects proposed by community-based
organizations (associations, organizations, and others with legal status) or decentralized
local government entities (at the commune or communauté rurale level, once established)
in project areas. After local meetings were organized, each local development community
(Assemblée communautaire de développement--ACD) would prepare a LDP detailing its
priorities and listing activities to be financed (as subprojects).
22.     Component 2: Capacity building for local development stakeholders
(US$18.68 million, of which US$4.58 million in IDA funds). The objective of
Component 2 was to strengthen the technical and organizational capacity for
participatory approaches, needs assessments, project management, access to credit, or
new poverty reduction methods. This component targeted local communities and their

    Circumstances conspired to prevent the restructuring from being carried out, in that relations between
    the Bank and the Government of Chad were under review when the restructuring package was
    submitted to the CMU in August 2009. By the time relations were clarified (this process ended with the
    ISN of June 2010), the closing date was drawing near, and the CMU decided that there was no longer
    any point in changing the PDO.
3
    The 11 core departments included: Mandoul Occidental, Mandoul Oriental, and Bahr Sara (region of
    Mandoul); Dodje, Lac Weye, Ngourkosso, Tandjile Est, and Tandjile Ouest (regions of Tandjile and
    Logone Occidental); and La Nya Pende, La Pende, and Monts de Lam (region of Logone Oriental). The
    eight additional departments in which PROADEL launched studies and pilot activities included: Chari,
    Baguirmi, Loug Chari, Dababa, Bahr El Gazal, Bahr Koh, Bahr Signaka and Fitri (regions of Chari-
    Baguirmi and Kanem).


                                                    5
associations, subprefectoral and departmental decision and approval committees, and
service providers (training institutions, NGOs, microfinance institutions).
Component 2 had three subcomponents:
·   Subcomponent 2.1: Support to community participatory assessments and local
    development plan preparation and implementation. This subcomponent was to be
    executed by an opérateur ensemblier (coordinating service provider) financed by
    AFD and recruited through an international invitation to tender based on the terms of
    reference detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The component was
    to finance training at the local level for participatory appraisals and to pay the local
    service providers needed to plan and implement the subprojects, as well as to pay for
    complementary studies and pilot operations that would be launched in the pastoral
    departments, where the techniques to be used were different.
·   Subcomponent 2.2: Training programs at the community level. Training programs
    were to be provided by local subcontractors (NGOs) and were to include a wide
    variety of modules determined during the participatory assessments.
·   Subcomponent 2.3: Institutional support to microfinance institutions. The objective
    of this subcomponent was to help provide efficient financial services to poor
    communities in rural project areas. These include defining and implementing a
    regulatory framework for rural finance, providing basic training for microfinance
    institutions and communities on savings and credit, and reinforcing and expanding
    existing microfinance institutions through feasibility studies, business plans,
    equipment, and the like.
23.   Component 3: Support for decentralization (US$5.06 million, of which
US$3.5 million in IDA funds). The objective of Component 3 was to help the
Government effectively implement its decentralization policy.
Component 3 had three subcomponents:
·   Subcomponent 3.1: Support for the completion of the legal and regulatory
    frameworks of decentralization. The support was provided to finance studies and
    technical assistance to the Ministry of Decentralization to complete the necessary
    laws and regulations and to formulate a master plan for implementing the
    decentralization program.
·   Subcomponent 3.2: Capacity building. This subcomponent aimed to strengthen the
    institutional and technical capacities of all key stakeholders in the decentralization
    process at the national, regional, and local levels.
·   Subcomponent 3.3: Support for the definition of land tenure. The project would
    improve the land tenure system in Chad by helping create a reliable database on land
    tenure, define new curricula and research programs on land tenure, help collect data
    needed for PROADEL's activities, and provide equipment to support the Chadian
    Land Tenure Office (CLTO - Observatoire Foncier du Tchad).
24.    Component 4: Management and information support (US$8.31 million, of
which US$4.9 million in IDA funds). Component 4 supported project coordination,
evaluation, and monitoring.


                                             6
Component 4 had two subcomponents:
·   Subcomponent 4.1: Support to project management. Institutional arrangements for
    project implementation consisted of a Steering Committee,4 a Project Management
    Unit--PMU (Unité de gestion du projet--UGP), and Local Project Management
    Units--LPMUs (Unité de gestion locale--UGL) in each of the three regions where
    project operations were active. In addition, there were Decision Committees for
    subprojects at the regional level.
·   Subcomponent 4.2: Program monitoring and evaluation. The planned management
    information system consisted of (a) monitoring of accounting and financial
    information, (b) monitoring and evaluation of project activities, and
    (c) monitoring of development operations and processes.
25.      Causal linkages. The decentralization strategy of the Government was designed
to promote cooperation between elected authorities (regional and subregional) and rural
communities, with the goal of jointly managing resources, including future oil revenues
allocated to priority sectors. As reflected in the PDO, it was therefore deemed necessary
to: (a) establish a decentralized administrative structure based on formal laws and a well-
defined regulatory framework, (b) provide the facilities and competencies needed to
operate the structure, and (c) finance local initiatives selected not by the central
authorities but by stakeholders who are close to beneficiaries or are beneficiaries
themselves. The activities supported under the project supported this paradigm, although
it could be argued that they were not always implemented in the optimal order.
1.6 Other significant changes
26.     During implementation, there were no major changes in the project strategy,
components, or implementation arrangements. Following the MTR project funds were
reallocated to better reflect the actual demand and use of funds up until that time.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
27.     Two factors in the external environment affected project implementation: the
breakdown in relations between the World Bank and the Government of Chad, and the
civil conflict that gripped the country. The related disruptions slowed implementation of
project activities and required many subprojects to stop and then re-start again.
28.    Breakdown in relations between the World Bank and the Government of Chad:
The relationship between the Bank and the Government of Chad was severely strained
over disagreements concerning the use of oil revenues that negotiated in the context of
the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project. The Bank stopped its program in Chad in 2006,
which led to the temporary freezing of disbursements to all projects including
PROADEL-1. Consequently, project activities slowed or stopped altogether before
eventually resuming when the situation improved.
29.   Civil conflict: For much of the project implementation period the Government
was engaged in what amounted to a low-level civil war, with opposition groups based

    At the central level, there is a Steering Committee for all the projects of the PIDR,
    including PROADEL and ASPOP.

                                            7
inside and outside the country mounting regular armed attacks designed to destabilize the
economy and overthrow the existing regime. The lack of security in many parts of the
country, especially rural areas including many of those targeted by the project, often
made it unsafe for project staff to travel to project sites and/or perform their activities in a
normal way. In February 2008, the World Bank Country Office was closed following
rebel attacks on the capital and remained closed throughout the entire year.
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
30.    The Government fully endorsed the local development approach that PROADEL
supported. It undertook the responsibility to prepare the three phases by establishing a
national team (Equipe Nationale d'Instruction du Projet--ENIP) and using funds made
available through a PPF funded by the Government of Japan. The multidisciplinary
preparation team included representatives from the Government and from civil society.
Furthermore, the Government placed PROADEL under a multisectoral Steering
Committee composed of eight ministries to oversee the program (the same Committee
supervises other rural sector projects). Prior to appraisal, the Government also organized
preparation of the operations, financial, and M&E manuals.
31.    Project preparation benefited from: (a) analytical work done when the national
and sector-specific strategies were being developed (see Section 1.1.b); (b) lessons
learned from other rural development projects, including CBD/CDD projects carried out
not only in Chad but also in other African countries; (c) lessons learned from several
community-based development projects preceding this project; and (d) lessons learned
from a number of bilateral projects for local development in Chad.
32.    Technical support on the design of Component 3 was provided by FENU which
was already active in Chad, and the appraisal mission included a decentralization and
governance consultant who provided background support.
33.     The design decided by the preparation team included a range of activities,
including building capacity for planning of local development and implementing
subprojects, transfering financial resources to communes and communities, strengthening
financial management and procurement systems, introducing new policies and
regulations for decentralization, and bolstering natural resource management.
34.     The PDO was appropriate in light of the long-term development objectives of the
overall 12-year program. At the same time, because the PDO related to the overall
program goals, it did not lend itself easily to the definition of the detailed performance
indicators needed to measure the achievements of the first phase of the project.
35.     The design of the project and its components were appropriate. The program was
intended to (a) run for an extended period; (b) cover multiple sectors; (c) encourage
active participation of all population groups within the targeted communities; (d) develop
and test decentralized financial management mechanisms; (e) provide mechanisms for
financing local initiatives while attempting to ensure long-term viability of ecosystems
and natural resources; and (f) facilitate making local governments or the private sector
responsible for providing services previously provided by the central government.
36.    The project design prudently called for project operations to be launched initially
in one region only, with the objective of gaining experience before the approach was


                                               8
extended to other regions. In retrospect, it is apparent that the scaling up proceeded very
slowly, and it now seems that work in the two other regions should have been started
simultaneously in the second year, rather than being phased in over two years.
37.      Most risks and mitigating measures were appropriately conceived. Two risks were
arguably underestimated: (a) the risk that planned capacity-building efforts might not be
sufficient to ensure rapid and successful adoption by participating community
organizations of decentralized financial management measures (including procurement
activities), and (b) the risk that local administrations would require additional resources
to be able to perform their functions effectively (see Annex 6--Stakeholder workshops).
2.2 Implementation
38.     No major changes were made during implementation to the project design, and
the project was never formally at risk, although risks inherent in the environment were
high as noted earlier.
39.     The Project succeeded in implementing most of the planned activities, and
significant impacts were achieved. Selected achievements are summarized in Table 2.

                           Table 2. Main accomplishments of PROADEL-1

 decentralization


40.   Several factors can be singled out as having contributed to the successful
implementation experience:
 (i)    Throughout implementation, the demand for project services was very strong,
        both with regard to financing of subprojects and with regard to supporting
        decentralization.
 (ii)   The Government maintained its strong commitment to the project, participating in
        supervision missions, facilitating communication with the Bank, expediting the
        transfer of funds from the Bank, providing guidance through the Steering
        Committee, and ensuring a supportive policy environment



                                              9
 (iii) Supervision missions, although not carried out as frequently as planned because
       of the protracted cessation of the Bank's operations in Chad, were characterized
       by strong collaboration between the Bank task team and project staff. These
       missions generated important feedback to the implementing authorities about the
       performance of the project, which helped to make up for the weak performance of
       the project M&E system during the first two years (see 2.3 below).
 (iv) Financial and technical support provided by the co-financier (Agence Francaise
      de Developpement) allowed field operations to proceed without interruption after
      the initial delay of eight months (caused by the difficulty of recruiting the
      Opérateur Ensemblier).
41.    During the project life cycle, however, implementation was slowed by a number
of problems:
 (i)   Unfortunate timing of effectiveness: The IDA grant was approved on 30
       September 2004. However, due to delays in hiring the project coordinator,
       implementing the computerized accounting system, and transferring Government
       counterpart funds, the grant was declared effective only on 28 March 2005, and
       the special accounts received initial deposits of funds only in May 2005. This
       meant that the project had only four months in 2005 to implement activities
       before the onset of the rainy season.
 (ii) Slow recruitment of project staff: The international procurement procedure used
      to recruit the coordinating service provider funded by AFD took eight months;
      since the coordinating service provider was needed to build capacity in local
      communities and prepare local development plans, all activities in Components 1
      and 2 were delayed.
 (iii) Cessation of World Bank programs in Chad: The year 2006 began with the halt of
       all World Bank programs in Chad, meaning that the planned first-quarter
       activities were transferred to the second quarter. In addition, the annual plan and
       budget of the project for 2006 was approved by the Steering Committee only in
       August, thus restricting the use of Government counterpart funds.
 (iv) Civil disturbances: Due to rebel attacks, the World Bank office in Chad remained
      closed throughout 2008, slowing the processing of replenishment requests.
      Security operations directed against the rebels disrupted fieldwork from February
      to April.

42.    Four other factors adversely affected the speed and quality of implementation:
 (i)   Seasonal factors: Many project-supported activities could be implemented only
       during the dry season (four or five months), when beneficiaries were not actively
       engaged in agricultural activities.
 (ii) Non-availability of counterpart funds: Delays in the payment of counterpart
      funds, and the Government's failure to honor all of its counterpart funds




                                           10
           commitments, prevented timely implementation of some project-supported
           activities.5
    (iii) Cash flow problems: Transfer of project funds from N'Djamena to field locations
          and ACDs were difficult to arrange, in part because financial institutions are
          scarce in Chad. Delays in moving funds to the field were exacerbated by a cash-
          flow bottleneck that arose because of the very low limits that had been imposed
          on the two Special Accounts (these were originally set at US$505,000 and
          US$320,000 equivalent; only after the midterm review were they raised to US$1
          million and US$640,000, respectively).
    (iv) Inconsistencies in project management: Due to management shortcomings
         pointed by the MTR, at the end of 2009 the Government replaced nearly all of the
         management staff. Identification of a new Project Coordinator proved very
         challenging, in part because of political reasons. Eventually the supervising
         ministry (Ministry of Land Management, Urbanism and Habitat) exerted its
         authority and brokered the appointment of a new Project Coordinator. From that
         point on, implementation performance picked up again
43.     As a consequence of the slow start and the many delays experienced during
project implementation, the MTR originally scheduled to take place in March 2007 was
significantly delayed. The MTR took place only in June 2009, 60 months after
effectiveness was declared. Because of the lateness of the MTR, the project closing date
was extended by one year.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
44.    Design. Planning of the M&E system started before project appraisal. The manual
was validated by the World Bank in 2004 with minor changes.
45.        As designed, the M&E system had four major weaknesses:
    (i)    Overly ambitious design: The original results framework was too ambitious and
           contained indicators that were challenging to measure under the difficult
           conditions prevailing.
    (ii)   Excessive data collection requirements: Some of the M&E data could only be
           collected through formal surveys carried out annually.
    (iii) Inadequate resources: The resources allocated for M&E activities were
          inadequate.
    (iv) Missing baseline: Baseline data were not collected at project inception. A basic
         review of the existing infrastructure in the departments covered by the project was
         prepared only in November 2007. The lack of a detailed baseline proved to be a
         major limitation at the evaluation stage.



5
     It should be noted, however, that after the Project closed, the Government has continued to provide
     funding, thus allowing the project implementation unit to retain core staff and to continue
     implementation of non-completed subprojects.


                                                   11
46.     Implementation. During the first two years of implementation, the M&E system
was unable to generate more than the most basic data on project activities, and the M&E
function was consistently rated unsatisfactory by the supervision team during four years.
These unsatisfactory ratings continued until the MTR (June 2009), when several one-off
studies were carried outThese studies made clear that the original targets for subprojects
were seriously flawed, and the World Bank task team and project management agreed
that the targets for several key performance indicators should be revised.
47.      The M&E system did manage to generate basic information about project
activities. Twenty-five out of the 28 scheduled quarterly and annual reports were
completed on time (89 percent), and at the time of the ICR mission, project management
was able to report on (i) progress achieved against the original indicators, (ii) progress
achieved against the "revised" indicators introduced at the time of the MTR, (iii) progress
achieved against the Phase 2 triggers, and (iv) capacity building activities. However, the
beneficiary survey planned at appraisal and the impact surveywere still being completed
when the ICR was being prepared. Preliminary results were transmitted at the end of
November 2010, but the quality was compromised by methodological shortcomings
compounded by a lack of baseline data.
48.     Utilization. The data on project activities generated by the M&E system, while
not very sophisticated, were used to good effect by project management and by World
Bank supervision teams. Data produced by the M&E unit were also used to prepare
detailed annual work plans, and these plans, in combination with financial management
information, allowed project management to halt the approval of new subprojects before
project funds became overcommitted.
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
49.     Safeguard policies. Four World Bank safeguard policies were triggered by the
project: OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats), OP4.11
(Physical Cultural Resources), and 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). An Environmental
Assessment (EA) and an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMP)
were prepared prior to appraisal. Based on the recommendation of the appraisal mission,
project management recruited environmental and social specialists for the head office and
for the regional offices. Beginning in the second year of implementation, the project
transferred responsibility for selected environmental activities to the Volet Gestion
Communautaire des Ecosystems (VGCE), a Government project that was tasked with
handling environmental management issues for several rural development projects,
VGCE was effective in providing environmental management services during the
identification, preparation, and implementation of subprojects. World Bank supervision
missions consistently rated compliance with applicable safeguard policies as satisfactory.
50.     Fiduciary compliance. Project accounts, including special accounts and regional
subaccounts, were audited regularly. According to the auditors' reports, many of the
accounts contained numerous irregularities up until the last year, but these errors were
mostly minor in nature, and only one audit report was qualified (the annual audit for
FY2006). The irregularities identified by the auditors were successfully addressed, and
all of the audits were eventually approved. The performance of the project's financial
management system was mixed. Because the planned financial management system


                                            12
(based on TOMPRO software) was never fully implemented, production of quarterly
reports was impeded, and annual plans suffered because they could not be subjected to
rigorous financial analysis. Throughout the life of the project, there were problems with
the transfer of funds and delayed payments to service providers (see Annex 6).
51.     Every supervision mission of the Bank carried out a procurement review. The
performance of the procurement team that operated out of the project's main office was
consistently rated satisfactory, but it was pointed out on numerous occasions that Local
Development Committees sometimes failed to follow required procurement procedures.
Because of the recurring problems with community-level procurement, the performance
of the procurement function was rated moderately unsatisfactory in 2007 and 2008.
2.5 Post-completion Operation / Next Phase
52.    The Government of Chad remains firmly committed to continuing the PROADEL
APL series and has signaled its desire to scale up the program and to increase the
coverage to include the entire national territory. Based on the performance of first phase,
and taking into account the fact that the Phase 2 triggers have been met, preparation of
PROADEL-2 was well underway in December 2010 when this ICR was being finalized.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
53.      The project design, comprising four components, is appropriate.
54.    The objectives of the Project are as relevant now as they were at appraisal.
Poverty rates in Chad have come down somewhat since the Project was prepared, but
poverty remains widespread throughout the country and is especially prevalent in rural
areas.
3.2 Achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO)
55.     Evaluation of the achievement of the PDO is problematic, for three reasons. First,
the PDO was formulated in terms that are worded very vaguely, making precise
measurement difficult.6 Second, because the project uses a CDD approach, the activities
to be financed could not be predicted accurately at the time of appaisal, so the targets set
in the PAD for many output indicators were at best only "guesstimates." Third, many of
the original targets were modified after the MTR, and although the modified targets were
never formally adopted, they were reported on by the project team.
56.     Progress achieved against the original indicators. Despite these challenges, the
effectiveness of the project in meeting its PDO can be evaluated based on the progress
achieved in relation to the original indicators. Table 3 shows the achievements against the
21 original indicators given in the PAD, four of which are related to the general
objectives and 17 of which are related to the sub-component objectives. In five cases the
target values not achieved.7 These five cases involve indicators related to the subprojects
6
    Section 1.2 reports the wording of the PAD and the Grant Agreement is not more precise: "to empower
    local communities and decentralized authorities to manage development funds."
7
    Three indicators are not applicable due to change in Government's policy, absence of selection by the
    local communities, and rescheduling. One output indicator is unavailable.


                                                   13
that were financed under Component 1, a significant number of which could not be
completed prior to the Project closing date due to delays in payment of counterart funds.
All of the targets for indicators associated with Components 2, 3, and 4 were fully
achieved, and most were significantly exceeded.

57.     Progress achieved against the "revised" PDO indicators. Additional insights into
the performance of the Project can be obtained by examining the progress achieved
against the revised indicators (see Annex 2.1). Even though the revised indicators were
never formally adopted, they reflect what the World Bank team and the Government felt,
in the wake of the MTR, were reasonable outcomes for the project. Many of the revised
indicators were less ambitious than the original indicators presented in the PAD, so the
rate of progress achieved against the targets was generally higher, especially for
Component 1.10
58.     Progress achieved against the Phase 2 trigger indicators. A final measure of the
performance of the project is provided by the trigger indicators (see Annex 2.2). For all
trigger indicators, the targets set in the PAD were reached or exceeded, with the
exception of Trigger 8 (percentage of oil revenues devoted to priority sectors). For this
indicator, monitored data do not allow effective measurement.
59.     The composite picture that emerges based on the different sets of indicators is that
the PDO has been substantially met. All of the many partners and stakeholders contacted
by the ICR mission agreed on this fundamental conclusion (see Annexes 5 and 6).
3.3 Efficiency
60.     Consistent with ICR guidelines, since economic analysis was not carried out at
the time of appraisal, economic analysis was not carried out for the ICR. The appraisal
mission concluded that the Project did not lend itself to cost-benefit analysis, for two
main reasons: (i) benefits could not be defined prior to implementation, because the
subproject investments could not be identified ex ante due to the use of the CDD
approach; and (ii) the activities most likely to be financed under the project produce
benefits that are difficult to quantify in economic terms (e.g., strengthened institution,
reinforced human capacity, improved and more transparent governance, improved
welfare of rural populations).
61.     The appraisal mission anticipated that a useful approach for evaluating the
effectiveness of the Project would be to analyze least-cost alternatives for implementing
project-financed activities. The appraisal mission did not perform any ex ante analysis of
least-cost alternatives, but the Project M&E unit did collect and save data on the numbers
and costs of different types of Project-supported subprojects. Using these data, the ICR
mission was able to compute average costs of representative Project-supported
subprojects. This analysis is presented in Annex 3. Because most of the contracts to
implement subprojects were approved using the World Bank's simplified bidding
procedures (which require that a minimum of three valid bids be received for each


10
     The revised indicators are mentioned here because they were consistently reported in supervision
     missions carried out following the MTR, but since they were never formally adopted, they are of minor
     importance for purposes of this ICR.


                                                    17
contract that is tendered), the average costs associated wit Project-supported subprojects
provide useful information that should help to inform the design of future operations,
including PROADEL-2 which is currently under preparation.
62.     The economic benefits generated by the Project are discussed in the impact
assessment commissioned by the Government, a draft of which was made available to the
ICR mission. Although the impact assessment suffered from a number of methodological
weaknesses that cast doubt on the accuracy of many findings, the report points out that
the FCFA7.7 billion worth of subprojets financed under PROADEL-1 generated
substantial benefits in terms of local employment and income generation. The draft
impact assessment documents the involvement of 76 local construction firms, 10
furniture makers, 34 consulting engineers, 26 environmental consultants, and 287
miscellaneous goods providers.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.
63.     The overall outcome of a project is assessed taking into account the extent to
which the project development objectives were achieved or are expected to be achieved.
The Project recorded significant accomplishments: most of the targets specified in the
results framework have been met or exceeded, the remaining unfinished subprojects are
all being completed, and efforts continue to ratify pending legislation on decentralization.
The overall outcome is therefore rated as Moderately satisfactory.
·     Although assessment of project achievements is hampered by a lack of data, it is clear
      that the development objective and most output targets were essentially achieved, and
      many targets were exceeded. The performance triggers for advancing to the second
      phase of the project were met, with the exception of Trigger 8, for which data
      collection was difficult (due to budget posting issues).
·     Competitive procurement was used for most subprojects, with the goal of reducing
      implementation costs below the level that would have been incurred had normal
      government implementation procedures been used.

64.      Several factors militate against assigning a higher rating for project outcomes:
·     At the time the Project closed, more than 60 subprojects had not yet been completed,
      despite the fact that the closing date had been extended by a year.
·     Several important legal documents on decentralization prepared under the Project
      remain to be processed.
·     Due to difficulties faced by the M&E system and the unavailability of the final impact
      assessment at the time of the completion of the ICR report, data permitting more
      rigorous economic analysis of the performance of subprojects are not available,
      making difficult the quantification of project benefits.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
65.    With available data it is not possible to assess the degree to which poverty has
been reduced in the areas targeted by the project (three out of the country's 22 regions).
66.     Gender and youth issues. The original PAD indicated that "women, youth,
transhumant herders, and other underprivileged groups would be actively targeted."
Among the 405 subprojects financed under the project, only two are owned by women;
the remaining 403 subprojects all have both men and women as members and
beneficiaries. This does not alter the fact that PROADEL-1 has been instrumental in
promoting the welfare of women and in improving their status in the communities where
the project is active. With 23% of the total cost of subprojects dedicated to water
infrastructure and sanitation, the draft impact assessment rightly notes their specific
impact on women and youth. The project led to a significant decrease of water chores for
women, and reduction of fecal and water-related diseases for children. Women
participate on project committees at all levels, and the ICR mission noted that all ACDs
for village groups and subprojects have at least one or two women members. Youth are
even better represented in the ACDs; each subproject that the ICR team visited had a
minimum of two or three youths represented on the ACD. The ICR mission also observed
that other underrepresented groups, such as transhumant herders, did not participate to the
same extent in ACDs because of their transient way of life. However, almost all LDPs
include provisions for sustainable land management activities, which typically provide
safe passage corridors for livestock and watering points (see Annex 5, section 4).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
67.     Processes and procedures introduced under PROADEL-1, which were used to
prepare local development plans in a participatory manner, select priority investments,
and take investment decisions, are today being used not only in regions targeted by the
project, but also in other regions throughout the country.
68.      In addition to serving as a model, the project helped build capacity in the central
institutions that implemented the project. The Ministries of Land Management and
Decentralization in particular benefited through material support and training (capacity-
building), while agencies located in the regions benefited from modernization of
communication and other equipment. A particularly important contribution, and one that
was not anticipated at the time of appraisal, was the provision of equipment to the Land
Tenure Office (Observatoire Foncier du Tchad) and the construction of three branch
offices. Every group of stakeholders contacted by the ICR mission agreed that without
PROADEL (and to some extent its agricultural sister project, ASPOP), the Government's
decentralization efforts would not have made nearly as much progress (see Annex 6--
Stakeholders' workshops).
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
69.    Under Component 1, support was to be provided to the Agence pour l'Energie
Domestique et l'Environnement, to allow completion of activities that had been initiated
under the IDA-funded Household Energy Project (CR 30820 CD, closed on June 30,
2004). The purpose of PROADEL-1 support was to create structures at the village level


                                            19
to allow sustainable management of fuelwood resources. This activity languished under
PROADEL-1, and in 2007 the Government decided to cancel the program.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
70.     Beneficiary survey. No beneficiary survey was carried out. The draft impact
assessment displays results for 564 questionnaires which are statistically unusable.
However qualitative feedback from beneficiaries shows a high level of satisfaction for all
subprojets, except for those involving water infrastructure (a significant number of wells
financed by the Project were reported to have gone dry). During the course of 15 field
visits carried out by the ICR mission, almost 100 project beneficiaries were interviewed,
as well as members of project committees, and local administrations. The outcomes of
this "mini beneficiaries survey" are summarized in Annex 5.
71.     Stakeholder workshops. The ICR mission interviewed stakeholders individually
or in small groups. Key findings of the stakeholder interviews are summarized in Annex
6. The key lessons learned identified by stakeholders appear below in Section 6--
Lessons Learned. This section presents some highlights of the proposed lessons:
·   Phasing of project-supported activities was appropriate because of local capacity
    constraints. Even though the project design was relatively simple, and despite the fact
    that the participatory approach had been introduced earlier under PROADEL's sister
    project, ASPOP, it was important for PROADEL to be launched in only one region,
    and then extended to other regions in subsequent years.
·   Late payment (and in some cases non-payment) of service providers were chronic
    problems. In future, measures must be found to ensure that project managers and
    beneficiaries in charge of implementing subprojects respect contractual conditions
    and payment schedules. Engineering firms, construction firms, and other service
    providers must be paid in a timely fashion. A guarantee fund or payment system
    should be developed in case ACD committees abandon their subproject or misuse the
    allocated funds. The loss should not fall on the service providers who have done their
    work properly.
·   Contracts for implementation of subprojects should not only provide general guidance
    on technical specifications and costs, but also should take into account specific
    conditions that are likely to vary from one subproject to the next (for instance,
    additional transport costs should be included for subprojects located in remote
    locations).
·   Many local ACDs that awarded contracts for project-supported subprojects were
    initially unfamiliar with competitive bidding procedures such as those required for
    selection of service providers. During the first phase of PROADEL, some mistakes
    occurred that were subsequently remedied by training, but additional training will be
    needed even in PROADEL-1 project areas to consolidate local knowledge. A priority
    activity for procurement officers during Phase 2 should be to organize procurement
    and simple financial training in the field.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
72.     Risks to the development outcome and sustainability of project achievements are
assessed against technical, institutional, economic/financial, social and environmental,
political (including the Government's commitment), and stakeholder criteria. These are
evaluated briefly below in relation to potential decentralization, subprojects' viability,
and institutional concerns.
73.     Decentralization and financing of the established decentralized organs. The
Government of Chad has been working on decentralization since the 1990s, with
relatively modest results to date. However, the Government's current commitment to
continued decentralization cannot be questioned, especially in view of the already fixed
election agenda. Of greater concern is the financial capacity of the central and
decentralized public-sector units to perform their duties and provide services initiated by
PROADEL funds. Mitigating this risk are the nearly finalized legal framework; the
capacity-building that has already taken place in target regions, departments, and
subprefectures; the rise in oil revenue for the Government; and the improvement in
collection of taxes and other funds by regional and lower-level administrative units.
Considering the enormity of the task of spreading decentralization to all 22 regions of
Chad, the cost element cannot be ignored, however. The risk of rapid development in
decentralization--which will take place during the second and third phases of
PROADEL--is estimated as moderate, even when the funds provided by the World Bank
grant are considered. (Other donors are waiting for actual results and elections before
committing themselves to provide additional funds for decentralization.)
74.      Viability of subprojects. The ICR mission and most of the supervision missions
concluded that nearly all subproject structures financed under PROADEL are technically
sound and well constructed. However, the economic viability of the subprojects financed
under PROADEL-1 remains uncertain, and many subprojects (such as schools and health
centers) must rely on public-sector financing to carry on their operations. These
subprojects do generate significant non-monetary benefits, but their viability must be
ensured nonetheless. In contrast, all local water and economic subprojects (butcheries,
storing depots) have or will have subproject committees that collect money from users in
order to be ready for maintenance expenditures when needed. PROADEL has, throughout
its existence, insisted on budgeting and collecting enough funds for subprojects to ensure
good maintenance of their investments, regardless of whether they are for productive or
social purposes. In this respect, improved fundraising by decentralized administrative
units, already mentioned, could provide some help for social subprojects. (This support
would not have to cover 100 percent of operational and maintenance charges, however,
as social subprojects are capable of collecting small fees from beneficiaries - see Annex
5.) The risk of failing to maintain subprojects is evaluated as moderate, mainly because
the social infrastructures require public funds.
75.    Experienced staff for PROADEL. Since the project was formally closed, funding
constraints have forced the laying off of many project staff in the project head office and
almost all staff in regional offices, except for the M&E officers and some unskilled
workers (cleaners, security guards). Even the project administrator is on a temporary


                                            21
transfer from another project (VGCE). The erosion in implementation capacity will be
hard to reverse quickly. Replacement staff needed for the follow-on phase will be easy to
find, but few will come with appropriate experience. It led to the selection of an
international consulting firm to do the hiring. Bringing new staff up speed will take time,
although the challenge will be mitigated by the existence of manuals and training
materials developed during PROADEL I. This issue remains sensitive but the risk of not
having experienced staff for PROADEL 2 is evaluated as low if adequate measures are
taken in terms of selection and adequate complementary training.
76.    All other risks (technical, social, environmental, and stakeholder commitment) are
considered negligible.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory.
77.     The role of PROADEL was to complement its agricultural sister project, ASPOP,
in helping the Government to operationalize its Rural Development Support Program
(PIDR) and improve the provision of basic services in rural areas. In addition, project
financing was needed for a related program, that is, decentralization of Government
administration and services. The Bank had earlier committed to supporting Chad's
strategy for poverty reduction, and key elements in that strategy were decentralization
and community-based or -driven development. The Bank also financed a Project
Preparation Facility and advised the Government on the preparation and shared
experience from similar projects, for instance, in Burkina Faso and Niger. The appraisal
mission considered several alternatives, but eventually chose a long-term financing
mechanism (APL), a CDD approach which was still evolving in its conception with
reference to other projects, multi-activity intervention, and whole-hearted support for
decentralization. In view of the poverty-reduction strategies of the Government, the
objectives of the project were fully relevant at the time of preparation and the
components were appropriate.
78.     With the limited financial resources available, concentration on three regions--
sufficiently diverse to generate a good experience base to inform later scaling-up efforts--
was justified. The risk assessment was generally appropriate, although the Bank's design
team should have better anticipated the challenges posed by a new type of project, the
large size of the country, and long distances to the necessary service providers. Phasing
the start-up of project-supported activities over a two- to three-year period was a practical
choice, but the plans should have emphasized intensive training and guidance at all levels
to avoid the slow pace of implementation in the early years. Also, even though the M&E
manual was prepared well before appraisal, the M&E system turned out to be too
ambitious, and the systems eventually put in place to ensure collection of M&E data were
inadequate, especially when it came to evaluating the project impacts.
79.    Consistent with Bank policies prevailing at the time, the project design was not
subjected to a formal quality-at-entry review. Improvements to the project design were
discussed extensively during the decision meetings (which included participation of the

                                             22
Quality Assurance Group--QAG) and during the presentation of the project to the
Bank's Board of Executive Directors.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
80.     World Bank task teams carried out nine supervision missions during the project
period and monitored implementation progress by reading the quarterly and annual
reports produced by project management and by engaging in correspondence with
Government officials and the project management team (particularly for no-objections).
World Bank supervision missions were less frequent than would normally have been the
case because World Bank operations in Chad were first suspended and then disturbed by
the civil conflict (the Country Office closed for a full year). Generally speaking, the team
charged with supervising the project included a suitable mix of specialty skills, spread
among different missions. However, only one mission contained a specialist in
decentralization (a decentralization lawyer).11 The teams that carried out the supervision
missions generally included 1-3 World Bank staff from Washington or external
consultants; the remaining members of the teams usually were drawn from West Africa
resident missions, thus economizing on supervision costs. Government ministries and
agencies participated in all supervision missions, and so, occasionally, did the co-
financier, AFD. Extensive aide-memoires recorded the main findings of the missions and
provided adequate guidance to improve implementation performance. The MTR
mission--carried out very late--generated a series of recommendations that among other
things resulted in an attempt to revise some of the performance indicators.
81.    The performance ratings recorded in the Implementation Support Reports (ISRs)
were originally lenient, reflecting the consensus view of the task team that time was
needed to get this new type of project started.12 The ratings became stricter toward the
end of the project, providing Bank management with more objective and more useful
information needed to identify measures to improve project performance. Faced with
evidence that performance was lagging, the supervison team can be credited with taking
proactive measures to turn the project around, including convincing the Government to
replace the underperforming project coordinator.
82.     A noteworthy deficiency in the supervision effort was the failure to resolve the
weakness of the project's M&E system. This weakness was evident from the inception of
the project, when it emerged that no baseline survey had been carried out, and it was
subsequently reinforced when it became clear that many of the performance indicators
specified in the results framework were not being collected. While it is true that
supervision teams regularly noted this problem in ISRs, no effective action was ever
taken to resolve the problem and this situation complicated the ICR process. The M&E
team was however able to speed-up and to provide most of the needed indicators with
regard to the PDO.

     Specialists from the Ministry of Decentralization participated in the implementation support missions.

     In 2006 and part of 2007, progress toward achievement of the PDO was rated unsatisfactory, but this
     did not reflect the actual performance of the Project. Following the cessation of Bank operations in
     Chad, management directed that the unsatisfactory rating be applied to all Bank projects in the country.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
83.     Based on the soundness of the project design, the adequation of the project
objectives given the needs and potential of the country and its rural population, and the
reasonably solid supervision effort (admittedly hampered by two interruptions of the
Bank programs), the overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
84.     The Government made important contributions in the implementation of the
project and showed its commitment to the project during the first phase. It had put in
place strategies to reduce poverty (PRSP) and promote rural development (PIDR); and it
prepared the project using its own personnel and consultants under the leadership of a
special committee and high-level staff.
85.      During the project, the Government took the following actions:
·     Provided counterpart funds although below the agreed budgets throughout the project
      and continued to do so after the project's closing date, thus keeping alive the
      possibility that the project objectives would be reached.
·     Required staff of the key ministries (the ministries dealing with land management,
      decentralization, and environment) to undergo project-financed training, and required
      the ministries to support the project's field activities and participate in the
      multiagency teams supervising the project.
·     Promptly endorsed the recommendations of the supervision missions.
·     Changed the project management staff when the project leaders proved inadequate to
      attain the expected results.

86.     These positive contributions by the Government were however offset by a number
of shortcomings in the support provided to the project by the Government.
·     Project effectiveness--essentially controlled by the Government--was delayed by six
      months due to delays in meeting the effectiveness conditions.
·     Throughout the life of the project, chronic delays in paying the annual counterpart
      funds and failure to contribute part of the committed funds made it difficult to
      implement the disbursement categories where Government financing was needed.
·     At the end of the first phase, the ICR team work was complicated by delays in the
      preparation of the national completion report (transmitted on November 8, 2010) and
      of the impact assessment (a preliminary draft was available only on November 29,
      2010).
·     These difficulties highlight the complexity of Government processes for approval of
      procurement decisions and replenishment of funds.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance


                                             24
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
87.    The main implementing agencies are the project implementation unit (including
the national office and three regional offices), as well as the coordinating service
providers. These agencies made a number of important contributions to successful
implementation:
·   Establishment of the project management unit with new staff and field organization
    and recruitment of service providers before project effectiveness or soon thereafter.
·   Successful promotion and financing of an impressive number of project-supported
    activities. Most of the burden was apparently carried by the regional offices and the
    supervising service provider, together with other service providers, and, as the final
    results show (Annexes 2 and 10), they did their work quite well.
·   Conscientious adherence to a major tenet of the project implementation strategy--
    popular participation and consultation with beneficiaries and stakeholders--and
    provision of the necessary training.
·   Carrying out of numerous studies that improved understanding of the complexities of
    rural development and implementation of CDD projects (see Annex 9)
·   Effective work, toward the end of the project, in achieving results on the ground and
    meeting the triggers for entering the second phase of the program.

88.     The performance of the implementing agencies was not without some problems,
however, and the Governement ICR strongly stressed their weaknesses. Areas in which
their contribution could arguably have been better include the following:
·   Delays in the recruitment of (attributable partly to complex AFD and Government of
    Chad procurement regulations).
·   Weak quality control of the coordinating service provider and its subconsultants
    (local development NGOs) which were hired on a fixed rate basis. This choice led to
    a "cookie cutter" approach to the preparation of the Local Development Plans which
    affected their overall quality.
·   Inadequate M&E system for impact evaluation, although basic records for
    management purposes were kept throughout the project (the M&E system improved
    toward the end).
·   Inadequate budget control regarding the linkages with annual and quarterly plans,
    inaccurate accounting and misplacement of cost items (into the management and
    M&E component), giving an appearance of excessive management costs.
·   Failure to ensure that NGOs and technical and engineering service providers were
    paid on time or at all.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
89.     Taking into account the performance of the Government and the performance of
the implementation agencies, Overall Borrower Performance is rated as Moderately
satisfactory. The negative aspects observed in both are offset by the achievements that at
the end were close to the targets set at midterm. The disbursement lag prevalent in the
early project years was eliminated before the extended project period ended due to
Borrower committement.

6. Lessons Learned
90.     CDD approaches are challenging to implement. An important lesson emerging
from PROADEL-1 is that bottom-up development projects that use CDD approaches are
challenging to implement, because they require extensive support with respect to capacity
building. Projects that use CDD approaches involve more actors and many more phases
(e.g., sensitizing the target population, identifying and prioritizing community needs,
formulating subprojects, managing the approval process, contracting with service
providers, constructing facilities, transferring money, making payments, and properly
maintaining constructed facilities). Implementing such projects is particularly challenging
in rural areas, where public services and institutions are often limited or nonexistent and
where poverty levels are daunting. This is the case of Chad where the long-standing
centralized form of government posed an additional challenge.
91.      Participatory approaches create expectations that can be difficult to meet. To the
extent that projects based on participatory CDD approaches succeed in mobilizing rural
communities to articulate their development needs, they have a tendency to generate
expectations that may be difficult to meet if significant amounts of financing cannot be
mobilized. PROADEL-1 was able to respond to only a small proportion of the demand
that was created: 5,840 local development assemblies were established under the Project,
but only 405 subprojets were financed and completed. To avoid possible frustration, this
reality should be kept in mind when subsequent phases of the Project are designed.
92.     Capacity of local communities to contribute co-financing may be limited. The
Project design called for beneficiaries to contribute 10 percent of subproject costs, but
beneficiaries were able to contribute only 3 percent on average, and a significant part of
their contributions was in kind (e.g., labor, local building materials). The lower than
expected rate of co-financing reflects the extreme poverty prevailing throughout much of
rural Chad, which constrains the ability of beneficiaries to mobilize resources for social
infrastructure. The inability of many rural communities to contribute co-financing has
important implications for the design of subsequent phases of the Project and suggests
that there is a need to identify ways to lower the cost of subprojects, for example through
innovative design.
93.     Capacity building is a long-term process. A consistent message heard from many
stakeholders was the importance of continuing the capacity building activities that were
launched during the first phase of the project. While the capacity building activities
carried out under PROADEL-1 were extensive (see Annex 2.4), testimony from many
stakeholders interviewed by the ICR mission as well as the Government ICR suggest that


                                            26
too often the emphasis was on meeting quantitative targets, and that the quality of the
local development process often suffered. During subsequent phases of the Project,
follow-up training will be needed to consolidate progress achieved in terms of bulding
decentralized capacity and to further strengthen communities' ownership of the local
development process.
94.     CDD approaches can be used to empower vulnerable groups. PROADEL-1
demonstrated that by encouraging vulnerable groups to participate actively in local
decision-making processes, CDD approaches can effectively empower these groups,
amplify their voices, and ultimately improve their status in society. PROADEL
deliberately promoted participation by women and youth in needs identification
exercises, for example by making sure that the three-person training teams (animateurs)
always included at least one woman. This ensured that the needs and concerns of
vulnerable groups received attention and ensured that the interests of these groups were
adequately represented in the selection of subprojects to be funded.
95.     Project management and oversight functions should not be politicized.
Implementation of PROADEL-1 was hampered at times by weaknesses in the Project
management team resulting from the politicization of key staffing decisions, as well as by
the overly interventionist stance of the Steering Committee. It goes without saying that
selection of key staff must be nonpolitical and based strictly on merit. Chad disposes
many experienced project managers and technical specialists, so if recruitment processes
are conducted openly and transparently, it should be possible to recruit staff with the
requisite skills and experience. Where skill gaps are identified, additional training on
local development can be considered. Similarly, the role of the Steering Committee
should be limited to review and approval of annual budgets, as well as providing
guidance on key issues. The Steering Committee should not get involved in operational
decisions, such as clearing the recruitment of staff.
96.     Results frameworks and M&E plans must be realistic given capacity constraints.
The results framework and the associated M&E plan for PROADEL-1 turned out to be
extremely ambitious given the limited capacity available for their implementation. The
Project M&E manual called for the collection of far too much information, excessively
frequent reporting, and the use of overly sophisticated analytical procedures. The data
needed to report on many performance indicators proved impossible to collect in a
country the size of Chad, especially since some indicators had to be collected from
hundreds of subprojects. In subsequent phases of the Project, it will be important to revise
the M&E manual in light of what is possible, with the goal of restricting regular data
collection activities to focus on information that is critical for project implementation and
supervision. Performance indicators should not be limited to quantitative outputs but also
include quality indicators related to ownership of the local development process,
adequacy of LDPs with local conditions instead of more standardized documents, and
effective management capacity of the subprojects.

1/ Project accounts have been kept only in FCFA, and an attempt to convert the amounts
used for different components into dollars in retrospect would be inaccurate because of
the varying exchange rates over the project period and because no records have been kept
on the past exchange rates. However, as the latest estimate is based on actual accounting
figures, the fourth column provides a good illustration of the percentages of funds
planned and funds used for different components.
2/ The dollar amounts in the PAD have been converted into FCFA by using the original exchange rate 5.31.
Because of the dollar devaluation in relation to SDR (the grant currency), there still was US$200,000
(0.8%) available for disbursement at the time of the ICR mission.

1/ The project accounts were kept only in FCFA. The contributions were provided in
different currencies over the five-year period (AFD in euros and FCFA; Government and
local communities in FCFA; and World Bank in dollars, whose amount has depended on
the changing exchange rate between SDR and dollar. Any presentation of all the
financing in dollars would thus be inaccurate. (For the actual/latest estimate of the World
Bank financing, a median exchange rate of 5.01 has been used. Because of exchange
variations over time, the use of Bank fund in dollar terms and in FCFA terms are not the
same.)

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Limited beneficiary survey
No beneficiary survey was carried out during the project period, neither after the completion of
the project. However, the ICR mission interviewed close to 100 beneficiaries during the field
visits. The interviewees included subproject members, different levels of project committees, and
local administrations (altogether 17 meetings). The following summarizes the outcomes of this
"mini-survey."

The methodology was based on an open approach, allowing the discussants to present their
opinions freely, but at the same time aiming at getting them to answers questions about the
approach used, the importance of the financial and technical support given, problems
encountered, social issues such as the gender situation, and the future needs of the community.

(This mini-survey is not considered to represent all the project areas because the sample was
small and the survey concentrated on two of the three project regions (Moundou and
N'Djamena), N'Djamena being the one where the activities started last, only about two years
ago).

Approach used for implementation of subprojects
The members of the communities had become familiar with the community-driven development
(CDD) approach or at least had heard of it under other programs or from the neighboring
communities. Thus they were receptive to getting the information agents ("animateurs")15 to visit
their villages and organize meetings for the members of the community. In all cases except one,
these animation groups were the source that brought the first news about the details of the
PROADEL program and the opportunities it offered. In one village, some 10 km away from the
main roads, younger people who had traveled further, were the first source of information about
the forthcoming PROADEL, and in that village the preliminary subproject plans were waiting for
the animators when they came. The animators also helped the villages, village groups and
quarters in towns to form development committees (Assemblée communataire de
développement--ACD) and to prepare local development plans.

The ACDs were responsible for managing the implementation of the subprojects, including
making contracts and taking care of the payments.16 For formulating the technical documents for
subprojects and preparation of the financing requests and procurement documents the ACDs
recruited technical service providers (Cabinets d'ingénieurs conseils), and for construction and
equipping the subproject facilities they contracted engineering enterprises.

All the subproject beneficiaries were satisfied with the help they had received from the animators
and technical service providers. They were equally satisfied with the structures built by the
engineering firms, but pointed out that there had been a few problems especially with deep wells
that in a couple of cases had not reached the aquifer level or after a while had not produced as
15
     NGOs recruited by the Coordinating Service Provider ("Opérateur Ensemblier") to be the trainers and
     advisors to villages and to assist them in organizing the village planning meetings, preparing Local
     Development Plans, and prioritizing the order of the subprojects to be financed.
16
     These procedures were according to the Project Operations Manual of 2002, which was essentially
     based on the World Bank 1978 document "Guidelines for simplified community-based procurement
     and disbursement."



                                                   41
much water as expected. However, in most cases the engineering firms had made the necessary
improvements within the guarantee period. (During the ICR mission an ACD committee pointed
out a crack in a wall of one grain store and the engineer accompanying the mission promised that
it will be repaired.)

The villagers highly appreciated the information, training, and technical assistance they had
received through the project. The ACDs were now confident that they know the procedures well
enough to be able to manage subproject implementation the next time without any outside
assistance except for design of the structures, for which they would need to recruit technical
service providers. In the discussions with the ICR team, it appeared that the villagers who had
participated in training organized by the animators had internalized the principal elements of the
procedures. As a result, there seemed to be a new sense of social dynamism among the villagers.
(This self-containment view was contradicted by the all service provider, that is, both the
animating NGOs and technical service providers and well as the Bank's procurement specialist--
see Annex 6 on Stakeholders' views).

Benefits of the subprojects
The beneficiaries had retained well information about the benefits of the different types of
subprojects, indicating that the animators and village meetings had served the intended purpose.
For instance, for the deep wells ("forages") they were able to list the following benefits:
    - Now clean drinking water was available close by, both saving time for women who had
        earlier to fetch water from a distance;
    - Villagers (and people of neighboring villages) were now able to enter productive
        activities that require water (small-scale gardening and establishing nursaries);
    - Other economic benefits such as increased the number of cattle and watering trees had
        become possible; and
    - Clean waer allowed maintaining better health.

As another example, the beneficiaries mentioned benefits of schools, such as:
    - Improved literary rates;
    - Better teaching facilities (earlier the schools were held under big trees without tables and
       fixed blackboards);
    - Increasing the number of students. New schools appealed better to parents so that they
       would send their daughters to school. For instance in Bokora, in the semi-desert town 270
       km northeast from the capital, the school enrolment in five classes (three of them built by
       project financing) was 285 student, and 105 of them were girls (37 percent).

The beneficiaries also understood the necessity for maintenance of the constructed facilities. In all
subprojects visited, the ACD committee collected small fees from the users for maintenance
purposes. For instance in a subproject of a mini-water tower in Mayaguine Canton the money
collected was FCFA 175,000 (equivalent of US$365, but with much higher purchasing power) by
charging FCFA 100 (US$0.21) for each 200 liters of water. At the new school in Bokoro the
parents-students association collected FCFA 1,000 (US$2.20) per year for a male student and
FCFA 500 (US$1.10) for a girl to help in maintenance and small education needs. (Primary
education is otherwise free in Chad.)

An important benefit mentioned by the villagers was that the local development plans (LDP--
Plans de développement local) could also be used for getting funds from other sources than
PROADEL for subprojects that could not be financed under this project.




                                                 42
Gender and youth
The original Project Development Objective stated that "particular attention will be paid on
women, youth and marginalized groups." 17Among the 405 subprojects financed under the
project, only two are women-owned (Centres de couture) and all the rest are "mixed," that is,
contain both men and women as members and beneficiaries. However, PROADEL has been
instrumental in promoting women and improving their status in the communities where the
project is active. In project committees at all levels there are women members, and the ICR
mission noted that in all ACDs for village groups and subprojects there are one or two women
members. As for the youth, they are even better represented in the ACDs, because in the
subprojects that the ICR team visited, there were present 2 to 3 youths. The ICR mission did
observe that other underrepresented groups, such transhumant herders were not included in the
same manner in ACDs, which would also have been more complicated due to their transient way
of life. However, the LDPs included land management sections that provided them and their
cattle with safe corridors and sometimes even a cattle well (in Bokoro).

The positive development in this respect was caused apparently by two facts: (a) every three-
member animation team organized by project-financed NGOs and going to the field contained
one woman; and (b) they presented in the villages the project objective for underprivileged
sections of the population and possibly in the manner that involvement of women and youth was
a premise for getting financing for subprojects.

The mission's visits were at the daytime, and although the beneficiaries reported the involvement
of women and youth with obvious contentment, no women attended the meetings of the ICR
mission at subproject sites or with the different levels of committees. (Women and girls were told
to be "in the houses or in the fields".) There were several young men present at each subproject
site.

Problems encountered
In the first instance of interviews, the members of subprojects said that there had been no
problems. However, when discussing the topic further, some problems that had been encountered
emerged, such as:

     -   At the ACD level (usually covering several villages) there were more priority subproject
         ideas than was possible to implement (even in the most active ACDs not more than three
         subprojects were allowed under the first phase of the program). Also, because most of the
         ACDs contained several villages, some dissatisfaction had arisen among the villages
         because of the place selected for the subproject was not in their village;
     -   There had been far too many subprojects for the cantonal CCCDs (Cadre cantonal de
         concertation pour le développement) to consider and some villages had to be left out or
         made to use temporality the facilities built in nearby villages;
     -   The utilization level of grain storage facilities built (usually 300 tons) were severely
         underutilized during the first year, bringing very little income to the respective subproject
         committees. They had, however, plans to carryout information campaigns in neighboring
         villages to improve the use of utilization levels;
     -   Some village groups that had received the first training by animators had not received no
         other assistance and no subprojects. In these cases the problem apparently was in lacking

17
     The various marginalized groups are listed in Lutte contre la marginalisation prepared by the
     Opérateur ensemblier), November 2006. (See listing in Annex).



                                                 43
        initiatives among the villagers, because the neighboring village groups could have had
        more than one subproject at the same time;
    -   Some deep wells had not produced the water promised and the engineering firms had to
        come back to increase the depth of the wells (and at least in one case the well site was
        abandoned);
    -   Signing of the contract between PROADEL and the ACDs had to take place at the
        regional office of the project, sometimes 200-300 km away, which was considered
        expensive and difficult for the ACD committees;
    -   An account had to be opened in a bank for the cash deposit required for approval of a
        subproject, and sometimes the nearest bank can be more than 200 km away (as in
        Bokoro).

Supervision reports and the mid-term report of PROADEL have indicated that contribution of 10
percent of the investment by the beneficiaries was seen too high (the same is also implied by the
fact that the total financing by beneficiaries was below the PAD estimates). The ACDs or review
and approval committees that the ICR mission met at different levels did not consider the
contribution level as an obstacle as such, especially as part of the contribution could be in kind
(land, materials, labor). An obstacle in this respect was that the villagers had been given to
understand (by politicians?) that everything would be free because the country now had oil
revenue. In addition, there had been some misunderstanding about the nature of the in-kind
contributions and their valuation, because they were not mentioned in the contracts.

Also, the villagers did not consider it a problem that the implementation period for a subproject
commonly extended to one to two years from animation to reception of the facility. The ICR
mission concluded that their expectations in this respect were not very high.

Future needs
As already indicated, the demand for subprojects has been much large that the funds available
have allowed to finance. For instance, the number of subproject documents prepared for the
consideration of the sous-prefectoral committee of Mayaguine Canton, subprojects were 36, of
which only 26 were possible to finance. In the same canton, there are 45 villages and only seven
wells.

The visited ACDs mentioned their future priorities of subprojects to include, in a varying order in
different communities:

    -   School buildings to replace the Ecoles saccos (under trees);
    -   Canteens and fencing for schools
    -   Health centers;
    -   Grain stores;
    -   Deep wells and wells for animal herders; mini-water towers
    -   Mosques;
    -   Vehicles to transport grain sacks and village needs;
    -   Culture or sport centers for the youth;
    -   Animal vaccination centers; and
    -   Transit corridors for cattle.

An apparent need, but not mentioned by the current beneficiaries, would be find a solution to the
drudgery of grinding grains, which affect in particular women and girls. In the neighboring
countries some groups have obtained flour mills under the projects financed by the World Bank,



                                                44
and although many of these mills have not worked well or have broken down, with the fee
collection, maintenance and bookkeeping culture already established in Chad they would have a
good chance to be successful.

At appraisal, feeder roads had been believed to become oen of the priorieties. However, none of
them was as high in the prioroty list as several other needs and had not been financed under this
phase of the program.

Observations on local governance
The project authorities that the ICR mission met at the local level (representatives of traditional
authority, cantonal, sub-prefectural and departmental levels) confirmed that the project had been
very important for development of their areas (commonly saying that "without PROADEL we
would have nothing at all of the type of subprojects we now have). Also, they confirmed that they
had received training to carry out their activities for the project, but also emphasized that more is
needed, for instance for procurement. As for future needs, they mentioned essentially the same
types of subprojects, but in addition the mayor of Bokora (member of the departmental approval
committee) brought up the need to improve the leisure facilities such as parks with more trees.

The civic authorities were not as satisfied with the competencies at the subproject level as the
ACD committees, mentioning problems of procurement and lack of adequate capacity among the
engineering enterprises.

As for decentralization, the governmental and elected authorities emphasized the importance of
PROADEL not only for having helped in developing the legislation, but also as facilitator of
training of civil servants and elected bodies and as provider of a variety of equipment for offices,
including computers. They also suggested that more training would be needed at all levels of
decentralization, possibly in form of well-panned workshops or seminars, to ensure the
consolidation of the decentralization steps taken. However, they were confident that they will
successful manage the sub-departmental elections planned for April-June 2011.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.         Stakeholder workshops
The ICR mission met with key stakeholder representatives in individual or small group sessions.
The stakeholders met included the following:

     (a)   the Secretary General and other senior officials of the Ministry of Land Management,
           Urbanism and Habitat, which is the supervising ministry for the project and which chairs
           the Steering Committee,
     (b)   the Secretaries General and other senior officials of the line ministries that were directly
           involved with the project (i.e., the Ministries of Planning and Economy, Decentralization,
           and Environment);
     (c)   the Coordinator of the Cellule Permanente de Suivi that is in charge of monitoring of all
           externally financed projects;
     (d)   PROADEL management and senior staff;
     (e)   Staff of PROADEL Regional Coordination Units;
     (f)   Private sector operators, that is, NGOs pour animation and prestataires de service
           (technical advisory agencies and engineering firms), which have assisted in implementing
           subprojects);
     (g)   The development partners that are most active in rural development in Chad (AFD, EU,
           GTZ, and the World Bank).

2.         Methodology
Stakeholders were asked the following key questions:

·      What was the relationship of your ministry/agency/organization vis-à-vis the project? In other
       words, how did your ministry/agency/organization engage with the project?
·      What were the most significant results/achievements of the project?
·      What were the main problems encountered that negatively affected implementation of the
       project?
·      What are the most important lessons learned from the project and its implementation that can
       help to inform the design of a follow-on project in Chad, or similar projects in other
       countries?

3.         Main achievements
All of the stakeholders interviewed expressed appreciation for the achievements of the project, a
couple of the Government representatives even saying that "this is the best project we have had."
They strongly endorsed the general approach of the project, i.e., decentralization of service
provision and administrative structures and bringing development finance to the local level and
helping rural communities to decide on their priorities in a participatory manner. They also
emphasized that for the participatory approach to be effective, it needs to be provided with even
more of information, training, and technical support.




                                                   46
In their own work and organizations they attributed several results to the project. As a summary,
the public- and private-sector partners reported that the project had:

·   Despite a slow start (the activities really started in January 2006), the project succeeded in
    achieving its main goals in terms of subprojects, as 428 subprojects have been planned on the
    basis participative and local development approach, 405 of them have been financed, 341
    completed, and the rest are under work. Altogether 174 cantonal Local Development Plans
    have been prepared, and they cover the key project areas, each including several cantons, and
    including hundreds more of potential subprojects.
·   Awareness of PROADEL facilities have been spread to a large number of villages, where it
    trained and helped organize as many as 5,840 villages to participate in local development
    groups (Assemblée communautaire de développement). All this is an important step for
    making the local population responsible for their own development ("changement de
    mentalite"), participating in the selection of their own priorities, and giving them a certain
    degree of autonomy. (There also was an opinion that the local people do not still feel fully
    responsible for their subprojects.) The demand of subprojects is now estimated to be in
    thousands
·   Because the project was among the first in the field of decentralization and also in some areas
    in community-driven development, it initially served as a pilot program and developed
    approaches and methodologies that facilitating more extensive efforts to come.
·   The basic procedures, from the decisions of priorities in the villages to formulating and
    implementing subprojects, have now been developed and tried out, and they provide a basis
    for a countrywide approach if finances so allow. The project also allowed correcting the
    earlier expectations of the local people that they did not need to make their own contribution
    to get new facilities and services.
·   Through linking with and partial financing of the Volet Gestion Communautaire des
    Ecosystems project, PROADEL ensured environmental protection and improvement
    activities, reforestation schemes, and enforcement of environmental standards relating to
    infrastructures.
·   The project combined the necessary decentralization effort that the Government had
    promoted since the previous decade and the community development approach to the fight
    against the poverty in Chad. The decentralization is needed for the country as the basis of
    long-term development, but, in addition, local development requires local initiative, skills,
    investments, and involving of all population there through a participatory approach.
·   The decentralization effort has advanced on the legislative side as most of the key laws and
    regulations have been drafted with the help of PROADEL financing and largely approved,
    providing a basis for organizing local administrations (some laws and regulations are still
    pending) and preparations for local elections at the subprefecture level. The project also
    acquired or facilitated acquiring of information technology and materials for the departmental
    administrations. As preparation for the local elections, PROADEL has helped to finance the
    defining the arears and borders of 200 communes.
·   The project facilitated organization of workshops, seminars, and conferences for training for
    capacity buildings among the local populations, the participating agencies and NGOs, and the
    Government administration at the national, regional and departmental levels.
·   In the departments, the officials appreciated that project had allowed an increase in the
    coverage of wells (the demand for more is still great), facilitating potable water to thousands
    of people, as well as building of new schools and health centers.
·   The private technical service provider and engineering firms were particularly satisfied with
    new contract opportunities that the LDPs brought up, and while not always making profit,
    PROADEL gave opportunities to expand their sphere of work and employment opportunities


                                                47
     for their staff and workers, and, as partners of a World Bank-financed project, important
     exposure and contacts in the country.
·    For these firms a major achievement was that they were able to complete 341 of the 405
     subprojects started despite the various delays and payment problems they encountered (see
     the next section about problems). Also the rest are expected to be completed within next few
     months.
·    The project also helped substantially in establishing offices for land management
     (Observatoire de Foncier), land recording, and training in land-management aspects.
·    Despite the communications and other problems between the four project offices, project
     finances have been recorded properly (after numerous corrections), annual accounts have
     been audited by qualified auditors, and audits have been unqualified. Project monitoring and
     evaluation arrangements have improved, the M&E unit has prepared detailed annual plans,
     and during the last two years--after the mid-term review--the projects M&E reporting has
     become satisfactory.

4.       Problem areas and difficulties
Stakeholders also recognized that a number of problems had arisen during implementation of
PROADEL and that they should be avoided in any eventual follow-on operation:

·    Because of a very slow start of the project (blamed on inefficient management), the
     supervising ministry and the World Bank implementation support missions became very
     much involved in project management and implementation. Most views were that this
     involvement probably saved the project (200 subprojects were processed and implemented in
     the last less than two years. However, there also was a contrary view among the stakeholders
     according to which the Government and the World Bank should maintain an advisory and
     oversight role and not start "running the projects" ("il faut responsabiliser l'équipe").
·    When dismissing a project management team, it always takes months for the new team to
     catch up the working level of the previous team. In the case of PROADEL, after removing
     the original project management team after mid-term, there still were two more changes in
     top management because of resignations or staff transfers.
·    The World Bank teams did not work enough with the Cellule Permanente de Suivi (however,
     they visited this unit during missions). Also, the gap between World Bank projects (in this
     case between the phases) is harmful for effective implementation of the program.
·    Training at the field level of ACDs and various project committees was inadequate to make
     them really familiar with their duties partly because the project represented a piloting exercise
     and also because there was a rush during the last two years of the project to catch up with the
     indicator targets. (Most stakeholders mentioned procurement problems and that the capacity
     of service providers was often not adequate.) Also, under the decentralization component
     more training would be needed.
·    When the international coordinating service provider (Opérateur Ensemblier) left at the end
     of their contract in early 2010, the activities seemed to stop in many areas in the field.
·    Delays in the disbursement of government counterpart funding resulted in frequent
     disruptions to the project implementation schedule, delaying the timely implementation many
     field activities. However, when the project ended in June 2010, the Government continued to
     supply funds, thus facilitating completion of subprojects that had been financed during the
     project period. (At the time of the ICR mission, 65 subprojects had not been finished.)




                                                  48
·   The quantity and sometimes the quality of technical assistance provided to the project by the
    service providers (technical engineers and contractors) was sometimes inadequate, especially
    the technical assistance relating to management of water resources. A reason for this problem
    was the far-away location of many subprojects where the service providers were able to
    employ only engineers just out of school (but where they gained experience necessary for
    their trade.) On the other hand, because no consideration had been given in the contracts for
    differing physical conditions (especially the distance to the work area) and population
    readiness for starting a subproject, NGOs and other ervice providers had to accept contracts
    that they knew were not profitable for them.
·   The cost projections during project preparation and at appraisal were unrealistic, resulting in
    consistent underestimation of subproject costs. As a result, the projected numbers of
    subprojects to be financed was too large, and more subprojects were planned than could
    eventually be financed. (This situation was partly corrected at mid-term, when it was better
    known what type of subprojects the population wanted and what were their costs; at appraisal
    the types of priority subprojects could not be more than "educated guesses.")
·   Implementation of many subprojects was delayed by late payments to contractors
    (entrepreneurs) and other service providers (irregularité de financement des microprojets).
    Many technical service providers and contractors had to wait for 6 to 12 months for their
    payments, or even longer.
·   Service providers also experienced socio-economic difficulties and difficulties in getting
    consensus when an ACD sometimes comprised as many as 10 villages of different sizes and
    should have included besides local pastoralists, also transhumant herders and other
    underprivileged groups.
·   The flow of funds was slow at all levels. Replenishments requests addressed to the World
    Bank took longer time than necessary, even though the Financial Monitoring System was
    supposed to speed up disbursements. The Government's counterpart contributions were late.
    Transactions between the central PMU and the regional LPMUs and subprojects also
    frequently took weeks or even months, usually because the needed supporting documents had
    not been provided. The lack of financial institutions outside major cities is also a factor that
    slows down the money flow. Also, there was nobody guiding ACDs in the payment issues,
    and they made errors (this task was not in the TOR of either the animators or technical
    advisory agencies.)
·   The contributions required from local communities was too high because of the general
    poverty, especially in the more remote areas where cash economy is not very common and
    among the marginalized groups. This situation led in a few cases to abandoning of the
    subproject. Also, it appeared that at least in the N'Djamena region, the Government
    (politicians) had indicated that the population did not need to provide any contribution, but
    everything was free.
·   When it took a along time to implement a subproject, the prices of materials increased and
    caused financial problems, even losses to service providers. Also, the service providers ran
    out of funds as no prefinancing was provided for their services.
·   The whole decentralization activity has been slow and resources limited.
·   In principle, decentralization should cover the whole country; it is difficult politically to
    explain to people in left-out provinces and departments why their turn would come later,
    although economically it seems reasonable. There also was lack of written material for local




                                                49
     administration (GTZ/Government collected the decentralization laws and regulations into one
     book to be distributed to new councelors, but this book may need to be updated.)
·    There is no juridical status for the Local Development Plans and ACDs that could be used in
     potential disbutes.
·    For the Observatoire foncier the process of funding has been slow, as it had first to
     prefinance the activitiees from its own budget and then get the eligible items refunded from
     the project (there was no convention). This unit would have liked more flexibility in using the
     funds. Also, the students under this university-run unit suffered from financial problems and
     would have needed scholarships.
5.       Lessons learned
Based on the positive achievements of the project but also in recognition of the problem areas and
difficulties, stakeholders identified lessons learned in a number of areas.

Project management. 18

·    An experienced project management team is very important for the start and eventual success
     of the project. Selection of the key staff must be non-political and strictly based on merit.
     Academic qualifications are not an adequate basis, and as Chad already possess experienced
     project managers and other senior project staff, only those with earlier experience in similar
     assignments and proven initiative should be chosen for so important and innovative projects
     as those supporting decentralization and local, participative development.
·    Monitoring and evaluation manuals are often asking too much information and also asking
     for it on regular, usually quarterly basis. Much of such information is not possible to collect
     in such a large country as Chad and from hundreds of subprojects or governmental units. In
     M&E manuals and PADs it would be important to concentrate "on the possible" and on
     information and data that are critical for project implementation. For more general, impact
     oriented indicators, special studies should be carried out the for instace every two years.
Project design
·    The project design for local development was relatively simple and the participatory
     approach had been at least partially experimented under ASPOP and bilateral field programs.
     However, PROADEL was still correctly started in one region, and then annually extended to
     two more regions, because it was known that project's field work would be challenged by the
     limited implementation capacity.
·    The projects can be designed in such a way (for instance in phasing their implementation)
     that not many preconditions are needed. (An opinion: Le PROADEL était le premier projet au
     Chad sans ces conditions).
·    The contracts for subprojects, while providing guidance for their contents and costs, should
     also allow taking into account the different geographical and other conditions (for instance
     allowing inclusion of transport and additional material costs for far-away locations). Also, a
     guarantee fund or payment system should be developed for the case that ACD committees
     abandon their subproject or misuse the allocated funds. The loss should not be on the service
     providers who have done their work properly.


18
     Problems with project management and management of human resources was mentioned by nearly all
     the stakeholders



                                                 50
Capacity building
·   Although more training would have been needed and the training should be provided before
    entering into the cycle of subprojects, local communities benefited from the training and
    capacity building facilitated by the project. This empowered them to become organized,
    identify development priorities in their own communities, prepare development plans, and
    prepare and implement subprojects identified in the development plans. Training was also
    beneficially for the Ministry of Decentralization and other ministries involved in the project,
    as well for the local governmental administrations in the project regions.
·   Training of ACD committees should continue after the subproject has been implemented (for
    instance to secure the committee's financial competence and maintenance of the facilities).
·   At the start of a project such as PROADEL, there may not be many competent service
    providers. Adequate training and guidance for the new aspirants may be needed.
Financial management of the project
·   Interruptions of disbursements by the World Bank slow down implementation progress,
    increase costs (because activities must be repeated), and compress the implementation time
    line. Therefore with projects such as PROADEL, the World Bank should be favorably
    disposed to grant extension requests (as it did in the case of PROADEL by extending the
    project period by a year.
·   Late payment and non-payment of service providers was a chronic problem. Measures must
    be found to ensure that in future contractual conditions and payment schedules will be
    respected by the project and especially by project beneficiaries in charge of implementing
    subprojects. The engineering firms and other service providers must be paid in timely
    fashion. One option would be to involve the technical service providers (Conseiller
    technique) in supervising the payments to be made by ACDs committees.
·   With the objective of ensuring equitable treatment for all service providers, PROADEL (like
    its agricultural-sector sister project ASPOP) introduced a standardized country-wide payment
    system for the preparation and implementation of subprojects. This turned out to be unfair,
    because the cost structure differed significantly in different parts of the country.
·   Shocks stemming from global economic downturns, dramatic and unanticipated changes in
    the exchange rate, suspensions of World Bank lending programs for political or other reasons,
    and other external factors often affect the amount of money available for the project purposes.
    In the case of PROADEL, it allowed more dollars to be disbursed (because of the rising rate
    of SDR), thus partially balancing the devaluation of dollar in relation to FCFA (from 1 dollar
    giving originally FCFA 535 and finally FCFA 475).
·   Many local ACDs that awarded contracts for project-supported subprojects were initially
    unfamiliar with simplified competitive bidding procedures such as those required for
    selection of service providers. Training in this respect improved the situation but not
    sufficiently, and more consolidation training will be needed in this respect even in the Phase I
    project areas. Although introduction of the competitive bidding procedures may have delayed
    the initiation of field work, use of the approved procedures enabled ACD committees in most
    cased to choose the best and least expensive NGOs and other service providers to carry out
    the field activities.
·   Decentralization is a complex, costly, and long-term program, and it should be given more
    time to be implemented. (Some bilaterals had given conditions for their participation that
    elections must be made at the certain date.)



                                                51
Donor coordination and harmonization

·   PROADEL, together with agricultural-sector sister project ASPOP, has played an influential
    role in Chad in introducing a new approach to the fight against the poverty, one that has been
    successfully integrated into the Government's strategic planning and decentralization effort.
    It has mobilized the Government and donors that are active in the rural development field to
    coordinate better around a common set of decentralized, participatory approaches
·   The few international financing agencies and bilaterals active in the local development field
    have worked in a relatively good harmony and aimed at learning from each other (for
    instance by participating in an GTZ-financed workshops). Currently, when the European
    Union is planning its second tranche of local assistance, it is basing the approach very much
    on the similar lines with PRODEL.

1/ RÉSUMÉ DU NIVEAU D'EXECUTION ET D'ATTEINTE DES OBJECTIFS
DU PROADEL19

Le Projet d'Appui au Développement Local (PROADEL) a pour objectif global de promouvoir le
développement local et la décentralisation par l'amélioration de l'accès des populations aux
services sociaux de base notamment la santé, l'éducation, l'alimentation en eau potable et à
l'utilisation rationnelle des ressources naturelles grâce au renforcement des capacités des
communautés en matière d'organisation, de planification, d'exécution des activités issues des
priorités de leurs plans de développement. Il vise également à permettre aux communautés locales
de certains écosystèmes fragiles du Tchad de mieux combattre la déforestation et la dégradation
des terres et mieux gérer les aires protégées.
Du fait de son ambition de s'attaquer à la situation de pauvreté des populations et de soutenir le
processus de décentralisation, le PROADEL s'inscrit dans un Projet à long termes. C'est
pourquoi, l'instrument APL (Adaptable Program Loan) a été choisi afin de disposer d'un horizon
flexible qui permet d'atteindre les objectifs.

La première phase du PROADEL, conduite de 2004 à 2010 poursuivait deux objectifs de
développement à savoir i) accroître l'accès aux services d'infrastructures de base dans des
communautés pauvres ciblées et améliorer la capacité locale des institutions et communautés à
gérer le processus de développement et ii) permettre aux communautés locales de certains
écosystèmes fragiles du Tchad de mieux combattre la déforestation et la dégradation des terres et
mieux gérer les aires protégées.

Cette première phase a été financée par l'Association pour le Développement International (IDA),
l'Agence Française de Développement (AFD), l'Etat du Tchad et les populations bénéficiaires
pour un montant total de 46 millions de dollars US.

La stratégie d'intervention a été basée sur trois principes fondamentaux qui sont i) une démarche
participative avec des interventions multisectorielles émanant des besoins exprimés par les
communautés, ii) le renforcement des capacités des communautés pour fixer des priorités,
planifier le développement au niveau locale, mettre en oeuvre des microprojets et iii) un
partenariat avec diverses institutions de l'Etat, le secteur privé et les ONG.

Le PROADEL a mis en place et a apporté son appui aux Assemblées Communautaires de
Développement (ACD) et aux Cadres Cantonaux de Concertation pour le Développement
(CCCD) répartis dans 19 départements du pays. De manière générale, la zone d'intervention
compte environ 2 600 000 habitants soit 25 % de la population du Tchad.

Au termes de cinq années d'exécution effective de ses activités, la première phase du PROADEL
a enregistré des résultats perceptibles sur le terrain. Ces résultats sont présentés ci-après selon une
démarche qui nous indique quel a été le niveau des fonds mobilisés, pour quelles réalisations
physiques et pour quels effets observés sur les bénéficiaires. Les résumés de ces résultats sont
présentés à travers cinq parties qui sont :

1. Les niveaux des effets observés par les bénéficiaires au cours de la première phase.

Les investigations menées sur la base des rapports internes (Suivi et évaluation), externes (Aides
mémoires des missions de supervision, rapports d'audit) et les rencontres des différents acteurs au
niveau central et au niveau du terrain ont permis de mettre en relief les principaux résultats
observés par les bénéficiaires. Ces résultats démontrent que le PROADEL a eu des effets
globalement acceptables malgré les différents évènements qui y ont pesé négativement dont
notamment :
    -    le retard de 8 mois pour l'approbation du marché de l'Opérateur Ensemblier chargé de
         préparer les communautés à l'élaboration des Plans de Développement Local (PDL) où
         sont identifiés les microprojets à financer ;
    -    la suspension des décaissements des fonds IDA intervenue le 6 janvier 2006 pour ne
         reprendre que le 15 mai 2006 et de ce fait la plupart des activités planifiées au premier
         semestre 2006 ont été décalées pour le second semestre 2006 ou reportées en 2007 ;
    -    L'adoption tardive du PTBA de l'année 2006 par le Comité Technique de Suivi (CTS) de
         la Consultation Sectorielle sur le Développement Rural assurant la fonction de Comité
         d'Orientation et de Pilotage (COP).

Toutefois, il y a lieu de noter que le projet n'a pas été géré avec rigueur et compétence par l'Unité
de Gestion du Projet (UGP). L'intervention du PROADEL a couvert 5215 Assemblées
Communautaires de Développement (ACD) et 210 Cadres Cantonaux de Concertation pour le
Développement (CCCD). Plus de 8 milliards de FCA ont été gérés par les communautés pour financer
leurs microprojets par les procédures de passation de marchés communautaires. L'analyse des
données de suivi-évaluation et les différents rapports sur les effets du projet démontrent le niveau
des résultats importants que le projet a obtenus, parmi lesquels on peut citer les éléments suivants :

En matière d'accès aux infrastructures socio-économiques de la zone du projet

le PROADEL a contribué significativement à augmenter la couverture des besoins en eau de 16
% à 20 % avec 204 points d'eau potable (181 forages, 21puits et 2 mini châteaux) réalisés (le taux
de couverture issu de la situation de référence du PROADEL est de 16% alors que le schéma
directeur de l'eau table sur 17%), à la couverture des besoins sanitaires (avec 11 centres de santé
et 3 centres d'accueil des personnes vivants avec le VIH/SIDA réalisés), à l'équipement en
infrastructures scolaires (avec 253 salles de classes construites), au renforcement des capacités
des jeunes à la création d'emplois (création de 9 centres culturels et de formation des jeunes et
adultes femmes et hommes). Ces infrastructures ont permis respectivement à près de 250 000
personnes d'accéder à l'eau potable (sur la base d'un point d'eau pour 1150 personnes (selon le
schéma directeur de l'eau, l'hydraulique villageoise vise à donner accès à l'eau potable aux
populations qui habitent dans des villages de moins de 2 000 personnes. Dans ce cas, les normes


                                                 54
actuelles (en 2002) d'attribution de points d'eau potable établies par l'Administration sont les
suivantes :
    - la population du village doit être supérieure à 300 personnes;
    - l'acceptation par les villageois des conditions de participation, soit la création d'un
        comité de gestion et la constitution d'une caisse-eau.), à près de 50 000 personnes
        d'accéder chaque année aux soins de santé de base (5000 personnes par centre de santé)
        et à près de 49 000 enfants d'étudier dans des conditions sécurisées. En tenant compte de
        la taille des populations des villages couverts on peut estimer que près de 2 600 000
        personnes ont bénéficié directement ou indirectement des activités du projet.
De ce fait, les populations bénéficiaires apprécient fortement les effets très positifs de ces
infrastructures dans l'amélioration de leurs conditions de vie.
Ces résultats auraient pu être meilleurs si des difficultés de planification, de gestion, et de suivi du
projet avaient été maîtrisées. Ces difficultés sont entre autres :
    -   La faible mobilisation des contributions des populations bénéficiaires (il reste un peu plus
        de 400 millions de F CFA auprès des communautés bénéficiaires que le projet n'arrive
        pas à mobiliser) ;
    -   L'insuffisance de planification adéquate dans le temps et l'espace des microprojets ;
    -   Le non payement à temps des décomptes financiers des entrepreneurs,
    -   Les délais de réalisation des infrastructures qui ont en général largement dépassé les
        délais prévus ;
    -   L'insuffisance de suivi des chantiers par les ingénieurs-conseils dont les prestations de
        services ne sont pas régulièrement payées dans les délais ;
    -   L'insuffisance de suivi des activités sur le terrain par les UGL ;
    -   L'insuffisance de l'application des mesures de sauvegarde environnementales et sociales
        dans l'exécution des microprojets.
En matière de Gestion Communautaire des Ecosystèmes
Sur la base des documents exploités, 192 microprojets ont été approuvés par les instances locales
dont 67 sont achevés et 56 en cours d'exécution et qui ont touché près de 72 000 bénéficiaires.
Des sites pilotes ont été retenus et aménagés avec la formation de près de 1050 personnes sur des
thèmes spécifiques divers comme la production et l'entretien de plants, la pisciculture,
l'apiculture, les foyers améliorés etc. Ces microprojets ont permis entre autres le reboisement de
sites dégradés, la vulgarisation de foyers améliorés auprès de 300 femmes pour réduire la
consommation du bois, la création de jardins botaniques, des mises en défens de ressources
halieutiques, l'aménagement de micro-barrages et des mares.
En matière de mise en place et de renforcement des capacités des structures locales :
L'appui financier de l'AFD à travers le PROADEL a permis la mise en place de 5215 ACD et
210 CCCD, et 19 CDSA. Ces différentes structures ont été mises en place et formées par des
ONG locales recrutées par l'opérateur ensemblier (OE). Cela a permis l'élaboration et l'adoption
au niveau communautaire de 174 Plans de développement local, démontrant ainsi une bonne
capacité des communautés locales à planifier leurs actions prioritaires.

Les ACD et les CCCD sont capables de définir leurs priorités et reconnaissent leurs droits. Aussi,
612 sessions de formations ou de campagne sensibilisation ont été réalisées sur 784 prévues. Au
regard des chiffres enregistrés, un nombre important de sessions de formation ont été organisées ;
cependant sur le terrain il a été constaté que les personnes formées ne maîtrisent pas le cycle de
mise en oeuvre et de gestion des infrastructures. Ceci atteste que la qualité de la formation est
insuffisante. Ceci est liée à un certain nombre de contraintes qui sont entre autres : i) une durée
très courte de temps de formation (maximum 2 jours) ii) des procédures de recrutements des
ONG locales qui ne sont pas basés sur l'appréciation à la fois de la qualité et le coût des
opérations envisagées, iii) l'insuffisance du suivi de ces ONG par l'OE, iv) des animateurs
recrutés sur le tas et peu expérimentés, v) un manque de synergie d'intervention entre l'OE et
l'UGP.
Ainsi, dans la plupart des cas les sessions de sensibilisation ont pris le pas sur les sessions de
formations formelles. Les rares formations dispensées par les ONG ne sont pas accompagnées
d'outils permettant aux communautés la maîtrise de la gestion de leurs activités notamment dans
les passations de marchés, la gestion financière, la tenue des réunions.
En matière d'appui à la décentralisation:

Les services du Ministère chargé de la Décentralisation estiment que l'exécution de cette
composante du projet a été satisfaisante car elle a permis l'adoption de 6 projets de lois et 47
projets de décrets d'application et la délimitation des territoires de 200 communes. De plus la
création des CCCD a permis de clarifier le niveau le plus pertinent pour l'implantation des
communautés rurales. C'est ainsi que le PROADEL a permis au Ministère concerné d'identifier
412 communautés rurales potentielles pour les futures élections.
Cependant l'appui du projet n'a pas été suffisant pour former les autres échelons locaux du
processus de décentralisation.
Le projet a appuyé l'Observatoire National du Foncier au Tchad par la formation de 10 spécialistes
dans le domaine foncier et la mise en place de 3 observatoires pilotes locaux du foncier. Ce qui a
permis de commencer à sensibiliser les acteurs à délivrer les actes fonciers au niveau communal et
de prévenir les conflits sociaux.

2. Les niveaux de performance sur la base des indicateurs de performance et déclencheurs
de phase

Le niveau de performance globale du PROADEL au cours de sa première phase d'exécution est
globalement acceptable comme l'indique les valeurs atteintes par les indicateurs de performances
et déclencheurs de phase. La majorité de ces indicateurs ont atteint et dépassé leurs cibles en fin
de phase. L'objectif de développement et ces indicateurs ont été revus lors de la revue à mi-
parcours et ont fait l'objet d'un suivi.
Au 26 octobre 2010, la situation des indicateurs de performance et déclencheurs de phase se
présente dans le tableau ci-après

   3. Niveaux des réalisations physiques du projet
La première phase du PROADEL a permis la réalisation de plusieurs activités qui ont touché la
vie socio-économique tant au niveau local que national notamment :

¾ Le financement de 341 microprojets dont les plus important sont 204 pour l'eau potable, 91
  bâtiments scolaires soit 253 salles de classes pour l'éducation primaire et secondaire, 9 pour
  l'éducation et la sensibilisation de la population, 14 pour la santé, et 15 infrastructures
  économiques. La nature des microprojets réalisée dénote le caractère multisectoriel du
  PROADEL.
  Pour la gestion communautaire des écosystèmes, 67 microprojets ont été achevés.

¾ Des formations diverses et des conseils au profit des organisations communautaires de base
  qui ont porté principalement sur i) la mise en place et le renforcement des capacités des
  organes de gestion, ii) l'élaboration des plans de développement local, et iii)
  l'accompagnement dans l'élaboration, l'approbation et la mise en oeuvre des microprojets
  issus des plans de développement ;

¾ La conduite par les Ministères partenaires de plusieurs études devant contribuer à
  l'amélioration de l'exécution du projet. Il s'agit de :
  - i) l'étude sur les bases de données régionales, ii) la rédaction du livre blanc pour le schéma
  national et régional d'aménagement du Territoire effectuée par le Ministère de
  l'Aménagement du Territoire, de l'Urbanisme et de l'Habitat, iv) l'étude sur les potentialités



                                                58
    économiques des communes, v) l'étude sur le plan de développement communal, vii) l'étude
    de la stratégie de communication du MCD effectuée par le Ministère chargée de la
    Décentralisation.

¾ La réalisation de plusieurs outils méthodologiques dont les plus importants sont : le guide de
  planification participative et le guide d'élaboration des PDL ;

¾ La mise en place d'un cadre de collaboration en vue d'améliorer la synergie d'action avec :
  - i) les services techniques déconcentrés dont le niveau opérationnel prévu par le montage du
  projet (le CDSA au niveau départemental) a été fonctionnel ;
  - ii) les partenaires du niveau national dont le Ministère chargé de la décentralisation, et
  l'Observatoire National du Foncier ;
  - iii) les autres projets dont principalement le PSAOP intervenant sur le terrain pour financer
  des activités génératrices de revenus portées par les communautés de base ;

Il apparaît clairement que les réalisations physiques ci-dessus énumérées ont permis
d'enregistrer au niveau des bénéficiaires plusieurs résultats (en termes d'effets) notamment
une contribution effective des services techniques de l'Etat à l'atteinte des objectifs du
projet et une amélioration significative des conditions de vie des communautés locales.

   4. Niveaux des réalisations financières
Les décaissements des fonds ont été faibles notamment pour le financement des microprojets
entre 2004 et 2007 (avant la revue à mi-parcours en 2008). Mais il s'est progressivement amélioré
pour atteindre et dépasser pratiquement les 100 % en 2010. En effet, les niveaux de décaissement
des fonds à la date d'achèvement par source de financement, par catégorie de dépense et par
composante sont globalement satisfaisants comme l'indiquent les tableaux ci-dessous. Cependant
du fait de l'épuisement des catégories de dépenses Ateliers/formations et fonctionnement du
projet, l'Unité de gestion du projet a été amenée à solliciter des réallocations de fonds afin de
corriger les déséquilibres constatés durant l'exécution du projet.

Il y a lieu de rappeler que le calcul du taux de réalisations financières est fait sur la base des fonds
IDA libellés en Droits de Tirages Spéciaux (DTS) et convertis en Dollars US, les fonds AFD en
Euros et les fonds de la contribution de l'Etat du Tchad et des Bénéficiaires en Francs CFA.

   4. 1. Utilisation des fonds
Au 30 septembre 2010, le total des fonds utilisé par composante donne des dépenses de 19 008
841 137 FCFA, pour un cumul d'encaissement à partir des différentes sources de 19 209 641
625 FCFA. La situation de trésorerie à la même date est de 200 800 488 FCFA

Commentaires du tableau N° 4 : Les réalisations financières par composante sont conformes aux
proportions de départ excepté au niveau de la composante 4 (gestion, suivi et évaluation) où il
apparaît un taux de 119%. Cette situation s'explique par le fait que les charges liées à la
composante 4 ont mobilisé des fonds depuis l'année 2004 jusqu'à la prolongation du projet en
2010, soit 7 années de fonctionnement.

   5. Principales contraintes rencontrées dans l'exécution de la première phase
   Les principales contraintes rencontrées dans l'exécution de la première phase du PROADEL
   identifiées portent sur trois principaux éléments qui sont :
   -    Les contraintes liées à l'insuffisance constatée dans l'accomplissement des rôles des
        différents acteurs pendant la mise en oeuvre du projet,
   -    Les contraintes liées à l'insuffisance du management global du projet, notamment, la
        gestion financière, la passation des marchés, le suivi évaluation),
   -    La capacité des communautés à jouer pleinement leurs rôles de maîtres d'ouvrage,
   5.1. Le rôle des différents acteurs dans la mise en oeuvre du projet :

        Les rôles des différents acteurs ainsi que les partenariats établis entre eux ont été jalonnés
        de difficultés liées dans la plupart des cas au non respect du manuel d'exécution et de
        leurs cahiers de charges :

        i)      les procédures de recrutement des ONG par l'OE n'a pas respecté le principe du
                choix basé sur la qualité et le coût ; les ONG ont exécuté leurs missions sur la
                base d'un coût forfaitaire déterminé d'avance par l'OE sans tenir compte des
                spécificités du terrain, amenant du coup ces ONG à expédier parfois leur travail;
        ii)     les décomptes des travaux d'infrastructures préparés et soumis par les
                entrepreneurs dans la majorité des cas n'ont pas été payés dans les délais,


                                                 61
                 provoquant ainsi de la part de ceux-ci des retards importants voire même des
                 suspensions de certain chantiers ;
         iii)     l'application des mesures de sauvegarde environnementales sont insuffisantes et
                 se limitent dans la plupart des cas à des plantations d'arbres pour les
                 infrastructures de génie civil;
         iv)     Les ACD n'ont pas versé la totalité de leur contribution dans la majorité des cas
                 par incompréhension de leurs devoirs en la matière du fait de la désinformation
                 venant de diverses sources (animateurs, personnalités politiques etc....)

6.   Recommandations à prendre en compte dans la deuxième phase du Projet
     6.1. En matière de renforcement des capacités locales, les unités locales devront avoir la
             responsabilité de recruter, suivre et évaluer les opérateurs prestataires de services.
     6.2. En matière d'appui au financement des microprojets, le projet devra disposer d'un
             spécialiste de contrôle des microprojets au niveau de chaque unité qui assurera la
             supervision des ingénieurs conseil recrutés pour garantir une meilleure qualité des
             microprojets réalisés sur le terrain. Les ingénieurs conseil appuieront la préparation
             des marchés communautaires en collaboration avec les responsables des UGL.

     6.3. En matière de pérennisation des investissements réalisés au profit des communautés,
             celles-ci doivent être suffisamment formées et outillées pour suivre la réalisation et
             assurer la gestion des investissements.

     6.4. La contribution demandée de la part de ces communautés doit être revue et adaptée aux
              réalités locales (contribution en nature ou en espèce).

2/ CONCLUSION20

La première phase du Projet d'Appui au Développement Local a pris officiellement fin le 30 Juin
2010 avec une prorogation d'un an. Au cours de cette première phase, le Projet a couvert 5215
ACD et 210 CCCD pour une population totale estimée à 6 millions d'habitants. Les résultats obtenus
ont été satisfaisants. Le projet a eu un impact visible sur l'amélioration des conditions de vie des
communautés. Les résultats présentés dans ce document selon la logique d'intervention ont
permis de connaître l'importance des réalisations physiques et financières et les effets observés
sur les bénéficiaires. Ainsi, près de 6 milliards de FCA ont été mis à la disposition des communautés
pour financer leurs microprojets par les procédures de passation des marchés communautaires.
Le niveau de performance globale du PROADEL au cours de sa première phase d'exécution est
satisfaisant comme l'indiquent les valeurs atteintes par les indicateurs de performances et
déclencheurs de phase.
Cependant, à côté des résultats relativement satisfaisants obtenus par le projet, des insuffisances
ont été constatées tout au long des cinq années d'exécution du projet dont les plus importantes
sont liées à la coordination générale du projet.
Sur la base de ces résultats, le Gouvernement du Tchad et la Banque Mondiale ont entamé le
processus de préparation de la deuxième phase pour éviter un long délai entre la clôture de la
première phase et le démarrage de la seconde phase.
