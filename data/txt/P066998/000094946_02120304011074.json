Within this context, given the absence of a\n            detailed legislative framework on environmental mitigation\n            in Chad, in addition to weak institutional capacity, the\n            project design will focus on an environmental institutional\n            framework, integrating a national environmental, and social\n            management, under the Project Unit, and Technical\n            Environmental and Socioeconomic Units at the local levels,\n            to strengthen the Ministry of the Environment's\n            competencies, while consultations with local people would\n            ensure improvements to the natural environment. This\n            strategy will allow identification of precise mitigation\n            measures for each subproject, propose training needs, and,\n            enable the project to capitalize on best practices learned\n            from local development partners. Mitigation measures are as\n            follows: concerning transport, and roads construction,\n            community participation will be included in the route\n            tracing process, further validated by drainage studies,\n            while local workers, as well as local materials for\n            construction will be utilized; deforestation should be\n            minimized, and fragmentation of natural habitats avoided,\n            emphasizing on vegetation propagation following\n            construction; similarly, regarding energy subprojects,\n            installation of power distribution lines should minimize\n            deforestation and natural habitats fragmentation, and\n            voltage should be determined in accordance to socioeconomic\n            parameters; schools, and health facilities should be\n            constructed close to villages, avoiding flood prone areas,\n            and ensuring appropriate wastes disposal procedures; water\n            quality testing and adequate drainage systems should be\n            observed in the implementation of water supply subprojects.\n            Recommendations on involuntary resettlement issues are also included."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
