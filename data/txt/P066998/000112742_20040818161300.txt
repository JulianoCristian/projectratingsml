   1. Program purpose and program phasing:

    The Government of Chad finalized its Poverty Reduction Strategy in June 2003 and designed the
    Local Development Program as part of its implementation. The purpose of the program is to reduce
    poverty and promote sustainable development in rural areas by empowering communities and
    decentralized authorities and improving access to basic services and economic opportunities at the
    local level.

   The complexity of needed institutional reforms and Chad's size suggest the use of Adaptive Program
    Lending, which allows flexible, long-term (up to 12 years) intervention through three phases, the
    second two triggered by intermediate results (see section B.4). The program would evolve from pilot
    activities in a few areas to a full-fledged national program in a clearly established framework of
    decentralization by progressively adapting activities to build experience and capacity.
   · Phase 1. The Local Development Program Support Project (PROADEL) would progressively
   build on preliminary results and refine its approach and mechanisms for the next steps. This phase
   would cover 19 of 47 départements in Chad (see map in annex 16). PROADEL would emphasize
   community development in oil and cotton production area (11 southern départements), consolidate
   the experience of village-based management of wood resources around N'Djamena and Moundou,
   and pilot models for participatory development in pastoral areas (5 northern départements). And
   PROADEL would help the Government of Chad complete the decentralization framework and
   support democratically elected decentralized authorities. During this phase the project would also
   build on current World Bank­financed pilot initiatives such as the Local Development Fund
   (FACIL), Agency for Domestic Energy and Environment (AEDE), Agricultural and Livestock
   Services Project (PSAP), and the Federation of Small Anthropology Programs (FOSAP).
   · Phase 2. The program would be scaled up with more intensity in pastoral areas, and coverage
   would be expanded to 32 départements, while continuing to support fiscal decentralization and
   implementation of national training and capacity building for newly elected decentralized authorities.
   Funds would be progressively channeled through these elected decentralized authorities.
   · Phase 3. The project would achieve national coverage, consolidating the successes of the previous
   phases and contributing to the implementation of policy measures needed to ensure the long-term
   sustainability of the process.

   The long-term vision for rural areas is capable of and representative decentralized authorities and
    empowered rural communities are working together to plan and control their development by
    managing resources, including future oil revenues allocated to priority sectors, in a clearly
    established framework of decentralization.

2. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
   PROADEL (Phase 1 of the Local Development Program) would assist the Government of Chad in
   designing and implementing a decentralized and participatory financing mechanism that empowers
   local communities and decentralized authorities to manage development funds by (i) strengthening
   the capacity and responsibility of local communities and decentralized authorities, (ii) implementing
   demand-driven subprojects, and (iii) supporting the emerging process of decentralization.

3. Global objective: (see Annex 1)

    Chad's national and rural development priorities strongly emphasize the imperative to ensure the
    long-term health and productivity of its natural resource base. The Government of Chad recognizes
    that this goal is more likely to be achieved through the direct participation of local communities in
    the monitoring and management of ecological processes at ever larger geographical scales, as well as
    through micro-investments that can generate broad, multiple benefits to diverse stakeholders. It is
    improbable that a purely demand-driven project could effectively address Chad's multiple


                                                                                                       6

    environmental challenges, nor, given Chad's high level of rural poverty, that communities would
    prioritize medium and long-term investments in land and NRM management without incremental
    GEF funding. In response to these challenges and barriers, the global objective of the GEF project is
    to better enable local communities throughout Chad to combat desertification, preserve biodiversity,
    and maintain the productivity of natural assets within fragile, yet globally-significant ecosystems, as
    a result of the introduction of community-driven, integrated environmental management principles
    and planning. Through a variety of interventions, implemented under the umbrella of the IDA-
    funded Local Development Support Project (PROADEL), the project will introduce, replicate, and
    help sustain integrated ecosystem management activities in Chad through innovative approaches and
    capacity building. These activities aim to foster holistic and cross-sectoral approaches to local
    economic development and local environmental management that can simultaneously address global
    environmental challenges.

    The project will generate global environmental benefits in multiple GEF focal areas--with emphasis
    being placed on biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management--while simultaneously
    advancing the Government of Chad's main development objectives as well as its commitments to a
    number of major international environmental conventions. The project will introduce, replicate, and
    help to sustain integrated ecosystem management in Chad through a variety innovative approaches
    and capacity building activities. These activities aim to foster holistic and cross-sectoral approaches
    to local economic development and local environmental management that simultaneously address
    global environmental challenges.

4. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
   A monitoring and evaluation manual would be developed to guide information collection and
   assessment of the progress and impact of the project. Progress toward development objectives and
   global environmental objectives would be measured by key impact indicators: (i) living conditions
   (improvement in access to basic social services and infrastructures, permanent jobs created, income
   levels); (ii) restoration, protection, and conservation of globally-significant ecosystems and habitats
   and environmental assets therein (iii) local institutional capacity (quality of community development
   plans and implementation, transparency in management of decentralized decision entities); and (iv)
   central institutional capacity (definition of a coherent regulatory framework, adoption of a master
   plan to implement decentralization). Key performance indicators to be tracked for the GEF activities
   include: number of LDPs that reflect IEM principles; number of community-based natural resources
   subprojects implemented that actively promote conservation of globally significant biodiversity or
   joint management of protected areas; number of LDPs that actively promote conservation of globally
   significant biodiversity or joint management of protected areas; level of endangerment of one or two
   endemic mammals, birds and plant species in each of the priority zones reduced by at least one
   category; increase in total hectares under protected areas network; incremental adoption of
   sustainable agricultural techniques (i.e. direct seeding) in targeted areas, and percentage increase in
   total area previously classified as forest under rehabilitation or active reforestation.

   Some baseline data are available from detailed feasibility studies in PROADEL's départements and
   from the current ECOSIT household survey. Censuses would be conducted regularly to monitor the
   impact of the project, and a beneficiaries assessment would be completed at the end of the project.
   PROADEL would also use participatory appraisal tools to measure community satisfaction and
   subproject implementation. Some data would be regularly provided by other monitoring systems,
   such as the Poverty Monitoring System and the Rural Sector Monitoring System. The environmental
   information systems strengthened by GEF incremental finance will help to measure performance
   indicators related to natural resource management and ecosystem quality. These systems will measure
   trends in performance and impact indicators, such as: number and extent of endangerment of
   threatened species; traditional fuelwood and charcoal usage; extent of cropping areas; water and

    fodder availability for livestock and local and migratory wildlife; and extent of forest rehabilitation
    and increased area of land under active reforestation. Progress in achieving the global operational
    objectives would be monitored through the following key performance indicators and targets.

    (establishment of Departmental or Subprefectoral Decision and Approval Committees, effective
    community participation in decision-making, inclusion of women and underprivileged groups in
    decision-making, quantity and quality of Local Development Plans established, efficiency of the
    approval process of subprojects). As results are obtained and lessons from experience can be applied
    to subsequent phases, performance indicators would become more quantitative and output-related
    (management capacity at local level, implementation of development activities, deconcentration of
    technical services, effective service delivery).

                                                 B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 19365-CD            Date of latest CAS discussion: January 11, 2001

    The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy aims to help Chad reduce poverty by (i)
    strengthening governance and using its oil resources more effectively (ii) developing greater, more
    inclusive,   sustainable        non-oil-income-earning      opportunities.         PROADEL           would     support
    decentralization and strengthen the rule of law, a critical outcome of the first pillar of the strategy.
    The second pillar of the strategy aims to expand opportunities for the poor and to empower
    communities to formulate their needs in basic infrastructures and to manage and maintain
    infrastructure. In particular, the Bank seeks to contribute to the following outcome: 250 subprojects
    benefiting communities in 10 departments implemented based on their approved Local Development
    Plans and operated and maintained in a sustainable manner. PROADEL would be the main instrument
    to achieve this outcome.


    An explicit theme in the Bank's strategy is that operations funded by the International Development
    Association (IDA), and the Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Project (ASPOP) in
    particular, should improve Chad's ability to use its oil revenues for effective poverty reduction. It is


                                                                                                                        8

    expected, as indicated in para. 22(i) of the Letter of Sector Policy, signed on October 27, 2003, that a
    portion of oil revenues would finance producer organizations' needs, as identified by the participatory
    approach implemented under Rural Development Support Program projects.


    For fiscal 2004 Chad was allocated IDA grants of US$17 million equivalent because of its status as a
    "poorest country," and this amount would be fully applied toward financing the Local Development
    Program Support Project. Chad's grant allocation was calculated as 17% of the total amount of
    Chad's IDA lending program in fiscal 2004, in line with fiscal 2004 Grant Implementation
    Guidelines. This project was selected for grant financing because of its importance in the Bank's
    program in Chad and its expected strong poverty alleviation impact.

    The grant money is aimed at (i) improving access to basic services in rural areas (subprojects
    financed under Project Component 1), (ii) strengthening communities (Project Component 2), and
    (iii) strengthening decentralized authorities (Project Component 3.2). IDA support to these activities
    would be financed entirely by grant funds.

    Chad's fiscal 2004 grant allocation was not sufficient to fully finance this project, and the grant would
    be supplemented by US$6 million credit financing. This money is aimed at other project activities
    that would support mainly project management, the monitoring system, and capacity building of
    administrative services involved in local development and decentralization.

    World Bank Rural Development Strategy for Chad
    The proposed project is based on the Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach. It is in line
    with the current Bank strategy for rural development in Chad (review meeting on November 30,
    2000), which recommended the identification of a national CDD program. The ultimate goal of the
    Bank's strategy is to support the Government of Chad in its efforts to fight poverty by focusing on
    rural development and management of natural resources, with strong and effective participation of
    beneficiaries. Bank assistance emphasizes the importance of strengthening local capacity and
    increasing stakeholders' involvement by developing consensus on priority objectives and
    implementing clear operational strategies to meet those objectives, with particular focus on (i)
    completion of the unfinished agenda of structural reform, (ii) decentralization and empowerment of
    local communities and farmers organizations to manage their assets and become active partners in the
    development process, and (iii) concentration of limited government resources on critical services and
    investments.

1a. Global Operational strategy/Program objective addressed by the project:

    The project will generate global environmental benefits in multiple GEF focal areas--with emphasis
    being placed on biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management--while simultaneously
    advancing the Government of Chad's main development objectives as well as its commitments to a
    number of major international environmental conventions. GEF activities are specifically linked to its
    strategic priorities under OP#12 in the following ways:

    Biodiversity Conservation. The natural resource management practices of communities participating
    in the first phase of the PROADEL have the potential to positively or negatively impact some of the
    country's most environmentally fragile areas. Chad's unique, globally important ecosystems are at
    risk of serious irreversible degradation. At the same time, it must be recalled that, although
    environmental protection is a priority in Chad, resources are scarce and meeting basic needs is a more
    urgent priority for much of the population. Therefore, incremental GEF financing will be necessary to
    ensure that local development plans integrate biodiversity conservation issues.



                                                                                                           9

GEF activities aimed at conserving biodiversity will be limited to three of the country's major
ecological zones and will proceed along a two-tiered strategy. At one level, collaboration between
key stakeholders, including a super-structure of concerned communities, will be built to pursue
integrated ecosystem management priorities at larger spatial areas. Support will be provided to
strengthen the institutional and legal framework for decentralized natural resource management. In
order to ensure for a more equitable sharing of global biodiversity, activities will include
strengthening the management plans for existing and imminently planned protected areas, along the
approach of decentralized environmental governance and community co-management. On another
level, targeted capacity building will be extended directly to communities for strengthening the
protection and conservation of protected areas under a joint management approach. In addition, co-
financing of eligible subprojects related to biodiversity conservation and sound community
management of natural resources will be supported. Some of the local development subprojects likely
to be eligible for GEF incremental funds include, inter alia, the development of protected areas
management plans, reforestation and rehabilitation of gallery forests and the establishment of on-farm
or communal windbreaks to prevent dune advancement, community grazing management plans,
development of grazing corridors and fodder buffer zones, and farm and off-farm investments that
increase biodiversity and soil fertility.

For strategic reasons and resource limitations, geographical emphasis or priority will be, at least
initially, placed on three priority zones from among the following: Lake Fitri, Siniaka-Minia Fauna
Reserve, Mandou Forests and Greater Manda National Park Area, Bainamar & Larmanaye Forests in
Monts de Lam, and West Mayo-Kebbi. These areas contain a number of significant protected areas
and peripheral buffer zones that harbor globally significant environmental assets and highly
threatened species, such as the manatee, addax, orxy, and Derby eland. Among these include the Lake
Fitri Biosphere Reserve, Manda National Park, Binder-Léré Game Reserve and Yamba-Berté
National Forest. For additional details on the biodiversity assets to be protected under the project refer
to description of priority zones, List of Eligible Departments under the PROADEL/GEF Project in
Table 1.1, and map of intervention areas which follow the specific activity component descriptions.

Land degradation
More sustainable agricultural cultivation and land management techniques are another priority area of
the GEF activities. Additional support to the baseline activities will increase the dissemination and
uptake of land management technologies and practices that will enhance soil fertility, reduce erosion
and water run-off, reduce release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and improve landscape
planning and management. Some of the specific management practices that will be supported include:
direct seeding, "cordons pierreux", crop-livestock integrated pilots, better crop management,
rainwater harvesting, reclamation of arable lands, integrated plant nutrition management, better
residue and manure management, and improved grazing management. Moreover, the capacity
building and co-financing of subprojects will aim to introduce direct seeding and other agro-forestry
techniques that will increase soil fertility and soil organic carbon retention. With GEF Block-B
support, targeted research is being undertaken to identify, specifically, the most appropriate,
economically viable, and environmentally beneficial sustainable land management interventions for
each of the targeted ecological zones, again, paying particular attention to three priority zones of
intervention. In the environs of Mandou and Sarh, the largest cities after the capital, alternative
energy carriers to fuel wood and traditionally produced charcoal will be promoted, as well as more
sustainable harvesting and commercialization of fuel wood through regular replanting or the
introduction of user fees/taxes.

Ancillary Benefits



                                                                                                       10

Climate change is not a primary focal point of the project. Nevertheless, GEF incremental activities
that promote sustainable land management would have positive climate benefits. It is expected that
Chad's net greenhouse gas emissions balance would be lowered as a result of GEF activities through
two main mechanisms: a reduction in deforestation through fiscal incentives and other support for
alternative household energy carriers than traditional fuel wood and charcoal, and the introduction
and dissemination of agro-forestry and sustainable land management practices, such as no-till
farming, that would increase the retention and sequestration of carbon in Chadian soils. These
activities link global climate protection efforts to local development priorities, thereby contributing to
the goals and spirit of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change with respect to
least developed countries.

Although also not a primary focal point targeted by the project, the elaboration of integrated
ecosystem management plans and the aggregation of community sub-projects having sustainable land
management or reforestation aims could have a beneficial impact on preserving the quality and flow
of water to the Lake Chad basin, a globally significant trans-boundary watercourse, via the Chari-
Logone watershed. Water input to the Lake is seasonal, with the majority originating as precipitation
on the Adama Plateau. Chad's major rivers are the Chari and the Logone and their tributaries, which
flow from the southeast into Lake Chad. Both river systems rise in the highlands of Central African
Republic and Cameroon. The Chari-Logone system, which flows into Lake Chad from the Southeast,
contributes about 90 percent or more to total water inflow to Lake Chad. Through improved
agricultural cultivation practices, including water management, as well as reforestation and other soil
erosion control measures, incremental GEF activities will help to reduce sedimentation and water
flow deterioration in those areas which abut the Logone and Chari Rivers. In this way, the project will
reinforce and build synergies with the objectives of the international, GEF-supported Lake Chad
Basin Project.

Annex 18 contains a map outlining the tentative priority zones for intervention and Annex 17
provides more detailed information on the global environmental challenges that would be addressed
by the project within each of the four main sub-regional ecosystems.

Priority Zones of Intervention

Integrated ecosystem management activities and plans will be prioritized in three priority zones of
intervention. Currently, a shortlist of five zones are under consideration: Lake Fitri, Siniaka-Minia
Fauna Reserve, West Mayo-Kebbi, Mandoul Forests and Greater Manda National Park Region, and
Bainamar & Larmanaye Forests in Monts de Lam. This list will be narrowed down to three during the
course of project appraisal. The criteria to be applied for final selection of priority zones shall be:
    · Full project coverage of major environmental challenges in the country and root causes of
      unsustainable development
    · Diversification among major sub-regional ecological zones (i.e., Sudanian, Sahelian, Sahelo-
      Sudanian)
    · Equitable geographical distribution of project activities
    · Assurance that GEF activities under PRAODEL supplement and do not duplicate the efforts of
      other projects

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
   Main sector issues

   With 80% of the population living on less than $1 a day, Chad is one of the poorest countries in the
   world. Poverty is most prevalent in rural areas, where about 80% of the population resides. Average
   annual income per capita is estimated at FCFA 98,000, with a marked disparity between rural areas
   (FCFA 73,000) and urban areas (FCFA 180,000). Agriculture employs 80% of the active work force,
   contributes about 40% of national income, and accounts for almost 50% of the value of exports. Thus
   rural areas must be the primary target of interventions aimed at reducing poverty and increasing
   growth. An analysis conducted in 1998 in preparation for the rural development roundtable and
   confirmed by the preidentification multidonor mission in April 2000 identified four main constraints
   to rural growth:

   Issue 1: Weak and inefficient provision of basic services to the rural population. On average, only
   30% of the population has access to safe water and between 25% and 70% of the pumps are
   dysfunctional due to poor equipment management and maintenance. Education shows persistent
   weaknesses: (i) poor infrastructure and insufficient number of schools; (ii) wide regional disparities,
   with gross enrollment rates of less than 42% in most of the northern and eastern provinces; (iii)
   gender disparity; (iv) poor education quality; (v) high disparity in unit costs; and (vi) persistently low
   post­primary education enrollment. The health situation is particularly precarious in rural areas, with
   one doctor per 41,000 inhabitants nationally compared with one doctor per 3,904 inhabitants in
   N'Djamena. Half of births are assisted in urban areas, compared with 16% in rural areas. The
   prevalence of HIV/AIDS is increasing, reaching 5% of adults nationally, and more than 10% in some
   areas, compared with 2.9% in 1994. The road network is extremely limited, with a low roads
   normalized index value of 21. Chad has 300 kilometers of fully paved roads out of 6,200 total
   kilometers, and most unpaved roads are not accessible year-round, which seriously affects food
   security and the cost of agricultural products (transport charges can be as much as 70% of marketing
   costs). Almost 100% of the population relies on woodfuels for its energy needs. And the rural
   production of firewood and charcoal contributes little to the communities where the resources are
   located because a supportive regulatory framework and local management structures are lacking.
   Chad's main environmental threats--desertification, deforestation, and soil and water quality
   deterioration--are clearly exacerbated by poor access to, and insufficient regulatory frameworks and
   local management structures for, sustainable energy services. To meet basic human energy needs,
   almost the entire population depends upon the unsustainable consumption of wood fuel and charcoal.
   As a result, "rings" of desertification and deforestation have developed around major population
   centers (e.g., N'Djamena, Ati, Abéché, and Bongor); moreover, these practices add to Chad's net
   greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the fertility and carbon storage capacity of its soils.

   Issue 2: Ecosystem fragility exacerbated by demographic pressures and land-use conflicts. Lying at
   the convergence of four major continental ecological zones (i.e., the West African Sahara, the Sahel,
   the Sudanian zone, and the Central African Forest), Chad's ecosystems are globally significant. They
   serve as permanent habitats, safe migration harbors, and assimilation zones for a multitude of unique,
   threatened species from across the African Continent (e.g., large mammals and reptiles, migratory
   birds, fish, and unique desert, savanna, and forest vegetation formations). Likewise, the Logone-Chari
   river system emptying into Lake Chad is a watercourse of great global and regional importance. As
   the largest fresh water reserve in the area, the extensive Lake Chad Basin (LCB) supports a mosaic of
   societies and cultures to sustain agricultural and pastoral activities, often at subsistence level. Yet the
   basin has been under increasing pressure from progressive desertification and environmental
   degradation accelerated by human demand for land and water. Other rivers and lakes (e.g., Lake


                                                                                                           12

  Fitri), as well as pockets of oases in the Sudanian and Sahelian deserts, provide key habitats for
  numerous species. Many of these may be endemic and are considered to be endangered. According to
  WCMC, 6 animal species are currently critically endangered (among which the addax, the northern
  white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros), 6 endangered (among which the Addra and Rhim gazelle,
  the giant otter and the elephant) and 16 vulnerable, while 1 is now extinct in the wild (the Sahara
  oryx). At the same time, the unique location and functions of Chadian ecosystems renders them
  fragile and highly sensitive to environmental change, including climatic variability. For example,
  droughts and bush fires are threatening the viability of rangeland vegetation, and by extension, the
  wild and domestic animals whom are dependent on it. Moreover, integrated management of Chad's
  ecosystems is a greater challenge, particularly at larger spatial levels, since they lie at the confluence
  of different ecological sub-systems. On top of these challenges, demographic pressures and the
  growing pains of economic development are creating a vicious cycle of mounting ecological damage
  and low rural productivity. The tolerance of major ecosystems is being pushed to the brink by the
  poor management of water resources, the progressive depletion and declining fertility of agricultural
  soils, and the extensification of agricultural production and the encroachment of human settlements
  on natural habitats. Land-use conflicts between pastoral and agricultural activities have intensified,
  contributing to migration pressures and undermining social cohesion. The perpetuation of open-
  access land-use policies threatens the integrity and sustainability of Chad's natural assets, particularly
  its forests, woodlots, and pasturelands. For example, as areas continue to experience population
  growth and new migration (e.g. particularly the Sudanian zone), natural vegetation in wetlands,
  prairies, and woodlands are being systematically cleared for food production. These unsustainable
  patterns are reinforcing poverty and curbing the future economic growth potential of the country,
  particularly in the rural sector.

  In terms of Chad's key environmental threats, the Government of Chad is fully cognizant of the value
  of an integrated ecosystem management approach to respond to its key environmental threats;
  however, a number of barriers hinder the ability to translate this strategic vision into action. First,
  limited funding mechanisms exist to support IEM processes at local levels and few micro-finance
  programs have ever focused on environmental issues. While climatic and demographic factors are
  among the root causes of desertification, the lack of appropriate management of natural resources
  confounds the situation and is the aspect most open to immediate improvement. With increased
  funding, available techniques for reducing soil erosion, improving soil fertility, and increasing woody
  biomass could be adopted more widely. Second, weaknesses in the legal framework and low capacity
  of decentralized governmental institutions exists. The Chadian legal framework regarding
  environmental management could strongly benefit from some additions or modifications, especially
  those pertaining to land tenure and security. Moreover, Chad's capacity to manage its environment,
  and particularly its protected areas, is currently very limited. Third, the Government lacks the
  analytical and information basis for long-term monitoring of environmental issues and targeting of
  scarce resource to highest impact interventions. For example, only basic data on protected areas and
  the value of natural capital is available, and much of this data is quite outdated.


· Issue 3: Weak organization of rural communities and limited involvement in decisions concerning
  their development, including natural resource management. The Government of Chad has started
 decentralization, but it is still in the early stages. There are no elected decentralized authorities yet,
 and decision centers are still out of reach for much of the rural population. A few projects have set up
 informal local development decision bodies (such as the FACIL and the AEDE), but they remain in
 the pilot stage and depend on international donors for financial support. The range of environmental
 challenges impeding Chad's sustainable economic development are intimately connected to weak
 local governance structures, particularly in the domain of natural resources management.
 Decentralized mechanisms are important, as national capacity to manage protected areas and larger



                                                                                                         13

ecosystems is very limited. Indeed, fewer than 500 agents in the Ministry of Environment and Water
are charged with environmental and/or water management in the entire country, and budgetary
constraints are severe. Weak decentralized natural resources management capacity in poverty-
stricken areas aggravates existing human migration pressures that can be destabilizing. Weak
decentralized environmental governance has contributed to a rise in conflict over land use,
particularly between demand for agricultural activities and existing wildlife and protected areas. At
the same time, in regions with stronger growth prospects (e.g., the Sahelo-Sudanian zone), and hence
a higher level of attractiveness to economic refugees, the initiation of long-term frameworks for
natural resource management planning at an early stage of economic development may be pivotal to
the prevention of irreversible environmental damage, such as soil erosion and the degradation of
groundwater. More generally, as the underlying basis and outlook for economic growth in Chad
continues to improve, it has become increasingly critical that conservation issues and sound natural
resource use frameworks be integrated more effectively into local development planning. This is vital
in an economy where farming, stockbreeding, and fishing account for 40 percent of GDP, employ 80
percent of the active population, generate over 59 percent of household income in rural areas, and
provide 80 percent of export revenue. The interconnected mix of problems outlined above demands
holistic approaches and integrated frameworks that can balance the ecological, economic, social, and
financial needs of communities.

Issue 4: Weak rural financial services. The vast majority of small farmers and small entrepreneurs
have difficult or no access to credit. There is no national policy on micro-finance, and local banks
have demonstrated little interest in financing rural sector activities. Nor do local banks have
decentralized networks of branches or agencies to facilitate access by rural clients. The shallowness
of both formal and informal rural financial markets has hindered modernization of the rural sector and
the transition to more lucrative non-farm activities.


Government strategy

Government strategy to address the sector-specific issues:
The Government's national rural development strategy was presented to the main donors during the
Geneva IV Sectoral Consultation on Rural Development in June 1999. The objective of the strategy is
to increase production in a sustainable way that preserves the environment while reinforcing
institutional and human capacities. The key elements of the strategy are:

(i) Increasing agricultural productivity and improving agricultural marketing. This includes (i)
better delivery of agricultural extension and research services, more access to agricultural inputs and
credit, (ii) enhanced effectiveness of high-potential products, and (iii) improved rural basic
infrastructure.

(ii) Providing support to rural organizations. This includes strengthening the capacities of producer
organizations and promoting the emergence of new ones at the grassroots, district, and national
levels--with particular emphasis on women and transhumant herders.

(iii) Promoting sustainable management of natural resources and restoration of production
potential. This includes (i) consultation and consensus building with rural communities; (ii)
promotion of better soil and water management; and (iii) management of rural space, conservation of
biodiversity, and prevention of desertification and deforestation.

(iv) Improving the effectiveness of the public sector. A key part of Chad's development policy, the
effectiveness of the public sector concerns more than rural development. Achieving this objective
requires (i) redefining the Government's role in policy formulation, sectoral planning, and regulation;


                                                                                                    14

(ii) reorganizing public services, through deconcentration of their structures and decentralization of
decision-making and management; and (iii) optimally allocating resources through multisectoral and
multithematic approaches developed in a participatory framework.

(v) Improving the provision of basic services. This point concerns the rural sector in its broader sense
and is a precondition for the success of the rural development strategy. It requires the intervention of
other ministries besides the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Livestock, and the Ministry of
Environment and Water and includes (i) strengthening primary schools in rural areas, (ii) improving
primary health care, (iii) strengthening the communications network (transport, media,
telecommunications), and (iv) improving access to energy sources other than woodfuel.

To implement its rural development strategy, the Government has created a Rural Development
Support Program. Within the Rural Development Support Program framework, and as stated in the
CAS, the Bank is supporting the rural development strategy and cotton reform strategy with ASPOP
and PROADEL. Integration of GEF activities will improve the design of PRAODEL and ASPOP
components, while serving as an umbrella framework under which a range of interventions and
collaborations can be coordinated to advance the Government's key strategies in a manner that can
realize global environmental benefits.

PROADEL AND ASPOP are complementary but support different parts of the development and
reform strategies. They aim to create sustainable growth in agricultural production, provide support to
producer organizations, and support the decentralization and delivery of agricultural services. ASPOP
specifically addresses agricultural productivity and marketing, rural organizations, and management
of rural space and the public sector, while the thrust of PROADEL is decentralization and community
development. ASPOP aims to increase agricultural production and productivity by improving farmers'
access to productive infrastructure and equipment, improving farming systems, promoting
agricultural diversification, and strengthening the capacities of agricultural services (capacity building
to strengthen the technical ministries, strengthening capacities of producer organizations, and private
sector development). PROADEL supports the development of community (public) property--rural
roads, health centers, and schools--whereas ASPOP supports private farmers' own investments. The
two projects work together to coordinate their annual work programs so that community development
(rural roads) and productive investment (irrigation rehabilitation and technology transfer) go hand in
hand. The synergy of the two projects is detailed in C.4 and in annex 11.

Natural Resources Management

The Government of Chad's national policies and priorities, particularly in the sphere of rural
development, strongly emphasize the need to ensure for the long-term health and productivity of the
country's natural resources base. The Government of Chad strongly supports policies and investments
that can effectively strengthen environmental protection and integrate sustainable development
principles into decentralized natural resource management structures and plans. The Rural
Development Policy Letter pledges to more equitably allocate future oil revenues to rural
development, including the financing of community sub-projects identified in the framework of the
Rural Development Support Program (PIDR). The Government plans to devote at least half of new
sector resources to the domain of natural resources management and restoration of natural capital so
as to ensure long-term productivity growth. As mandated by the 1996 Constitution, the Government
is also engaged in decentralization and new decentralization laws ascribe rural communities a major
role in the management of natural resources.

The Decentralization Process



                                                                                                       15

PROADEL and its incremental GEF activities would strongly support the Government of Chad's
decentralization agenda, which commenced in 1996. A six-level administrative organization has been
defined (nation, région, département, sous-préfecture, commune, and communauté rurale), but the
legal and regulatory framework has not yet been completed, with some critical legal documents (such
as those regarding the transfer of responsibilities and resources to local governments) still to be
finalized. PROADEL would support the Government of Chad in completion of the regulatory
framework and implementation of decentralization. PROADEL would be concurrent with
decentralization, with the project's institutional arrangements designed to comply with the
decentralization framework, especially with regard to the future communautés rurales created under a
June 2002 law.

The Government also seeks to achieve the objectives and implement interventions under its National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) largely through decentralized development plans and projects
conceived under the framework of the Rural Development Strategy and associated Rural
Development Support Plan (PIDR). In this way, it is believed that resources will be allocated in a
manner that aligns the country's national environmental objectives and global environmental
aspirations with its local development priorities. Plans formulated under NEAP and the PIDR that
enhance productive activities and simultaneously promote biodiversity conservation, soil fertility and
carbon storage, and biomass growth and carbon sequestration will be given priority consideration by
the Government. The Government of Chad has also recently adopted a National Biodiversity Strategy
and Action Plan (BSAP). The five core objectives of the BSAP are to: (i) improve knowledge and
monitoring of biological diversity; (ii) inventory ecosystems and threatened species; (iii) increase use
of substitution resources; (iv) adopt techniques for a more sustainable exploitation of biodiversity;
and (v) promote a more equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity exploitation. In 2002, the
Government also approved a National Action Plan to Combat Desertification. This strategy is
designed to safeguard Chad's most important and threatened ecosystems (e.g. Lake Chad, Lake Fitri,
the Ouadis, oasis, and the karolands), while promoting policies and building capacity to preserve the
production potential of the country's most precious natural resources--land and water.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was adopted by the Government in June 2003.
PROADEL and its incremental GEF activities have been designed to support the strategy's
implementation. The PRSP clearly articulates three fundamental challenges to realizing the
country's targets and long-term development vision: ecological threats and weak national
capacity for environmental protection; the need to effectively consolidate ongoing
decentralization efforts; and effective integration of sustainable development considerations
into economic development policies. One of the pillars of the Government's PRSP strategy is to
promote an integrated vision of rural development that can effectively address environmental issues
and natural resources management within frameworks that also address sustainable livelihoods and
the determinants of economic growth. Local PRSP consultations conducted in recent years reveal that
environmental degradation is recognized as having a strong relationship to poverty in most districts
and regions, and that poor natural resources management has been articulated by communities as a
serious, recurring concern.

Over the next 15 years, Government policies aim to reinforce capabilities and strengthen the
regulatory framework for natural resources management, through:
    · promulgating laws transferring some natural resource management prerogatives to users;
    · strengthening institutional capacity of agencies responsible for natural resources
    · installing local natural resource management committees;
    · establishing an environmental information system;



                                                                                                     16

        · consolidating an action plan for improving household energy management in connection with
              global environmental protection initiatives
        · drafting a national program to galvanize the population to protect the environment.

   Increased participation of rural communities in local development promoted by PROADEL complies
   with an explicit recommendation for the promotion of governance under the first national objective of
   Chad's PRSP. PROADEL also aims to link participation of communities with decentralization, which
   is also planned under the same strategic objective of the PRSP. More specifically PROADEL
   components would establish links at the community level between the various strategic axes of the
   PRSP (table 1 and annex 15). At the same time, GEF incremental activities will explicitly address the
   strategic orientations of Axis 1, Axis 2 and Axis 5 of the PRSP. Good governance will be promoted
   through increased capacity for decentralized environmental governance and training of
   Ministry of Environment and Water agents. Strong and sustainable economic growth will be
   advanced through genuine integration of natural resource management and sustainable rural
   livelihood strategies in local development planning and processes. More obviously, GEF
   incremental activities will help restore and sustain Chad's major ecosystems through all of its
   sub-components, in particular the co-financing of strategic micro-projects and targeted
   training to improve the management of protected areas.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
    Support to be provided under PROADEL would address the main issues as described in B.2, as
    follows:

       Issue 1: Weak and inefficient provision of basic services to the rural population. The project would
       increase the availability of social and economic services in rural areas by (i) financing community
       infrastructures on a demand-driven basis and in accordance with national policies and guidelines;
       (ii) improving the technical and managerial skills of local staff (teachers, nurses, civil officers); and
       (iii) creating conditions that ensure the long-term sustainability of services by promoting capacity
       building. The project would encourage the establishment of private service providers and the active
       involvement of communities in managing local services. And the project would foster
       decentralization by establishing more efficient and more demand-driven services.

       Issue 2: Ecosystem fragility exacerbated by demographic pressures and land-use conflicts. The
       project would finance (i) investments and capacity- building activities that protect and restore the
       natural resource base and (ii) initiatives that benefit biodiversity. The project would deal with
       degradation of natural resources at several levels: (i) at the local level, the project would actively
       formulate and implement land management plans that promote the small-scale, rational use of
       natural resources (largely based on the AEDE experience and pilot pastoral projects, community
       forestry, soil erosion management, and fertility enhancement techniques), and allow villages to
       generate funds from sustainable harvesting of woodfuels; (ii) at the département level, the project
       would consolidate several local proposals to finance environmental interventions on a larger scale
       (such as community-managed natural forests and protected areas and watershed management); and
       (iii) at the national level, the project would establish an environmental information management
       system and adopt a regulatory and fiscal framework to encourage protection and restoration of
       natural resources. The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) and The Fight against
       Desertification National Plan (FADN) exercises would provide the project with relevant orientation



                                                                                                                 18

     information. The long-term horizon of PROADEL allows for inclusion of diagnostic studies and
     pilot projects on degradation of natural resources in the first phase and development of appropriate
     interventions in later phases. And the analysis of land tenure issues would receive specific
     attention.

     Issue 3: Weak organization of rural communities and limited involvement in decisions concerning
     their development, including natural resource management. The project would finance
     socioeconomic investments identified and managed by local communities while building the
     managerial and planning capability of those communities and increasing transparency and
     accountability at the local level. While administrative decentralization would likely take a long
     time to complete, the project would establish mechanisms for improving the efficiency of
     coordination activities that would increase the participation of civil society during decentralization.
     The involvement of women and other underprivileged groups (youth, transhumant herders) in their
     community's development would receive particular attention.

     Issue 4: Weak rural finance services. The project would support the Government in the completion
     of the regulatory framework for microfinance in Chad and provide institutional support to
     microfinance institutions by strengthening their capabilities.


   The project's strategic choices are in line with the CDD approach and are as follows:
      - Community development or agricultural development. Rural growth would remain the main
     engine of Chad's economy, even during the oil era. This project is part of a larger Program of
     Interventions for Rural Development (PIDR). The combined efforts of PROADEL and ASPOP
     would contribute to sustained rural growth in a framework of strengthened capacity of local and
     central stakeholders.
      - Long-term or short-term horizons. Activities to be undertaken are ambitious and demand long-
     term commitment. No single-phase short-term project could deal with the issues at stake and
     achieve the objectives of national coverage and enhancement of the regulatory framework. A
     multiphased long-term program would be able to build on early results, with an experimentation
     phase followed by an expansion phase and then a consolidation phase.
       - Decentralized or centralized approach. This project has chosen a participatory approach
     demanding decentralized powers and resources at the lowest level of intervention. Addressing
     poverty requires approaches tailored to each zone of intervention.
      - Multisector or sectoral intervention. Poverty is multidimensional and demands a multisectoral
     approach. A demand-driven approach cannot be pursued without a multisectoral vision because
     rural development is the result of activities in agriculture, health, education, transport, housing, and
     others. But consistency with sectoral development programs and national policies is necessary.


4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans:
   To allow for the best adjustment of the program according to its performance, the program is
   designed to allow for overlap of the successive phases. Phases would be initiated independent of the
   termination dates of the previous phase and triggered when specific results have been accomplished.
   The following actions and triggers are proposed for each phase:

                      Program Description and Performance Triggers for Subsequent Phases

                   national assembly, and 50% of the application texts projects are available.
                   ·       Timetable for local administrative elections (communes and communautés
                   rurales) has been defined.
                    ·      At least 0.5% of oil revenues devoted to priority sectors are disbursed for
                    subprojects that come within the scope of Local Development Plans




Phase 2             ·      Will scale up the activities of the program and expand coverage to 32 of 47
                    départements.
                    ·      Will continue the deconcentration implementation plan and follow up the
                    support to fiscal decentralization and implementation of the national training and
                    capacity building of elected local governments.
Triggers            ·      75% of targeted communities have prepared and adopted their Local
                    Development Plans.
                   ·       50% of targeted communities have at least one subproject whose first
                   tranche has been disbursed.
                   ·       75% of Decision Committees are in place and have met at least once.
                   ·       Elections for the rural councils have taken place.
                    ·      75% of national resources budgeted for decentralized authorities are
                    actually transferred, and 10% of these transfers are disbursed based on Local
                    Development Plans.




Phase 3             ·      Will achieve national coverage, consolidate the achievements of the
                    previous phases, and contribute to the implementation of the policy measures
                    needed to ensure the sustainability of the process.
                    ·      Will continue to support the institution reforms in line ministries.



  Expansion to new phases of the program would be subject to an appraisal assessing the feasibility of
  the new phase. The appraisal would include (i) evaluation of the results of the previous phase,
  assessed against trigger indicators, and (ii) preparatory studies for each new département to be
  covered, detailing social, economic, and environmental analyses.

    Additional details on project components, including incremental GEF activities are provided below.

    Component 1 ­ Financial support to local development subprojects
    Under PROADEL matching grants will be provided to co-finance subprojects proposed by local
    communities (associations, organizations, and others) with legal status or decentralized local
    government entities (at the commune or communauté rurale level, once established). Its purpose is to
    reduce poverty by stimulating local development and improving communities' livelihood, such as:
    · Small social activities such as transport (bridges), education (classrooms), health (health posts,
    HIV/AIDS prevention and information, personnel training), and water and sanitation (wells).
    · Management of natural resources activities such as erosion control, tree nurseries, forests
    management, and fuelwood alternatives.
    · Large-scale and more expensive collective infrastructure projects that would affect several
    villages or cantons, such as drilling, rural roads, and water supply systems.

    Financial support would be established to co-finance community subprojects which will have a
    positive impact on the global environment and related integrated ecosystem management activities.
    Eligible activities will include environmental activities of only medium and long term economic
    return regarding priority sites and proposed in the Local Development Plans. In such case, a
    percentage of the contribution requested from the beneficiaries will be financed. This will happen
    mostly by financing a percentage of the contribution requested from the beneficiaries (in the form of
    cash, materials or wages for labor) representing between 5 and 50 percent of total subproject costs. A
    final "positive list" of specific eligible activities will be established according to GEF principles
    during project preparation; however, in all cases eligibility will be restricted to those subprojects
    proposed in Local Development Plans and that concern or affect priority zones. Finally, activities
    must be "incremental" investments having a medium or long-term economic return and manifesting
    barriers to their immediate implementation. Some of the subprojects likely to be eligible include, inter
    alia, the reforestation and rehabilitation of gallery forests to prevent dune advancement, support for
    community co-management of protected areas, the introduction of direct seeding and other agro-



                                                                                                        21

  forestry techniques that can increase soil fertility and soil organic carbon retention, and the
  development of more sustainable, alternative energy carriers to fuel wood and traditionally produced
  charcoal. Under this component, the interventions and lessons learned in the successful Household
  Energy Management Project would be replicated to a wider area of rural communities in the outskirts
  of the capital.

Component 2 ­ Capacity building for communities

  PRAODEL will strengthen the technical and organizational capacity at the community level for
  participatory approaches, needs assessments, and subproject management (procurement, financial
  management). It would support communities in the preparation of local development plans and
  subprojects requests. The capacity of sub-prefectoral and departmental Decision and Approval
  Committees will be strengthened for them to fulfill their mandate (conflict resolution, regional
  management, safeguard issues, decentralization) and specific training will be provided on critical
  rural development issues, including HIV/AIDS awareness. Given the multi-sectoral nature of the
  program, these capacity-building activities may concern a wide spectrum of sectors including health,
  environment, education, transport, and energy. Additional trainings will be provided to benefit to
  communities on specific topics related to poverty reduction: access to credit, nutrition, hygiene,
  HIV/AIDS awareness, sustainable management of natural resources especially in woodfuel supply
  basins.

  GEF activities under this component comprise technical assistance and capacity building support
  services to local communities, its decision committees, and community super-structures to integrate
  environmental concerns and integrated ecosystem management principles into local development
  planning. Specific training and organizational support will build the skills of communities in targeted
  areas to: (i) design and implement natural resources management strategies within an integrated
  ecosystem management framework; and (ii) pursue strategies and modalities to co-manage protected
  areas with government officials. These activities run in parallel to the first component, such that the
  conceptualization of subprojects (i.e. those aimed at reducing soil erosion, maintaining forest cover,
  and restoring woody vegetation) can more coherently address broader ecosystem challenges, such as
  watershed management. GEF capacity building activities will proceed in a two-tiered strategy. At one
  level, collaboration between key stakeholders including a super-structure of concerned communities
  will be built to pursue integrated ecosystem management priorities at larger spatial scales, including
  the development of new protected area management plans, including those for the Binder-Léré
  Wildlife Reserve and proposed Lake Fitri Biosphere Reserve. A systematic review of protected areas
  and other assessments to identify new priority intervention zones will be undertaken. On another
  level, support will be extended directly to local communities for capacity building and in some cases
  facilitation assistance to help co-manage protected areas identified in the protected areas review.
  These activities will incorporate indigenous knowledge and participation of community leaders.
  Selected communities will be supported to conduct participatory needs assessments in alignment with
  "gestion de terroirs" and community based natural resources management principles. In rural areas in
  the outskirts of N'Djamena, capacity building will emphasize the promotion of more sustainable
  household energy alternatives. In addition to these activities, scientific and technical capacity will be
  built in biosphere reserve management, and targeted support will be given to Chadian stakeholders in
  savannah and drylands management under a future UNEP/GEF regional initiative on Dryland
  Biodiversity in West African Biosphere Reserves. At an early stage of the project an "IEM Guideline
  Document" (being prepared with GEF PDF-B support) will also be developed. This will finalize the
  subprojects eligibility criteria and "positive list" under the program. The document will serve as a
  blueprint for how to consolidate IEM approaches in local development planning under the framework
  of the PIDR. Under a "train the trainers" model, it will be used for capacity-building purposes to



                                                                                                        22

  increase the skills and knowledge base of decentralized Ministry of Water and Environment agents
  and local NGO service providers.

Component 3 ­ Support for decentralization

  PROADEL will strengthen the institutional/legal framework for decentralized rural development,
  leading to modest gains in the capacity of local authorities to support natural resources management
  (mainly focused on more sustainable agricultural cultivation). PROADEL focuses on building sound
  legal and regulatory frameworks to support decentralization in general, as well as targeted training for
  key stakeholders involved in the process, with the Ministry of Decentralization being the primary
  partner. These activities will also establish a fiscal decentralization framework. ASPOP would also
  support capacity building of technical ministries to improve the quality in preparation and
  implementation of rural investment programs, and to monitor implementation of mitigation measures
  for potential negative impacts of productive investments on natural resources. Technical and
  institutional capacities of research institutions would be also strengthened.

  GEF incremental funding will advance the Government of Chad's decentralization agenda, by
  strengthening national capacity for decentralized environmental governance. Interventions under this
  component will target the finalization and implementation of sound regulatory frameworks and
  workable modalities for community involvement or joint environmental management. This may
  involve modifications to the legal framework and targeted assistance to communities to work with the
  Ministry of Environment and Water to adopt local regulations for joint management of protected
  areas. In addition, modifications to the institutional or legal framework for adopting taxes and/or user
  fees to woodfuel and charcoal sales will be pursued to increase incentives for proper management of
  wood resources and to support more sustainable energy alternatives to traditional biomass. Capacity
  building activities will thrust at improving the skills and enforcement powers of agents in the
  Ministry of Environment and Water, particularly those working at local and decentralized levels.
  Mechanisms to build this capacity shall include, inter alia, specialized training and workshops, and
  logistical support. Land tenure and security issues will also be addressed through assistance to
  communities to collaborate with Ministry of Environment and Water officials in the adoption of local
  regulations and workable modalities for joint management of protected areas. Support may include
  modifications to the legal framework that hinder direct community or joint environmental
  management.

Component 4 ­ Management and Information support

  Baseline activities under the PIDR framework include the development of more robust, broad-based
  monitoring and management information systems for the rural sector. These systems would include
  additional data on the state of the environment. A general public awareness-raising campaign on
  challenges to sustainable rural development would also be advanced. Additional funds will be
  dedicated to local participation in the monitoring and evaluation of IDA-funded projects.

  GEF financed activities will strengthen the environmental monitoring and evaluation capacities and
  complement the baseline Rural Sector Monitoring System. Building upon existing environmental and
  biodiversity data compiled in recent years under the NEAP and BSAP initiatives, under the Regional
  Environmental Information Management Program (REIMP), and in early 2004 with GEF PDF-B
  support, this component will: (i) expand the scope and coverage of environmental management
  information systems; (ii) refine the methodologies and tools used for monitoring and evaluating the
  progress of ecosystem improvements (including the creation of a national Geographic Information
  System (GIS) panel database; and (iii) delimit a set of quantitative indicators to benchmark
  improvements with respect to the project's global environmental objectives, (e.g., biodiversity



                                                                                                       23

conservation, the retreat of desertification advances, and net carbon sequestration gains in drylands
and agricultural soils). Such inventories, systems and methodologies are necessary to properly target
interventions, better determine the underlying economic value of the country's natural assets, and
track changes to national environmental quality in a more sustainable and scientifically rigorous
manner. Stakeholder participation will be emphasized in this component; communities will play a
front-line role in ecosystem monitoring. Technical assistance to local stakeholders will be provided
by the Association for the Development of Information on the Environment. In addition, the
environmental information system will be elaborated in conjunction with the development of the
second phase of the Regional Environmental Information Management Program (REIMP), the first
phase of which was supported by the GEF.

A detailed map of the departments covered by the PROADEL, and GEF incremental activities
(including GTZ-financed PRODALKA areas) is provided in Annex 18.

Priority Zones of Intervention

Integrated ecosystem management activities and plans will be prioritized in three priority zones of
intervention. Currently, a shortlist of five zones are under consideration; this list will be narrowed
down to three during the course of project appraisal. The criteria to be applied for final selection of
priority zones shall be:
    · Full project coverage of major environmental challenges in the country and root causes of
         unsustainable development
    · Diversification among major sub-regional ecological zones (i.e., Sudanian, Sahelian, Sahelo-
         Sudanian)
    · Equitable geographical distribution of project activities
    · Assurance that GEF activities under PRAODEL supplement and do not duplicate the efforts
         of other projects



Northern Chad ­ Lake Fitri
Lake Fitri, fed by the Batha River, is the second largest body of water in Chad. A normally
permanent, freshwater, Sahelian lake, fed by seasonal rainfall and runoff from the seasonal Batha
river, Lake Fitri, in Chad, has a surface area of 30,000 ha during the dry season and is part of a larger
biosphere reserve covering 195,000 ha. In 1987, the lake was designated a Ramsar site, and in 1990 a
biosphere reserve. Unlike Lake Chad, Lake Fitri is one of the very few Sahelian water bodies that has
yet to undergo a large-scale hydrological change, yet like Lake Chad, it is extremely shallow. Lake
Fitri became desiccated in 1913, 1985, and again in 1991 during a period of severe drought. The Lake
Fitri Biosphere Reserve contains important flora (e.g., acacia, Echinochloa stagnina) numerous fish
species (Claria lazera, Claria angilaris, Gymnarchus niloticus, Protopterus annectens, Tilapia
galelea, Tilapia niloticus) and habitats important to a very large number of seasonal migratory birds
and afro-tropical waterfowl, including the rare Egyptian Goose and a plethora of waterbirds such as
pelicans. The Lake environment also supports the endangered red-fronted gazelle and a small
elephant population; in addition, lion, antelope, and roan have been detected in the immediate
vicinity. The abundant fish found in the Lake and the fertility of the Lake's floodplains are vital to
surrounding communities for their very survival. Of late, conflicts between mainly Arab transhumant
pastoralists and mainly Bilala sedentary farming communities concerning control over wells and lake
shore grazing have been on the rise. The most significant potential threat to the site's ecological
character comes from the cumulative impact of small dykes and dams diverting seasonal runoff and
river flow into the lake. If Lake Fitri is as a priority zone, then incremental GEF activities under
PROADEL will complement a small pilot activity under the umbrella of the UNDP/GEF Lake Chad

Basin initiative. Synergy will be built in three fundamental aspects: (i) a financing window to
implement sub-projects already conceived through previous processes and ecosystem assessments;
(ii) IEM local development planning and capacity-building support to a greater number and wider
range of communities beyond the immediate perimeter of the Lake; and (iii) mainstreaming at
country level a major regional ecosystem management priority.

Northern Chad ­ Siniaka-Minia Fauna Reserve
The human savannah fauna reserve of Siniaka-Minia in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone covers and
immense plain of 426,000 hectares and was established in 1961. The reserve rests atop a ground
water network of the Bahr Siniaka et Droum, which drain from the north and finally enlarge to the
Bahr Minia in the south of the reserve. In the reserve the very rare Derby Eland and "great" kudu
species make their home, as well as rhinoceroses, elephants, hyenas, and a great variety of antelopes.
The integrity of the wildlife in the reserve and its peripheral areas, and the vegetation upon which
they depend is being compromised by poaching and the progressive encroachment of cotton
cultivation and other subsistence crops.

Southwestern Chad ­ West Mayo-Kebbi
This small area in the Southwestern corner of the country bordering Cameroon envelopes Lac Léré,
another major freshwater body in the Chad, as well some key protected areas, including the Binder-
Léré Game Reserve and the Forest Reserve of Yamba-Berté. The sub-region in general suffers from
poor integrated ecosystem management and is subject to mounting ecological pressure from the
ongoing expansion of agricultural activities for subsistence and cash-crops, extensive grazing,
poaching, and illegal charcoal production. This has lead to soil degradation, deforestation, and the
initiation of desertification. The Binder-Léré Game Reserve (Mayo Dallah department) hosts a few
rare and highly-threatened species including the eland, red hartebeest, fresh-water manatees, and
aquatic pleomediusa and pelusios turtles; lions, hyenas, elephants, and gazelles, among some 38 other
large mammals, can also be observed. The reserve also encompasses the world heritage site of the
Gauthiot falls. A number of agrarian communities in the region also abut and use the Logone River,
which flows into Lake Chad. The Yamba-Berté Forest Reserve in the department of Lac Léré
envelopes critical gallery forests, pristine woodlands, and a network of small lakes, swamps, and
flood plains along the Kebbi and Kabia Rivers that serve as important buffer zones against
encroaching desertification. Most of the local population in this area consumes charcoal, much of
which is not rationalized and some of which is illegally harvested, contributing to deforestation.

Southeastern Chad ­ Mandoul Forests and Greater Manda National Park Region This priority
zone encompasses the extensive Mandoul Forests which traverse in particular the departments of
Mandou-Occidental and Mandou-Oriental. This zone also includes buffer zones and peripheral areas
of Manda National Park, which is arguably Chad's most important protected area. With support of the
GEF and other donors, Manda has been undergoing a major effort to rehabilitate its habitats after
many years of neglect and a significant depletion of its key biodiversity. The swamps and tributaries
of the Chari River that encompass Manda Park and its peripheral areas provide ideal habitats for a
variety of sensitive flora as well as grazing areas for livestock and wildlife. Among other species,
Manda supports elephants, lions, buffalos, hippos, panthers, crocodiles, gazelles, antelopes, ducks,
and pythons. The integrity of the Mandoul Forests and the Manda National Park buffer zones are
threatened by progressively greater land clearing and deforestation from transhumant pastoralists and
surrounding villagers. In large part, this is linked to unsustainable wood fuel and charcoal production,
which is destined for sale in Sarh, Chad's third largest city, also within this zone. In addition to these
areas, a new protected area of 94,500 hectares, known as Ndam, has been proposed for this region.
GEF incremental activities under PROADEL will not be implanted within the Manda Park, as it is not
in the project boundary. However, some of the buffer zones and peripheral areas of the Manda Park



                                                                                                       25

    are in the PROADEL project boundary, and a number of communities that could threaten the integrity
    of the biodiversity in the park are in departments in which the project will build cooperation.

    Southern Chad. Bainamar & Larmanaye Forests in Monts de Lam
    The Bainamar and Larmanaye forests are situated in the Lam Mountains in the Logone-Oriental, near
    Goré. These and a number of other forests in this area (i.e. the Timbiri and Yambabereti forests) are
    classified as protected areas, due to the important plant and animal biodiversity contained within
    these dense, humid Central African forests. In 2003, a study was undertaken to elaborate a committee
    for improved forestry management in Larmanaye forest, but at this time, no specific conservation
    activities or management structures for the region have been implemented. A village has emerged in
    the Yambabereti forest, threatening the integrity of protected area. Also in this area, but lying toward
    Mongo and technically in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone, the flora and fauna reserve of Sianakamenia can
    also be found. This important habitat for flora and fauna also suffers from a lack of any formal
    management structure or community involvement.

       framework for decentralization and a master plan for its implementation.
       ·       Distribution of public funds, especially oil revenues, through the network of
       decentralized entities. In accordance with the Law on Oil Revenue Management, the
       Government has committed to using part of the royalties and dividends deposited into the
       Special Petroleum Revenue Accounts for incremental expenditures in key sectors contributing to
       poverty reduction (education, health and social services, rural development, infrastructure,
       environment, and water resources). The Bank should lobby the Government of Chad to channel
       part of these funds through decentralized financial mechanisms and disburse them based on
       Local Development Plans.

3. Benefits and target population:
       Target population
       The primary target population consists of communities in rural areas and urban areas except the
       main cities of N'Djamena, Moundou, and Sahr. Local communities are made up of people living
       in one or several villages, districts, hamlets, or campments sharing use of the space and natural
       resources around the settlements. Women, transhumant herders, and other underprivileged
       groups would be actively targeted to ensure that they (i) receive their share of benefits from
       project activities and (ii) are able to effectively participate in decisions affecting the program and
       the development of their community. Service providers would be contracted to support
       communities in participatory assessments and Local Development Plan preparation and
       implementation, and they would be asked to focus specifically on underprivileged groups.
       Decision Committees to decide on subprojects would comprise representatives of communities
       and include women as members. Other beneficiaries be strengthened by the project would be
       decentralized authorities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and service providers.

       The Government of Chad, in agreement with donors, has chosen to target several départements
       for the first phase of the program. Zones and types of activities were chosen to (i) quickly cover
       the oil and cotton production area, which will be more and more socially sensitive; (ii) allow an
       efficient and successful start of PROADEL; and (iii) launch activities in sedentary and pastoral
       areas. PROADEL would start in the departments of Mandoul Occidental, Mandoul Oriental, and
       Bahr Sara (in the region of Mandoul) and expand to Dodje, Lac Weye, Ngourkosso, Tandjile
       Est, and Tandjile Ouest (in the regions of Tandjile and Logone Occidental), which are in the oil-
       producing area. To complete the coverage of the oil production area, PROADEL would also
       include La Nya Pende, La Pende, and Monts de Lam (in the region of Logone Oriental), once
       FACIL is no longer active. PROADEL would launch some studies and pilot activities in pastoral
       areas, the départements of Chari, Baguirmi, Loug Chari, Dababa, Bahr Koh, Barh Signaka, Fitri,
       and Bahr El Gazal (in the regions of Chari-Baguirmi, Kanem, and Hadjer Lamis) to refine the
       participatory approach prior to the following phases and to implement household energy
       activities in the N'Djamena woodfuel supply basin (see map in annex 16).

       For Project Component 1 (financial support to local development subprojects), availability of
       funds would be partly preset for each sous-préfecture or département to strengthen priority
       setting by the communities.
       ·       60% of the Component 1 resources would be allocated on a per capita basis.
       ·       30% of the Component 1 resources would remain available on a first-come, first-served
       basis, up to FCFA 140 million (US$200,000) per rural community or commune each year.




                                                                                                          27

         ·       10% of the Component 1 resources would be distributed as awards to beneficiaries best
         meeting project expectations, based on the following criteria: good governance, good
         administrative and financial management, accounting for marginalized populations, and good
         infrastructure management.
         The resource envelopes for each sous-préfecture or département would be revised each year
         following the criteria set out in the Public Investment Program. Dynamic communities might
         then receive more funds.

         Expected benefits
         Expected benefits of the project are:
          Improved living conditions:
           (i) Improved health, food security, and education.
           (ii) Improved access to social services.
           (iii) Improved communication.
          Strengthened local capacity:
           (i) Ability to plan, implement, and monitor Local Development Plans and projects.
           (ii) Transparency in managing local financial resources.
           (iii) Accountability of elected bodies and communities.
          Strengthened central institutional capacity
           (i) Implementation of decentralization.
           (ii) Deconcentration of line ministries.
           (iii) Improved use of scarce budgetary resources.
          Preservation of natural resources:
           (i) Reduction of soil erosion.
           (ii) Reduction of deforestation.
           (iii) Conservation of biodiversity.


4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:

         The Ministry of Land Management, Urbanism, and Habitat would have institutional
         responsibility for the project.

         Implementation period
         The program would be implemented over a period of up to 12 years, and the proposed project
         represents its first phase. The duration of each phase would depend on the progress made in
         attaining the predefined triggers.

         Project implementation (See annex 13)
         The Government has prepared a comprehensive Project Implementation Manual, a Monitoring
         and Evaluation Manual, and an Administrative, Financial, and Accounting Manual. The Project
         Implementation Manual defines procedural arrangements for implementing the project and
         includes guidelines for identifying, approving, implementing, supervising, and evaluating
         subprojects. Adoption of the Project Implementation Manual by the Government in a manner
         satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of project effectiveness.

         Implementation of PROADEL would be concurrent with decentralization, which was begun by
         the Government of Chad in 1996. The project's institutional arrangements have been designed to
         comply with the decentralization framework defined in laws 002/PR/2000 and 07/PR/2002,
         especially with regard to the communautés rurales. Four levels in the administrative organization
         of the country are involved in PROADEL's organization:



                                                                                                       28

    (1) Community level: the communautés rurales, created by the law of June 5, 2002, and the
    communes. Communautés rurales consist of one or several villages or cantons. Communes
    are the capitals of the régions, départements, and sous-préfectures.
    (2) Intermediary level: PROADEL's implementation requires a decision level that is close to
    the communities and that is already represented by major central Government services. Since
    the canton is represented by only a single auxiliary with limited prerogatives, the sous-
    préfecture was chosen. There are 108 sous-préfectures. The département could also be the
    intermediary level if the population is less than 5,000 or if MA, ME, MEE, MH, MED, or
    MTP are not represented at the sous-préfecture level.
    (3) Middle intermediary level: the département.
    (4) Central level.

Individuals in communautés rurales or communes would form community-based organizations,
where all local shareholders would meet. with a secretariat to organize meetings and write
reports. The meetings would allow communities to assess their needs and prepare Local
Development Plans in a participatory manner. Animators would be contracted by the project to
assist in the process.

Subprefectoral Decision and Approval Committees would also be established with (i)
representatives from deconcentrated line ministries concerned with submitted subprojects,
including ministries in charge of rural development, education, health, and local infrastructure;
(ii) an NGO representative chosen by his or her peers; (iii) a representative of local rural
organizations; and (iv) three representatives of community-based organizations from each
canton. The committees would be responsible for (i) approving Local Development Plans and
subproject proposals submitted by community-based organizations, (ii) consolidating Local
Development Plans into a Subprefectoral Development Plan, and (iii) monitoring the
implementation of those subprojects. Any deconcentrated line ministry that is not a member of
the Subprefectoral Decision and Approval Committee but is concerned with a subproject request
would be involved to share technical expertise and ensure compliance with national standards
and policies. Concerned Deconcentrated line ministries' technical clearance would be required
prior to approval of development plans and subprojects.

A Departmental Decision and Approval Committee would be established to (i) approve Local
Development Plans submitted by community-based organizations from communes or from the
new decentralized authorities and (ii) monitor and supervise implementation of Local
Development Plans. The committee would include (i) elected representatives of the communes
management committees; (ii) representatives from deconcentrated line ministries concerned with
subproject requests, including ministries in charge of rural development, education, health, and
local infrastructure; (iii) an NGO representative chosen by his or her peers; (iv) a representative
of local rural organizations; and (v) three representatives of community-based organizations
from each canton, including different local groups (women's associations, youth associations,
and others).

In addition to technical and operational background information on PROADEL, the minutes of
the Decision Committees (including approved Local Development Plans) would be sent to the
ASPOP's Departmental Decision and Approval Committees to strengthen synergies between the
two projects.

At the central level there would be a Steering Committee for all the projects of the PIDR,
including PROADEL and ASPOP. It would (i) examine and approve the balance sheet of the
previous period's activities, (ii) analyze and adopt the action programs and budgets, and (iii) take


                                                                                                 29

corrective measures in case of anomalies. The Steering Committee, to be defined by legal texts
(arrêté 027/PM/2003), would consist of representatives of ministries and institutions associated
with the program (ministries, donors, NGOs) and representatives of producer organizations and
community-based organizations. Donors or experts could attend as observers, if needed.

Program Management and Monitoring
Day-to-day management of project activities would be assigned to a Project Management Unit
(PMU) in N'Djamena, with members recruited by the Ministry of Land Management, Urbanism,
and Habitat. It would consist of a small management team staffed with:
·       A coordinator proficient in managing development projects.
·       A technical team (a capacity-building specialist, a decentralization specialist, a
monitoring and evaluation specialist, an environmental and social specialist, and a
communication specialist).
·       An operational team (an administrative and financial specialist, an accountant, and a
procurement specialist).
The PMU would be responsible for: (i) coordinating overall implementation of the project, (ii)
managing project activities implemented at the central level, (iii) ensuring availability of funds,
(iv) maintaining the books and accounts of project activities and producing financial reports, (v)
monitoring and evaluating implementation and impacts of the program, (vi) reporting results to
various stakeholders (administration, donors, civil society, projects, Decision Committees), and
(vii) providing technical assistance to Local Project Management Units (LPMUs). Most
activities would be subcontracted by the PMU in accordance with the PROADEL procurement
arrangements. Household energy activities would be single source contracted to AEDE because
it is the only agency that can successfully and efficiently implement the activities in a timely
manner. Support activities to the communities for local planning, and local work supervision
(Subcomponent 2.1) financed by the co-stakeholder, French Development Agency, would be
executed by an operator recruited by the Ministry of Land Management, Urbanism and Habitat,
following an international invitation to tender.

Three LPMUs would be responsible for coordinating project activities in their territory. They
would be established in Koumra, Moundou, and N'Djamena. Each LPMU would comprise an
administrator, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, a capacity-building and animation
specialist, and an accountant. Rather than being directive, they would concentrate on support
activities to local communities in consultation with local stakeholders. The LPMUs would be
responsible for (i) carrying out capacity-building activities at the local level, (ii) managing the
funds to finance the subprojects, (iii) monitoring and evaluating project activities at the local
level, and (iv) reporting to local stakeholders and the central PMU.

The PMU and LPMUs would work closely with ASPOP's National Project Coordination
Management Unit and Inter-Regional Project Coordination Units to coordinate preparation and
implementation of their annual work programs, organize joint meetings and field missions, and
harmonize their training and communication plans.

The detailed configuration of the PMU, the LPMUs, the profile of the staff, and their job
descriptions are described in the Project Implementation Manual.

Financial Mechanism (see annex 12):
Three special accounts would be opened for the implementation of the Program , and would be
managed by the PMU:
·       Special Account A (SA-A) to cofinance the subprojects.



                                                                                                30

·       Special Account B (SA-B) for such activities as capacity building and information
education and communication, to be financed through the IDA grant.
·       Special Account C (SA-C) for activities to support decentralization, monitoring and
evaluation, and project management costs (PMU/LPMU expenses).
The financial management arrangements, including reporting, are detailed in the Project
Implementation Manual and the Administrative and Financial Management Manual.

Financial Management Arrangements:
The first phase of the program would be carried out over four years. Procurement, disbursement,
and decentralized financial management practices would benefit from several new and simplified
methods recently developed and standardized in the Bank. These methods are described in
"Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for Community-Based Investments"
(February 1998), "Guidelines for Africa Region on Financial Management for Community
Action Programs" (October 2000), "Guidelines for Task Teams on Procurement Procedures
Used in Social Funds" (February 2001), and "Fiduciary Management for Community-Driven
Development Projects" (March 2002, draft).

1. Capacity Assessment of the PMU and Financial Monitoring Reports
A PMU with a competent and experienced staff, including a coordinator and an administrative
and financial management specialist, would be recruited through a competitive process
acceptable to IDA. Adequate provision would be made to train the accounting and financial staff.
The PMU would include a procurement specialist and an experienced accountant. At the field
level, there would be three LPMUs, comprising an administrator, a monitoring and evaluation
specialist, a procurement specialist, and an accountant.

The project would establish a financial management system, acceptable to IDA, that would
provide the borrower and IDA with accurate and timely information on resources and
expenditures. The financial management system would include budgetary accounting and
financial reporting for internal control device and auditing elements. A financial management
firm would be selected to design and establish the computerized financial management systems
of the PMU and the LPMUs. The PMU would be responsible for project administrative and
technical coordination and financial management at the central level and the LPMUs at the
regional level. The configuration of the PMU and the LPMUs, the profile of the staff, and their
job descriptions are described in the Project Implementation Manual.

2. Financial Management
Accounting and Financial Reporting. The PMU and the LPMUs would maintain the books and
accounts of the project activities and ensure that the annual financial statements are produced in
a timely manner. The PMU would be responsible for consolidating project accounts, including
those of the LPMUs. A financial management firm would be selected to design and install a
computerized accounting and financial management system, based on internationally generally
acceptable accounting principles agreed to by the Bank. The firm would also prepare guidelines
for using the software, in accordance with procedures in the manual of budgetary financial and
accounting approved by IDA. The firm would train the accounting and financial management
staff on the operation of the computerized accounting system, prepare a financial management
training program with an implementation timetable, and provide the project with assistance. The
selection of the accounting software would ensure that the system is supported by a reliable
organization.

The PMU and the LPMUs would maintain their accounts in accordance with international
accounting standards, keeping all documentation related to project expenditures and following


                                                                                              31

   sound accounting practices for all financial records. These accounts would be consolidated by
   the PMU at the central level, with records to be made available to Bank missions and
   independent auditors. The accounts of the project would be audited annually.

   Financial Monitoring Reports. The PMU's administrative and financial management specialist
   would be responsible for preparing the Financial Monitoring Reports, according to procedures
   laid out in the Project Implementation Manual. The coordinator of the PMU would be
   responsible for ensuring that the reports are provided to stakeholders and IDA on a timely basis
   each quarter. Financial Management Reports would show (i) whether funds disbursed to projects
   are used for the intended purpose; (ii) whether project implementation is on track; and (iii)
   whether costs remained within budget. Financial information would be explicitly linked with the
   project's progress and procurement. The annual financial statements of the project would be
   prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and would include (i)
   discussion of project progress, (ii) sources and uses of funds, (iii) uses of funds by expenditure
   type, (iv) an output monitoring report, and (v) a procurement report. The audited financial
   statements would be submitted to IDA no more than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
   The computerized accounting system would be customized to generate the Financial Monitoring
   Reports as indicated in "Financial Monitoring Reports for World Bank­Financed Projects:
   Guidelines for Borrowers:" with a statement showing cash receipts by source, expenditures by
   main classification, beginning and ending cash balances of the project, and supporting schedules
   comparing actual and planned expenditures. Adequate financial management arrangements,
   including the ability to produce a timely Financial Monitoring Report, would be in place by
   credit effectiveness.

   Auditing. Project records and accounts would be audited in accordance with international audit
   standards by an experienced and internationally recognized audit firm acceptable to IDA. The
   audit reports would be submitted to IDA no more than six months after the end of the
   Government's fiscal year. In addition to a standard short-form report with an opinion on the
   annual financial statements, the auditors would be required to: (i) review all statements of
   expenditure and the internal control procedures governing their preparation for the period under
   audit and express a separate opinion on them; (ii) review the management and use of the special
   account and the project account and express a separate opinion on each; and (iii) review the
   internal control system of the project--to identify its major weaknesses and shortcomings--and
   propose practical recommendations for improvement. The audit firm would review the
   performance of randomly selected beneficiaries and provide an opinion on the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the lending and distribution procedures of the matching grants (Component 1). The
   results of this review would be documented in a Management Letter submitted along with the
   audit report.

   The auditors would review and audit the use of Project Preparation Facility and Policy and
   Human Resources Development Fund grant funds covering the period prior to effectiveness.
   Auditors would also perform interim audits (nine months into the fiscal year) to review the
   internal control system, including management performance, and issue reports no more than one
   month from the end of their work. The findings and recommendations of the interim reports
   would be addressed by management without delay (no more than six months from the end of the
   fiscal year) before the final audit. Contracting of auditors on a renewable multiyear contract,
   acceptable to IDA, and certification by the financial auditors that the project accounting system
   is operational would be conditions of credit effectiveness.


D. Project Rationale



                                                                                                  32

1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
   The following alternative projects have been considered and rejected:

   Alternative without an Adaptable Program Lending (APL). In the absence of the APL instrument, the
      Government of Chad and the Bank would have been limited to two options: (i) a general rural
      investment fund covering the whole country or a large number of areas or (ii) a project (or set of
      projects) supporting a limited area and expanding to other areas through new projects. The number
      of thematic and regional projects sponsored by other partners led to an instrument that provides
      flexibility and a long-term perspective to complement existing and planned projects in a
      comprehensive development framework. The flexibility of the APL would allow the Government
      of Chad to reduce the risk of failure associated with a large program and to progressively build a
      sound national program based on lessons from the first phase and complementary projects.

   A second phase of the Agricultural and Livestock Services Project (PSAP). PSAP, the Bank's major
      intervention in Chad's rural sector in recent years, was closed in fiscal 2003. The program was
      directed toward strengthening the national extension service, integrating it with the research
      sector, and launching pilot activities to offer more participatory and demand-driven technical
      assistance services to rural producers. Lessons from these pilot activities defined much of
      PROADEL's approach during preparation and appraisal. Although some of the PSAP activities
      could be relevant to the proposed project, they would be addressed by another project (ASPOP)
      which, in the framework of the PIDR, would concern agricultural services and producer
      organizations and would accompany implementation of this project.

   Classical Integrated Rural Development Programs (IRDPs). IRDPs have generally failed to provide
      sustainable solutions to rural development. Based on a multisectoral approach, they lacked formal
      integration with national institutions, failed to provide for adequate participation by local
      stakeholders in implementation of development activities, and involved too much technical
      assistance. The proposed project, which would promote a multisectoral approach with significant
      involvement of local stakeholders at each step and sound integration with the national
      administrative framework and existing regional development programs, is part of a comprehensive
      approach to rural development, designed and implemented in collaboration with major donors and
      partners in Chad.

   Top-down or centralized programs. The Government of Chad has started decentralization, vowing to
      disengage from the management of development activities and to increase the active participation
      of rural residents in the planning and the implementation of development activities. Chad's
      communication mechanisms and transport network do not allow for efficient coordination of
      activities with the central government. As in other countries, projects managed at the central level
      have been ineffective and failed to adequately respond to local needs. A program focusing
      responsibility at the central level would contradict lessons learned and go against the new political
      direction of the country.

GEF co-financing under the PROADEL mechanism will create synergies with other ongoing
GEF-supported and related environmental activities in Chad and the West/Central Africa
region, thereby bolstering the global environmental objectives achieved. Among these
synergistic projects include:

- Reversal of Land and Water Degradation Trends in the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem
  (GEF / UNDP and IBRD). The riparian countries of the LCB are unable to orchestrate
  water management and environmental activities to address the aggregate impact of these
  demands on the LCB. This regional operation (USD 18.9 Million) expected to run from
  2004-08 is supporting the countries of the Lake Chad Basin to develop a broad-based
  constituency and regional mechanisms to ensure that the Basin member countries
  coordinate their use of Lake Chad resources. Specific project objectives aim at: (i) building
  awareness of how national policies impact on regional resources, and capacity among
  riparians and stakeholders; (ii) augmenting the existing constituency through the design of
  a SAP; (iii) facilitating donor coordination; (iv) collaborating with ongoing work supported
  by other donors; and (v) drawing on lessons learned on regional water management by
  coordinating with other GEF projects. The project will support pilot activities in Lake Fitri,
  the main goals of which are to strengthen the management plan, review and commission
  further environmental and hydrological studies, and build processes for conflict resolution
  among stakeholders in the catchments area, including possible identification of micro-
  projects that could have a beneficial economic and environmental impact. The total budget
  for this activity is US $500,000. If Lake Fitri is chosen as a priority zone, then incremental
  GEF activities under PROADEL will complement the GEF LCB pilot activities in the area
  in three important ways: (i) by providing a financing mechanism to implement eligible sub-
  projects that have been conceived as a result of the earlier processes and detailed spatial
  ecosystem diagnostics; (ii) by supporting communities beyond the immediate perimeter of
  the Lake (i.e. encompassing the entire Fitrie department) with local development planning
  and capacity-building support for IEM; and (iii) mainstreaming at the country level through
  various activities one of the priorities of the regional Lake Chad Basin initiative.

- Participatory Conservation in the Manda National Park, Moyen Chari Region in
  Southeastern Chad (GEF / UNDP). The Moyen Chari region in Southeastern Chad
  constitutes one of the few remaining undisturbed ecological zones of Sudanese savanna.
  This project will strengthen the management plan for the Manda National Park, the Aouk
  Reserve, and the Nyala reserve and promote measures to rationalize natural resources use
  among the communities within the Park. GEF incremental activities under PROADEL will
  not get involved the Manda Park itself, as it is not in the PROADEL project boundary.
  However, some of the buffer zones and peripheral areas of the Manda Park are in the
  departments in which the PROADEL will build cooperation. Regular meetings will take
  place and the team in charge of project's implementation in the Manda National Park will
  be invited to participate in PIDR planning meetings in order to be able to share experiences
  and coordinate complementary activities.

- Building Scientific and Technical Capacity for Effective Management and Sustainable
  Use of Dryland Biodiversity in West African Biosphere Reserves (GEF / UNEP). The
  purpose of this regional project still under preparation (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire,
  Mali, Niger) is to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity in six Biosphere Reserves in
  West Africa that are predominantly composed of savannah ecosystems. In order to achieve
  this goal, project implementation will emphasize both strengthening stakeholder capacity
  and integration of stakeholders in biosphere reserve management. Technical exchanges
  with this operation will take place during the PIDR / GEF alternative.




                                                                                            35

   - Institutional Strengthening and Resource Mobilization for Mainstreaming Integrated
     Land and Water Management Approaches into Development Programs in Africa
     (GEF / IBRD). Technical exchanges between the PIDR / GEF alternative and this project
     will be pursued. The project's objectives are to (i) develop a credible M&E system to track
     performance and impacts in the 5 project intervention areas (in Madagascar, Niger and
     Ethiopia); (ii) compile and disseminate Best Management Practices (including policies) in
     community-based integrated land and water management at the 5 sites; (iii) formulate
     guidelines to incrementally manage basin/sub-basin issues in the selected sites; (iv) compile
     and synthesize natural resource management data and develop diagnostic principles of
     basin/sub-basin management in the selected sites; (v) develop mechanisms for effective
     stakeholder participation in integrated land and water management in the targeted areas;
     (vi) training and awareness building (capacity building) at basin/watershed, country, and
     community levels in the targeted areas; (vii) develop mechanisms for communication,
     partnerships and operational networking within and between the selected sites; (viii)
     resource mobilization from donors, governments and private sector for further program
     implementation (expansion phase) for the 5 sites; and (ix) catalyze "start-up" institutional
     strengthening and capacity building activities to support community-driven decentralized
     and programmatic land and water management in the intervention areas.

   - Household Energy Project (IDA). The Household Energy Project (USD 6.0
     Millions) which closed at the end of 2003, had four components: (i) establishing
     village-based natural resources management--this component builds the capacity to
     design simple long-term village land-use and wood exploitation plans for villages in
     the N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area by funding the technical assistance for
     nongovernmental organizations, forestry agents, and villagers to develop a master
     plan and thereafter manage and control fuelwood use; (ii) building the capacity of
     the Agency for Household Energy and Environment to monitor and control wood
     product flow through charging collecting user fees/taxes; (iii) improving the
     efficiency of household fuel use by commercializing efficient cooking stoves
     (firewood, charcoal); and promoting the use of low-cost kerosene and liquid
     petroleum gas (LPG) stoves with publicity and NGO-sponsored promotional
     activities as well as testing, product development, and monitoring of stove
     performance; and (iv) capacity building and training as a part of project
     management. The Agency for Household Energy and Environment will participate
     in the GEF project preparation and instruction, making it possible to scale-up the
     results acquired in the N'Djamena area to the national territory.

   - Rural Policy Design, Planning and Monitoring Support Project (Projet d'appui à
     l'élaboration, à la programmation et au suivi des politiques rurales au Chad ­
     PAEPS). PAEPS includes an environmental component that will support the
     implementation of the Action Plan to Combat Desertification. This will be done by
     integrating the concerns of the plan, currently embodied by Local Action Plans, into
     the Local Development Plans that will be common to all community based
     operations in Chad.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
   Lessons from the Bank's experience in Chad




                                                                                              36

  Through implementation of community-based decentralized development funds (FOSAP,
  PSAP, FACIL), the Bank has learned that:
  · Demand for community-driven projects is extremely high.
  · If local groups are adequately trained and monitored, they are capable of managing the
  entire subproject cycle, from needs assessment through payment of service providers.
  · Disbursement efficiency is paramount in acquiring and maintaining local interest and
  dynamics.
  · The participatory approach to rural, social, and socioeconomic infrastructure
 development is often successful and ensures the sustainability of rural investments.

 The Household Energy Project (CR 30820 CD, to be closed on June 30, 2004) aimed to
 create local management structures at the village level to manage wood resources. Some 100
 villages now manage their resources and generate sustainable income from a woodfuel tax
 and the sale of woodfuels. With considerable effort it is possible to develop adequate
 management capacity at the village level. It is necessary to involve all possible stakeholders
 in the process, even those not directly involved.

  The design of the GEF alternative follows the experiences acquired in Chad but also
  in other countries of the Western / Central African region. These experiences include:

· PGRN - Natural Resources Management Project in Niger (1996­2002 / World Bank/
  USD 26 Millions demonstrated a solid record of success and proved that communities
  have substantial capacity for local development in the area of natural resources
  management. It was given "satisfactory" ratings across-the-board upon completion,
  and the sustainability of its interventions was rated as "likely," particularly as a large
  share of communities involved in the project indicated their intention to self-finance
  subprojects identified under the program. This is an important precedent for the Chad
  project as the socio-economic and environmental contexts are quite similar,
  particularly in the rural sphere: fragile ecosystems, weak local communities,
  inefficient provision of basic services, and slowly emerging decentralization (laws
  enacted but no local elections). The primary objective of the Project was to slow
  down, stop and ultimately reverse the process of land and natural resource
  degradation in order to secure sustainable agricultural production and growth,
  alleviate poverty and improve the living conditions of Niger's rural communities. In
  addition, the project had two specific objectives: (i) to assist selected rural
  communities in different agro-ecological zones in designing and implementing
  management plans for their lands and provide them with the necessary know-how,
  information, technical and financial resources and the proper institutional and legal
  framework to successfully carry out such an endeavor; and (ii) to assist the
  government in building up a national capacity to promote, assist and coordinate the
  diverse natural resource management initiatives underway in Niger in the framework
  of the National Natural Resources Management Program (NNRMP), and help prepare
  NRM policies and strategies, based on lessons learned from field experience.
  Community Action Program procedures were introduced and implemented after the
  midterm review of the Natural Resources Management Project. Procedures were
  successfully implemented by all 125 communities in the project, even with the
  handicap of a sparse network of bank agencies (as in Chad). Within three months
  communities were able to contract operators to drill village wells, a process that was


                                                                                            37

  still incomplete after 18 months before community-based procurement procedures
  were introduced learned include: (i) the necessity for a participatory, bottom-up IEM,
  (ii) the importance of keeping disbursement mechanisms as simple as possible, (iii)
  the impossibility to overview capacity building of decentralized environmental
  services. In Niger some 80 villages have created wood resource management plans
  under the World Bank Energy II project (closed in 1992) and continued to manage
  their wood resources and produce woodfuel in a sustainable manner.

· PCGRN ­ Programme de Conservation et de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles: a
 community based approach to integrated ecosystem management has been
 successfully piloted in the German-financed PCGRN project in the Mayo-Kebbi
 (Sahelo-Sudanian zone), with respect to the management of a protected area, a
 classified forest, and a river system. The experience from the PCGRN shows also that
 agricultural intensification on the farm level has to go along with improved
 management of common resources. Another experience is that the deconcentrated
 governmental services need to be well prepared for the transfer of responsibilities to
 the communities and their new role and functions. Their implication and motivation
 in terms of work conditions are important factors. A pre-condition for a new and
 improved relation with the local communities will be the continuity of the officers of
 the environmental services on their positions.

· Agriculture and Livestock Service Project (PSAP ­ Programme des Services
  Agricoles et Pastoraux). The Agricultural and Livestock Services Project (1996-2002
  / World Bank / USD 25 Millions) aimed at increasing agricultural productivity in an
  environmentally sustainable manner, at improving producers' incomes, and at
  rationalizing the use of public resources in support of rural services. The specific
  objectives of the project were to: (i) reshape extension into an effective service
  addressing farmer's needs for improved crop and livestock production as well as for
 natural resources management; (ii) strengthen linkages between extension and
  research focusing on participatory and adaptive research; and (iii) strengthen and
  build up producer's organizations. This program showed the limits of a top-down
  approach aiming at changing NRM habits of local communities. The program
  developed community based pilots in its last years of implementation and the first
  results are encouraging. Generally speaking, it seems that community driven
  development is an approach wanted by the Chadians, from the top to the village.

· Elaboration of environmental strategies in Chad. The processes followed to elaborate
  these strategies (BSAP, NEAP, Rural Development) were always very participatory,
  involving representatives from all the fields of activities in Chad: beneficiaries,
  administration, NGOs, research institutions, producers organizations, private
  companies, etc... This approach proved to be very efficient and local mobilization was
  always extremely positive. The methodologies followed to make local populations
  express their needs in a structured manner, with a long term vision, will be integrated
  in the design of the project, specifically in the process of elaboration of LDP.

· Technical considerations. The design of the proposed GEF alternative, based on
  strengthening    local   management      capacities,   evolved    from    the  following
  considerations resulted from experience in Chad: (i) the GOC cannot protect or
  manage biodiversity in general, and protected areas in particular, without the


                                                                                       38

endorsement and participation of local communities, (ii) communities will not accept
the additional costs (in time or money) imposed by sound natural resources
management including conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions if they
do not understand the benefits, (iii) communities need control over their land in order
to assume the responsibilities of planning and management of their resources (the
new decentralization law provides for the management of lands by rural
communities) and (iv) the GOC role in biological resource management must take
account of the rights and responsibilities of local communities as well as the
relevance of environmental features such as watersheds and transitional vegetation
zones.


Lessons from the Bank's experience in other countries

Social funds. Initiated in 1987, social funds are currently active in more than 50 countries,
     financing small-scale community interventions that range from infrastructure and social
     services to training and micro enterprise development. Originally conceived as
     emergency measures, social funds have become part of many governments' long-term
     poverty alleviation strategies. With more than 10 years of experience, considerable
     analysis is now available on what has and has not worked in social funds. Lessons
     include the importance of administrative autonomy, close coordination with line
     ministries, integration into sector-based policies and programs, flexible and simple
     procurement and disbursement requirements, simple but rigorous administrative
     procedures, and high-level political support.

Community Action Program in the Borgou région of Benin. One of the first community-
     driven development projects in central Africa (1998­2002), the Community Action
     Program was successful and offered the following lessons:

· Communities must be organized through a special participatory process (village-level
participatory approach) to acknowledge and address the development needs of all segments
of the community--particularly marginalized groups (herders), the underprivileged, women,
and the young--and prioritize their needs at the community level through consensus.
· The training process can be contracted to any operator with the required expertise
(consultant firms, government services, NGOs).
· Communities give more weight to service delivery speed and accountability of operators
than to the level of contribution (financial or in kind) they have to provide. Bureaucracy must
therefore be limited, and intermediaries between communities and their institutional partners
(project management, financial institutions, government, and services providers) must be
avoided.
· Direct communication between communities and projects is essential. Staff should be
recruited locally, provided they have the necessary expertise, or be fluent in at least one local
language. Project management must be nimble and close to the beneficiaries (geographically
and culturally).
· Operational inter-institutional links must be spelled out clearly through framework
contracts from the beginning of implementation to avoid conflicts and delays (with the
Government of Chad's local services for review and technical support, with financial
institutions for funds management, with other partners for technical support and training)




                                                                                              39

   · Even when the literacy rate is low, communities are able to carry out procurement
   efficiently and transparently, often more efficiently than formal institutions (government,
   NGOs), provided that the necessary steps have been taken to ensure ownership and
   understanding of the processes and that supporting institutions leave the actual leadership of
   operations to the community.


4. Indications of borrower and recipient commitment and ownership:
   · he Government of Chad has signed a Rural Development Policy Letter, common to
   ASPOP too, expressing its commitment to some sector-based measures, particularly the
   allocation oil revenues to rural development, and to the financing of community subprojects
   identified by the participative processes planned in the framework of Sectoral Consultation
   for Rural Development projects. The Government has also pledged to devote a percentage of
   future oil revenue resources to natural resources management to ensure long-term
   productivity growth.

   · The Government of Chad intends to integrate the strategy presented to donors at the April
   1998 roundtable and subsequent sectoral meetings (health, rural development, education, and
   transportation) into a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy that would guide the
   government's action and coordinate donor assistance. A final PRSP, prepared in close
   consultation with civil society and external partners, was sent out in March 2003. It is
   currently being reviewed before being presented to the Board.

   · The Government of Chad is engaged in decentralization, as mandated by the 1996
   Constitution. Additional resources generated by oil revenue will be earmarked for poverty
   reduction and will increasingly be shared with decentralized entities. At the same time, the
   execution of public expenditures will be increasingly concerned with the private sector and
   nongovernmental entities. This institutional setting offers an opportunity to define rural
   development activities of national impact and local relevance. The new decentralization laws
   ascribe rural communities a major role in the management of natural resources. The
   implementation strategy for the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) further reflects
   this commitment. The Government seeks to achieve NEAP objectives and implement NEAP
   interventions largely through decentralized development plans and projects that will be
   conceived under the broader framework of the Government's Rural Development Strategy
   and associated Rural Development Support Plan (PIDR). In this way, it is believed that
   resources will be allocated in a manner that aligns the country's national environmental
   objectives and global environmental aspirations with its local development priorities. Plans
   formulated under NEAP and the PIDR that enhance productive activities and simultaneously
   promote biodiversity conservation, soil fertility and carbon storage, and biomass growth and
   carbon sequestration will be given priority consideration by the Government.

   · The Government of Chad intends to establish a monitoring and evaluation system for the
   rural sector at central and decentralized levels, in line with the proposed approach. The
   system would be supervised by the Permanent Committee for the Follow-up to the Geneva IV
   Conference (Cellule Permanente de Suivi de Geneve IV). The Permanent Committee was
   established and staffed during the summer of 2000 and has contributed to mission
   identification. The management information system component of the proposed project
   would provide adequate support to and links with this system and other similar interventions
   for the dissemination and management of information concerning the sector.




                                                                                              40

    · The Government of Chad adopted a law for managing oil revenues and a management
    plan for oil revenues to ensure that oil revenues are used to finance priority sectors for
    poverty reduction: rural development, health, education, and transportation. While rural
    development should benefit substantially from this provision, establishment of the
    decentralized financial mechanism sought by the present program should constitute an
    important vehicle for channeling these resources to the régions.

    · Recognizing that its economy is highly dependent on natural resources, the Government
    of Chad has adopted a number of environmental policies and international commitments to
    address ecological threats to its security and to promote more integrated approaches to
    ecosystem management. Chad has ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate
    Change (1994), the Convention on Biological Diversity (1994), and the Convention to
    Combat Desertification (1997). Building on its core National Environmental Protection Law
    13/PR/94, the Government of Chad has also adopted a National Biodiversity Strategy and
    Action Plan (BSAP) as well as a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in the last few
    years. The BSAP rests on four strategic pillars and promotes a community-based biodiversity
    management framework. The NEAP will ensure that environmental objectives are integrated
    into all economic development planning. Chad is also a signatory to the Yaoundé Declaration
    on Tropical Forests. Finally, more specific legislation has been introduced to regulate
    hunting, fishing, and timber and non-timber forest product extraction.

    · The Government of Chad has taken measures to protect certain areas through the creation
    of national parks (Manda and Zakouma), integral nature reserves (Fitri), wildlife reserves
    (Abou Telfane, Bahr Salamat, Binder-Léré, Fada Archei, Mandelia, Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi
    Achim, and Siniaka-Minia), and classified forests, as well as through the legislation
    regulating hunting, extraction of forest products, and fishing. The proportion of Chad's
    territory under formal protection thus approaches international norms since 113,890 km2,
    representing 8.8 % of the total territory, are under formal protection.


5. Value added of Bank and GEF support in this project:
  Thanks to its activities in policy dialogue and its links with the International Monetary
  Fund, the Bank plays an important role in donor coordination in Chad, having already
  established a network with major donors that led to an agreement in rural development
  strategy. Collaboration with other donors in Chad resulted in two multidonor missions
  (in April 2000 and February 2001) to identify a common approach to rural development
  under the PIDR. The AFD would co-finance the project. Both AFD and Bank financing
  plans were jointly appraised in December 2002. The AFD would finance part of the
  second component and more specifically all the support to communities for
  participatory assessments, local planning, and subproject implementation and
  management.

  In 2003, the Government of Chad approved its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This
  long-term strategy clearly articulates three fundamental challenges to realizing the country's
  development vision and its corresponding PRSP targets: (i) environmental security threats and
  weak national capacity to protect increasingly fragile ecosystems; (ii) the need to better
  consolidate ongoing decentralization efforts; and (iii) more effective integration of sustainable
  development considerations into economic development policies. Bearing these in mind, the
  Government of Chad has recognized that these challenges are more likely to be overcome if its
  citizens and local communities are empowered to take greater ownership in the monitoring,


                                                                                                41

management, and conservation of natural and ecological resources. The Government therefore
strongly supports policies and investments that can strengthen conservation and environmental
protection, advance its decentralization agenda, and effectively integrate sustainable
development and natural resource management principles into local, national, and regional
planning.

This project squarely supports the Chad Country Assistance Strategy and Poverty Reduction
Strategic Plan, which focuses strongly on reducing poverty through more sustainable natural
resource management. Indeed, GEF activities have been conscientiously designed to
complement and support the Government's Rural Development Support Plan (PIDR), which is
the cornerstone of its Rural Strategy and PRSP Implementation Plan. More specifically, as a
blended activity, GEF activities closely parallel and complement the components of the Local
Development Program Support Project (PROADEL) as well as some associated aspects of the
Support to Agricultural Producers Organizations Project (ASPOP), which are both part of the
PIDR, and which are being co-financed by IDA, AFD, and the GTZ/KFW, among others. In
this way, the integration of holistic ecosystem management approaches and methodologies
vetted by the GEF into community-based planning will improve the design of individual
PRAODEL components, while serving as an umbrella framework under which a range of
interventions and collaborations can be coordinated. This overarching structure, particularly in
focusing on local and decentralized implementation, will also facilitate a systematic
implementation of Chad's National Environmental Action Plan and create synergies with other
key national strategies relating to biodiversity conservation and integrated ecosystem
management. Through activities geared towards stabilizing and increasing production capacity
of agricultural areas, the project will also strengthen and reinforce the impact of the baseline
poverty-reduction and vulnerability-reducing activities and plans embraced by the Government.

Successful implementation of the project will bolster GEF's overarching priorities as outlined
in the GEF Council's Strategic Business Plan. The global operational strategy of the project is
aligned to support the aims and targets of the GEF's OP Objective #12. Specifically, activities
will contribute to OP#12 Strategic Priorities for increased institutional capacity to implement
integrated ecosystem management, and investments based on stakeholder participation to
address both domestic and global environmental benefits. In promoting (and introducing, in
many cases) holistic and cross-sectoral approaches to environmental management, the project
will also contribute to OP#12 objectives through the provision of investments for integrated
ecosystem management in a manner consistent with stakeholder priorities through the
application of a community driven methodology.

Interventions will address multiple GEF focal areas. The primary impacts will address the focal
area of biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management. Additional global
environmental benefits may accrue from interventions that have a positive impact on climate
change and trans-boundary water management. GEF Co-financing of the IDA supported
activities will generate numerous synergies. PROADEL, and by extension the PIDR, will
benefit from better targeted IEM capacity-building tools and activities, and additional funding
to manage longer-term local, national and global environmental issues that contribute to the
perpetuation of poverty. Incremental activities funded by GEF will benefit from a national and
cross-sectoral framework, as well as decentralized management structures and logistics. Since
IDA activities will contribute to supporting the basic needs of communities, the likelihood of
success for GEF activities will be higher, as they will be in a better position to address longer-
term issues related to IEM in local development planning.




                                                                                               42

  The GEF is uniquely positioned to support these objectives and it is unlikely that these goals
  would be achieved in the absence of GEF support. Without the GEF alternative, it is unlikely
  that biodiversity preservation will be given the financial means it needs to be efficient. It is also
  improbable that a purely demand-driven rural development project could effectively address
  Chad's multiple environmental challenges, nor, given Chad's high level of rural poverty, that
  communities would prioritize medium and long-term investments in sustainable land and
  natural resource management without incremental GEF funding. The provision of basic
  services and food security are so important in Chad that, even if there is a shared agreement that
  biodiversity is worthy at the global scale, only scattered attention will be given to this critical
  issue. Without GEF funds, integrated ecosystem management is not likely to be emphasized in
  the elaboration of local development plans, and some areas of global importance could be left
  aside, which could lead to the irreversible degradation of key habitats over time. The GEF
  alternative will focus on the conservation of key ecosystems likely to maximize environmental
  benefits and on the improvement of plans for the integrated management of renewable natural
  resources within those rural communities. At the same time, it is unlikely that without the funds
  and structure lent through an integrated GEF operation, sufficient capacity would be built to
  monitor ecological processes at ever larger geographical scales, or that any micro-investments
  supported by other donors would be able to generate in the aggregate the same degree of broad,
  multiple benefits to diverse stakeholders. In these respects GEF involvement would be critical
  to achieving these objectives. The implementation of the PIDR is expected to need further
  support from GEF in a manner that will be refined during the first phase of the APL.


E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)

1. Economic (see Annex 4):
Other (specify) NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
    This project is not suitable for global cost-benefit analysis because its activities produce
     benefits that either are difficult to quantify in economic terms (capacity building,
     governance, living conditions) or are not predefined (because of the program's demand-
     driven approach). Nevertheless, specific guidelines would be integrated into the operations
     manual to ensure that (i) projects that do lend themselves to economic evaluation are
     evaluated and (ii) selection criteria are defined to preclude uneconomical projects from
     eligibility. A major criterion of evaluation would be analysis of least-cost alternatives for
     project-financed activities, comparing the cost of similar activities financed by other sources.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
    Financial support to subprojects
    Steps for subproject financing through PROADEL:
    · Beneficiaries submit a request to Decision Committee for approval.
    · After approval, a financing contract is signed between the concerned LPMU and the
    beneficiaries. Beneficiaries should have already opened an account at a bank or microfinance
    institution accredited by PROADEL (convention signed between microfinance institution and
    PROADEL). Communities would be required to cofinance subprojects, but their level of
    financial participation would depend on the type of activity to be financed and would be
    finalized during appraisal. Subproject financing would be through matching grants to the
    communities, not credit.
    · The beneficiaries would contract and finance subproject implementation.




                                                                                                    43

   Cofinancing with other donors
   This project would be cofinanced with the AFD with parallel arrangements, with support
   focused on participatory assessments, community organizations, local planning, and
   subproject implementation and management (part of Subcomponent 2.1).

Fiscal Impact:

   The project would support fiscal decentralization by helping the Government of Chad define
   its modalities. PROADEL would support completion of the draft law on the transfer of
   resources to local governments and help the Ministry of Decentralization to finalize the
   application texts to allow local governments to acquire financial autonomy.

3. Technical:
   During the preparation phase the Government of Chad, in collaboration with key stakeholders
   and other donors, identified areas of progressive geographical coverage. They agreed that the
   first phase of the program would concentrate on areas where it is likely to succeed, areas that
   would be socially challenging during the oil era, and areas representative of the
   agroecological diversity of the country. PROADEL would begin in Mandoul Occidental,
   Mandoul Oriental, and Bahr Sara and expand to Dodje, Lac Weye, Ngourkosso, Tandjile Est,
   and Tandjile Ouest. It would cover La Nya Pende, La Pende, and Monts de Lam, once
   FACIL is no longer active. And it would launch studies and pilot activities in Chari,
   Baguirmi, Loug Chari, Dababa, Bahr Koh, Barh Signaka, Fitri, and Bahr El Gazal to refine
   the participatory approach in pastoral areas and to implement household energy activities in
   the N'Djamena woodfuel supply basin (see annex 16).

   Quality of subprojects. The Project Implementation Manual includes technical criteria for the
        eligibility of subprojects. Deconcentrated line ministries would be involved in subproject
        evaluation and approval to ensure technical conformity with national standards.

4. Institutional:


4.1 Executing agencies:

   Project Steering Committee
   A multipartner approach. At the central level, a single Steering Committee would be
        established to monitor and guide implementation of PIDR projects, including PROADEL
        and ASPOP. The Steering Committee would consist of:
   · Representatives of ministries (MLMUH, MPED, MA, ME, MEE, MTP, MD, and
        others).
   · Representatives of civil society (Decision Committees, NGOs, and producer
        organizations).
   · Representatives of the project team as observers, when concerned.
   · Representatives of donors as observers.

   Implementation
   Decentralization is evolving. The project would support the decentralization agenda, but
        decentralization is still in its early stages, and its effective implementation is linked to
        political variables. So while PROADEL would facilitate implementation of a
        decentralized administration, it is designed to function independently of decentralization.
        Elected committees would be established at the sous préfecture or département level and



                                                                                                 44

         would be in charge of development plans and subproject evaluation and approval. Once
         local elected decentralized authorities are in place, the project would strengthen their
         capabilities so that they could take over the responsibilities of PROADEL Decision
         Committees.

    Though supported by the Government of Chad, the participatory approach is still at an early
         stage, particularly in the accountability of technical and administrative entities. This
         issue would be addressed in the capacity-building component.

4.2 Project management:

    Limited managerial capacity is a serious constraint at the central and the decentralized levels.
         Staff would be recruited through a competitive and transparent process and would
         receive training through the project.

4.3 Procurement issues:

    The 2000 Country Procurement Assessment Report for Chad focused on the Government's
    capability to manage public resources and on the impact of recent fiscal reforms on
    procurement (see annex 6). After the assessment, the Government adopted new Instructions
    for Bidders (Guide aux Soumissionnaires) to clarify the procurement issue. An assessment of
    the procurement capacity of PROADEL's preparation team was completed during project
    preparation, leading the Government to agree to implement recommendations for
    improvements in procurement efficiency (annex 6). Because most procurement would be
    conducted at the local level, particular attention during appraisal was paid to procurement
    rules and procedures that would apply to community-based subprojects and carried out by
    community participation procedures acceptable to the Bank and described in the Project
    Implementation Manual. While the PMU at the national level would be responsible for
    monitoring all procurement-related issues for project implementation, the LPMUs at the
    regional level would be responsible for coordinating project activities at the community level.

4.4 Financial management issues:

    To better manage the project and ensure sound and effective financial management,
    PROADEL is developing a financial management system comprising (i) an administrative,
    financial, and accounting management manual to be discussed during negotiations and
    finalized before effectiveness and (ii) a computerized information, monitoring and evaluation,
    accounting, and financial management system to provide accurate and timely information on
    the status of the project. The system would (i) be user friendly and adaptable over time,
    taking into account the progressive geographical extension of the project; (ii) allow use of a
    transparent accounting and financial management system at the national and regional levels;
    (iii) allow capture of the flow of funds; and (iv) have adequate arrangements for cost
    monitoring for all project expenditures. The project's financial management staff, which
    would comprise a financial management specialist and an accountant at the national level and
    three accountants at the regional level, would be adequately trained to handle the system,
    ensure good financial management, and produce all required reports and statements on time.

5. Environmental:                         Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation
(including consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging
from this analysis.


                                                                                                45

   An environmental assessment and an environmental and social management framework were
   completed prior to appraisal, with local stakeholders involved in the preparation. The final
   environmental assessment and environmental and social management framework were
   received by the Bank on November 5, 2002, and have been available in Chad and at the
   Bank's Infoshop since November 21, 2002.

   Due to the community-driven nature of the project, with subprojects chosen by communities,
   it is impossible to know from the beginning what the project's exact environmental impacts
   would be. Consultants have met with local associations, local authorities, and NGOs in
   several départements representative of each agroecological zone (sudanian, sahelo-sudanian,
   and sahellian) to identify and appreciate subprojects that would be requested by communities
   and funded by PROADEL. The consultants could therefore evaluate related potential
   environmental impacts. Of all subprojects potentially funded by PROADEL, rural roads
   improvement and construction are most likely to have negative impacts on the environment.
   But any subproject (roads, wells, schools, productive activities) could affect the environment.
   Therefore subprojects would be systematically reviewed in advance, and appropriate
   measures would be taken to fully disclose potentially negative environmental impacts.

5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?

   The proposed environmental and social management framework for environmental impact
   assessment is founded on PROADEL's design. Therefore, it is proposed:
     (i) To create an environmental and socioeconomic management cell in the PMU at the
     national level.
     (ii) To create environmental and socioeconomic technical cells in the LPMUs.
     (iii) To include representatives of the Ministry of the Environment and Water in the
     Subprefectural Decision and Approval Committees and Departmental Decision and
     Approval Committees, which are responsible for subproject approval.
     (iv) To build the social and environment assessment capacity of these committees.
   The mandate of the PMU cells would include the training of LPMU cells and the monitoring
   of LPMU cells and the activities of the Subprefecture and Departmental Decision and
   Approval Committees. The PMU cells would have to produce standard checklists for
   subprojects with negligible environmental and socioeconomic impacts. The PMU cells would
   have to actively participate with the LPMU cells and Subprefecture and Departmental
   Decision and Approval Committees in the preparation of environmental impact assessments
   and in environmental monitoring for subprojects with more significant environmental and
   socioeconomic impacts. Subprefecture and Departmental Decision and Approval Committees
   would be responsible for appraising the social and environment aspects of subprojects,
   including classifying subprojects, listing safeguard policies requirements, reviewing
   assessments, and monitoring mitigation plan implementation. The LPMU cells would assist
   Subprefecture and Departmental Decision and Approval Committees to ensure that national
   and donor safeguard policies are respected.

   Since LPMUs and Subprefecture and Departmental Decision and Approval Committees
   would be new management units, considerable training would be needed to make them
   operational. This training would be provided by PROADEL (Component 4) and should be
   planed and executed by the PMU cell at the national level.

5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:



                                                                                              46

                   Date of receipt of final draft: 11/05/2002


5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b)
draft EA report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan?
Describe mechanisms of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?

    Following an information campaign, the consultants visited various départements between
    April 17, 2002, and May 19, 2002. They went to the chief town of each département, sous
    préfecture, and canton. Local political authorities, civil society representatives, producer
    organization representatives, women's groups, and community associations were invited to
    express themselves on local difficulties impeding the sustainable development of their
    communities.

    For household energy activities, some 100 villages already collectively manage their wood
    resources and are extremely satisfied doing so. They say that the environmental damage that
    had been occurring earlier stopped completely once the management plan was implemented.

5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on
the environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?

    The monitoring and information system of the project would include environmental
        assessment monitoring. The environmental and socioeconomic management cell in the
        PMU would be responsible for following up on environmental indicators.
    Furthermore a larger natural resources monitoring system would be set up and would be
        cofinanced by the Global Environment Facility. It would provide surveillance of
        renewable resources to aid local stakeholders in decision-making.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.


    Measures for the inclusion of marginalized groups--particularly women, youth, HIV-AIDS-
    affected people, and transhumant herders.
    Women, youth, HIV-AIDS-affected households, and transhumant herders are traditionally
    excluded from economic choices concerning communities (poor women constitute a
    particularly weak group), and frequent conflicts between herders and farmers in the sudanian
    and sahelian zones often prevent the involvement of those groups. Inclusion of marginalized
    groups must be effective both at the decision-making level (Decision Committees) and at the
    subproject level (benefit from investments). Information campaigns and sensitization efforts
    would strongly focus on these issues.

    Composition of Subprefectoral Decision and Approval Committees.
    Having Subprefectoral Decision and Approval Committees at the intervillage level, where
    people know each other and share the same cultural background, would facilitate the process.
    But there are many areas in Chad where traditional and decentralized administrative
    authorities may have difficulty coming to agreement. The project would subcontract trained
    animateurs to assist communities in their needs assessments.




                                                                                                47

   Specific social assessments have been completed in the départements PROADEL would
   cover to provide the LPMU and animateurs with the necessary knowledge of the social
   environment.

6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?


   Stakeholders have been included in the project design since the earliest stage of preparation
   and would be involved in implementation at several points:
   · The terms of reference of the feasibility studies (which includes a social assessment) have
   been discussed with representatives of NGOs.
   · The project preparation working group includes representatives from the Government of
   Chad, civil society, and women.
   · Several workshops have been and would be held in the outlying regions to seek the
   advice and comments of local beneficiaries and stakeholders. The Project Implementation
   Manual has been discussed with communities, and an illustrated simplified operating manual
   in local language would be produced and disseminated beforehand.
   · Stakeholders would name their own representatives to local Decision Committees
   through a participatory process preceded by an information campaign.
   · Civil society representatives would have a majority of seats in Decision Committees.
   · Specific procedures would be put in place to make sure that women and other
   marginalized social groups are involved in project preparation and implementation.
   · Local communities and civil society will be actively involved in the monitoring of global
       environmental benefits

   Participatory stakeholder involvement lies at the core of project goals and activities.
   Partnerships between civil society and local communities will be built in the devising of
   locally appropriate integrated ecosystem management plans. Participatory monitoring and
   environmental information management will also be strongly emphasized. Local
   communities and civil society will be actively involved in the monitoring of global
   environmental benefits.

   The baseline scenario was designed following a preparation phase of one year and a half
   involving all the stakeholders implied in the environmental sector in Chad: representatives of
   the administrations, NGOs, research institutes (both national and international), local
   communities (mayors), producers organizations, and private sector (Coton Tchad for
   example). Each of the 3 multi-donor missions gathered more than 150 participants from
   various horizons, and each undertook visits to the field (representing all the Chadian
   ecoregions except Sahara). All along and since then, technical working groups have been put
   together and meet regularly to support the design of projects activities. A communication
   plan is being put together, involving various media including radio talks, in order to keep the
   stakeholders of rural development in Chad as well as the population aware of on-going
   activities and priorities. During PIDR implementation, beneficiaries will be placed in the
   driving seat, following CDD approach, by participating to decision making committees and
   will be the major actors (sources and end-users) of monitoring, evaluation, and information
   procedures. They will also be intimately involved in ecosystem management planning at
   larger spatial areas through the development of protected areas management plans that affect
   multiple local communities.

   The GEF project has been designed during the elaboration of the NEAP and the PIDR
   thereby capitalizing upon these meetings and workshops. The following major stakeholders


                                                                                               48

   on biodiversity conservation and environmental management have been involved in the
   preparation of the GEF project:
   ·   Administration: Ministry of Environment and Water, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
   Livestock, and others concerned by rural development (Energy, Health, Transport,
   Education).
   ·   Information centers / Research institutions: National Center for Research Support
   (CNAR), Training and Study Center for Development (CEFOD), Veterinary Research
   Laboratory of Farcha, N'Djaména Univesity's Library, Committee for the Lake Chad Basin
   (CBLT).
   ·   Beneficiaries: representatives of producers organizations like the "Plateforme Paysanne"
   (Peasants' Platform), representatives of women organizations (CELIAF ­ Cellule de Liaison
   et d'Information des Femmes du Tchad), members of the private sector (Cotton Chad), and
   also just beneficiaries.
   ·   International institutions: the donor community (UNDP, GEF, France, World Bank,
   Germany, Japan, EC, etc.) and international NGOs (mostly WWF).

   All these stakeholders will remain involved during final preparation and implementation: (i)
   the PROADEL steering committee, whose composition will be finalized during preparation,
   is designed to be a real platform, where decisions are made, for real partnership between the
   different stakeholders of rural development in Chad, (ii) emphasis has been given to the
   Information / Education / Communication components of all PIDR programs to keep all
   actors informed and promote adaptive learning, (iii) annual and semi-annual planning
   meetings will be held in N'Djaména but also ­ and mostly ­ in the departments benefiting
   from the PIDR, where all local actors will be invited to participate, and (iv) a memorandum
   of understanding has been signed by all the donors involved in rural development and
   environment in Chad, constructing the bases for a long term partnership.

6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?

   NGOs and civil society have been consulted extensively throughout the project's preparation.
   During implementation collaboration with NGOs would be a key element of success because
   NGOs can (i) act as intermediaries for communities; (ii) provide services to the project, such
   as needs assessments, training workshops, and project monitoring; (iii) implement
   subprojects for the communities; and (iv) be elected to Decision Committees as
   representatives of civil society.

6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?

   The project would work in close collaboration with national institutions to make sure that
   financed investments are fully supported and staffed.

6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?

   Social outcome indicators would be included in the monitoring system and linked to poverty
   reduction efforts. The indicators would be in common with the Poverty Monitoring System
   set up under the PRSP process.

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard
policies.


    The environmental assessment of the project conducted during preparation has given a good
    indication of the cumulative environmental impacts to be expected from the project's generic
    investments. By identifying issues in advance, proposing measures or changes in technology
    or construction materials, and recommending methods for monitoring environmental
    indicators (through local-level institutions and structures) commonly affected by project-
    funded investments, the time and effort required for specific environmental and social
    assessments of subprojects would be greatly reduced. The environmental assessment of the
    project also proposes methods for increasing local government, community, and other
    partners' capacities for environmental appraisal and monitoring. The assessment suggests:

    · Creating an environmental and social screening, evaluating, and supervising mechanism
    to ensure that funded subprojects are environmentally and socially sound and sustainable and
    that any adverse environmental or social consequences are recognized early in the project
    cycle. Such a mechanism would allow foreknowledge of the major environmental and social
    issues and impacts of individual subprojects, the set of measures to avoid them or mitigate
    those that are unavoidable, and the estimated costs of those measures.

    · Raising community awareness about the environmental and social impact of project-
    funded activities and promoting ways to mitigate or avoid negative effects. This would be
    done through the project's information, education, and communication activities, which
    would assist in disseminating information related to good practices. Other information about
    appropriate construction materials and methods in environmentally sensitive areas, site
    selection criteria, and other measures to mitigate likely adverse impacts could be
    disseminated through technical handbooks or other means.

    · Finding methods for supporting improved natural resource management through the
    project's community-based interventions. The project would facilitate community
    understanding of the relation between natural resources and well-being, the need to improve
    both, and the need for action to grow out of understanding and be based on the community's
    own commitment and local structures. Because poor communities often lack the impetus and
    initial capital necessary to get started, environmental problems often have to be proactively
    targeted at the community level. The project would have an active role promoting and
    supporting projects aimed at improving communities' management of the natural resources
    that they control and depend on for their livelihoods.


                                                                                              50

                                     F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
    The long-term vision of the program is more decentralized management of public resources
    to reduce poverty in local communities by taking into account their priorities. Although for
    operational reasons PROADEL would have to establish transitory structures and rely on
    donor financing, particular attention would be paid to institutional and financial
    sustainability.

    This would be achieved through progressive integration of the financing mechanism into the
    ordinary public resources management framework at the national and decentralized levels.
    Only then could the mechanism serve as a channel to transfer oil revenues or Heavily
    Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Debt Initiative funds to local communities, as foreseen in the
    Law on Oil Revenue Management.

    The sustainability of PROADEL would first require that financed subprojects contribute
    effectively to PRSP implementation. Even though the details of PRSP implementation are not
    yet fully defined, the following principles should be taken into account:
    (i) PROADEL should aim at respecting normal budget procedures. The challenge is to
    respect programmatic budgeting per sector for resources that are fungible (since they are
    supposed to finance priorities established by communities in a reactive manner). A possibility
    is to budget such resources under the Public Investment Budget with a tentative allocation per
    sector and ; (ii) at the operational level, two types of information should be made available to
    sector ministries: information contained in local development plans for sector ministries to
    update their plans (map of schools, health centers, water points, and the like) and budget their
    resources accordingly, and information investments that are ongoing or completed to avoid
    duplication and to take into account such achievements in the monitoring and evaluation of
    their sector programs. This exchange of information would take place at the level of the
    Decision Committees where administration would be represented and would require active
    involvement from these administrations.

    Second, sustainability would require a synchronization of the institutional arrangements with
    the decentralization process that is still at its early stages. As the program is implemented and
    decentralization actually takes place with elected local authorities progressively in place,
    responsibilities involved in the mechanism put in place by PROADEL, in particular those of
    local Decision Committees, would be transferred to such decentralized authorities.

    Third, the impact of PROADEL would require the sustainability of investments and
    infrastructure financed by the project. This would first be ensured by actual participation of
    beneficiaries in the decision on investments and by their financial and in-kind contributions
    for implementation. Beneficiaries would be responsible for defining their priorities,
    supervising implementation, and managing and maintaining such investments. Particular
    attention would be paid to strengthening the capacities of local communities.

    Furthermore, financing of subprojects would depend on the provision by beneficiaries of a
    maintenance plan with responsibilities, management, and financing arrangements, and on the
    availability of the necessary human resources (teachers, health personnel, and the like).

1a. Replicability:




                                                                                                  51

  Interventions to be advanced under the GEF alternative framework appear to have great
  potential for replicability, not only within Chad, but on the rest of the African continent. That
  participatory or co-management of natural resources and protected areas is critical to
  sustainability still remains a novel concept. While a few CDD operations in Chad in the past
  have partially adopted these principles, the implementation of the full suite of GEF incremental
  activities under the PIDR framework will enable a mainstreaming of this new concept.

  Replication Plan:
  The project's implementation model pivots around the scale-up and replication in all of Chad's
  departments of subprojects and other interventions based on widespread dissemination of good
  practice in community based IEM. The replication of good practice will be advanced through
  consultations, workshops, outreach materials, and other public and inter-country exchanges.
  These lessons will be publicized and made available worldwide through either the PROADEL
  web site or a clearing-house mechanism set up by the GEF. Moreover, the attention being paid
  to the economic feasibility of the environmental projects and their relationship to sustaining
  rural livelihoods also augurs well for replication; the positive returns from locally appropriate
  sustainable resource practices, such as water harvesting and soil fertility replenishment
  techniques, will be clearly visible and other communities and farmers will seek to achieve
  similar benefits. Local training activities will facilitate a sharing of experiences and best
  practices from other countries, such as Niger, that have successfully implemented similar
  programs. Meanwhile, dissemination of best practices in Chad to other countries in and outside
  the region will be promoted by project staff and key stakeholders, facilitated by an earmarked
  budget for outreach activities. Participatory monitoring and environmental information
  management will also enable the extraction of important lessons from the project that will be a
  key element of successful replication in other areas.

                    CHAD: Local Development Program Support Project

The following parts describe all components and related implementation arrangements, including
activities are not to be funded by IDA

By Component:

Project Component 1 - US$13.95 million
    Of which IDA Grant: US $ 10.12 million

    Financial support to local development subprojects

    Objective:
    PROADEL would provide matching grants to cofinance subprojects proposed by local
    communities (associations, organizations, and others) with legal status or decentralized local
    government entities (at the commune or communauté rurale level, once established). Its
    purpose is to reduce poverty by stimulating local development and improving communities'
    livelihood.

   GEF Activities
    A financial support would be established to co-finance community subprojects which will
    have a positive impact on the global environment and related integrated ecosystem
    management activities. Eligible activities will include environmental activities of medium
    and long term economic return regarding priority sites and proposed in the Local
    Development Plans. In such case, a percentage of the contribution requested from the
    beneficiaries will be financed. This will happen mostly by financing a percentage of the
    contribution requested from the beneficiaries (in the form of cash, materials or wages for
    labor) representing between 5 and 50 percent of total subproject costs. A final "positive list"
    of specific eligible activities will be agreed upon according to GEF principles during project
    appraisal; however, in all cases eligibility will be restricted to those subprojects proposed in
    Local Development Plans and that concern or affect the three priority zones. Finally,
    activities must be "incremental" investments having a medium or long-term economic return
    and manifesting barriers to their immediate implementation.

    Some of the subprojects likely to be eligible include, inter alia: the reforestation and
    rehabilitation of gallery forests to prevent dune advancement; development of grazing
    corridors; activities that facilitate community co-management of protected areas; introduction
    of direct seeding, "cordons pierreux", and other agro-forestry techniques that can increase
    soil fertility, retain soil organic carbon, and limit erosion; pilot activities to demonstrate or
    disseminate more sustainable, alternative energy carriers to fuel wood and traditionally
    produced charcoal. The project would also support the development of local drought
    management plans and bushfire awareness programs. Also under this component, the
    interventions and lessons learned in the successful Household Energy Management Project
    would be replicated to a wider area of rural communities in the outskirts of Chad's second
    and third largest cities, Moundou and Sarh.

    Fundamental Characteristics:
    Three main principles would be applied with specific objectives:




                                                                                                  62

· To avoid capture of financial resources by local elites, the project would make sure that
every process (subproject identification, selection, and implementation) is participatory and
that management of resources is transparent.
· To ensure sustainability of investments, contributions of beneficiaries would be
mandatory, with local maintenance responsibility.
· To ensure that local sector issues are addressed, PROADEL would be demand-driven and
offer an open menu of choices with a negative list.

Eligible subprojects:
PROADEL would be demand-driven and thus finance almost any type of community-based
development project that communities deem important, so long as it is not included on the
negative list and meets the eligibility criteria set out in the Project Implementation Manual.
There are three main criteria: (i) communities would have to submit subprojects derived from
a participatory assessment of their needs, (ii) communities would have to make contributions
of their own (cash, labor, or materials), and (iii) subprojects would have to be sustainable,
that is, a maintenance scheme has to be established (management committee, financial
resources), the capacity of beneficiaries for maintenance of the subproject has to be
improved, or competent human resources have to be available to run the infrastructure (health
personnel, teachers).

The project would finance:
· Small social activities such as transport (bridges), education (classrooms), health (health
posts, HIV/AIDS prevention and information, personnel training), and water and sanitation
(wells).
· Management of natural resources activities such as erosion control, tree nurseries, forests
management, and alternatives to fuelwood.
· Large-scale and more expensive collective infrastructure projects that would affect
several villages or cantons, such as drilling, rural roads, and water supply systems. Such
projects might be submitted by communes and would be eligible for a PROADEL IDA grant
if they could not be financed through a relevant sectoral project.


Financial mechanisms
PROADEL has been designed to support and comply with the decentralization framework.
Two options can be taken regarding the management of the funds: (i) direct management by
the beneficiary groups in case they dispose of sufficient capacities and the financial structures
exist or (ii) direct payment of enterprises and service providers by the Inter-Regional Project
Coordination Units (IRPCUs) in case the above criteria are not matched. These criteria are
detailed in the Project Implementation Manual. In both cases the beneficiaries order the
funds. The final objective of the project is to make beneficiaries more responsible regarding
the management of funds.

Chad is currently divided into 47 départements, which include 364 cantons (expected to be
the future communauté rurale) with 108 "urban" communes, corresponding to prefectoral and
subprefectoral chefs-lieux. Most of these urban communes have the same development issues
as the rural areas surrounding them and would be covered by PROADEL. The biggest urban
centers, N'Djamena, Moundou, and Sahr, have very different problems and would not be
included in the project.




                                                                                              63

Following a participatory assessment of their needs, each village or district would prepare a
Local Development Plan detailing its perceived priorities and listing activities to be financed
(subprojects). Participatory appraisal would be supported by PROADEL (Component 2).
Local Decision and Approval Committees would be constituted at the sous préfecture level or
at the département level if demographic pressure is too low and if critical technical services
are not represented at the sous préfecture level to approve Local Development Plans and
subprojects of communities. The Subprefectoral or Departmental Decision and Approval
Committees would be made up of elected representatives from the communities and the
deconcentrated line ministries, but civil society would have a majority of the seats. Specific
efforts would be made to encourage representation from underrepresented groups, such as
women, nomads, and young people. Local Decision Committees would also be constituted at
the département level to approve Local Development Plans and subprojects submitted by
decentralized authorities. They would be comprised of elected representatives from the
communes, the communities, and the deconcentrated line ministries, but civil society would
again have a majority of the seats. Specific efforts would also be made to encourage
representation from underrepresented groups, such as women, nomads, and young people.
Each Subprefectoral or Departmental Decision and Approval Committees would analyze,
approve, and consolidate Local Development Plans into a Sous préfecture or Département
Development Plan. Arbitration might be necessary between several communities if, for
example, two neighboring villages ask for a school. Sous préfecture and Département
Development Plans would have to conform with policy planning and technical standards
defined at the national and départment levels. Communities would then prepare the
subprojects' technical documents, with contracted technical assistance, if necessary. The
Subprefectoral or Departmental Decision and Approval Committees would approve projects
provided that (i) their content is consistent with national standards, (ii) they conform with the
approved development plans, and (iii) a sustainability plan has been provided. The first
section of the financing of the subprojects would be paid only if the beneficiaries have
provided their contribution (cash, labor, or material). The levels of contribution are set out in
the Project Implementation Manual and may evolve during implementation. They depend on
(i) the type of subproject proposed, (ii) the region in which it is to take place, and (iii) other
projects' local practices. The beneficiaries would then implement the subprojects.

The operational procedures would be consistent with similar Bank and non-Bank mechanisms
in Chad, to facilitate the transition to a coordinated management system and the
establishment of a network of community-development funds in Chad. Once local
governments are elected and legally established, Decision Committees would include elected
councilors and progressively hand over their responsibility to local governments (during
subsequent APL phases).

Consistency with sectoral policies and projects
Given the demand-driven multisectoral nature of the program, the subprojects may touch
upon a wide spectrum of sectors, including health, education, transport, energy, and water
and sanitation. Because these projects must be consistent with national policy, the following
precautions would need to be taken:
- Ensuring conformity. The subprojects must conform with the legal, regulatory, and
technical standards defined by national policy. To this end (i) technical line ministries have
been involved in the approbation process; (ii) each department would prepare a Departmental
Development Framework to compile all the national sectoral data (technical standards,
national policy) for use as a decision tool in the Subprefectoral or Departmental Decision and
Approval Committees and the Project Management Units; (iii) the Subprefectoral or



                                                                                               64

    Departmental Decision and Approval Committees would include deconcentrated line
    ministries representatives in the approval process of each subproject.
    - Assessing the feasibility of other project involvement. Once local development plans have
    been identified and submitted by the communities, local sectoral projects would be consulted
    to establish whether or not they can support and implement any of the proposed subprojects.
    -Ensuring sustainability. Each subproject would be required to provide evidence of
    sustainability through (i) a maintenance plan (financial plan, management committee) and (ii)
    the availability of the necessary human resources (health personnel, teachers).
    -PROADEL documents (Local Development Plans, minutes of meetings, general
    documentation) would be sent to sector-based ministries, especially at the local action
    committee level.
    An overview of the sectors in Chad (development status, existing projects, national policy)
    and of
    their interactions with PROADEL is presented in annex 14.


    Cost and financing:
    IDA Grant would finance this component but communities contributions are supposed to add
    US$ 1.1 millions and progressively the Government would progressively add some resources
    to finance additional sub-projects, once oil revenues are available.

Project Component 2 - US$18.68 million
    Of which IDA Grant: US $ 4.48 million

    Capacity building for local development stakeholders

    Objective
    The objective of this component is to strengthen the technical and organizational capacity at
    the community level for participatory approaches, needs assessments, project management,
    access to credit, or new poverty reduction behaviors. It would specifically target local
    communities and their associations, Subprefectoral and Departmental Decision and Approval
    Committees, and service providers (training institutions, NGOs, microfinance institutions).
    Given the multisectoral nature of the program, these capacity-building activities may concern
    a wide spectrum of sectors including health, environment, education, transport, and energy.
    This component would be implemented in local languages and would prioritize the learning-
    by-doing approach as opposed to the lecture approach.

    GEF Activities
    GEF activities under this component comprise technical assistance and capacity building
    support services to local communities, its decision committees, and community super-
    structures to integrate environmental concerns and integrated ecosystem management
    principles into local development planning. Specific training and organizational support will
    build the skills of communities in targeted areas to: (i) design and implement natural
    resources management strategies within an integrated ecosystem management framework;
    and (ii) pursue strategies and modalities to co-manage protected areas with government
    officials. These activities run in parallel to the first component, such that the
    conceptualization of subprojects (i.e. those aimed at reducing soil erosion, maintaining forest
    cover, and restoring woody vegetation) can more coherently address broader ecosystem
    challenges, such as watershed management.

    The component has three subcomponents:



                                                                                                65

Subcomponent 2.1: Support to community participatory assessments and local development
plan preparation and implementation
This subcomponent would be fully executed by an "opérateur"               recruited through an
international invitation to tender based on the terms of reference detailed in the Project
Implementation Manual. Following training sessions, contracted animators would go to
villages to assist local communities, recognizing their common interests, identifying their
problems, understanding their priorities, and proposing solutions under a list of subprojects
and preparing Local Development Plans. They would also assist local communities in
electing representatives for the Subprefectoral and Departmental Decision and Approval
Committees. After Local Development Plan approval by the Subprefectoral or Departmental
Decision and Approval Committees, animators would assist communities in preparing
subproject requests (technical documents, feasibility studies including environmental and
social assessments, if required) and implementing them (contracting, monitoring, managing,
and so on). Women, young people, transhumant herders, and other underprivileged groups
would be targeted to ensure that (i) they receive their share of benefits from the project
activities and that (ii) they are able to participate effectively in the decisions affecting the
project and the development of their community. The participatory approach would have to
be adapted to the local context. In particular, techniques would have to be different in pastoral
areas, where most of the population is nomadic. To address this issue, complementary studies
and pilot operations would be launched in the pastoral départements of Chari, Baguirmi,
Loug Chari, Dababa, and Bahr El Gazal during the first phase of PROADEL.

GEF activities
GEF capacity building activities will proceed in a two-tiered strategy. At one level,
collaboration between key stakeholders, including a super-structure of concerned
communities, will be built to pursue integrated ecosystem management priorities at larger
spatial scales. A systematic review of protected areas and other assessments in the three
priority zones will be undertaken to identify needs for developing new or strengthening
existing protected area management plans. On another level, support will be extended directly
to local communities for capacity building and, in some cases, facilitation assistance to help
co-manage protected areas identified in the protected areas review. These activities will
incorporate indigenous knowledge and participation of community leaders. Selected
communities will be supported to conduct participatory needs assessments in alignment with
"gestion de terroirs" and community based natural resources management principles. In rural
areas in the outskirts of Moundou and Sarh, capacity building will emphasize the promotion
of more sustainable household energy alternatives. In pastoral areas, capacity-building will
focus in particular on reducing overgrazing and addressing conflicts between pastoralists and
farmers. In addition to these activities, scientific and technical capacity will be built in
biosphere reserve management, and targeted support will be given to Chadian stakeholders in
savannah and drylands management under a future UNEP/GEF regional initiative on Dryland
Biodiversity in West African Biosphere Reserves.

Subcomponent 2.2.: Training programs at the community level
Training programs would be provided by local subcontractors and would include a wide
variety of modules determined during the participatory assessments. They would be centered
on:
- Strengthening of Subprefectoral and Departmental Decision and Approval Committees so
that they can execute the activities envisaged under the project (local governance, strategic
planning, human resources management, environmental and social assessments, monitoring,
communication, and the like).


                                                                                             66

    - Specific training for communities to promote behavior changes contributing to poverty
    reduction. Training could include information, sensitization, and pilot initiatives as
    demonstration tools: literacy programs to accompany village and district organization,
    HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness training           (in collaboration with the World Bank
    HIV/AIDS Project), campaigns for better nutrition and hygiene, better techniques for
    management of natural resources, especially in the N'Djamena and Moundou woodfuel
    supply basins, and so on. For increased impact and better efficiency, attending some of these
    modules would be mandatory for communities to access financing for their subprojects.

    GEF Activities
    At an early stage of the project an "IEM Guideline Document" (being prepared with GEF
    PDF-B support) will also be disseminated. This will finalize the subprojects eligibility criteria
    and "positive list" under the program. The document will serve as a blueprint for how to
    consolidate IEM approaches in local development planning under the framework of the
    PIDR. Under a "train the trainers" model, it will be used for capacity-building purposes to
    increase the skills and knowledge base of decentralized Ministry of Water and Environment
    agents and local NGO service providers.

    Subcomponent 2.3.: Institutional support to microfinance institutions
    The objective of this subcomponent is to provide efficient financial services to poor
    communities in rural areas. Following several meetings involving Chadian authorities and
    donors, it has been agreed that the project would concentrate its activities on:
    - Support for defining and implementing a regulatory framework.
    - Specific training for microfinance institutions and communities on savings and credit basics.
    - Support networks reinforcement and expansion of existing microfinance institutions:
    feasibility studies, business plans set-up, equipment, and the like.

    This support would consider (i) the national policy, which is currently being completed; (ii)
    the national and regional legal framework (COBAC); and (iii) other projects involved in
    microfinance support in Chad; and would comply with and contribute to implementation of
    the microfinance action plan of the PRSP.

    These activities would be more specifically defined in a feasibility study currently under way.

    Cost and Financing:
    AFD will totally finance activities of the subcomponent 2.1. in the southern region and in the
    departments of Dababa, Baguirmi and Loug Chari, while the Government of Chad would add
    some resources to conduct pilot activities in Chari, and Bahr El Gazal for this subcomponent.
    Support to communities (subcomponent 2.2.) would be financed by IDA Grant and the
    Government would also contribute to this subcomponent by financing institutional capacity
    building of administrative services (AEDE, deconcentrated services). IDA Grant will also
    fully finance the subcomponent 2.3.

Project Component 3 - US$ 5.06 million
Of which IDA Grant: US $ 2.4 million
IDA Credit: US $ 1.1 million

    Support for decentralization

    Objective:



                                                                                                 67

While the project is being designed independently of the decentralization process, which is
still in its early stages, the overall objective of the proposed support is to assist the
Government of Chad in the effective implementation of its decentralization policy. It includes
the following four subcomponents:

Subcomponent 3.1.: Support to the completion of the legal and regulatory frameworks of
the decentralization
This would consist of studies and technical support to the Ministry of Decentralization in the
completion of necessary laws and regulations and in the formulation of a master plan for
implementation of the decentralization program. More specifically, it would cover:
- Definition of the mandate and responsibilities of the decentralized authorities at the
regional, departmental, commune, and communauté rurale levels.
- Definition of the programming and planning process to be followed by the communes and
communautés rurales (annual action plan, work program, development plans); the setup of
communautés rurales.
- Status of elected people.
- Administrative deconcentration.
- Fiscal decentralization framework and definition of financial mechanisms to be established
to channel funds to the communes and communautés rurales, including taxes on the transport
of woodfuels.

GEF Activities
GEF incremental funding will advance the Government's decentralization agenda, by
strengthening national capacity for decentralized environmental governance. Interventions
under this component will target the finalization and implementation of sound regulatory
frameworks and workable structures for community involvement in                   environmental
management or joint management of protected areas. This may involve modifications to the
legal framework and targeted assistance to communities to work with the Ministry of
Environment and Water to adopt local regulations for such joint management. In addition,
modifications to the institutional or legal framework for adopting taxes and/or user fees to
woodfuel and charcoal sales will be pursued to adjust incentives for proper management of
wood resources. Land tenure and security issues will also be addressed through assistance to
communities to collaborate with Ministry of Environment and Water officials in the adoption
of local regulations and workable modalities for joint management of protected areas.
Support may include modifications to the legal framework that hinder direct community or
joint environmental management.

Subcomponent 3.2.: Capacity building
This second subcomponent aims at strengthening the institutional and technical capacities of
all key stakeholders of the decentralization process at the national, regional, and local levels.
It would include:
a) Carrying out an assessment of the Ministry of Decentralization training needs to strengthen
its capacity to fulfill its mission of managing and guiding the decentralization process. A
well-targeted training program for its three key directorates would be designed and
implemented throughout the project.
b) Acquiring equipment and vehicles, and rehabilitating or constructing offices for the
Ministry of Decentralization.
c) Providing technical advisory services to the Ministry of Decentralization: (i) in the
definition of a communication strategy on decentralization, (ii) in the organization of
information and awareness campaigns on decentralization, (iii) in the establishment of a
management information system on local governments, and (iv) in the formulation of specific


                                                                                               68

    training modules on decentralization for all stakeholders (local governments, when
    established; decentralized authorities at the regional, departmental, and subprefectoral levels;
    deconcentrated line ministries; communities; the private sector; and traditional authorities.
    d) Testing the above training, communication, and policies in 10 communes in the 16
    départements to be covered by the first phase of the PROADEL by assessing the level of
    development and capacities in these 10 communes and (ii) strengthening local capacities
    within these communes through training and purchase of equipment.
    e) Providing equipment, training, and technical advisory services to staff at the central and
    departmental levels of the Ministry of Land Management, Urbanism, and Habitat.

    GEF Activities
    Capacity building activities will thrust at improving the skills and enforcement powers of
    agents in the Ministry of Environment and Water, particularly those working at local and
    decentralized levels. Mechanisms to build this capacity shall include, inter alia, specialized
    training and workshops and logistical support.

    Subcomponent 3.3.: Support to the Land tenure definition
    The project would improve the land tenure system in Chad by (i) creating a reliable data base
    on land tenure in Chad (operators, existing data), (ii) defining new curricula and research
    programs on land tenure, (iii) collecting data needed for PROADEL's activities, and (iv)
    providing equipment to support the Observatoire Foncier du Tchad(OFT). Three pilot
    Cellules d'Observation Fonciere(COF) would be created in the three regions of Mandoul,
    Tandjile, and Logone Occidental to help create the sociological and geographic data base on
    existing land tenure systems, to assist the government in the design of the new Code Foncier
    (Land Tenure Code) (French Cooperation is providing assistance for its elaboration).

    Cost and financing:
    IDA Credit will finance the subcomponent 3.1. to support the finalization of the regulatory
    framework of decentralization. Subcomponent 3.2. will be financed as follows: (i) an IDA
    grant would support activities aimed at strengthening decentralized authorities, as soon as
    elected; the IDA grant would then support activities 3.2a), c), and d), and (ii) the IDA credit
    would finance activities 3.2b and e. Support for detailing the land tenure system
    (Subcomponent 3.3) would be financed by an IDA credit.


Project Component 4 - US$8.31 million
    Of which IDA Credit: US $ 4.9 million

    Management and information support

    Objective
    The management and information support component would support project coordination,
    evaluation, and monitoring, through two subcomponents: (i) project management and (ii)
    program monitoring and evaluation.

    Subcomponent 4.1.: Support to project management
    Day-to-day management of project activities would be assigned to a Project Management
    Unit (PMU) established within the Ministry of Land Management, Urbanism, and Habitat
    and located in N'Djamena. It would consist of a small team comprising a coordinator
    proficient in managing development projects, a technical team (capacity building specialist,
    monitoring and evaluation specialist, environmental and social specialist, communication


                                                                                                 69

specialist, decentralization specialist), and an operational team (financial specialist,
accountant, procurement specialist). The CPCU's responsibilities would be to (i) coordinate
overall implementation of the project, (ii) manage project activities implemented at the
central level, (iii) ensure the availability of funds, (iv) maintain the books and the accounts of
project activities and produce financial reports, (v) monitor and evaluate implementation of
the work program and its impact, (vi) report results to stakeholders (administration, donors,
civil society, projects, Decision Committees), and (vii) provide technical assistance to
IRPCUs. The CPCU would work closely with ASPOP's Central Project Coordination and
Management Unit (CPCMU). Most of the activities would be subcontracted by the CPCU in
accordance with PROADEL procurement arrangements. Household energy activities would
be single source contracted and the Agence pour l'Energie Domestique et l'Environnement
(AEDE) would be a good candidate, since it has been successfully implementing the World
Bank Household Energy Project in Chad.

Three IRPCUs would be responsible for coordinating project activities within their territories.
There would be three IRPCUs during the first phase, established in the same cities as
ASPOP's Inter-Regional Project Coordination and Management Units and possibly in the
same building, to improve communication and coordination. Each IRPCU would comprise an
administrator, an environmental and social specialist, a monitoring and evaluation specialist,
a procurement specialist, and an accountant. Instead of being directive, they would
concentrate their efforts on support activities to local communities through regular
consultation with local stakeholders. The IRPCUs would be responsible for (i) carrying out
capacity-building activities at the local level, (ii) managing the funds to finance the
subprojects, (iii) monitoring and evaluating project activities in their territories, and (iv)
reporting to local stakeholders and to the CPCU.

The project would finance (i) technical advisory services and training to strengthen
PROADEL's management entities (procurement, financial management, disbursement,
monitoring and evaluation), (ii) the rehabilitation or construction of their office space, (iii)
equipment and vehicles, and (iv) financial and technical audits.

Subcomponent 4.2.: Support to the project monitoring and evaluation
The project monitoring and evaluation subcomponent is designed to (i) ensure sound
management of the project through daily technical and financial monitoring of its activities;
(ii) enforce strategic, technical, and operational links between the project and sector
strategies, other development programs and projects, and more generally all stakeholders (in
particular the beneficiaries); and (iii) optimize management of all the information generated
and used by the different CPCUs. Stakeholders at every level would be involved in gathering,
processing, analyzing, storing, and disseminating the information required for transparent and
efficient decision-making, as well as for sound financial and technical monitoring of
activities. The subcomponent would rely on (i) a monitoring and evaluation system to follow
financial and technical activities and (ii) a knowledge management system for decision
makers.

GEF Activities
GEF financed activities will strengthen the environmental monitoring and evaluation
capacities and complement the baseline Rural Sector Monitoring System. Building upon
existing environmental and biodiversity data compiled in recent years under the NEAP and
BSAP initiatives, under the Regional Environmental Information Management Program
(REIMP), and in early 2004 with GEF PDF-B support, this component will: (i) expand the
scope and coverage of environmental management information systems as they relate to the


                                                                                               70

priority target areas; (ii) refine the methodologies and tools used for monitoring and
evaluating the progress of ecosystem improvements (including the creation of a national
Geographic Information System (GIS) panel database and the acquisition of information from
existing remote sensing inventories and archives); and (iii) delimit a set of quantitative
indicators to benchmark improvements with respect to the project's global environmental
objectives, (e.g., biodiversity conservation, retreat of desertification, and net carbon
sequestration gains in drylands and agricultural soils). Such inventories, systems and
methodologies are necessary to properly target interventions, better determine the underlying
economic value of the country's natural assets, and track changes in national environmental
quality in a more sustainable, scientifically rigorous manner. Stakeholder participation will be
emphasized in these activities and communities will play a front-line role in ecosystem
monitoring.

Technical assistance to local stakeholders will be provided by the Association for the
Development of Information on the Environment. In addition, the environmental information
system will be elaborated in conjunction with the development of the second phase of the
Regional Environmental Information Management Program (REIMP), the first phase of
which was supported by the GEF.

a. The Monitoring and Evaluation System
The monitoring and evaluation system of the project would be critical for managing the large
volume of information in subproject cycle, monitoring the IRPCU and communities'
performance, and aggregating information for evaluating the impact of the project. The
management information system would be constructed with three modules. IRPCU would use
a lighter version of the system containing all the information needed from the CPCU.
IRPCUs would gather information from beneficiaries and stakeholders at the local level while
ensuring continuous diffusion of lessons learned and best practices among beneficiaries, to
help make participatory evaluation and steering of the project effective. The database would
be synchronized each month between the departmental and central levels.

Accounting and financial monitoring. A consulting firm specializing in financial and
accounting systems is being recruited to (i) finalize the project's financial and administrative
procedures (personnel and goods management, accounting, and disbursement), (ii) develop
the software and install it in the CPCU and IRPCUs, (iii) train the staff, and (iv) provide the
CPCU with technical assistance for six months. Reports in accordance with the Financial
Management Report format would be prepared three times a year. Once a year, an audit of
the CPCU and the IRPCUs and a survey of a statistically representative number of
beneficiaries would take place.

Activities monitoring and evaluation. A system is being developed to monitor and evaluate
the performances and the impact of the project. This monitoring and evaluation system would
provide information to (i) determine clear and realistic objectives for each activity, (ii)
measure gaps with previsions and thus identify the problems linked to the activities
realization, (iii) propose options and arrangements to address those issues, and (iv) better
inform the stakeholders with periodic reports (terms of reference of stakeholders, activities
advancement and problems encountered, chronogram of activities with responsibilities,
financial status of the project, value of key impact and performance indicators, value of
trigger indicators). The establishment of reports and control boards would imply interaction
with the accounting and financial system to compare financial disbursement and commitment
with physical advancement. Furthermore, monitoring and evaluation of the activities financed
under the first component (subprojects) would benefit from specific tools and procedures.


                                                                                             71

Once a year, a census would be conducted on a statistically representative sample of
beneficiaries to assess the impact of the project. A study would be conducted before project
implementation to maximize synergies among programs and institutions in Chad regarding
monitoring of poverty and local community development, especially to ensure operational
links with PRSP monitoring and the rural sector monitoring and evaluation system. Data from
those surveys and monitoring systems would be used for the project impact evaluation.

Development operations and process monitoring. This module would be based on a
Geographical Information System that would help monitor: (i) existing or planned
infrastructures, services, and development operations in the concerned departments, (ii) sector
policies, and (iii) the progression of the geographical scope of the project according to
various phases pre-established (ranging from "nothing happened" to "community fully
empowered, with a strong involvement of local governments"). This tool would be used to
update the Departmental Development Frameworks. This Geographical Information System
would use scanned maps from CNAR archives or satellite-rectified photographs as
background to display the following layers:
- Existing or planned infrastructures: schools, health centers, water wells, markets,
slaughterhouses
and veterinary services, drainage facilities, socioeducational animation centers, roads, village
stores, village territory with natural wood resource management, newly established wood
plantations or otherwise reforested areas.
- Development operations under way for which are to be specified: objectives, sectors and
themes, budget, effectiveness and closing dates, financing sources, and contacts.
- Geographic scope of the program evaluating the progress accomplished along a pre-defined
process scale for a given area.
National strategies and policies for poverty reduction, rural development, water management,
health, education, transport, and urbanism would also be monitored with this module, but
without geographical interface. This system, to be successfully implemented and used, would
possess numerous links with other monitoring systems (sector monitoring or development
programs monitoring) and especially with the ones linked to rural sector monitoring.


b. Beneficiaries assessments
Light beneficiaries assessments would be conducted yearly and a more complete one at the
end of the first phase. The PROADEL would also continually look at participatory appraisal
reports showing community satisfaction with PROADEL and subproject implementation.
Global impact information would come from the Poverty Monitoring System, and the
ECOSIT family income survey to be completed by the middle of 2003 would bring the
baseline.

c. Knowledge management in the project
The local dimension of the project highlights the necessity of sound knowledge management
procedures during implementation. This activity would ensure efficient information
circulation between the different stakeholders involved in the project. By "information" one
must understand every single hard or electronic copy of (i) accounting and financial reports,
(ii) technical status reports and all related documents (such as financing request forms), (iii)
contacts list, (iv) communication supports (such as brochures and flyers), (v) Departmental
Development Framework (see Development Operations and Process monitoring), and (vi)
technical support documents and publications (such as books, studies, and maps). Therefore,
a simple implementation manual describing the knowledge management procedures would be



                                                                                             72

  written before project effectiveness. This activity includes the elaboration and maintenance of
  a Web site that would include various functionalities depending on the targeted audience:
  (a)     General public: with an overview of the rural sector in Chad and a presentation of the
  project and its performances.
  (b)     Project financial partners: technical and financial status reports would be available,
  with a direct link to project performance and impact indicators.
  (c)    Project technical partners: this part would provide experience-sharing tools for
  international and national experts interested in the technical aspects of the project. It would
  contain: (i) a repertory of technical documents by sectors (strategies, studies), (ii) a chat
  room, and (iii) a calendar of project implementation events (studies launching, planning and
  validation workshops, etc.). This last part can be used to improve project activity
  procurement.

                                Annex 4: Incremental Cost Analysis
                  Chad Integrated Ecosystem Management Program


Context

This annex elaborates upon aspects of the PAD that relate to GEF incremental activities.


Chad's national and rural development priorities strongly emphasize an imperative to ensure for
the long-term health and productivity of the country's natural resource base. The Government of
Chad recognizes that this goal is more likely to be achieved through direct participation of local
communities in the monitoring and management of ecological processes at larger geographical
scales, as well as through micro-investments that can generate broad, multiple benefits to diverse
stakeholders. To illustrate this commitment, the key environmental strategies recently elaborated
by the Government recognize that in order for conservation and environmental protection efforts
to be sustainable, rights and responsibilities over land and other natural resources must be
devolved to the lowest appropriate level.


While the value of an integrated ecosystem management approach to address Chad's key
environmental threats is recognized, a number of barriers have precluded the ability to translate
this strategic vision into action. These barriers include:

· Limited funding mechanisms for integrated ecosystem management. In Chad, no rural
    financing mechanism to afford communities and opportunity to undertake micro-activities
    whose agglomeration could quickly achieve a positive global environmental impact currently
    exists. The few past community-driven development programs have either been limited in
    geographical scope, or did not directly address environmental issues. Until now, it has been
    impossible to implement a bottom-up national integrated ecosystem management program.

· Lack of technical knowledge and capacity of local communities. While climatic and
    demographic factors are among the root causes of desertification and biodiversity loss, lack
    of appropriate natural resources management skills confounds the situation and is most
    immediately open to improvement. Available techniques for reducing soil erosion, improving
    soil fertility, and increasing woody biomass could be used widely given adequate support for
    capacity building. Such techniques would also have a positive impact on reducing carbon
    emissions and promoting carbon sequestration.

· Weaknesses in the legal framework and capacity for decentralized environmental
    governance. The range of environmental challenges impeding Chad's sustainable economic
    development are intimately connected to weak local governance structures, particularly in the
    domain of natural resources management. Decentralized mechanisms are important, as
    national capacity to manage protected areas and larger ecosystems is very limited. Indeed,
    fewer than 500 agents in the Ministry of Environment and Water are charged with
    environmental and/or water management in the entire country, and budgetary constraints are
    severe. Weak decentralized natural resources management capacity in poverty-stricken areas
    aggravates existing human migration pressures that can be destabilizing. Weak decentralized
    environmental governance has contributed to a rise in conflict over land use, particularly
    between demand for agricultural activities and existing wildlife and protected areas.

· Limited analytical and information basis for long-term monitoring of environmental
    issues and targeting. Lack of sound information on the environment constitutes a real
    constraint. Only basic data on protected areas is available, while wildlife censuses are often


                                                                                               76

    more than 25 years old. No ongoing scientific observation of desertification is taking place,
    and most decisions and interventions are made on limited local and often biased information,
    leading to poor resource rationalization.

· Need to contextualize interventions in the context of rural poverty reduction. The
    transition to the oil era should bring major revenues to the national economy. As the
    underlying basis and outlook for economic growth in Chad continues to improve, it has
    become increasingly critical that conservation issues and sound natural resource use
    frameworks be integrated more effectively into local development planning. Adopting these
    frameworks at an early stage of economic development may be pivotal to precluding
    irreversible environmental damage, such as soil erosion and groundwater degradation. The
    interconnected mix of environmental and socio-economic threats to the preservation of
    Chad's globally significant environmental assets demands holistic approaches that can
    balance the ecological, economic, social, and financial needs of communities and the
    imperative of poverty reduction. These approaches have heretofore been limited or lacking.


Project Overview

This four-year GEF funded project, to be implemented in parallel with the first phase of the Local
Development Support Program Project (PROADEL), has been conceived to remove the financial,
institutional, and knowledge barriers to achieving the Government's strategic vision for
environmentally sustainable rural development. The project has four components: financial
support to local development subprojects, capacity-building for communities, support for
decentralization, and management and information support.

In line with the strategic priorities of the GEF operational program #12, the global environmental
objective of the GEF alternative project is to promote community-based integrated ecosystem
management of targeted fragile ecosystems in the framework of sustainable rural development in
Chad, thus combating desertification and preserving biodiversity while fostering multiple global
environmental benefits. The activities thus aim to better enable local communities to combat
desertification, preserve biodiversity, and maintain the productivity of their natural assets through
the introduction of community-driven, integrated environmental management principles and
planning.

In this sense, the incremental cost can be weighed against the following potential global
environmental benefits:
         Integration of integrated ecosystem management principles and planning tools in majority
         of Chadian local development plans
         Restoration, protection, and conservation of globally-significant ecosystems and habitats
         and key biodiversity therein
         Marked retardation of desertification
         Reduction in national net greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through increased carbon
         sequestration in soils and biomass
         Benefits from global biodiversity use more equitably shared and indigenous knowledge
         incorporated into global environmental conservation efforts
         Globally replicable lessons in community driven ecosystem management gained through
         participatory monitoring and more durable environmental information management
         systems

Successful implementation of the project will bolster GEF's overarching priorities as outlined in
the GEF Council's Strategic Business Plan, while simultaneously advancing poverty reduction.
The global operational strategy of the project is aligned to support the aims and targets of the



                                                                                                  77

GEF's OP Objective #12. Interventions will address multiple GEF focal areas, prioritizing
biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management, while promoting (and introducing, in
many cases) holistic and cross-sectoral approaches to environmental management.

Baseline Scenario

The incremental cost for technical assistance, investments, and capacity building associated with
the project objectives are identified by comparing the baseline scenario and the GEF alternative
scenarios. At the simplest level of analysis, the baseline scenario represents the likely impacts that
would result from the timely and steady implementation of the Government's Rural Development
Support Plan (PIDR) and the outcomes associated with its interventions in the rural sphere. This
is particularly the case for interventions that are directly or indirectly intended to enhance natural
resource management. The baseline can therefore be constructed by examining the intended
impacts of implementing the Local Development Program Support Project (PROADEL), the
Agricultural Services and Producers Organizations Project (ASPOP), and PRODALKA, a
GTZ/KfW/DED financed project focused on natural resource management.

The PIDR is a framework for a number of complementary programs and projects aimed at
fulfilling the Government's objectives in the agricultural and rural development sectors. The
objective of the PIDR is to achieve the goals outlined in the rural development strategy: (i)
sustainable growth of agricultural production; (ii) protection of biodiversity and sustainable
ecosystem management; and (iii) reinforced human capacity in the rural sector. These objectives
are shared among these three operations of the PIDR. Underneath this umbrella, the two largest
projects are PROADEL and ASPOP.

The commonality between these operations, beyond their focus on rural development, lies in the
fact that they place communities in the driving seat. They also emphasize the need for capacity
building for both the beneficiaries (in order to better identify, plan, and prioritize interventions)
and for decentralized agents (in order to improve regulatory and enforcement powers). Indeed,
almost all of the relevant governmental strategies and plans (i.e. rural development strategy,
biodiversity strategy and action plan, national environmental action plan) promote strong
involvement of communities in natural resource management. Likewise, new decentralization
laws attribute a major role in the management of renewable resources to rural communities. They
also give the communities the opportunity to group themselves around specific issues and to
elaborate intercommunity agreements called Charta.

All these operations, even if focusing on non environmental issues, like rural infrastructure and
agricultural techniques, will potentially have a strong impact on the environment, depending on
(i) what part of the funds will be dedicated to environmental subprojects, (ii) the way
environmental concerns are integrated into the elaboration of local development funds, and (iii)
how much local capacity in environmental management is built.


PROADEL

The Local Development Program is a three four year-phases program using an Adaptable
Program Lending. The Local Development Program Support Project (PROADEL) is the first
phase of the program and will assist the Government of Chad in designing and implementing a
decentralized and participatory financing mechanism that aims at empowering rural communities
and decentralized institutions to manage development funds in a transparent way and according to
their own priorities, eventually contributing to the decentralization agenda. The project is
expected to start in beginning of FY05. The project would progressively cover 19 departments in


                                                                                                   78

Chad, building on previous community development pilot initiatives. The project will initiate and
test, in a limited number of areas, the community-based approach while helping the Government
develop a coherent regulatory framework for the decentralization process and a master plan for its
implementation. The project will also pilot activities on current natural resources management
strategic issues (particularly land tenure, pastoralism and water) in order to identify solutions to
be implemented in the subsequent phases.

PROADEL has four components:

(i) Financial support for eligible socio-economical initiated by local communities to local
development subprojects. The project would provide matching grants to co-finance subprojects
proposed by community-based organizations or decentralized local government entities. Eligible
activities are likely to include:

                  Small social activities such as transport (bridges), education (classrooms), health
             (health posts, HIV/AIDS prevention and information, personnel training), and water
             and sanitation (wells).

                  Management of natural resources activities such as erosion control, tree
             nurseries, forests management, and alternatives to fuelwood.

                  Large-scale and more expensive collective infrastructure projects that would
             affect several villages or cantons, such as drilling, rural roads, and water supply
             systems. Such projects might be submitted by communes and would be eligible for a
             PROADEL IDA grant if they could not be financed through a relevant sectoral
             project.

(ii) Capacity building of local development stakeholders for communities. The project would
strengthen the technical and organizational capacity at the community level for participatory
approaches, needs assessments, subproject management and implementation. It would support
them in the preparation of development plans and subprojects requests.

(iii) Support for decentralization process. The project would support the Government in
completing the legal and regulatory frameworks of the decentralization, strengthening capacities
of all key stakeholders of the decentralization process at the national, regional and local levels,
and improving the land tenure system; and

(iv) Project Management and M&E of program activities and impact. The project would support
project coordination and project monitoring and evaluation.


ASPOP

ASPOP is a four year, IDA-financed project with progressive national coverage expected to start
in May 2004. The objective of the Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Project is to
increase rural income and reduce poverty in rural areas, while preserving the natural resource
base. ASPOP has the following three components: (i) promotion of sustainable growth in
agricultural production, (ii) capacity building for agricultural services, and (iii) support to project
management.

Five sub-components of ASPOP are particularly germane in terms of their potential impact on
Chad's ecosystems and the realization of global environmental benefits.

    (1) Productive infrastructure . Under ASPOP component 1(a) , a number of investments in
    productive infrastructure at a cost of US $5 Million will be made in the agricultural sector,
    following a demand-driven approach based on the interests articulated by producers


                                                                                                    79

organizations. Many of these are likely to have a material impact on local ecosystem quality.
These investments include: (i) construction and management of small-scale water
management schemes, such as hydro-agricultural retention pools, small ponds, hillside water
retention structures, pastoral wells, small irrigation and drainage work, and small dams, (ii)
soil and water resources conservation infrastructure comprising relevant water resource
management facilities that would allow the channeling of surface and underground water for
agricultural and livestock purposes; (iii) establishment of small store systems and rural
veterinary facilities that would particularly address vaccination needs; and (iv) targeted
studies.

(2) Agricultural development.. Also under ASPOP component 1(a), capacity building
investments primarily targeting the cotton sub-sector will also help to improve the
environmental sustainability of cultivation practices. These activities will include (i)
improvement of existing farming systems and development of conservation farming
techniques to preserve soil fertility (no tillage) and improve the environment in areas of alley
cropping, contour ridge terracing, cover crops, and living fences; (ii) demand-driven
extension and training activities not necessarily linked to the above productive infrastructures
subprojects (such as diversification of agricultural and livestock production, processing and
marketing of farm products, and establishment of seed and plant nurseries and promotion of
domestic and export agriculture, including the search for domestic and international markets
for prominent crops such as cereals, fruits and vegetables; animal and animal products such
as meat, milk, fish, poultry and small ruminants; other marketable products such as shea nuts,
cashew, arabic gum, sesame and spirulina. These investments are associated with a cost of
US$4.65 million.

(3) Capacity building of producers organizations, including cotton producers
organizations. Activities to be financed under this subcomponent would include: technical
advisory services provided by a variety of rural service providers to identify, prepare, and
support implementation of productive investment subprojects and manage Producer Services
and Management Centers (PSMCs); training, workshops, and study tours to enhance the
ability of producer organizations and their representative organizations (including the local
coordination committees for the cotton subsector) to promote participatory approaches and
the development of basic accounting and procurement methods and to foster producer
organization representation in state and regional steering committees comprising
representatives of producer organizations, NGOs, donor organizations, and the private and
public sectors; and collection and dissemination of technology and economic information to
producer organizations.

(4) Public service development. Under ASPOP component 2(d), the capacities of public
service at the national and subnational levels in the technical ministries linked directly to
rural development (Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Livestock, and Ministry of
Environment and Water); will be strengthened. A thematic research program on rural
development will also be supported. Specifically, the project would provide technical
assistance, training, and equipment to the technical ministries to: (i) improve the quality of
the budgetary and financial management in the preparation and implementation of rural
investment programs; (ii) to strengthen the capability of the environmental management unit
of the Ministry of Environment and Water to monitor implementation of the proposed
mitigation measures for potential negative impacts of productive investments on natural
resources in the agricultural sector; (iii) to strengthening the technical and institutional
capacities of research institutions in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Livestock
to implement thematic research activities. These activities aim to find solutions for long-term


                                                                                             80

           constraints to the intensification, diversification and sustainability of the agricultural
           production systems. Such programs may finance studies on agricultural research activities
           identified as priorities by the Government, producer organizations, and the private sector.

           (5) Project management and monitoring systems. This component will increase the
           monitoring and evaluation capacity of projects and programs in the rural development sphere
           significantly. Besides being responsible for monitoring project-related activities and carrying
           out impact studies, the project would support the sector monitoring and evaluation system,
           that is, the general monitoring and evaluation by a permanent unit of developments of
           impacts on agriculture and relevant rural development activities. The sector monitoring and
           evaluation system aims, in particular, at evaluating implementations of the Rural
           Development Support Plan and its effect on poverty.


       PRODALKA

       The Rural Development Program of Mayo-Dallah, Lac Léré and Kabia (PRODALKA), a four
       year GTZ/KfW/DED-financed project, commenced in August 2004. The program is a follow-on
       to PCGRN activities. The objective of the program is to reduce poverty and improve the
       livelihood conditions of rural population. PRODALKA has the following components:

               (i) Rural development sector coordination. The project will support the Government in
               coordinating all rural development activities in Chad.

               (ii) Financial support to rural development investments. The project will provide
               matching grants to co-finance community infrastructures.

               (iii) Decentralization and local planning. The project will support the decentralization
               process through (i) capacity building of decentralized authorities, (ii) outreach campaigns
               on decentralization and (iii) trainings of decentralized ministries. It would also support
               communities in participatory local planning.

               (iv) Support to sustainable agriculture. The project will support the promotion of
               innovative agricultural techniques to reduce soil degradation and loss of fertility. It would
               especially focus on techniques adapted to local ecological conditions.

               (v) Community natural resources management. The project will support strengthening
               capacity of all local stakeholders in sustainable management of natural resources, at the
               village level and also at the inter-village level for protected areas management.


GEF alternative description

       The GEF alternative comprises the package of incremental activities that will be enabled with the
       addition of US $6 Million to the IDA-financed PROADEL. Integration of GEF activities will
       improve the design of PRAODEL, ASPOP, and GtZ-Financed PRODALKA components, while
       serving as an umbrella framework under which a range of interventions and collaborations can be
       coordinated, advancing the Government's key strategies and realizing global environmental
       benefits. GEF incremental activities will help restore and sustain Chad's major ecosystems
       through all of its sub-components, in particular the co-financing of strategic subprojects and
       targeted training to improve the management of protected areas. By increasing local management
       capacity, the GEF alternative will contribute to the strategic priorities under the biodiversity focal
       area, stabilizing fragile ecosystems and preserving biodiversity through catalyzing community
       participation in the management and monitoring of projects in indigenous areas. The GEF
       alternative will also focus on the conservation of key ecosystems likely to maximize


                                                                                                          81

environmental benefits and on the improvement of plans for the integrated management of
renewable natural resources within those rural communities. Through activities geared towards
stabilizing and increase the production capacity of agricultural areas, the project will also
strengthen the baseline poverty-reduction and vulnerability-reducing activities.


Component 1 ­ Financial Support for Local Development Suprojects
A financial support would be established to co-finance subprojects holding promise to make a
positive impact on the global environment and related integrated ecosystem management
activities at the local level. The project would finance a percentage of the contribution requested
from the beneficiaries (cash, materials or wages for labor) representing between 5 and 50 percent
of total subproject costs. A final "positive list" of specific eligible activities will be established
according to GEF principles during project preparation; however, in all cases eligibility will be
restricted to those subprojects proposed in Local Development Plans and that concern or affect
priority zones. Finally, activities must be "incremental" investments having a medium or long-
term economic return and manifesting barriers to their immediate implementation. Some of the
subprojects likely to be eligible under GEF incremental activities include, inter alia, the
reforestation and rehabilitation of gallery forests and the establishment of on-farm or communal
windbreaks to prevent dune advancement, community co-management of protected areas, the
introduction of direct seeding and other agro-forestry techniques designed to increase soil fertility
and soil organic carbon retention and reduce land degradation, and the development of more
sustainable, alternative energy carriers to fuel wood and traditionally produced charcoal. The
project would also support the development of local drought management plans and bushfire
awareness programs.

Component 2 ­Capacity Building for Communities
The activities under this component comprise the provision of technical assistance and capacity
building support services to local communities and decision committees that can facilitate the
practical integration of environmental concerns and integrated ecosystem management principles
into local development planning. Specific training and organizational support will build
community skills in: (i) the design and implementation of natural resources management
strategies within an integrated ecosystem management framework; and (ii) specific strategies and
modalities to effectively co-manage protected areas with government officials. These activities
run in parallel to the first component, such that the conceptualization of subprojects (i.e. those
aimed at reducing soil erosion, maintaining forest cover, and restoring woody vegetation) can
coherently address broader ecosystem challenges, including sub-regional watershed management.

The main tool to foster IEM will be to integrate the relevant elements of an IEM guideline
document into the elaboration and implementation of Local Development Plans, while addressing
some critical ecosystems on a more holistic approach. An "IEM Guideline Document" (which is
being prepared with GEF PDF-B support), will be disseminated at an early stage of the project.
This will finalize the criteria and "positive list" for subprojects that are eligible for co-financing
under the program. The document will also serve as a blueprint for how to consolidate IEM
approaches in local development planning under the framework of the PIDR. Under a "train the
trainers" model, the document will be used for capacity-building purposes to increase the skills
and knowledge base of decentralized Ministry of Water and Environment agents and local NGO
service providers. In addition, under this component, selected communities will be supported to
conduct participatory needs assessments in alignment with "gestion de terroirs" and community
based natural resources management principles. In addition to these primary tools, a systematic
review of protected areas will be undertaken and assessments will be taken to identify new
priority intervention zones. Facilitation assistance will be extended to selected communities to


                                                                                                   82

help co-manage protected areas, including strengthening management plans for Binder-Léré
Wildlife Reserve and the Lake Fitri Biosphere Reserve. These activities will incorporate
indigenous knowledge and participation of community leaders. In addition, scientific and
technical capacity will be built in biosphere reserve management, and targeted support will be
given to Chadian stakeholders in savannah and drylands management under a future UNEP/GEF
regional initiative on Dryland Biodiveristy in West African Biosphere Reserves.

Component 3 ­ Support for Decentralization
GEF incremental funding will advance the Government of Chad's decentralization agenda, by
strengthening national capacity for decentralized environmental governance. Interventions under
this component will target the finalization and implementation of sound regulatory frameworks
and workable modalities for community involvement or joint environmental management. This
may involve modifications to the legal framework and targeted assistance to communities to work
with the Ministry of Environment and Water to adopt local regulations for joint management of
protected areas. Capacity building activities will thrust at improving the skills and enforcement
powers of agents in the Ministry of Environment and Water, particularly those working at local
and decentralized levels. Mechanisms to build this capacity shall include, inter alia, specialized
training and workshops, logistical support, and the provision of constructive equipment.

Component 4 ­ Information and Management Support

GEF financed activities designed to strengthen environmental monitoring and evaluation
capacities will complement the baseline Rural Sector Monitoring System being established under
the PIDR framework. Building upon existing environmental and biodiversity data compiled in
recent years under the NEAP and BSAP initiatives, under the Regional Environmental
Information Management Program (REIMP), and in early 2004 under GEF PDF-B support, this
component will: (i) expand the scope and national coverage of environmental management
information systems; (ii) refine the methodologies and tools used for monitoring and evaluating
the progress of ecosystem improvements (including the creation of a national Geographic
Information System (GIS) panel database; and (iii) delimit a set of quantitative indicators to
benchmark improvements with respect to the project's global environmental objectives, (e.g.,
biodiversity conservation, the retreat of desertification advances, and net carbon sequestration
gains in drylands and agricultural soils). Such inventories, systems and methodologies are
necessary to properly target interventions, better determine the underlying economic value of the
country's natural assets, and track changes to national environmental quality in a more
sustainable and scientifically rigorous manner. Technical assistance to local stakeholders will be
provided by the Association for the Development of Information on the Environment. In addition,
the environmental information system will be elaborated in conjunction with the development of
the second phase of the Regional Environmental Information Management Program (REIMP), the
first phase of which was supported by the GEF. A financial audit would be conducted for each
fiscal year by an auditor and a technical evaluation of the project would be conducted by an
independent consulting firm at the end of the project to assess its results, its strengths and
weaknesses and give some guidance on replicability and for the design of the second phase.


The incremental global environmental benefits of the proposed GEF alternative include:
        Integration of integrated ecosystem management principles and planning tools in majority
        of Chadian local development plans
        Restoration, protection, and conservation of globally-significant ecosystems and habitats
        and key biodiversity therein
        Marked retardation of desertification



                                                                                               83

          Reduction in national net greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through increased carbon
          sequestration in soils and biomass
          Benefits from global biodiversity use more equitably shared and indigenous knowledge
          incorporated into global environmental conservation efforts
          Globally replicable lessons in community driven ecosystem management gained through
          participatory monitoring and more durable environmental information management
          systems

Incremental Cost Calculations: The GEF component is $ 6 M, of which $2.4 M is for the
financial support to local development subprojects, $1.8 M is for capacity building in
communities, $1.2 M is for support for decentralization, and $600K is for management and
information support. Thus, the total incremental cost of the GEF activities is about 7.2% of the
total costs of the baseline activities in the targeted areas under the PIDR. A detailed breakdown of
these costs is provided below. A breakdown of the cost components by contributors and an
estimate of GEF incremental costs by total cost is provided in Table 1.

  2.PROADEL and WB-PTMR
  (assessment summary)

  Background

  The 40,000 km road network includes 12,700 km national/regional roads and 27,300 km local
  roads. Most of them are deteriorated and out of the 12,700 km, only 300 km are fully paved. Under
  the "Roads Normalized index," Chad has been rated 21%. The non-availability of year-round
  transport has also created many rural enclaves, where the high cost of transport hinders the inflow
  of inputs and consumer goods, while hampering the outflow of production to food-deficit regions
  and urban centers. Studies showed that transport costs can represent as much as 70% of marketing
  costs.

  The GOC has elaborated a National strategy for the Transport Sector and a 2000-2005 National
  Transport Program with the following objectives: (i) improving the network quality, (ii) increasing
  reliable year-round network, (iii) increasing the share supported by the GOC, (iv) improving
  sustainability of infrastructure through better management and maintenance and (v) continuing
  liberalization of the transport sector. But there is no comprehensive strategy for rural transport.

  The Bank supports 15% of the National Transport Program through the National Transport Program
  Support Project (PAProNAT), the remainder being financed by other donors and the GOC. The
  PAProNAT became effective in March 2001. It includes several components, among them a
  support to the GOC in defining a rural transport strategy. This strategy will seek to contribute to
  improving rural livelihood in Chad, by facilitating access of the rural population, which is mostly
  poor, to markets and to economic and social goods and services. This activity was planned to be
  completed in December 2003.

  Synergy and collaboration between PROADEL and PAProNAT

  The departments where PROADEL will be launched first, will become the implementation zones
  for the rural strategy. This will be completed in three phases:
      First phase (four months): an interim strategy for rural transportation will be elaborated for Bahr
  El Gazal, Dababa and Mandoul and will include necessary technical, institutional and financial data
  for its implementation;
      Second phase (ten months): (i) monitoring and evaluation of PROADEL implementation
  regarding rural transport micro-projects co-financed by the project, (ii) complementary studies on
  technical, institutional and financial aspects and (iii) baseline for a rural strategy in the other
  departments concerned by the PROADEL phase 1.


                                                                                                           97

    Third phase: completion of the rural strategy.
The regional roads needs have been estimated for the three departments as follows: rehabilitation of
653 km in the department of Mandoul, of 230 km in Dababa and signing of 502 km in Bahr El
Gazal. Total cost for these works, studies, periodic maintenance and day-to-day maintenance will
be around 10.5 millions USD. The works, studies and periodic maintenance would be supported by
the GOC (through donors) and day-to-day maintenance by the beneficiaries, which would have to
organize management and maintenance committees.


3.PROADEL and WB Rural Water Strategy

The Rural Water and Sanitation sector is strongly supported by many donors in Chad (AFD, EU,
KFW, BADEA, Saudi Fund, UNICEF, UNDP...), that finance construction and rehabilitation of
water points and support institutional and policy reforms. Over the 2000-2003 period, 13 projects,
for a total amount of US$ 68 million, are ongoing, covering all regions of the country, which
represents about 1,000 new water points equivalent and 450 rehabilitations per year. For the coming
years, several projects are already under preparation for a total amount of at least US$ 61 million.

However, several areas of the RWSS sector policy need improvement to ensure a greater impact
and a better sustainability of the investment. These areas include participation, gender inclusion,
hygiene and environmental sanitation, promotion of local enterprises, long-term follow up, water
supply and sanitation in semi-urban areas and local government involvement in the planning
process and long term monitoring.

Possible Scope of RWSS Intervention for PROADEL
Given the wide availability of financing for the RWSS sector projects and the above mentioned
gaps in the sector, PROADEL will focus on:
- Identifying the demands for potable water from the rural communities, through the participatory
process,
- Ensuring a greater community participation, including gender issues in the decision-making
process,
- Preparing the communities to better understand the interest and constraints of such investment, in
particular in terms of management and sustainability,
- Ensuring and monitoring that communities requests for water, mentioned in the Local
Development Plan (LDP), will be taken into account by the Directorate of Water in the
programming of the rural water supply projects,
- Emphasizing hygiene and environmental sanitation aspects through specific sensitization
campaign, training and promotion of local operators,
- Strengthening capacity of communities to manage on a long term basis such infrastructure, and
local governments in order to ensure long term follow up.

The above approach offers the advantage of applying the CDD concept to the RWSS sector while
keeping new investment in the framework of the sector policy and national technical standards.
This will guarantee the quality of works, a lower cost investment for the country as well as for
communities, and ensure a better framework for the sustainability of water facilities.

It is also proposed that, in case the water-supply sector projects would not be able to respond to the
demand of the communities within a reasonable timeframe, PROADEL would identify at that time
an implementation alternative consistent with the sector policy.

                                       Root Cause Analysis

This section outlines in greater detail the environmental threats and socio-economic barriers to
advance global environmental protection in Chad. These issues are sub-divided by socio-
economic context and environmental root causes by major geographical region. The project
design reflects measure to address these environmental challenges in each of the ecological
zones.

a. Sudanian zone

Socio-economic context, issues and root causes. Three million inhabitants, mainly rural small-
holders, live in this zone, representing 40% of the country's population on 10% of the land.
The zone corresponds roughly to the southwestern regions of Mayo Kebbi, Tandjile, Logone
Occidental, Logone Oriental, and Moyen Chari. Population density averages 20-30 inhabitants
per km2, but some agricultural areas have up to 60-100 inhabitants per km2 and are reaching
saturation. Both local farmers and transhumant herders raise livestock in the area. Shifting
agriculture is still largely practiced, but fallow periods are increasingly short and soil fertility
can no longer be adequately maintained with these methods. The Sudanian zone is currently
Chad's main agricultural area for both food and cash crops. Though marked variations are
discernable from west to east, the agricultural situation is basically characterized by very low
productivity, due to low soil fertility, unreliability of rainfall, lack of equipment, lack of credit
for inputs, high marketing costs due to poor rural infrastructure, weak producer organizations,
and lack of effective leadership from government. These issues will be addressed within the
PIDR mainly through the Program of Support to Agricultural Services and Producer
Organizations (ASPOP).

Environmental context, issues and root causes. This zone contains a variety of ecosystems
ranging from the riverine gallery forests and seasonally flooded swamplands in the upper
reaches of the Chari-Logone river system, to the wooded savanna of the great plains and, at its
southern extremity, the equatorial forest bordering the Central African Republic. Rainfall
ranges from 900 to 1200 mm annually. Because of the diversity of ecological niches, this zone
also exhibits a high diversity of bird and fish species as well as of reptiles and mammals. The
National Park of Manda (which is expected to benefit from support under a UNDP-
implemented GEF project) is located in this zone, in the department of Moyen Chari. All of
the Chad's ten classified forests are found in this zone, as well as the wildlife reserve of Binder
Léré (currently benefiting from support under the German-financed PCGRN). Soil exhaustion
and environmental degradation are critical issues in a growing number of departments in the
center and north of this area. Generally this results from a short-term strategy of extensive
farming with no investment in techniques of soil regeneration and preservation. When the soil
is exhausted people move on to seek new land to convert to agricultural use. In a region where
demographic pressure is increasing, the last available areas of natural vegetation (marshes,
prairies, but particularly woodlands) are being cleared, precipitating widespread degradation of
the ecosystem, loss of native plants and animals, and introducing the threat of future
desertification. This pattern will soon become impossible to maintain as new areas become
rapidly depleted in their turn. Population pressure encourages encroachment on protected
areas, both for collecting natural resources and for clearing and planting crops. The UNDP-
GEF project for the Park of Manda (Moyen-Chari), as well as the ongoing GTZ project in
Mayo Kebbi, will help to address this issue.


                                                                                                100

    b. Sahelo-Sudanian zone

Socio-economic context, issues and root causes. This zone corresponds roughly to the regions
of Chari Baguirmi, Guera, and Salamat, containing about 3 million people (40% of the
population), including about 1 million in the capital city of N'djamena, and representing 15%
of the land. The rural economy of the central region of Chad is based on three mainstays:
livestock, cereal production and gum arabic. Access to water determines land use and the lack
of permanent surface water accounts for the under-exploitation of many areas in the central and
eastern part of this zone. Large areas with agricultural potential remain available, mainly in the
departments of Salamat and south Guera, allowing farmers and herders to currently cohabit
without major conflicts. The soils in this area have thus been spared from depletion and yield
substantial cereal harvests. The eastern part of this zone is hilly to mountainous, with seasonal
flooding in low-lying areas which offer much untapped potential for agriculture, especially for
post flood cultivation. Livestock rearing in this area is mainly based on transhumance. Finally,
the gum arabic industry is profitable and expanding. A growing international market for gum
arabic, "Talla", which is produced by Acacia seyal, presents further development opportunities,
and also promises greater security in the subsistence of nomadic pastoralists who harvest it.
However, economic development in the region is hindered by its isolation from the capital and
other markets. Other impediments to rural development include low literacy and education
levels, due to the difficulty of delivering services, and inadequate support to marketing and
business initiatives.

Environmental context, issues and root causes. Annual rainfall in this zone ranges from 600 to
800 mm. In the western part of the zone, agriculture flourishes in the lower Chari-Logone
basin flowing into Lake Chad. The wildlife reserve of Mandelia (Chari-Baguirmi) borders on
the Logone and is not far from the Waza Park in Cameroon; to the north is the hunting reserve
of Douguia. There are two more wildlife reserves in Guera (Abou-Telfane and Siniaka Minia).
On the border between Guera and Salamat lies the National Park of Zakouma, surrounded by
the game reserve of Bahr Salamat. Southeast of the Bahr Salamat game reserve, a hunting
reserve (Reserve of the Aouk) extends to the Central Africa Republic border. While the
Government of Chad has not been able to provide strong protection to these areas, their
remoteness and difficulty of access suggest that important populations of African wildlife,
including threatened and endangered species, may remain. The Sahelo-Sudanian zone offers
good prospects for establishing a diversified agricultural economy. Gum arabic harvesting
from wild trees has proved sustainable at relatively low rates of offtake; should pressure on the
resource increase, commercial cultivation of acacia seyal is also a feasible solution. The zone
is highly likely to attract immigrant populations from other areas in the future, leading to
increased pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems in the longer run.        Soil erosion in hilly
areas, and water management, especially groundwater, will be additional issues of concern. It
will be important to introduce rules, mechanisms and capacity for participatory planning of
land use, involving multiple ethnic groups, in order to ensure sound economic progress that
takes into account the conservation of biodiversity and functioning ecosystems.

    c. Sahelian zone

Socio-economic context, issues and root causes. The Sahelian zone is made up of the regions
of Lac, Kanem, Batha, Ouaddai, and Biltine. Its population is estimated at 1 million (13% of
the population) and its territory covers 30% of the land. The Sahelian zone is predominantly
pastoral and its economic activity is characterized by nomadic movements of herders in search


                                                                                             101

  of food and water for their livestock. The full agricultural potential of this area is underused
  (pastures, polders, wadis), notwithstanding the major limitation imposed by the scarcity of
  water. Demographic pressure has not reached critical thresholds, although there is mounting
  tension between nomadic and sedentary groups, mainly over access to water points. In addition
 to the limits imposed by availability of water, rural development is hindered by the area's
 isolation (poor transport and communications networks) and lack of services (very low living
 standards, poor education and health coverage including veterinary services, a dearth of
  banking structures). As a result the informal sector predominates, the private sector is weak,
  and levels of organization are low among stakeholders in the agricultural sector. Climatic
  factors also narrow the region's growth horizon.

  Environmental context, issues and root causes. Rainfall in this area ranges from 200 to 400
  mm annually. Average temperatures range from 35 to 40 degrees Centigrade (95 to 105
  degrees Fahrenheit). Hot, dry winds blow across the land bringing desiccation and incipient
 desertification in their wake. The region contains the Chadian portion of Lake Chad, as well as
 the Biosphere Reserve of Lake Fitri (Batha), in addition to significant untapped groundwater
  resources in the west. To the east, however, groundwater disappears under granitic formations,
  and crop cultivation is only possible in oases, which form unique, highly productive
  ecosystems. The ecology is fragile: droughts, erosion, deforestation, and bush fires in the west
  all threaten the viability of the rangeland vegetation and the animals, both wild and domestic,
  including humans, that depend on it. This zone possesses the largest game reserve in the
  country, that of Ouaddi Rimé-Ouaddi Achim (80,000 km2), covering the northern third of
  Batha department and extending into Kanem to the West, Biltine to the east, and Borkou-
  Ennedi-Tibesti (Saharan zone) to the north. The reserve is home to a variety of gazelles,
  including the threatened oryx and addax. Lake Chad and Lake Fitri contain numerous fish
  species and provide important habitat to migrating birds. A GEF project in preparation will
  assist the four countries who share the Lake Chad basin in introducing sustainable resource
  management practices in communities that depend upon the lake.


  Major global environmental threats and root causes

  Desertification and irreversible loss of biodiversity represent two major environmental threats
  in Chad. The seriousness of these threats is mounting and their socioeconomic effects are
  becoming increasingly evident.

· Desertification: a major issue that could worsen with development. Chad has been a major
  victim of desertification, soil degradation, deforestation and decline in the quantity and quality
  of water resources over the last thirty years (at least).      Around the main urban centers
  (N'Djamena, Ati, Abéché, and Bongor, for example), "halos" of desertification and
  deforestation can be clearly seen on satellite images, resulting from excessive wood cutting for
  charcoal and construction materials. This activity not only reduces biomass but also adds to
  the carbon emissions released by wood burning. The lack of development to date in Chad has
  helped to preserve the remaining resources, but development cannot be denied. As explained
  above, the politico-socio-economic conditions are ripe for development, and it is now
  necessary to consciously integrate conservation and sustainable resource use in development
  programs. Chad has long recognized its dependence on natural resources and has made it a
  strong policy to include environmental concerns which will be a precious pre-requisite now
  that strong development is expected.



                                                                                               102

· Irreversible loss of biodiversity. According to WCMC, 6 animal species are currently critically
  endangered (among which the addax, the northern white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros),
 6 endangered (among which the Addra and Rhim gazelle, the giant otter and the elephant) and
 16 vulnerable, while 1 is now extinct in the wild (the Sahara oryx). In the Saharan zone, natural
 migrations of addax and oryx have been disturbed by poaching and the effects of drought on
 their food and water supply. In the Sahelian zone, elephants and ostriches have almost
 disappeared due to the loss of vegetation in temporary streams and overgrazing by small
 ruminants. In the Sudano-Sahelian zone, feline populations (lions and panthers) and large
 antelopes (Derby Elands) are disappearing due to increased human pressure on their habitat. In
 the Sudanian zone, where buffalos, giraffes and rhinoceros are threatened, unique vegetal
 associations combining woody species, shrubs and grasses are found in great variety in the
 different biotopes of this zone but are increasingly threatened by expanding agricultural
  activity. In addition, poor management of fish resources has led to the near-disappearance of
  certain fish species (eels, capitaines, etc.) due to overexploitation and water pollution.

  Summary table of major causes to threats, linkages with development issues, actors involved.
 In order to distinctly put into evidence the major causes of the threats to the global
 environment, so as to build the GEF alternative accordingly, the following table has been
 elaborated. This table summarizes elements gathered from the BSAP, the NEAP, the PIDR and

             Additional Annex 15: Overview of Main National Environmental Strategies

    1. National Environmental Action Plan

This plan, currently in preparation, will be implemented towards June 2003, in the framework of
the PIDR after it is adopted by Government and any necessary adjustments made in the National
Environmental Policy. The NEAP will define broad strategic principles at the national level. It
will be executed on the ground through local village, cantonal and departmental plans which will
be developed taking into account the specific requirements of each locality. The NEAP represents
an opportunity for systematic analysis of environmental issues, in order to formulate diagnoses and
identify strategies and interventions, with their technical, institutional and financial
implementation arrangements. The NEAP involves cross-sectoral planning, bringing together
ministerial departments and representatives of civil society to formulate and implement strategies
to incorporate environmental concerns into all economic and social development activities. The
NEAP has four objectives:

1. to integrate environmental concerns into all economic development strategies;

2. to establish long term environmental priorities for the Government, and improve the efficiency
    of public interventions, so as to reduce duplication of effort and optimize human and financial
    investments;

3. to establish a collaborative framework for the implementation of PNAE activities jointly by
    GOC, international partners, and NGOs, and

4. to heighten awareness in all segments of the population, and involve them in sustainable
    natural resource utilization.

Chad is one of the last sub-Saharan countries to carry out a NEAP, which will enable it to draw
from other PNAE experiences in the region.

    2. Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan

The elements of the Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan are summarized in the following
paragraphs, written in November 1998:

a. Development objectives, indicators and assumptions

The development objective of the Biodiversity Strategy in Chad comes from the concern of taking
account of the aspirations of the populations and to "negotiate" an objective likely to be reached.
In formulating such an objective, one makes the choice to reconcile the objective of conservation
with that of development. Instead of denying the latent conflict between the conservation and the
exploitation, one integrates it in the strategic approach and one chooses a concerted approach. In
other words, the actions of the authorities in charge of the strategy will seek a perfect synergy with
those of the populations and other actors in this sector, in particular while supporting and
facilitating as much as possible their own initiatives. Doing so, the populations and other actors
will in the long term integrate the durable conservation and the management of the living resources
in their attitudes, behaviors and initiatives. The introduced or induced improvements will have the
chances to sustain itself beyond the specific interventions which will be programmed within the
framework of national strategy. With this intention, the development and the implementation of an
effective strategy of information education communication including social mobilization, seemed
significant transverse needs for each of the five (5) expected outcomes of the national strategy: The


                                                                                                  107

development objective thus formulated as it follows: sustainable exploitation of biodiversity in
Chad. The indicators formulated for this objective are:
    · % of the population which ensures its food safety
    · % of the food imports compared to the overall consumption decreases
    · Reduction in the distance between great agglomerations and surrounding forests.
The first two indicators would tend to show, in a complementary way, that the resources of the
Chadian environment, managed durably, are sufficient to satisfy the national request. A significant
assumption being that the demographic growth remains under control. The third indicator could
inform about the reduction in the degradation rate of forest resource, because of urban expansion.

b. Specific objective of the strategy, indicators and assumptions

This objective was formulated as follows: sustainable conservation and management of
biological diversity.    It is the objective which the persons in charge for the strategy must
guarantee, in the long term. It describes a desirable situation where balance is found between
conservation and exploitation of biodiversity. The following indicators were formulated for this
objective:
    · volume of biomass in Chad increases by maintaining its diversity.
    · increase in fauna (surface of the habitats, species, population by species).
    · inversion and evolution of the general tendency of degradation of the living resources.
If the results below are assured, the only significant assumptions which could endanger the
achievement of the objective of the strategy are:
    · safety is not restored durably in Chad.
    · political good-will does not exist.

c. Strategic axes

The strategic axes are directions defined to guarantee that the various goals are achieved. For each
axis, actions to be carried out were formulated, as well as indicators. These axes are:

    · Improved knowledge and monitoring of Biological Diversity. Since biodiversity indicators
        are constantly changing, a one time census is not adapted. To the existing stock of
        knowledge, it is necessary to add those acquired continuously through research and studies.
        The concept of monitoring does not cover only the police-function around the living
        resources to preserve, but more especially the daily accumulation of information on the
        evolutions and possible degradations of the elements of biological diversity in order to be
        able to take suitable measures. The goal is to enable the means of exploiting existing
        information while focusing on the needs specificities of biodiversity. This process of
        knowledge management can generate new complementary methods of collection of
        information which will be centered on definite needs instead of being bound by concerns of
        exhaustiveness, not easily controllable. The indicators proposed for this axis are: (i)
        increase in the number of requests with satisfactory answers from the centers and data
        bases, (ii) increase in the number of articles and scientific publications on Biological
        Diversity, and (iii) increase in knowledge of the biodiversity populations.

    · Ecosystems and species threatened inventoried, preserved and/or restored. This axis
        addresses more specifically the "conservation" component of the strategy. Even if it
        appeared that Chad, with its surface of protected areas, almost reached the necessary
        international standards, much remains to be done to make these protected areas really
        functional. The examination of the indicators proposed hereafter demonstrates the great


                                                                                                108

        importance of this component of the strategy. The indicators proposed for this axis are: (i)
        % of the surfaces of protected compared to international standards (quantity, quality), (ii)
        increase in the endemic species of the fauna and of flora, (iii) some disappeared or
        disappearing species newly introduced, (iv) reduction in the number of criminal acts (in
        particular bush fires) in and around protected areas.

    · Increased use of substitution resources. This axis will be result from the actions of
        promotion of substitution resources in order to decrease the anthropogenic pressure. The
        actions to be undertaken will be: promotion, research, and even subsidy. This question of
        subsidy has been widely discussed and the workshop considered it necessary to take into
        account, in spite of the expressed reserves. The Indicators for this axis are: (i) % of
        reduction in the consumption of wooden energy, (ii) % of increase in the consumption of
        gas in urban households, (iii) % of increase in the consumption of biogas in rural
        households.

    · Techniques of sustainable exploitation adopted. These techniques refer to agriculture,
        breeding, fishing, hunting, forest and to all other forms of production or extraction of the
        biological resources. It aims at either improving productivity, or at decreasing pressure on
        the nature which provides them, or at collecting in a more selective way, by minimizing
        losses. The Indicators for this axis are: (i) the fallow period lengthen from ± 2 years in
        1998 to X1 in 2003, X2 in 2010, (ii) the average yield of cereals increases from 500 kg/ha
        in 1998 to X1 in 2003, X2 in 2010, (iii) the number of farmers using agrosylvopastoralism
        increases, (iv) reduction in itinerant cultures.

    · Fair exploitation of the biodiversity. This axis comes from the concern of real partnership
        with the base: to guarantee a righteous and fair division of biodiversity resources is indeed
        likely to convince the populations to take part in conservation actions, fostering the concept
        of collective responsibility as regards to biodiversity conservation. The Indicators for this
        axis are: (i) reduction of the number of conflicts related to the land use, (ii) increase of the
        number of peaceful and sustainable accesses to land property, (iii) increase of the surface
        and number of community-managed forests, (iv) some initiatives of transborder
        management of the living resources, (v) increase of financial flows of the GEF in favor of
        Chad.


    3. National Action Plan Against Desertification

The National Action Plan to fight against desertification (PAN/LCD ­ Plan d'Action National de
Lutte Contre la Désertification) was approved in September 2000 on behalf of the Government by
the National High Committee for the Environment (HCNE). The global objective of the PAN/LCD
is to combat desertification and to mitigate the effects of drought to sustain agricultural production.
Fours specific objectives including their outputs underlie the global objective. The four specific
objectives are the following:

1. to protect, restore and develop productive potential to achieve:
    · sustainable agriculture production,
    · sustainable livestock production respectful of environment,
    · protected and enhanced fisheries,
    · urban development policy that sustains town planning respectful of man and the
        environment.



                                                                                                   109

2. to protect and safeguard very important and threatened ecosystems. This specific objective is
   directed to Lake Chad, Lake Fitri, the Ouadis, the oasis and the korolands;

3. to build capacities to fight desertification. This objective is secured by developing the human
   resources of the rural people, the NGOs, and the public agencies. The capacity building will
   also involve the strengthening of the material and financial means and the readaptation of the
   institutional and legal framework.

4. to manage risks, to protect the fragility of natural ecosystems and to withstand the uncertainty
   linked to rainfalls and the uncertainty and the imperfection built into human activities.

The PAN/LCD, part of the PIDR, now needs to be translated into local development plans. Thanks
to GEF funding, this could be undertaken during preparation and implementation of the PIDR.

Key issues

1.       Scientific and technical soundness of the project

Soil degradation process and loss of biodiversity are considered the major threat for the future of our planet.
Chad, one of the poorest countries of the world, is facing both of these threats. Deforestation, soil quality
degradation and desertification represent a sequence of process that in Chad is exacerbated by the
increasing demographic pressure. The unsustainable use of wood fuel and charcoal, and overgrazing are the
factors promoting a vicious circle that lead to ecological damages and soil degradation.

Within the main objective of Chad Government to reduce poverty and to promote sustainable development,
biodiversity conservation represents the priority of the GEF Project, although other focal areas are involved.
The current scientific theory of both ecology and social science seems to be fulfilled. The ecological
approach include the preservation of both natural and agricultural biodiversity, including genetic, species
and landscape diversity. The social aspects reflect the actual guidelines to promote a participatory
mechanism with local communities and to shift towards a decentralized approach to natural resources
management.

The GEF intervention will allows better integration of environmental aspects in the ongoing development
programs. The need to avoid irreversible environmental damages is essential in a transitional economy,
where the change induced by the oil revenues can be very fast. Biodiversity conservation will be achieved
through distinct mechanisms operating at two different scales:
-        at local scale the co-financing mechanism of sub-project related to biodiversity conservation and
support to local community for capacity building;
-        at broader scale applying the integrated ecosystem management principles.


2.       Identification of the Global Environmental Benefits

Within the sub-saharan region, Chad has unique, globally important ecosystems that are at risk of serious
irreversible degradation; furthermore the ecosystem fragility is exacerbated by demographic pressure and
land-use conflicts. Even if environment and nature protection is a priority in Chad, the scarcity of
governmental resources require an increase in external financing to achieve an effective biodiversity
conservation policy. Within this framework the GEF project aims to integrate the environmental issues into
the Chad development policy. The environmental benefits deriving from the success of the project are
clearly identified and concern mainly biodiversity conservation and soil protection.

3.       Fit within the context of the goals of GEF and relevant Conventions

Project fits well within the goals, strategies and priorities of the GEF. It also fits well within the objectives
of the Biodiversity, Desertification and Climate Conventions. If Lake Chad and Lake Fitri will be included


                                                                                                            111

in the priority zones also the Ramsar Convention on wetlands will be fitted by the activities proposed in the
project.

4.      Regional Context

All the proposed activities will be realized within Chad, however the environmental and socio-economic
conditions of Chad can be considered representative of the wider area including the sub-saharan countries.


5.      Replicability of the project

The fight against desertification, soil and biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction represent
common issues for the sub-saharan region and for most countries of the African continent. The possible
achievement of these results through a participatory approach, will allow this project to become a model for
many African countries


6.      Sustainability of the project

The sustainability of the project relies on the progressive integration of donor financing with other financing
mechanism, such as:
        -        ordinary public resources;
        -        oil revenues;
        -        subproject beneficiary provision;
        -        local taxes for natural resources use.
        -        The long-term risk of PROADEL failure due to the lack of financing has been rated as
           "medium"


Secondary issues

1.      Linkage to other focal areas

This project is a clear case of multi focal activity. Even if it is stated that biodiversity is the priority focal
area, many of the proposal activities will improve soil quality, and promote carbon storage in both, soil and
biomass. Consequently the project has a clear link with the climate change focal area and to the soil
conservation issues. The reduction of wood harvesting and the increase in soil organic carbon stocks, will
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emission.


2.      Linkage to other programs and action plans at regional or subregional level

GEF activities are adequately linked with other international and national programs in Chad. Special
coordination is realized between the first phase of PROADEL project and the GEF that will subsidize
incremental activities which will have a positive impact on the global environment. Coordination will be
realized also with other ongoing programs in Chad financed by GEF/UNDP, IDA, European Commission,
bilateral cooperation. The objectives of the project are in accordance with the National Environmental Plan,
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and National Action Plan Against the Desertification.


3.      Degree of involvement of stakeholders in the project

The project is based on the Community Driven Development (CCD) approach, according which a strong
and effective participation of beneficiary is recommended. All over the project the importance of


                                                                                                              112

strengthening local capacity and increasing stakeholders involvement is emphasized. It is especially under
the PROADEL component 1 (Financial support to local development subprojects) and the component 2
(Capacity building for communities) that the importance of participatory approach is stressed. The matching
grants of component 1 will be assigned to local community subprojects presented by groups of
stakeholders. The management of protected areas and the identification of new priority intervention zones
will involve the participation of community leaders and the use of indigenous knowledge.


4.      Capacity building aspects

As indicated in the previous paragraph, the project includes many activities to promote and involve the
indigenous knowledge and the capacity building, especially with respect to natural resources and protected
area management. Specific training and organizational support will improve the skills of communities in the
integrated ecosystem management.


5.      Innovativeness of the projects

The project presents many innovative aspects:
        -        coordination between a Community Driven Development approach with the needs of
          environmental protection;
        -        large scale application of the integrated ecosystem management;
        -        possibility to scale-up the project;
        -        support to decentralization process;
        -        widespread use of participatory approach and capacity building of local community;
        -        small, local project co-financing;
        -        involvement of local communities in the management of protected area;
        -        use of oil revenues for rural sustainable development;
        -        sound environmental monitoring system based on GIS techniques and on a set of ecological
          indicators.
