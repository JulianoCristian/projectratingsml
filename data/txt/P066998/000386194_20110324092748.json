Some lessons learned included:\n            participatory approaches create expectations that can be\n            difficult to meet. To the extent that projects based on\n            participatory community-driven development (CDD) approaches\n            succeed in mobilizing rural communities to articulate their\n            development needs, they have a tendency to generate\n            expectations that may be difficult to meet if significant\n            amounts of financing cannot be mobilized. Capacity of local\n            communities to contribute co-financing may be limited. The\n            project design called for beneficiaries to contribute Ten\n            percent of subproject costs, but beneficiaries were able to\n            contribute only Three percent on average, and a significant\n            part of their contributions was in kind. Capacity building\n            is a long term process. A consistent message heard from many\n            stakeholders was the importance of continuing the capacity\n            building activities that were launched during the first\n            phase of the project. Results frameworks and Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) plans must be realistic given capacity\n            constraints. The results framework and the associated\n            M&E plan for the project turned out to be extremely\n            ambitious given the limited capacity available for their\n            implementation. The project M&E manual called for the\n            collection of far too much information, excessively frequent\n            reporting, and the use of overly sophisticated analytical procedures."}, "docdt": "2010-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
