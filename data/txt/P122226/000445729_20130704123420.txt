                                SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

                              Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                          November 1, 2012



     The Executive Directors approved a Competitiveness Development Policy Operation for
the Republic of Moldova in the amount of SDR 19.8 million (US$30 million equivalent) on the
payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (IDA/R2012-0254).

       Directors supported the proposed operation, which addresses the constraints to growth by
improving the return to private investment and decreasing the cost of finance. They noted that
the operation is consistent with the priorities of the Country Partnership Strategy Progress
Report. Directors encouraged continued close attention to reform implementation and
monitoring.     They also highlighted the importance of measures to strengthen public
administration capacity, the financial system, and the competitiveness of the agriculture sector.
Finally, Directors encouraged continued collaboration with the IMF and other donors.
