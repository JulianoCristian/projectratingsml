Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO) Project for Moldova were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: extensive\n            consultations were held both during design and\n            implementation of the program, including with the center of\n            government (State Chancellery and Ministry of Finance, or\n            MOF), concerned line ministries (agriculture, economy),\n            members of parliament, and civil society (including\n            academia, business associations, and Non-Governmental\n            Organizations, or NGOs). This broad approach to\n            consultations helped the team to identify key reforms, but\n            also develop an understanding of the broader political\n            environment and its implications on feasibility of different\n            reform measures. It also contributed to building a broader\n            support base for key reform actions, especially those that\n            required legislative approval. Solid analytical\n            underpinnings inform the design and implementation of the\n            overall program and individual measures. Strong\n            complementarities between the DPO and the World Bank Group\n            (WBG) sectoral engagement improve the effectiveness of both.\n            While a stand-alone DPO has limitations in addressing\n            complex institutional change, it can be effective if\n            continuity in the policy dialogue and program implementation\n            is ensured."}, "docdt": "2013-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
