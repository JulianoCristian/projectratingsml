Among the lessons learned from this project\n            were the following: Project design should be well balanced.\n            Pilot testing before country-wide roll out is important to\n            ensure success of comprehensive reforms. Coordinating\n            assistance for European Union acceding countries is critical\n            at the preparation stage. Full involvement and ownership of\n            the Government in project preparation is essential for its\n            success. Establishing oversight mechanisms is essential at\n            the implementation stage. The sustainability of information\n            technology (IT) programs hinges on risk management:\n            Continuity of staff is important during the life of the\n            project.
