     generating capacity are likely to be a constraint on\n            China's medium term growth objectives and potential,\n            the Government has given high priority to electric power.\n            In line with this, the proposed project seeks to (i) address\n            the acute power shortage at a major load center in the East\n            China power grid; (ii) support development of a modern\n            distribution network master plan for the city of Shanghai;\n            (iii) promote efficiency in the Shanghai Municipal Electric\n            Power Bureau through a staff training program; and (iv)\n            encourage financial reform.  Accordingly, the project\n            entails an extension of the existing coal-fired Wujing\n            thermal power station by adding two generating units of 300\n            MW each; construction of associated 220 kV transmission\n            lines and substations; provision of on-line computer control\n            and automotic load dispatching system for the Shanghai\n            Municipal Electric Power Bureau's (SMEPB) load\n            dispatching center; a master plan study of the distribution\n            network in Shanghai; and a training program."}, "docdt": "1987-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
