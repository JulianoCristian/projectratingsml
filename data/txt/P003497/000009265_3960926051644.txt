MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE WUJING THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of China to help finance the Wujing Thermal
Power Project. The loan for $190.0 million would have a term of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate. The
proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power
Bureau (SMEPB) under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term,
including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 8.5% p.a. The foreign
exchange risk between the dollar and local currency will be borne by SMEPB.
2.        Background.  Inadequate capacity in the power sector is a principal
bottleneck to economic growth in China, Despite rapid expansion in generating
capacity from a per capita level of 8 kWh in 1949 to 389 kWh in 1985, China
continues to suffer from acute power shortages. Estimated losses in indus-
trial production due to lack of power were in the order of Y40 billion in
1984. Consequently, the Government places high priority on efforts to develop
electric power through: (a) massive investment in new generating capacity of
all types (hydro, thermal and nuclear), together with introduction of modern
plant design; (b) rapid expansion of transmission and distribution networks;
(c) use of up-to-date techniques of load management, forecasting and
investment planning; (d) adoption of better construction techniques to bring
capacity on stream more quickly; and (e) training and manpower development to
bridge gaps in staff skills.
3.        The Shanghai area is the largest load center of the East China Power
Grid. In 1985 its gross value of industrial output was Y83 billion. Yet,
power use had to be restricted in the Shanghai area during more than 160 days
in 1985, due to insufficient generation and distribution capacities. These
restrictions have severely curtailed industrial production. In addition, more
than 2,500 requests for connection or extension, which represented a demand of
about 410 MW of power, could not be satisfied, With demand for power
continuing to grow, there is an urgent need to expand generation and
distribution.
4.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(i) address the severe power shortage at a major load center in the East China
power grid; (ii) support development of a distribution network master plan for
the city of Shanghai; (iii) promote efficiency in SMEPB through a staff train-
ing program; and (iv) encourage financial reform through adoption of modern
financial performance targets.

5.        Project Description.  The Wujing thermal power station, located near
the Huangpu river about 17 km south of Shanghai, is a coal-fired station with
a current capacity of 350 MW. The proposed project would extend the station's
capacity through the addition of two generating units of 300 MW each and
construction of a new coal-handling wharf. In addition, associated 220 kV
transmission lines and substations would be installed. The project would also
provide on-line computer control and an automatic load dispatching system for
SMEPB's new load dispatching center.
6.        Two institutional components--a distribution study and training--
would also be included in the project. The study would result in a master
plan for distribution facilities over the next 15 years. Training in
conjunction with the study would expose SMEPB's staff to modern methods of
distribution system planning and design. A separate training component would
support the upgrading of the technical schools under the auspices of SMEPB and
would provide training in finance and management for SMEPB staff.
7.        The project would be carried out over five years and would cover
funds for civil works, equipment and materials, technical assistance, training
and interest during construction. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$351.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$238.2
million (68%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the dis-
bursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project pro-
cessing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps showing project locations are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6610-CHA, daced May 18, 1987, is
being distributed separately.
8.        Rationale for Bank Support.  The project would be a continuation of
Bank support for the Government's strategy for electric power development.
Five previous power projects financed by the Bank have successfully introduced
international competitive bidding and technology transfer in the fields of
extra high voltage transmission and construction of modern, large coal-fired
thermal power stations. The Bank has also been instrumental in introducing
system planning and least-cost investment methodologies and in helping to
strengthen financial planning and management capabilities of the power
bureaux.
9.        A tariff study for the East China grid, initiated under the
Beilungang Thermal Power project, has provided the opportunity to lay the
analytical groundwork for tariff reform. That study has been undertaken
primarily by a Chinese task force with assistance from Bank staff and
consultants. It uses state of the art rate-making principles to develop
options for changes in the rate structure of the East China region.  The final
report is due in late June 1987.   The East China study is expected to be
followed by a similar study for Sichuan province, which represents a mixed
hydro-thermal system, a more complicated system for rate-setting purposes.
Once regional tariff studies are completed, implementation studies will be
conducted to specify the practical steps required and the equipment adaptation



necessary to put in place a new metering and rate-setting system. These
studies, taken together, will provide a practical framework for future
decisions on electric power pricing policies in China.
10.       The proposed project would expand capacity in an area where there is
a severe shortage of power. It would also support the Government's policy of
building large base-load thermal plants at load centers or near ports,
utilizing coal that is transported from North China via newly developed
railroad and port facilities. Through this project, the Bank would continue
to assist in the process of improving technical, financial and managerial
practices in the power sector in China. Notably, this is the first project in
China's power sector to include a self-financing ratio covenant, introducing a
modern concept in financial management of public utilities. The project would
also address the critical need for distribution system planning for
Shanghai.
11.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, the Government agreed to onlend
the proceeds of the loan to SMEPB on terms satisfactory to the Bank (see
para. 1). SMEPB agreed to: (a) take measures, including but not limited to
tariff adjustments, to ensure that annually it earns cash surpluses sufficient
to meet a minimum of 25% of its three year average investment program;
(b) incur additional debt only if a reasonable forecast of revenues and
expenditures indicates that internal cash generation would provide debt
service coverage of at least 1.3; (c) furnish a five-year financial plan
containing projected income statements, sources and uses of funds, and balance
sheets; (d) furnish its annual financial statements, certified by an
acceptable auditor, within six months of the end of each financial year;
(e) implement a training program satisfactory to the Bank; (f) carry out the
distribution study in accordance with terms of reference and timing agreed
with the Bank; and (g) carry out an environmental monitoring program
satisfactory to the Bank. In addition, an understanding was reached at
negotiations that SMEPB would prepare financial projections for an additional
three years beyond its five year plan as needed to plan for funding of
upcoming investments. Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and SMEPB and approval o. the Loan Agreement ty the State Council
would be conditions of loan effectiveness.
12.       Justification.  East China accounts for about 25% of total national
production, making it one of the most important industrial areas in China.
Shanghai is the industrial center of this region. Due to power shortages,
however, most industries in the area can operate only four to five days a
week, resulting in considerable underutilization of facilities and manpower.
A detailed economic study by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric
Power (MWREP), which was reviewed by the Bank, has established that the
proposed project is the quickest and least cost solution to meeting the power
shortage in the Shanghai area. The internal economic rate of return (IERR) of
the project is estimated at 12%, when valuing the electricity at the current
average revenue per kWh (including a 20% surcharge levied by the Shanghai
Municipal Government). The current rate, however, is a minimum proxy for the
economic value of the additional electricity. The rate of return would be



- 4 -
substantially higher if the opportunity cost of the electricity is
considered -- the value of industrial output foregone because of power
shortages without this project. Finally, the institutional benefits of the
project are important; they include support for improved distribution system
planning and management as well as needed financial and technical training.
13.       Risks.  No major risks are associated with the proposed project.
The Wujing station is an established facility, and the project will be
implemented by a power bureau whose staff have had significant experience in
the power field, although they lack exposure to modern technical and
managerial methods.  Land is already available, and field conditions are well
known. The technical soundness of the project has been established.
Consulting engineers, both local and foreign, will assist in engineering and
design, coordination and construction supervision. The principal challenge
will be the implementation schedule, which is ambitious but achievable. Both
units are scheduled to be commissioned by June 1992. To help avoid delays and
to achieve cost savings, the plant equipment will be procured under a single
responsibility contract that will cover detailed design, supply and management
of erection, testing and commissioning. An ancillary risk Is possible delay
in arrangements for coal supply and transport, but as these are scheduled to
be completed well in advance of commissioning of the first unit no serious
problems are anticipated.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
