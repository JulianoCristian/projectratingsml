IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
WUJING THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2852-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Wujing Thermal
Power Project in China for which Loan 2852-CHA in the amount of $190 million was
approved on June 23, 1987 and made effective on April 14, 1988.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, 24 months beyond the date originally
envisaged, June 30, 1993, as the Beneficiary took advantage of the cost savings of $12.6
million under the loan for an expanded transmission and distribution component. Final
disbursement in the amount of $194,995.17 was made on August 2, 1995 when the loan
was fully disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Elaine Sun and Shigeru Kataoka, Infrastructure Division,
China and Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region, and reviewed by
Mr. Richard Scurfield, Division Chief, and Mr. Yo Kimura, Project Advisor.  The
Borrower/Beneficiary provided comments, which are included as an annex to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission in
July 1995. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements,
Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower/Beneficiary,
internal Bank memoranda and interviews with Bank and Borrower/Beneficiary staff
involved in project implementation.  The Borrower/Beneficiary contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by commenting on the draft ICR, preparing an evaluation of the
project's execution and implementation, and by contributing views reflected in the
mission's aide-memoire.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
WUJING THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2852-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The Wujing Thermal Power Project was designed to support industrial growth in
East China by increasing electricity supply to the Shanghai Power Grid (SPG), a part of the
integrated East China Grid (ECG), which was suffering from acute power shortages. The
project was also used as a vehicle to: (a) support development of a modem distribution
network master plan for the city of Shanghai; (b) promote efficiency in the Shanghai
Municipal Electric Power Bureau (SMEPB) through a staff training program; and
(c) encourage financial reform through introduction of more appropriate financial
performance targets.
2.    Financing under the project was provided for: (a) extension of the existing coal-
fired Wujing thermal power station by adding two generating units of 300 MW each;
(b) construction of associated 220 kV transmission lines and substations; (c) on-line
computer control and automatic load dispatching system for SMEPB's load dispatching
center; (d) a master plan study of the distribution network in Shanghai; and (e) a training
program for upgrading the technical, financial and management skills of SMEPB staff and
equipping and upgrading SMEPB's technical schools.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Project implementation was highly successful and the above objectives were
achieved within the original schedule. The project provided the two 300 MW units with
high reliability and availability.   The project's successful training programs for
modernization of utility management, financial planning, and investment programming
established an institutional capability primed for further development under subsequent
operations. The final cost (including interest during construction) with expanded project
scope was $190 million in foreign and Y 1,045.4 million in local expenditures, compared to
an estimated $238.2 million in foreign and Y 476 million in local costs at appraisal. There
was a major expansion in the project scope for the transmission and distribution component,



- iv -
which caused a two-year extension of the loan closing date. With the same project scope,
the final cost would have been $176.4 million in foreign and Y 709.8 million in local costs.
The large increase in the local cost is due to higher than expected inflation in China and the
devaluation of local currency from an exchange rate of Y 3.7 to $1 at the time of appraisal
toY8.5to$1 bytheendof 1994.
4.    Commercial operation of the project units was three months ahead of the appraisal
schedule. To date, this is the only power project financed by the Bank to start commercial
operation ahead of the original schedule. The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is
also greater than originally estimated because "willingness to pay" for power is
demonstrably higher than original estimates. Both transfer of technology and, in particular,
institutional development objectives were achieved, and the good relations established with
the power entities in the East China Grid are likely to assist the Bank to continue to
positively influence the structure and commercial orientation of the power sector in East
China.
5.    All elements are present to ensure sustainability of the project. The power plant is
of high quality, and efficient and economic operations are expected to continue. The
pricing arrangements for the plant output will ensure satisfactory financial and economic
returns. On the institutional side, the tide of economic reform in China is creating
expectations far beyond those at appraisal. Shanghai is in the forefront of China's reform
and the project entity (SMEPB) is expected to play a model role for other utilities in China.
SMEPB is now preparing itself to be the first public utility in China to be listed on the stock
exchange.
6.    A master plan study of the distribution network in Shanghai, one key component of
the project, was successfully completed in April 1991. Based on the study, Shanghai has
implemented a major distribution system renovation project since 1991. The renovation
costs for the first five years, 1991-95, were estimated at Y 1 billion, including $75 million
for procurement of foreign equipment. About $12.6 million of loan proceeds under this
project were used to import the required foreign equipment.
7.    Bank performance overall was satisfactory. In particular, rigorous supervision by
the Bank during implementation was considered very effective in resolving difficult
problems for the project entity. SMEPB successfully completed the project ahead of
schedule with a relatively modest cost overrun when expressed in local currency. It
overcame problems as they arose, introduced and absorbed modem technologies and
management skills, and took full advantage of training opportunities.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
8.    The objectives of the project were consistent with those of the Chinese Government
and the Bank and the project achieved all its objectives. The project is rated as highly
satisfactory and is considered to be sustainable in all areas. Under the project, SMEPB
successfully completed one of the most reliable high-quality, coal-fired 300 MW units in
China. The project's rate of return calculated at completion is more than 15.9 percent,



- v -
compared to the appraisal estimate of 11.7 percent. The higher return resulted from larger-
than-anticipated tariff increases.
9.    One important lesson learned from this project relates to procurement. A package
contract for the major equipment (Boiler and Turbine-Generator package) under a single
responsibility was applied. The experience of a single responsibility contract was very
successful in terms of project coordination, quality control and implementation schedule
control. The two 300 MW units were successfully completed ahead of the originally
planned schedule. However, the outcome of the ICB for the main package under a single
responsibility contract revealed a major shortcoming of the method, lack of competition.
As a result, the Bank returned to the traditional procurement method of island-based
contracts in the following Beilungang Extension Project (Ln. 2955-CHA). Management of
interfacing problems has been a key issue experienced in the island based procurement
method for the Beilungang Extension Project. Under subsequent projects, such as the
Zouxian (Ln. 3462-CHA), Yangzhou (Ln. 3718-CHA), and Zhejiang Power Development
(Ln. 3846-CHA) Projects, minimizing the number of islands and reinforcing project
management systems have been reflected as lessons learned through this project, and the
two Beilungang projects.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
WUJING THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2852-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    In the mid-1980s, when this project was identified, East China was already one of
the country's most important industrial areas, accounting for about 25 percent of total
national production. However, a shortage of electricity supply forced industries in the area
to operate only four to five days a week, with consequent underutilization of plant facilities
and manpower. The Government attached high priority to electric power development,
with a strategy that combined: (a) massive investment in new generating capacity, together
with use of advanced plant design and modem construction techniques; (b) rapid expansion
of transmission and distribution networks; (c) use of up-to-date techniques of load
management, forecasting and investment planning; and (d) training and staff development.
2.    The main objectives of the proposed project were: (a) to address the acute power
shortage at a major load center in the East China power grid; (b) to support development of
a modem distribution network master plan for the city of Shanghai; (c) to promote
efficiency in the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Bureau (SMEPB) through a staff
training program; and (d) to encourage financial reform through introduction of modern
appropriate financial performance targets.
3.    The project comprised:
(a)   extension of the existing coal-fired Wujing thermal power station by adding
two generating units of 300 MW each;
(b)   construction of associated 220 kV transmission lines and substations;
(c)   on-line computer control and an automatic load dispatching system for
SMEPB's load dispatching center;
(d)   a master plan study of the distribution network in Shanghai; and
(e)   a training program for upgrading the technical, financial and management
skills of SMEPB staff and equipping and upgrading SMEPB's technical
schools.

B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The project achieved its primary objective of addressing the acute power shortage at
a major load center-Shanghai city-in the East China power grid. Economic and power
demand growth in Shanghai were in line with expectations. The Internal Economic Rate of
Return (IERR) was also greater than originally estimated.
5.    The two 300 MW units, the main component of the project, were constructed to
start commercial operation ahead of the original schedule, and have proven to have high
quality and reliability.
6.    The objective of transfering technology was also achieved.  The Energy
Management System (EMS) was successfully completed in the Shanghai load dispatching
center.  Based on a special study for Shanghai's distribution network improvement
completed under the project, a major renovation of the system with a budget of Y I billion
has been launched in Shanghai since 1991 to simplify voltage levels and improve the
reliability.
7.    The project's successful training programs for modernization of utility management,
financial planning and investment programming established an institutional capability
primed for further development.
8.   Institutional development is the most remarkable achievement of this project.
SMEPB has upgraded significantly its capability through the project in the areas of project
management, quality control, contract management, procurement standards, and financial
management. The real impact goes beyond the project and the company as a whole. The
domestic manufacturers which provided the generator and boiler to the Wujing plant, have
also enhanced the quality of their products as a result of the Bank's rigorous involvement in
the quality assurance for the project. Recently, they successfuly won a contract from abroad
as a result of their experience in the project.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Implementation Schedule
9.    The construction of the two 300 MW units was completed highly satisfactorily. The
No. I unit was synchronized to the system on November 19, 1991 according to plan
schedule and put into commercial operation on February 24, 1992 which was three months
ahead of the appraisal schedule. The No. 2 unit was synchronized to the system on
September 17, 1992 which was two months ahead of the appraisal schedule and put into
commercial operation on December 27, 1992 which was three months ahead of the
appraisal schedule. The loan closing date was extended by two years, from June 30, 1993
to June 30, 1995, to permit the Beneficiary to make use of the cost savings of about $12.6
million for an expanded transmission and distribution component.

10.   Power Generation. The operation record after the dates of commercial operation is
summarized below:

11.   The above record shows that the availability factors of the Wujing units are very
high, compared with those of other new units in the East China Grid. Moreover, the
Wujing units are currently the best units in the grid for cyclic operation (two-shift operation
for day time and night time) and load regulation in the power grid.
12.   Shanghai Distribution Network Improvement. The master plan study of the
distribution network in Shanghai was successfully completed in April 1991 as planned.
The study covered the network improvement plan for the Shanghai Urban District
(149 kmi), including system  planning software, management system  for network
construction and expansion, and plans for the short-term (1991-95), medium-term (1996-
2000), and long-term (2001-10). The network renovation is designed to simplify voltage
levels (old system: 110, 35, 23, 10, 6.6 and 0.4 kV versus new system: 35, 10, 0.4 kV and
110, 10, 0.4 kV) and to improve the reliability of the system from 99.5 percent to 99.85
percent. The estimated costs for the short-, medium-, and long-term plans are estimated at
about Y I billion, Y 0.9 billion, and Y 0.9 billion, respectively. Of the total budget of Y I
billion for the first phase, a foreign cost of $75 million is included. Under the project, loan
proceeds of about $12.6 million (about $7 million from remaining proceeds allocated to the
Gubei and Shibei substations and the unallocated amount of about $5.6 million) were used
to import some required foreign equipment. The closing date of the loan was extended by
two years, from June 30, 1993 to June 30, 1995, to permit the above procurement and
implementation of the associated renovation works.
13.   Project Costs. The estimated cost of the project at appraisal (including interest
during construction) was $238.2 million in foreign costs and Y 476 million in local costs,
equivalent to a total of $351.4 million (Y 1,508.7 million). The final cost was $190.0
million in foreign costs and Y 1,045.4 million in local costs, equivalent to a total of $381.8
million (Y 2,080.9 million) (see Tables 8a-1 and 8a-2 for details). Considering overall costs



- 4 -
(foreign plus local), there is a cost overrun of about 8.7 percent and 38 percent when
expressed in US dollars and local currency, respectively. However, to obtain a more exact
comparison, the project scope needs to be adjusted as there was a major expansion in the
transmission and distribution component which resulted in an additional foreign cost of
$12.6 million and local cost of Y 335.6 million. With the same project scope, the actual
final cost would have been $177.4 million in foreign and Y 709.8 million in local costs. It
shows that foreign costs are about 25.5 percent lower, local costs are about 49 percent
higher, and overall costs are about 12.5 percent lower when expressed in US dollars and
11.1 percent higher when expressed in local currency than estimated at appraisal. This
represents relatively good agreement, considering the large local inflation rate and the
devaluation of local currency from an exchange rate of Y 3.7 to $1 at the time of
appraisal to Y 5.7 to $1 by the end of 1992, when the main components were completed.
14.   A summary comparison of the estimated disbursements at appraisal with the actual
disbursements is given in Table 4. The loan was fully disbursed on August 2, 1995.
15.   Procurement.  The project was designed to procure the main power plant
equipment under a single responsibility contract covering detailed design, equipment supply
and management of erection, testing and commissioning. During project preparation and
appraisal, the Chinese Government requested such a single responsibility contract in order
to expedite completion of the project. The request was considered carefully by the Bank.
The Bank team reviewed the experience of four other projects in China (not financed by the
Bank) where similar single responsibility contracts were awarded. The evidence indicated
that: (a) significant time savings in project completion was possible (10-12 months); and
(b) there was wide international competition, with bids being received from most of the
reputable suppliers.
16.   However, the ICB for the main equipment package of the project resulted in only
one bid submitted by a domestic bidder. All prequalified foreign bidders declined to submit
bids. Foreign bidders were reluctant to participate in bids for the main package of the
project under a single responsibility, because they considered that they could not compete
with domestic manufacturers for 300 MW units for which Chinese manufacturers were fully
qualified.
17.   As a lesson learned for the above ICB procurement for major equipment, the Bank
returned to a traditional island-based procurement method.
18.   Consulting Services and Training. A foreign firm was selected to carry out
consulting services in two phases. Phase I, funded by the Bank Group's Technical
Cooperation Credit (Cr. 1412-CHA), provided services for preparation of the project,
including review of designs prepared by the China International Engineering Consulting
Corporation (CIECC) with assistance of the East China Electric Power Design Institute
(ECEPDI), preparation of bidding documents, and assistance to SMEPB for bid evaluation
and contracting. Phase II, financed under the project, provided services for assistance in
engineering and detailed design and review of vendors' drawings of the project. The



consultant input was very beneficial to SMEPB during the first phase. However, since the
general contractor was a domestic company and most of the docuwnentations was in
Chinese, the consulting service was not as significant at the second phase.
19.   Both domestic and overseas training was provided under the project. SMEPB took
full advantage of the Bank loan to finance a training program as well as development,
upgrading and equipping of the existing educational training center of SMEPB and the
Shanghai electrical school.
20.   An extensive overseas training program was carried out for the tariff study, financial
management, corporate management, operation and management of thermal power plants,
and planning and maintenance of the distribution system. Visits abroad totaled 90.0 man-
months to Hong Kong, France, Japan and Australia.
21.   Economic Performance. At appraisal, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return
(IERR) was estimated at about 11.7 percent, based on measurable economic costs and
benefits associated with the 600 MW development. The ex-post IERR is about 15.9 percent
(with shadow price adjustment as shown in Table 9). The higher IERR came from larger
than expected tariff increases.
22.   Financial Performance. Salient features of SMEPB's finances during the period
1986-94 are summarized in Annex 3. SMEPB's overall operating results and financial
position were satisfactory as its actual average rate of return on fixed assets in service, 14.1
percent, exceeded the expected 13.4 percent at appraisal. Energy sales have fallen short of
expectations since 1989 as a result of purposeful slowdown of the overheated economy by
the government during 1989-92 and the consequent inadequate investments in power
generation. SMEPB adjusted the tariff aggressively from an average rate of 8.7 fen/kWh in
1986 to 33.6 fen/kWh in 1994, a nominal increase of 18.4 percent and a real increase of 6.7
percent per year. As a result, SMEPB's net incomes over the period were largely in line
with the appraisal estimates in spite of larger than expected increases in fuel costs and costs
for purchased power, that increased annually by about 34 percent compared to an appraisal
estimate of 7.7 percent. These two cost increase factors also led to much higher operating
ratios. The overall performance of SMEPB was satisfactory as it maintained a sound debt
service position, above 2.2 times throughout the period, and a conservative capital structure
with the highest debt/equity ratio at 58/42 in 1992. Due to the very uneven tariff
adjustments approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government year by year and much
larger than expected special find expenditures for maintenance, renovations, employee
benefits, and distribution improvements, SMEPB was short of the target self-financing ratio
in a couple of years. As shown in Table 4 of Annex 3, SMEPB's self-financing ratio was
13.5 percent in 1988 and 19.4 percent in 1990 against the target of 25 percent set out in the
project agreement. Nevertheless, it managed to achieve an average self-financing ratio of
25.3 percent during the period 1986-1994. Moreover, it has never had problems in meeting
the covenanted debt service ratio of 1.3 times throughout the implementation period.



- 6 -
23.   In 1993, new accounting regulations came into effect, and SMEPB has acted to
bring its accounting procedures fully in line with Ministry of Finance regulations.
Meanwhile SMEPB has started to segregate its equity with debt as a fundamental step to
clarify the assets ownership right. In 1993, an overall fixed assets revaluation was carried
out according to national requirements. Along with internal strengthening in financial
management and introduction and use of international accounting and auditing practice,
SMEPB is currently in a better position to draw more foreign investments and to jointly
invest in future independent power plants.
24.   The Bank's objective to promote prudent financial management was achieved
through SMEPB's efforts to comply with project financial covenants, which required it to
prepare long-term financial plans, focusing on its trends in production costs, future
investment program, and related financing arrangements, and to review such plans annually
with the Bank.
25.   Environment, Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The project site is located at
Wujing along the Huangpu River about 17 km south of Shanghai. The site is primarily a
low population density agricultural area with a few industries. The project was designed to
meet environmental standards set by Chinese and World Bank guidelines. SMEPB carried
out periodic environmental monitoring before and after commissioning of the two 300 MW
units.  The monitoring showed that no excessive impacts were observed on the
environment.
26.   The investment for land acquisition and resettlement amounted to Y 100.2 million.
The project required resettlement of 773 people, all of which was carried out satisfactorily,
with standards of living sustained. Compensation levels were adequate, as indicated below:
(a)    Y 29.6 million was spent for land acquisition of about 53 hectares.
(b)   In the end, 773 people were relocated, for which compensation of Y 13.8
million was paid.  Industry Development Corporation of Shanghai
Municipal Minhang District was entrusted to accept and resettle farm
laborers after resettlement.
(c)    Employment was provided to the resettlers through: (i) establishment of
several small factories to produce toys, cartons, shoes, etc. for new
employment; and (ii) persuasion of farmers over 55 years of age and women
over 45 years of age to retire voluntarily with monthly pensions.
2
(d)   Housing totalling 19,860 m was built, for which Y 12.9 million was paid.
(e)    Some existing facilities, such as warehouses, pipelines and heavy and light
oil tanks were demolished and removed, for which Y 32.1 million was paid.
(f)    Y 7.9 million was paid for leveling of the site and providing infrastructure
such as electricity, water, communications and an access road.



27.   Shanghai Municipal Southern Ash Yard constructed in the early 1980s was used as
the ash yard for the project. Neither land acquisition nor resettlement for the ash yard was
required. The land for the associated transmission and substation system was provided by
the local government at a cost of Y 19 million. No resettlement was needed.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
28.   All elements are present to ensure sustainability of the project. Technically, the
finished Wujing thermal power plant is of high quality and the units have operated at a very
high availability factor since the start of commercial operation. Efficient and economic
operation is expected to continue based on SMEPB's past records and the management
arrangement for the power plant. Financially, the pricing arrangements for the plant output
will ensure satisfactory financial and economic returns. Institutionally, SMEPB, through
training provided by the project, is well prepared to operate in a market-oriented
environment. The company is in the process of further corporatization in order to prepare
itself to be the first public utility in China to be listed on the stock exchange. The actions
that SMEPB have taken include: (a) preparation of a plan to detach the nonproductive
assets from the Company; (b) clarification of assets ownership between the central
government and the Shanghai Government; and (c) employment of an international
accounting firm to reconstruct its accounts to meet international accounting standards.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
29.   Bank performance from project preparation through completion was satisfactory.
The Bank maintained good relations with the borrower, the beneficiary and the consultants
throughout project execution. During implementation, the Bank regularly supervised the
project, including the construction schedule, procurement, financial aspects, loan covenants,
project cost updating, and training activities, to ensure smooth implementation. In addition,
with this project and subsequent projects (Beilungang II, Yanshi and Zouxian), the Bank
established a basis for cooperation and dialogue between the borrower, beneficiary, and the
Bank in the development of the power subsector in China, including institutional
restructuring and electricity pricing reform. To date, the Bank has assisted in implementing
17 power projects in China with total assistance of about $3.8 billion.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
30.   SMEPB successfully completed the major project components-its two 300 MW
coal-fired units and associated 220 kV transmission line and substations-within the
planned schedule. Close coordination between SMEPB and the general contractor under
the single responsibility contract was also a key factor to the successful completion of the
two units with high quality. SMEPB introduced and absorbed the latest design technology
and construction and operational management techniques for the power plant, with the
assistance of foreign consultants. It also took full advantage of the training opportunities
and has upgraded its overall institutional capability. Based on the special study on a master
plan for Shanghai distribution network improvement, a major renovation of the system in
Shanghai started in 1991, partly financed by the Bank under this project.

G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
31.   The project outcome is rated as highly satisfactory. SMEPB achieved the project
objectives, and completion of the project contributed significantly to mitigating the
shortages of power supply, increasing load regulation capability in the Shanghai power grid
as well as in the East China power grid, and promoting industrial production and regional
economic development. Training for technical personnel in design, construction,
commissioning, operation and maintenance contributed to transferring the up-to-date
technologies needed for large-capacity coal-fired plants and distribution systems. Project
training for utility and financial management staff contributed to institutional development
that provided the basis for future reform.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
32.   Project achievements in institutional development were expanded in subsequent
Bank-assisted operations in the power sector in China.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
33.   This project was only the Bank's fourth power project in China and its second to
assist the Chinese in constructing a large-capacity (2X 300 MW) coal-fired power plant,
following Beilungang I 600 MW  project (Ln. 2706-CHA).  With reference to the
procurement method for the project, a package contract for the major equipment (Boiler and
Turbine-Generator package) under a single responsibility was applied.  Through this
procurement, one important lesson was learned. On one hand, the project was well
managed under a single responsibility and was satisfactorily completed, with high quality,
within the original schedule. Interfacing problems which are generally unavoidable in the
case of island based contracts could almost be eliminated. On the other hand, the ICB
procurement for the main package of this project revealed lack of competition. Only one
domestic bidder participated in the bid and all foreign prequalified bidders declined to
participate. Foreign bidders considered that they could not compete with domestic
manufacturers who were fully qualified for 300 MW class power projects. Based on this
experience, the Bank returned to the traditional procurement method of island based
contracts in the subsequent Beilungang Extension Project (Ln. 2955-CHA). Management
of interfacing problems has been a key issue in the island based procurement method.
Under later projects, such as the Zouxian (Ln. 3462-CHA), Yangzhou (Ln. 3718-CHA) and
Zhejiang Power (Ln. 3846-CHA) Projects, minimizing numbers of islands and
reinforcement of project management system have been reflected as lessons learned through
this project and the two Beilungang projects.

ANNEX 1: ICR PREPARATION MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE
(July 13 - 19, 1995)
General
1.    A World Bank mission consisting of Ms. Sun and Mr. Kataoka visited Shanghai
from July 13 to 19, 1995 to review the overall status of project execution, achievement of
project objectives, and financial performance of the beneficiary, Shanghai Municipal
Electric Power Bureau (SMEPB), and compliance with Loan and Project Agreement
covenants and to collect necessary data and information for preparation of the
implementation completion report for Wujing Thermal Power Project (Loan-2852-CHA).
The mission would like to express its appreciation for the excellent arrangements for the
visit, warm hospitality, and cooperation extended to the mission. This Aide-Memoire
outlines the principal matters discussed and understanding as well as agreements reached.
2.    The mission discussed in detail with SMEPB on the institutional development
impact of the Wujing Thermal Power Project. High remarks were given to the impact
brought about by the project on SMEPB and Shanghai. Specifically, through the project,
SMEPB has upgraded significantly its capability in the areas of project management,
quality control, procurement, contract management, and financial management. Now the
impact has already been felt in other projects and the company as a whole. The Bank's
regular and vigorous supervision mission and the thorough procurement rules have ensured
the quality of the major equipment supplied by Shanghai Factories. There is a significant
difference in quality between the equipment for Wujing plant and the similar turbine
generator/boiler units made by domestic manufacturers in the past. In the East China Grid,
the Wujing units is highly ranked for its availability. Now the same supplier successfully
won a contract in Pakistan (WAPDA, Muzaffagrha #7, 300MW) due to its experience in
Wujing. SMEPB also highly valued the training program under the project.  The
management and a large number of technical and financial staff were trained overseas.
SMEPB believes it prepared them well for a market-oriented market and has already seen
some efficiency gains.
Operation of Wujing Power Plant (two 300 MW units)
3.    The two units have been operating satisfactorily since they were put into
commercial operation, no. I unit on February 24, 1992 and no. 2 on December 27, 1992).
The availability factors of the Wujing units are very high, compared with those of other new
units in East China Grid (Beilungang and Shidonkou). Moreover, the Wujing units are
currently the best units for cyclic operation (two-shift operation for day time and night time)
in China and most effectively contributing to load regulation in the power grid.



- 22 -                     ANNEX 1
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.    All transmission lines and associated substations financed under the project were
completed on schedule. Gubei and Shibei substations were put into commercial operation
on November 8, 1993 and April 15, 1994, respectively.
Shanghai Distribution Network Improvement
5.    Based on the special study for Shanghai Distribution Network Improvement,
renovation of forty five substations (voltage change from 35 to 110KV) was completed as
of March 1995. Further renovation of 30 to 40 substations is expected to be completed by
the end of 1995. The network renovation has been designed to simplify voltage levels (old
system: 110, 35, 23, 10, 6.6, 0.4KV; new system: 35, 10, 0.4KV and 110, 10, 0.4KV) and
improve the reliability of the system from 99.5 percent to 99.85 percent. Total budget for
the renovation amounts to Y 1 billion for five years, including a foreign cost of $15 million
per year for imported equipment. Under the project, loan proceeds of about $12 million
were allocated for the network renovation.
Training
6.    SMEPB completed ten overseas training programs during 1992-1995 in areas of
planning of distribution, tariff, personnel management, corporate management, advanced
thermal technology, power plant maintenance, accounting and financial management. The
loan proceeds budgeted for training purpose were fully utilized.
Environmental Monitoring and Resettlement
7.    SMEPB will submit to the Bank a final summary report of the environmental
monitoring before and after the completion of the two 300MW units by the end of August
1995.
Disbursement
8.    The loan was almost fully disbursed as of June 30, 1995, except two special
commitments for the remaining payment of about $1.5 million equivalent for the
procurement of oil filled cables and GIS. It is expected to be fully disbursed before the end
of October. Due to exchange rate's movement, the final required payment may exceed the
loan amount. SMEPB will cover the difference by its own resources.
Updated Project Cost
9.    Updated project cost is $190 million in foreign costs and Y 1045.35 million in local
costs, equivalent to a total cost of $381.85 million (Y 2,080.85 million). As compared with
the appraisal estimate, the project has a cost underrun of 20 percent in foreign cost when
expressed in US dollar and a cost overrun of 120 percent in local cost when expressed in
local currency. The substantial local cost overrun is partially due to the expansion of scope



-23 -                      ANNEX I
on the distribution network improvement component. SMEPB will prepare detailed
explanations on the reasons for the above cost overrun and underrun by the end of August
1995.
Financial Aspects
10.   The net profit of SMEPB declined by about 22.4% in 1994. However, the result of
1994 is not fully comparable with the previous year due to different accounting treatments
for depreciation and interest expense and new tax laws enacted in 1994. The energy sales
and average tariff grew by 4.6% and 13.4%, respectively, have contributed to 10.1%
improvement in SMEPB's operation income during 1994. With regard to financial
covenants, SMEPB's debt service coverage was over 1.4 times in 1994 which met the
minimum target of 1.3 times set out in the Project Agreement. However, the information
disclosed in SMEPB's financial statements and the notes to the statements are not sufficient
to arrive at a self-financing ratio. The required information will be provided by August 10.
Information And Data To Be Provided And Timetable For Completing ICR
11.   In order to complete the Implementation Completion Report, the following data
need to be prepared by SMEPB in accordance with the agreed schedule:

ANNEX 2: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S
PERSPECTIVE
1.    Basically, the 6th Extension Project of Wujing Thermal Power Plant (2x300MW
units) was smoothly completed according to the original objectives under the guidance of
the World Bank. The commissioning of the Project makes a great contribution to the
improvement of power supply in Shanghai. The successive commissioning of the Project
together with Shidongkon II Power Plant before 1992 not only increased the installed
capacity in Shanghai and East China Network. but also provided a solid material base for
realizing vast changes in Shanghai within 3 years from  1992 to 1994.  Shanghai
Municipal People's Government highly appraises such an achievement.
2.    Our work strictly followed the stipulations in the Loan Agreement and World
Bank Guidelines from project pre-assessment to completion of procurement and finally to
commercial operation of the units. Assisted by our foreign and domestic Consultants, we
completed the work in successive stages without any delay. Thus we gained experience
in the implementation of a power plant project according to international practice. The
experience which can be spred and applied to other power plant projects includes:
(a)   SMEPB organized personnel from East China Electric Power Design
Institute (ECEPDI) and the power plant. etc. to collect overseas
information and elaborate equipment procurement bid documents by
ourselves. According to the requirement of the World Bank, we engaged
Sargent & Lundy Engineers, USA as our foreign Consultant whose first
task was to assist us in reviewing and revising the bid documents in order
to meet the requirement of international practice. After that, tendering was
carried out strictly in accordance with the stipulations in the World Bank
Procurement Guidelines. The experience in this context has already been
applied to the equipment procurement of other projects.
(b)   Due to the insistence of the World Bank, Shanghai United Electric
Corporation Consortium (SUECC). who was awarded the Contract,
engaged Bechtel, USA as their foreign Consultant to assist the Consortium
in the implementation of the Project. An advanced international project
quality assurance system was introduced during the consultation of
Bechtel. This system has also been applied to the management of other
projects and improvement of project quality has resulted.
(c)   The World Bank normally despatched its inspection team to Shanghai
twice a year for overall examination of the Project's progress. During



- 26 -                    ANNEX2
inspection, the team usually proposed a lot of valuable comments which
promoted the smooth progress of the Project.
(d)   According to the Loan Agreement, besides the power plant project as a
main item, followed a number of subitems such as procurement of relevant
transmission equipment, consultation for city network, equipment
procurement for city network, procurement of facilities for Shanghai
power education, and training of senior management personnel, etc. These
items were very helpful, especially the training programs for the senior
management personnel and the consultation for Shanghai city network.
The execution of these two subitems enormously increased the
management and technical competence of the personnel in SMEPB and
will exert an immeasurable influence in future.
3.    This Project was implemented by SUECC under single responsibility contract
awarded to a single bidder. During the early stage of equipment procurement, serious
delay occurred. Although this was improved after the World Bank and SMEPB urged
against it, yet adverse effects had resulted. Additionally, since all equipment had to be
procured by SUECC, it neglected the quality requirement of ordinary equipment in order
to save cost. Thus some quality problems were found in equipment as conveyors in coal
system, some valves in steam and water system, soot blowers, air compressors and station
transformers, etc. These quality problems affected normal operation of the units during
the early stage of commissioning. These equipment were renewed or regulated after
representations. This is the deficiency of single responsibility contract.
