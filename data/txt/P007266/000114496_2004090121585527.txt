     Re: Credit No. 2480-GUA (Public Administration Project) -
         Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
     Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated April 8,
1993 between Republic of Guyana (the Borrower) and the International
Development Association (the Association), as amended.
     In response to your May 21, 1996 request to open the Special
Account in a commercial bank rather than in the Bank of Guyana as
provided in paragraph (b) of Section 2.02 of the Development Credit
Agreement, we are pleased to inform you that the Association has
agreed to amend such paragraph as follows:
          "(b) The Borrower may, for the purposes of the Project,
          open and maintain in Dollars a special deposit account in
          a commercial bank of terms and conditions satisfactory to
          the Association, including appropriate protection against
          set-off, seizure or attachment.  Deposits into, and
          payments out of, the Special Account shall be made in
          accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 to this
          Agreement.".
     This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts each
of which shall be an original, and shall become effective on the date
the Association has received one fully executed original of this
amendment letter.  Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing
amendment by signing and dating the two counterparts of this amendment
letter.  Upon your confirmation, please return one fully executed
original to us.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
