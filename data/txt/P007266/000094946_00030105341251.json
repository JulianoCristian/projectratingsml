The general lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) Important changes to\n            the salary and employment structure require agreement from\n            all stakeholders. 2) Accurate and transparent information\n            needs to be provided on a regular basis to public servants\n            when salary reforms are being undertaken to avoid creating\n            false expectations that may later lead to frustrations and\n            industrial actions. 3) When designing new salary regimes, it\n            is important to obtain the most reliable information before\n            embarking on the reform, to ensure that the new structure\n            will be adequate to meet stated goals. Similarly, it is\n            essential to carefully examine the effect of removing market\n            supplements, in order to protect key and critical posts. 4)\n            In exceptional circumstances, when Recruitment Programs are\n            appropriate, it is important to ensure that the receiving\n            departments are consulted as well as the concerned ministry,\n            in order to maximize effectiveness and receptivity. 5) When\n            dealing with issues such as decentralization, setting of\n            tariffs, and the sorting out of the respective roles of\n            various levels of government, it is important to hire\n            consultants who are experts or nongovernmental organizations\n            in some cases."}, "docdt": "2000-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
