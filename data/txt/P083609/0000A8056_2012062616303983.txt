                         target of 75%. Overall project implementation remains satisfactory. However, some activities are still facing some considerable delays. They concern the establishment of the
                         irrigation perimeters in the Senegal River Delta and the implementation of the study that will identify the institutional setup for the management of the BeerThialane rehabilitated
                         irrigation network. Closer supervision and pro-activity of the project coordination unit is required. Key actions have been agreed for the timely implementation of these activities.
