were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it\n            is easier to build agricultural export facilities with\n            project funds than to find private entrepreneurs willing and\n            capable to take them over and run them. This holds true even\n            when project management is aware of this fact and tries from\n            the beginning to prepare for handover. Horticultural\n            production and exports, especially in the greater Dakar\n            area, are situated in a fast-changing environment, where\n            factors such as rapid urbanization and relative costs of\n            different modes of transport (air, sea, and road) can\n            quickly change the optimal location of export facilities and\n            render some of them no longer useful or financially viable.\n            Projects that seek to introduce game-changing institutional\n            and technical innovations and that depend for their success\n            on the buy-in of people who cannot be identified in advance\n            (auto-selection) must have a first-class, professional,\n            interactive communication strategy that uses all forms of\n            media, including the internet, and from the very beginning.\n            And the public must be able to easily access updated\n            information about how to participate in the project,\n            otherwise implementation delays are unavoidable."}, "docdt": "2015-12-23T21:48:02Z"}
