                         The project performance is satisfactory. Progress towards the achievements of the development objectives remain steady. The end of project target of 12,000 tons of fruits and
                         vegetables exports in project areas is expected to be reached by the end of the 2013 growing season. As of October 31, 2103 it is already estimated at 10,988 tons. The local
                         production of banana is currently estimated at 70% of domestic consumption versus an end-of-project target of 60%. The local production of onion covers 70% of domestic
