                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project performance is satisfactory. Progress towards achievements of the development objectives remain steady. Progress towards the end-of-project target of 12,000 tons for
                         fruits and vegetables exports in project areas have been satisfactory for the last two growing seasons with 12,643 tons by December 2012 and 11,994 tons by December 2013. By
                         March, 31 2014, fruits and vegetables exports had reached 5,535 tons. This compares to 5,882 tons of exports for the same period in 2013. The end-of project target is expected to
                         be met by the end of the 2014 growing season. The local production of banana is currently estimated at 70% of domestic consumption versus an end-of-project target of 60%. The
                         local production of onion currently covers 70% of domestic consumption for an end-of-project target of 75%. The annual increase in local rice production is estimated at 46,975 tons
                         as of June 30, 2014, compared to 33,900 tons of paddy rice as of October 31, 2013 for an end-of-project target of 52,000 tons.
