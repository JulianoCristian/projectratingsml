I. Disbursement Profile




1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1. Context at Appraisal
1.      Senegal’s relatively robust economic growth since 1994 was not driven by the
agriculture sector. Instead, its economic growth was led by non-labor-intensive sectors
and marginally benefited rural areas, where 58 percent of the population lives, 70 percent
of whom rely on agriculture for their livelihood. During the two decades before the
Agricultural Markets and Agribusiness Development Program’s (PDMAS) appraisal,
agriculture in Senegal experienced stagnant production and declining productivity and
remained largely dominated by rain-dependent, smallholder-produced crops and extensive
animal husbandry.

2.      The sector showed signs of recovery after 2000, notably in horticultural
exports, cereals production, and the poultry industry. This improvement was a direct
result of the Government of Senegal’s commitment to support the sector and implement
reforms through the World Bank-supported Agricultural Services and Producer
Organizations Project (Projet des Services Agricoles et Organisations de Producteurs -
PSAOP).

3.      Numerous constraints continued to dampen the country’s potential for
accelerated agricultural growth. At the time of PDMAS appraisal, Senegal’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy emphasized wealth creation, capacity building, social services, and
assistance to vulnerable groups (PRSP 2002-2005). In response to the growing
concentration of poverty in rural areas, it highlighted the need for increased investment in


                                            16
agricultural systems, rational use of natural resources, reinforcement of rural development,
and development of diversified agriculture. In this context, the government designed an
Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS) and, more specifically, a strategy for agricultural
export development. This strategy identified the key constraints to development of the
country’s agricultural growth potential as: (a) food safety and quality issues; (b) lack of
access to investments and working capital; (c) poorly functioning market infrastructures;
(d) inefficient distribution channels; and (e) weak irrigation infrastructures, which covered
less than 4 percent of Senegal’s total arable land.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
4.     The PDMAS’s Project Development Objective (PDO) was “to contribute to
sustainable increase of nontraditional agricultural exports and revenues for project
beneficiaries/participants.” The end-of-project outcome indicators were as follows:

   (i)     The volume of horticultural and nontraditional agricultural exports have
           increased from 13,000 tons (in 2004) to 30,000 tons; and,
   (ii)    Producers’ revenues for project participants have increased by 60 percent by
           the end of the first phase.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

5.      Project Development Objectives. The PDO was formally revised on May 10,
2010, upon approval of the First Additional financing for Food Security (Credit No. 4720).
It was revised to “Improved competitiveness of selected domestic supply chains, increased
non-traditional agricultural exports and increased rice production in project areas”.

6.      While the PDO wording was changed to focus on supply chains
competitiveness, the substance of the overall development goal remains the same.
Project activities aimed to improve the performance of domestic supply chains through
interventions such as matching grants to develop partnerships between agribusiness and
small-holders; provision of water-efficient irrigation technologies and improved irrigation
services; adoption of good agricultural practices; better access to post-harvest
infrastructures and high value markets; and development of marketing strategy and
information system. This was expected to improve producers’ productivity and secure
access to higher prices, thus resulting in increased incomes.

7.       The PDO was also modified to incorporate the AF1 development objective,
“Increased rice production in project areas.” Hence, the final revised PDO was: “Improved
competitiveness of selected domestic supply chains, increased nontraditional agricultural
exports, and increased rice production in project areas.” An additional outcome indicator
for this PDO was added: “Increased annual production of rice paddy by 52,000 tons by
end of the project.”




                                             17
The original PDO indicators were also revised to be more realistic and more
measurable. The first key performance indicator (KPI) initially stated that: “Horticultural
and nontraditional agricultural exports reach 30,000 tons by the end of the project.” While
this KPI showed satisfactory progress (with 27,409 tons in 2008-2009 against a target of
26,000 tons for the same period), it was unclear how observed increases in agricultural
exports could be attributed to project performance. A more outcome-focused performance
indicator was developed to better capture the project’s contribution and to differentiate
increases in exports directly generated by project interventions from those resulting from
private investments outside project areas. Thus the KPI was revised to: “Nontraditional
agricultural exports in project areas reach 12,000 tons by the end of the project”. This
formulation was also aligned with the PDO whose definition referred to nontraditional
agricultural products.

8.      Furthermore, as there were no baseline data on farm revenue and no information on
the growth in farm revenues at MTR (subprojects by beneficiaries had only just started), it
was decided to drop this indicator and analyze it as part of the economic analysis at the end
of the project. As a result, the KPI “60 percent increase in farm revenues of producers
supported by the end of the project” was dropped and replaced with “Local production of
onion and banana covers 75 percent and 50 percent of domestic consumption, respectively.”
This indicator was originally designed as an intermediate outcome indicator. It allowed the
direct monitoring of consolidation and competitiveness of key domestic supply chains. The
two selected commodities, onion and banana, were maintained.


9.     In light of the first Additional Financing for Food Security (AFFS) in
preparation at that time, the original PDO was also modified to incorporate the AFFS
development objective, “Increased rice production in project areas.” Hence, the final
revised PDO was: “Improved competitiveness of selected domestic supply chains,
increased nontraditional agricultural exports, and increased rice production in project
areas.” An additional outcome indicator for this PDO was added: “Increased annual
production of rice paddy by 52,000 tons by end of the project.” The PDO was formally
revised on May 10, 2010, upon approval of the First AFFS (Credit No. 4720).


10.     Other intermediate outcome indicators were modified, dropped, or added as
needed. These changes were made to better align indicators with what was feasible and
necessary to measure project progress towards achieving the PDO. They were also revised
to take into account the two Additional Financings (AFs) approved during the project life:
the First Additional Financing for Food Security (AFFS) and the Food Security and
Livestock Support Project (PASAEL). Table 1 shows changes in main intermediate
outcomes indicators.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

11.     The PDMAS had 13,082 direct beneficiaries. The targets were 2,500
beneficiaries under the original project, 6,000 additional beneficiaries under AF1, and
3,500 beneficiaries under AF2 for an overall target of 12,000 beneficiaries. Of these, it is
estimated that well over 9,000 were small-scale farmers (mostly rice and vegetable
growers), some 500 were medium-scale farmers, and 36 were commercial enterprises. Out
of the total number of beneficiaries, 4,299 were women (33 percent). Beneficiaries
benefitted from: (a) rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation infrastructure; (b)
subprojects financed with matching grants, mostly drip irrigation and livestock
improvement projects; (c) rehabilitated rice irrigation fields; and (d) improvements in
animal production due to vaccination campaigns. Producers and consumers benefitted from
improvements in agricultural marketing infrastructure and better food safety standards.

12.     Exporters of horticultural products benefited from agricultural export
infrastructures and better access to export markets. Hundreds of farmers received
advice and were trained on new irrigation techniques and production, marketing, and
conservation technologies for fruits and vegetables. Selected staff of executing agencies
(Senegal River and Faleme Delta Management Holding Company - SAED and National
Agency for Agricultural and Rural Advisory Services - ANCAR) benefitted from intensive
training courses abroad and several study tours outside the country. The Fondation Origine
Sénégal–Fruits et Légumes (FOS-F&L) and the Coopérative Fédérative des Acteurs de
l’Horticulture (CFAHS) received operational support. It is estimated that the project also
generated additional employment due to agricultural intensification and new jobs in
agricultural marketing and processing along the value chain.

1.5. Original Components (as approved)
The PDMAS consisted of four components, namely:

13.     Component A: Improving Domestic Marketing Conditions aimed to improve
food safety and the performance of domestic distribution channels for crop and livestock
products. The target beneficiaries were producers, producers’ associations, trade
associations, local authorities, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engaged in crop
and livestock. This component consisted of four subcomponents:


14.     Subcomponent A1 - Domestic Supply Chains Consolidation, which focused on
three main activities: (a) testing innovative partnership business models adapted to small
producers and SMEs in key promising supply chains for domestic and regional markets;
(b) assisting eligible small producers and SMEs interested in applying these innovations to
implement business development plans (subprojects); and (c) conducting related diagnostic
assessments and studies. Funding for subprojects included beneficiaries’ contributions and
project grants set at different levels for smallholders and SMEs.


15.     Subcomponent A2 - Rural Market Infrastructure, which supported: (a) the design
and building of innovative rural collective platforms for handling key products such as
onions, bananas, and tubers; and (b) development of innovative management systems for
collective facilities and promotion of better quality of services in such facilities.


16.    Subcomponent A3 - Knowledge Management, which aimed to: (a) develop and
implement an overall marketing and communication strategy for domestic supply chains;
(b) generate and disseminate domestic market knowledge and information; and (c) promote
knowledge sharing by disseminating results of tests conducted by the project as well as the
achievements of and lessons learned from funded subprojects.


17.    Subcomponent A4 - Development of Animal Products Markets, whose activities
focused on modernizing the domestic supply chains for animal products. They aimed to:



                                            20
(a) improve food safety in the marketing of animal products; (b) modernize marketing
channels for red meat; and (c) modernize marketing channels for poultry products. This
implied capacity building of key participants, strategies for development and promotion of
products, building of model market infrastructure for animal products, and provision of
grants to support the implementation of innovative business models.


18.    Component B: Development of Agricultural Exports aimed to expand
nontraditional agricultural exports (horticultural products) with an emphasis on
beneficiaries’ participation. The project helped develop a public-private partnership (PPP)
with target beneficiaries: producers, exporters, trade associations, and FOS-F&L. This
component consisted of three subcomponents:


19.     Subcomponent B1 - Innovation and Quality Management, which undertook
activities to: (a) diversify products and production zones, following mechanisms developed
under the Agriculture Export Promotion Project (AEPP); (b) develop centers of innovation
and training using existing training institutions in key regions; (c) establish good practice
guidelines benchmarked with the quality standard for fresh agricultural produce required
by EU’s importers, the Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group for Good Agricultural
Practice (EurepGAP; and (d) assist Senegal in its effort to obtain European Union (EU)
accreditation for its fruits and vegetables destined for export, which will allow it to measure
the country’s vegetables chains’ compliance with European Community (EC) Regulation
No. 1148/2001.

20.     Subcomponent B2 - Agricultural Export Infrastructure aimed to develop
collective post-harvest infrastructure and services in production zones. To support these
activities, the project financed technical assistance for designing the facilities and their
management model.

21.     Subcomponent B3 - Building Agricultural Export Institutions consisted of
supporting capacity-building activities for producers/exporters’ associations and assistance
for further development of FOS-F&L. It also supported the consolidation of a market
information system through an integrated and dynamic database, market intelligence on
export markets, and the successful publication I-FLEX, developed under AEPP.

22.     Component C: Development of Private Irrigation aimed at promoting demand-
driven, pro-poor investments in irrigation to support the expansion of agribusiness. The
target beneficiaries were primarily small-scale farm families, but also included SMEs as
well as larger local and foreign enterprises. Activities under this component were
conducted in close collaboration with the World Bank-funded Senegal River Basin
Multipurpose Water Resources Development Program (MWRD). It included four
subcomponents:


23.   Subcomponent C1 - Construction of Public Irrigation Infrastructures in the
Senegal River Delta in support of: (a) recalibration and rehabilitation of works on the


                                              21
Lampsar River; and (b) creation of secondary canals to connect to tertiary canals of private
investors (including smallholders). The project also supported technical studies for the
recalibration and construction of works on the Gorom-Aval River, rehabilitation of
Boundoum’s structure on the Lampsar River, and the opening of the Krankaye Canal.
These critical infrastructures were needed to attract private investors to develop innovative
irrigation schemes for crop diversification.


24.      Subcomponent C2 - Promotion of Irrigation for Crop Diversification in the
Senegal River Delta supported smallholders, SMEs, and agribusiness enterprises in
establishing innovative irrigation schemes adapted to their business plans, and provided
technical advisory services to ensure the schemes’ viability. The project complemented
investors’ capital with matching grants set at different levels for family farms, SMEs, and
agribusiness enterprises. The grants supported consultant services, civil works, and
irrigation equipment.


25.     Subcomponent C3 - Promotion of Micro-Irrigation for Crop Diversification in
the Niayes Zone, the Groundnut Basin, and Senegal Oriental. This subcomponent: (a)
carried out demonstrations of irrigated activities adapted to each region; (b) helped
smallholders in these regions establish innovative irrigation schemes adapted to their
business plans; and (c) supported technical advisory services to ensure the schemes’
viability. In the Groundnut Basin in particular, the project focused on the use of excess
water from existing village boreholes and small water-catchment dams (basins de
retention) to diversify production away from traditional crops. The project provided target
beneficiaries (smallholders) with grants for local consultants, civil works, and irrigation
equipment.


26.      Subcomponent C4 - Knowledge Management and Strategic Studies supported
the: (a) design of a master management plan for the Lac de Guiers; (b) assessment of the
irrigation and diversification potential of the mid and upper valleys of the Senegal River;
(c) design of the National Development Plan for Irrigation; and (d) strengthening of
SAED’s capacity in monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

27.     Component D: Project Coordination and M&E established a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) for overall project coordination and implementation. This
included the consolidation of annual work plans and budgets, oversight of financial
management and procurement, and monitoring of all implementing agencies’ activities. A
technical assistance firm with experience in agribusiness was recruited to provide
assistance on specific issues. Under this component, the project financed: (i) the PCU’s
staff and operating costs and supplemental costs incurred due to project activities carried
out by executing agencies; (ii) technical assistance provided by the technical assistance
firm and audits; and (iii) equipment, software, and consultant services, the cost of M&E
including information and communication (ICT) systems, mapping of out-growers and
service providers in the project areas, and monitoring of safeguards and social impacts.



                                             22
1.6. Revised Components

28.    With the approval of the AF1, the following additional components were added to
the parent project (PDMAS) by providing an additional US$10 million (equivalent of
SDR6.6. million) through the Food Price Crisis Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund:

29.      Component E: Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes in the Senegal River Valley
(US$8.0 million), which supported rehabilitation of 7,000 ha of village and private
irrigation schemes for rice production. This component was referred to as Part E of the
parent project in the Financing Agreement.

30.     Component F: Promotion of Intensive Rice Production in the Bignona Valley
(US$2.0 million), which aimed to enhance rice production in the Bignona Valley through
the exploitation of desalinated lands protected by the Affiniam Dam. This component was
referred to as Part F in the Financing Agreement.

31.   AF2 (PASAEL) added the following components by providing an additional
$US20 million through the Food Price Crisis Response Multi-Donor trust Fund:

32.     Component E (revised): Promotion of Intensive Rice Production in the Senegal
River Valley and the Anambé Basin (US$17.1 million). This component aimed to support
rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation perimeters and improvement of domestic rice
marketing conditions in project areas. It included: (i) rehabilitation of 7,400 hectares of
small-scale irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley and provision of 135 water
pumps; (ii) rehabilitation of 3,180 hectares of small-scale irrigation perimeters in the
Anambé Basin and 200 hectares of lowlands for rice production in the Department of
Velingara with the provision of agricultural equipment and materials and development of
an operations and maintenance (O&M) strategy for hydro-agricultural infrastructures in
the Anambé Basin; and (iii) improvement of domestic rice marketing conditions for locally
produced rice. This component was included in Component E defined above under AFFS.

33.     Component G: Improvement of Livestock Production in the Casamance (US$2.1
million). This component aimed to provide support to the national livestock production
capacity in the Ziguinchor and Sedhiou regions of the Casamance and to help increase
competitiveness of the domestic livestock sector (small ruminants and swine). It provided
funding to: (i) restock the livestock population through provision of matching grants; (ii)
expand existing animal health and disease control programs, such as animal vaccination
and systematic deworming, through technical assistance; and (iii) provide essential
infrastructure, including enhanced farm animal housing. This component was referred to
as Component G of the parent project in the Financing Agreement.

1.7. Other Significant Changes

34.    The project was first restructured with the approval of AF1 on May 10, 2010.
This was a Level 1 restructuring with a change in PDO and project development indicators



                                            23
as discussed in Section 1.3. On August 31, 2010, a reallocation of funds was processed to
support the completion of key project activities. With the approval of AF2 on April 9, 2013,
the project was further restructured to include the new AF components and related
intermediate indicators. An extension of closing date from December 31, 2014 to June 30,
2015 was granted in December 2014 to allow for completion of AF2 activities. A final
restructuring was approved on December 11, 2014, with a reallocation of proceeds to cover
higher than expected operating costs and large demand for subproject financing.

35.     The two AF operations built on the PDMAS’s institutional setup for their
implementation. They added a new emphasis on domestic rice and livestock production
in the parent project.

36.     First Additional Financing for Food Security (AFFS). Senegal is one of the
largest rice importers in Sub-Saharan Africa and relies heavily on these imports for its food
security. During 2007-2009, the country experienced a series of domestic and external
shocks. Given the severe food crisis and rising costs of fuel and food observed during this
period, the government adopted several fiscal measures to alleviate the effects of the crisis.
In 2008, the government increased public investments in agricultural inputs and irrigation
infrastructure and launched the Grand Offensive for Food and Abundance (Grande
Offensive Agricole pour la Nourriture et l’Abondance). Its key program was the National
Program for Rice Self-Sufficiency (Programme National d’Autosuffisance en Riz/PNAR).
The PNAR aimed at national rice self-sufficiency by 2012. The Bank responded to the food
crisis by approving the AFFS, which was built on the ongoing PDMAS’s institutional
arrangements. The rationale for AF1 was to provide supplementary funding to increase
national rice production and improve national food security.

37.     Food Security and Livestock Support Project (PASAEL). In 2011, agricultural
output declined drastically (by 21 percent) due to adverse weather conditions. In that year,
a joint assessment by local authorities, the World Food Programme, and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed that at least 850,000 people were facing food
insecurity. Agricultural production levels decreased between 25-80 percent across regions.

38.     The government and the Bank concurred that more resources were needed to
contribute to improved food security in the country. This decision was further supported
by AFFS’s satisfactory progress despite its limited resources. Additional funding was
allocated as more resources were needed to rehabilitate rice-growing perimeters, improve
rice marketing conditions, and strengthen livestock production systems. This led to
preparation and approval of AF2 (PASAEL). Its outcome indicators were: (i) annual
production of rice paddy in project areas (tons); (ii) livestock productivity in project areas;
and (iii) number of direct project beneficiaries (of which percent women).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1. Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry



                                              24
39.    The PDMAS reflected the existing government’s economic and sector
strategies. It was fully aligned with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) to
contribute to the country’s objectives of poverty reduction and economic growth among
the rural poor. It also acted as an implementation tool for the 2003-05 CAS (Country
Assistance Strategy), particularly in agricultural export promotion, in small-scale and
private irrigation, and in the commercialization of agricultural products. In addition,
agribusiness was one of the five focal sectors in the country's AGS, which aimed at a 7-8
percent average annual economic growth over a 10-year period based on development of
the export-oriented, labor-intensive sectors of: (i) agriculture and agribusiness; (ii) textile
and clothing business; (iii) information and communication technologies and services; (iv)
tourism, arts, and crafts; and (v) fisheries.


40.      The project was in line with the Bank’s Africa Action Plan (AAP). The prime
objectives of the AAP were to strengthen the private sector, expand exports, substantially
increase investment to close the infrastructure gap, scale up regional integration, build
skills for growth and competitiveness, and make agriculture more productive. The PDMAS
focused on these objectives by expanding Senegal’s private-led agricultural exports
through upgrading irrigation and market infrastructures, building public and private sectors’
capacities for competitiveness, and making irrigated agriculture more productive.


41.      In addition, the PDMAS’s design was well anchored on lessons learned from
the Bank’s past involvement in agricultural export promotion and irrigation
investment. It reflected: (i) the Bank’s overall experience in implementing projects in
Senegal; (ii) the findings of recent Economic Sector Work; and (iii) lessons learned in
previous projects, including AEPP, the Integrated Development Program for Irrigated
Agriculture in Mauritania (PDIAIM), and the Tunisia Export Development Project –
particularly its mechanisms for effective support to small and medium private initiatives
using public resources. Other lessons learned were that: (i) a bottom-up, inclusive approach,
rather than a top-down approach, is key to building capacity and assuring sustainability;
(ii) the standard four to five year project period is too short to build sustainable institutional
capacity; (iii) foreign firms with business know-how are an effective means of providing
hands-on demonstration of the skills necessary to shift institutional/business paradigms;
(iv) accumulation of soft assets is critical for triggering private sector investment growth;
and (v) the infrastructure investment process can be an important tool for institutional
development, institutional capacity building, and sustainability.


42.      The PDMAS was designed as the first phase of a 10-year Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) consisting of two phases, each lasting five years. The second phase, with
its triggers to move from the first to the second phase, was not developed in detail. The
project concept and components were similar to those of AEPP. The project components
were comprehensive and well-chosen so as to allow achievement of the PDO. At the same
time, the project was ambitious and had many innovative features, the most salient of which
were its: (a) value chain approach, and (b) encouragement of PPPs. The PDMAS sought to
change the way Senegalese authorities approach agricultural development and especially


                                               25
how they deal with agricultural export promotion. It tried to unlock the potential for private
sector involvement in agricultural development, built new partnership/business models
between the public and private sector, and tried to mobilize private capital for agricultural
development. Finally, the project put considerable emphasis on the introduction and
promotion of new technologies (drip irrigation) and software, including for knowledge
management.


43.     The Senegal Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness Development Project
(SSIAP/PDIDAS) builds on PDMAS-supported analytical work and sector strategy.
While a specific phase 2 of the APL was not prepared per se, the SSIAP/PDIDAS, a follow-
up operation of the PDMAS approved in December 2013, confirms the Bank’s
commitment to a long-term vision in its support to agribusiness in the country. This project
directly supports the National Accelerated Growth Strategy (Stratégie de Croissance
Accélérée – SCA), which was prepared under the PDMAS with a focus on the promotion
of horticultural exports and value chain development. The SCA is fully embedded in the
Emerging Senegal Plan (Plan Sénégal Emergent – PSE), the government’s medium- and
long-term development strategy.


44.     To ensure that infrastructure constructed under AEPP would be well
managed, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) included as a condition of
effectiveness that: (a) the Borrower would take all necessary actions to put the
infrastructure built under AEPP under private management; and (b) as a dated covenant
that not later than December 31, 2006, the Borrower would establish the FOS-F&L, and
that by June 30, 2008, this foundation would implement some of the activities to be carried
out under Part B of the project component “Development of Agricultural Exports.”


45.     The PDMAS’s design was therefore comprehensive and aligned with sectoral
policies and Bank operational experiences. Key project risks were appropriately
identified and rated at design phase. Proposed mitigation measures proved effective and
were adequately monitored during implementation. The only weakness of project
preparation was the overly optimistic assumption about the timeframe necessary to
accomplish certain actions, especially related to the abovementioned legal undertakings
and the execution of subprojects by family farms, SMEs, and agribusiness enterprises,
mostly related to production of horticultural crops with micro-irrigation.


46.     Similarly, the two AFs (AFFS and PASAEL) were well prepared. Their designs
were kept simple and limited essentially to irrigation rehabilitation and some livestock
activities. They were prepared in the context of the rapid response needed to address the
prevailing food security crisis in the country. They responded directly to the country’s
needs and were clearly in line with its food security priorities. Both projects’ preparation
benefited from the PDMAS’s PCU staff, who were experienced with the implementing
arrangements already in place. Anchoring these two activities in the ongoing PDMAS was
deemed appropriate in order to hasten the implementation of food security activities using


                                             26
existing PDMAS implementations arrangements. The technical and organizational designs
of these AFs were straightforward, as it was only a matter of extending activities that had
already been completed or were ongoing under the PDMAS using the same executing
agencies.

2.2. Implementation

47.      The project was affected by a slow start-up. Effectiveness was declared one year
after Board approval. It took a long time to meet the effectiveness condition regarding
private management of agricultural export facilities built under the PPEA (Agricultural
Export Promotion Project), as the process of selecting a private operator was lengthy and
initially unsuccessful. Despite completion of technical studies for the irrigation-related
works, the bidding process launch was delayed for about one year to address environmental
safeguards issues, as the project intervention areas in the Senegal River Valley included
two protected areas (Djoudj and Ndiael). The project also faced delays in the
implementation of subprojects for small-scale farmers as a result of beneficiaries’ difficulty
in mobilizing their contribution (set at 50 percent of subproject costs). In addition, average
subproject costs, estimated at CFAF 2 million per hectare at design phase, were found to
average CFAF 3.5 million per hectare during implementation. This cost increase impacted
the number of subprojects that could be financed and therefore the original target coverage
of 1,400 hectares for small-scale farmers. Otherwise, the project progressed as planned.


48.     The MTR was instrumental in ensuring project focus through restructuring
and addressing key issues that could impact project development outcomes.
Conducted in November 2009, the MTR found that overall project implementation as well
as safeguards and fiduciary aspects were satisfactory. The Results Framework was revised
to clarify and more sharply define some of the PDO and intermediate outcome indicators
to better capture the project’s development impact. The PCU’s proactive efforts and
extensive consultations with local communities helped moved execution of subprojects
forward. The contribution required of beneficiaries was decreased from 50 percent of
subproject costs to 20 percent. The PCU also worked with local financing institutions to
help mobilize beneficiaries’ contributions, helping to boost the approval of subprojects and
installation of small-scale farmers in the developed perimeters. IDA and MDTF funds were
reallocated across components to make up for expected shortfalls in physical investments
scheduled under Component C “Development of Private Irrigation.” The procurement
process underway for the restructuring of the Beer Thialane irrigation water network
revealed that the allocated envelope for this activity was not sufficient to allow for works
completion. Around US$6.5 million was reallocated to the works category from matching
grants and unallocated funds, which also ensured that the expected development impact
was not affected due to lack of funds.

49.    The MTR laid the groundwork for preparation of the two AFs for food
security. Since the PDMAS constituted a well-established instrument for swift project
execution, the government and IDA decided not to create a stand-alone operation but to
use the PDMAS’s existing institutional arrangements for the two new AFs aimed at


                                             27
improved food security (AFFS and PASAEL). This was also in part due to the fact that
most project activities were to be carried out by SAED, a well-experienced agency already
under implementation agreements with the PDMAS. The implementation of AFFS and
PASAEL proceeded without major difficulties. Despite a very short implementation period
(original closing date – December 31, 2014), PASAEL did not pose major challenges to
the PCU’s management capacity.

50.      Major infrastructure investments procedures were processed smoothly. Under
the PDMAS, AFFS, and PASAEL, several major infrastructure works were related to
construction of irrigation canals and irrigation networks as well as agricultural market
infrastructure. The procurement process for these physical investments (with the exception
of the construction of small water-catchment dikes and irrigation perimeters) was
conducted efficiently and works carried out as expected. The main difficulties partly laid
in finding private management for these facilities and ensuring adequate O&M for the
irrigation canals. For subprojects started under the PDMAS, the pace of installation of
users/beneficiaries was slow. The requirement that beneficiaries had to first mobilize their
own financial contribution (20 percent of total subproject costs for small producers)
delayed the process. Granting access to land for subprojects to operators from outside the
community (nationals as well as foreigners) was also a time-consuming process.

51.     Despite a simple design and a good project preparation, a major part of a
component under AF1 could not be implemented on time due to procurement issues.
Under AF1 Component “Promotion of Intensive Rice Production in the Bignona Valley”
(US$2.0 million), a candidate firm not selected for execution of the works contested the
procurement process. This triggered a long arbitration process, which concluded in a
relaunch of the bidding process. The decision, made six months before project closing,
ultimately stopped the execution of the associated dam works despite completion of all
detailed feasibility studies.

52.     Some issues remained at project closing. Despite the effective transfer of
management responsibilities for export infrastructures to the FOS-F&L, the project still
faced difficulties in placing one of the export facilities (Gare de Fret - GDF), built under
PPEA and located at the Dakar airport, under private management. The construction of a
new airport equipped with a similar infrastructure increased the level of uncertainty about
the future of this infrastructure. In addition, the Beer Thialane irrigation network, though
completed, still does not have the appropriate management structure. During the
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) mission, the issue was raised to the
Borrower. The mission team was assured the Société Nationale des Eaux du Sénégal
(SONES) will cover the costs of the study that will provide private management options
for the network. In the meantime, the National Water Distribution Company (SDE) will be
temporarily entrusted with the network’s operation and management.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

53.    Design. The PDMAS M&E system relied to a large extent on what was already in
place under AEPP. The indicators were designed to measure project development and


                                            28
component performance, assess project compliance with environmental and safeguards
standards, and monitor effectiveness of project management. Impact evaluation studies
were planned and expected to provide an annual assessment of project outcomes.


54.     Implementation. Specialized staff were recruited and a system of collecting and
analyzing data from the executing agencies was put in place. With the addition of AFFS
and PASAEL, new indicators were added. The only weakness of the M&E system was that
some of its indicators (e.g., increase in beneficiaries’ incomes) could not be measured at
the outset as beneficiaries were not yet known nor could they be measured at the MTR
because the results of subprojects were not yet available; one indicator (increase in
horticultural and nontraditional agricultural exports) did not distinguish between increased
exports as a result of project interventions and overall national exports (i.e., from non-
beneficiaries).

55.     Utilization of the M&E system. For the Borrower, the PCU, and the executing
agencies as well as IDA, the M&E system was crucial in judging project progress and
taking corrective action when needed. The quarterly and especially yearly progress reports
that reviewed in detail all outcome and output indicators were well done. They provided a
clear picture of project status at all times. During the MTR, the abovementioned
weaknesses were corrected. Also, as part of the AFFS approval package, the following
intermediate outcome indicators were dropped as they were no longer relevant for project
impact assessment: (i) “The Fondation Origine Senegal – Fruits & Legumes is
implemented”; and (ii) “Senegal has received EU accreditation related to EC No. 1148-
200 on check on conformity to the marketing standards applicable to fresh fruits and
vegetables.” This indicator was critical for development of the whole agricultural export
industry as it allowed access to the European market and attracted foreign direct investment.
The M&E system was improved during the course of implementation to adjust for better
measurability and realism. Difficulties and delays faced by the project during
implementation were promptly identified and informed the adoption of the necessary
remedial measures. The M&E system was adjusted to take into account new outcomes
expected from the two AFs.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
56.     Environmental and Social Safeguards. The PDMAS was an Environmental
Category B project. No additional safeguards policies were triggered under the two AFs.
The following safeguard policies were applicable: (a) Environmental Assessment; (b)
Natural Habitats; (c) Pest Management; (d) Involuntary Resettlement; (e) Safety of Dams;
and (f) Projects on International Waterways.

57.     A detailed Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF),
which included the potential environmental and social impacts of small dams, a Pest and
Pesticide Management Plan (PPMP), and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), was
prepared, reflected in the Project Implementation Manual, and subsequently implemented.
An environmental and social evaluation specialist was part of the PCU’s core staff and
corresponding focal points within the executing agencies were trained. All subprojects


                                            29
were screened for environmental and social impacts and an additional criterion was added
to ensure gender mainstreaming.

58.     No resettlement was necessary during project implementation. Only small
dams were financed, and the OMVS High Commissioner informed the Government of
Senegal that it had no objections to the proposed irrigation in the Senegal River Delta.
Farmers who lost trees due to rehabilitation works were compensated. Also, plants that
serve as wind breakers along the horticultural irrigation perimeters were planted as part of
the environmental measures. To avoid conflict between agriculturalists and herders, special
access routes (couloirs de betail) were provided for herders with animals in these irrigated
areas.

59.     The project supervision mission in April 2008 even had as a special focus an in-
depth review of all safeguards measures. During the whole project implementation period,
specialized IDA staff supervised all safeguards aspects and rated them as satisfactory.

60.       Financial Management and Audit. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the
PDMAS PCU: (i) recruited a qualified and experienced financial management specialist;
(ii) set up an accounting software; (iii) developed an administrative and accounting manual;
and (iv) recruited an external auditor. Disbursement methods at the beginning were based
on Reimbursement, Special Account Advance, and Direct Payment and later shifted to
disbursements based on quarterly unaudited financial reports. All supporting
documentation for statements of expenditures (SOEs) was retained at the PCU and made
available for review by periodic World Bank review missions and external auditors. The
special Designated Account was managed by the PCU. With the addition of the two AFs,
the PDMAS’s financial management system was adjusted to integrate the AF activities and
a “multi-project” computerized accounting system was customized to fit project needs. The
financial management system worked well, was regularly reviewed by a specialist on
supervision missions, and at all times satisfied the Bank’s requirements. Independent
external auditors annually examined project accounts and the audit reports were always
unqualified. In 2013, the auditors recommended improvements to the internal controls that
were acted upon.

61.     Procurement under the project was carried out according to World Bank
guidelines. The PDMAS and the executing agency – SAED– as well as AFFS and
PASAEL counted on experienced procurement staff that had full knowledge of the Bank’s
procurement rules and procedures. Detailed procurement plans and procurement actions
were regularly reviewed by procurement specialists as part of supervision. With the
exception of one or two contracts where national and Bank procurement rules came to
different conclusions, procurement overall went smoothly, albeit slowly.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

62.    In an unusual step, the government decided to maintain the PDMAS’s core PCU
staff with its own financing until the end of December 2015, six months after project
closing, to allow the team to wind down activities and finalize activities that were started


                                            30
but not yet completed. It should be noted that the PCU staff was instrumental in preparing
the IDA-financed Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness Development Project (approved
on November 22, 2013), which is a follow-up project to the PDMAS. Furthermore, the
PCU was actively involved in the preparation of all key agricultural strategy documents.
These strategies have made promotion of agricultural exports and development of irrigated
agriculture based on private sector involvement and innovative water-saving technologies
two of their central themes. In addition, the government is well aware that maintenance of
irrigation infrastructure was neglected in the past and is crucial in the future; to this effect,
the government established a maintenance fund in its budget for irrigation infrastructure in
the Senegal River Valley (Fond de Maintenance des Adduteurs et Emissaires de Drainage
– FoMAED). Finally, under the ongoing Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness
Development Project, IDA will have the possibility of following up on institutional issues
that are important for the long-term success of activities started under the PDMAS, AFFS,
and PASAEL.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

63.    The relevance of the PDO is high. The PDMAS reflected the government’s
economic and sector strategies at the time of preparation. It was in line with the existing
PRSP to contribute to the country’s objectives of poverty reduction and economic growth
among the rural poor. The PDO focused on agricultural export promotion, on small-scale
and private irrigation, and on commercialization of agricultural products, focus areas of the
2003-05 CAS and the country's AGS. At the time of this ICR, the objectives of the PDMAS,
AFFS, and PASAEL remain highly relevant.


64.     Project objectives continue to be consistent with the country’s current
development priorities. In the most recent national strategy documents: (i) Plan Senegal
Emergent (PSE), (ii) the National Agricultural Investment Program (NAIP), and (iii) the
Programme d’Acceleration de la Cadence de l’Agriculture Senegalaise (PRACAS),
structural transformation of the Senegalese economy, food security (increased rice
production), and development of agricultural exports are considered major pillars. The
latest strategy (PRACAS) has two major objectives: (i) promotion of family farming
through agricultural intensification, better marketing conditions, and better management of
the quality of agricultural products; and (ii) emergence of agricultural and rural enterprises
based on an intelligent synergy between agribusiness and family farms. Its specific
objective is increased production of rice, onions, groundnuts, and fruits and vegetables.


65.    The objectives of this operation are also in line with the Bank’s FY13–FY17
Country Partnership Strategy, which supports increased agricultural productivity and
marketing under Pillar 1, “Accelerating Growth and Employment & Creating Fiscal Space,”


                                               31
and contribute to the foundation “Strengthening Governance Framework and Building
Resilience” through support to sustainable land and water management.


66.      The relevance of design and implementation is rated substantial. The design of
PDMAS activities addressed key bottlenecks in agricultural productivity and export
promotion while aiming to unleash the potential for private sector involvement in
agricultural development. Activities were designed to build innovative
partnership/business models between the public and private sector to mobilize private
capital for sustainable agricultural development. Taking into account the constraining
production factor of limited access to water, the project put considerable emphasis on the
introduction and promotion of new technologies (drip irrigation) and software aspects,
including knowledge management. It was also designed to support major structural
irrigation infrastructures that would facilitate the establishment of small-scale farms and
medium and large agriculture enterprises adopting water-efficient irrigation technologies.
Overall, the project design put a strong emphasis on: (i) a value chain and institutional
strengthening approach based on exports quality promotion in compliance with European
Community (EC) Regulation No. 1148/2001; (ii) promotion of PPPs; (iii) introduction of
new water-saving technologies; and (iv) matching grants that required beneficiaries to
assume part of the investment costs based on their capacity to pay. The two AFs (AFFS
and PASAEL) corresponded to the recurring food crises and associated food insecurity.
Their main focus on increased rice production and rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation
perimeters both in the Senegal River Delta and in the south (Casamance) and with Senegal
River Delta Management Holding Company (Société Nationale d’Aménagement et
d’Exploitation des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Senegalet de la Falémé – SAED) and the
Senegal Agricultural and Industrial Development Company (Société de Développement
Agricole et Industriel de l’Anambé – SODAGRI) as executing agencies was the appropriate
response to changing circumstances and the prevailing food insecurity in vulnerable
households.


67.     Project implementation stressed the inclusion of beneficiaries in the decision-
making process to ensure continuous ownership and impact sustainability. O&M
models for irrigation and drainage system were discussed and agreed with beneficiaries.
Water users’ groups were made responsible for O&M of secondary irrigation
infrastructures. These arrangements assigned ownership of the project among beneficiaries.
Land allocation for the establishment of irrigation perimeters was handled jointly with local
communities throughout the project to ensure a transparent process and to provide secure
access to land for beneficiaries outside the community.

68.     The project implemented the introduction of innovative technologies through
a dynamic consultative process with stakeholders. Technical requirements and financial
implications of innovative irrigation kits required extensive information and training
sessions for small beneficiaries. Recognizing the underlying challenges along the way, the
project allocated appropriate resources in terms of staffing and technical assistance. This
helped strengthen smallholders’ capacity in acquiring advanced irrigation technology.



                                            32
Constant consultations with beneficiaries were critical in determining the appropriate kits
or combinations of kits adapted to specific farm business plans.

69.   With the relevance of objectives rated as high and the relevance of design and
implementation rated as substantial, the overall relevance is rated substantial.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

70.     The Project Development Objective was modified at approval of the First
Additional Financing on May 10, 2010. The PDO was revised from “to contribute to
sustainable increase of nontraditional agricultural exports and revenues for project
beneficiaries/participants” to “Improved competitiveness of selected domestic supply
chains, increased non-traditional agricultural exports and increased rice production in
project areas”.

71.     At approval stage, original PDO indicators included the following: (i)
Horticultural and nontraditional agricultural exports reach 30,000 tons by the end of the
project; and (ii) 60 percent increase in farm revenues of producers supported by the project
at the end of the project. They were revised and dropped, respectively, at restructuring upon
approval of the First Additional Financing on May 10, 2010.

72.     Original project activities aimed to improve the performance of domestic
supply chains through interventions such as matching grants to develop partnerships
between agribusiness and small-holders; provision of water-efficient irrigation
technologies and improved irrigation services; adoption of good agricultural practices;
better access to post-harvest infrastructures and high value markets; and development of
marketing strategy and information system. This was expected to improve producers’
productivity and secure access to higher prices, thus resulting in increased incomes.

73.     Pre-AF1 PDO indicators achievement. At restructuring, horticultural exports
attained 27,409 tons for the 2008-2009 growing period versus a project target of 26,000 for
the same period (105 percent achievement rate). At project closing, horticultural exports
reached 85,000 tons. Data for national horticultural exports are derived from Eurostat
database which reports Senegalese fruits and vegetables exports to Europe and from the
National Directorate for Plant protection (DPP), responsible for certifying the conformity
of agricultural products prior to exports, in line with EC No 1148-2001 on check on
conformity to the marketing standards applicable to fresh fruits and vegetables. This
indicator positive achievement is directly linked to PDMAS support to the certification of
private exporters through the production of various tools, namely: a registry of all exporters
of fruits; a database that allows the origin of products to be traced; and a manual on
SeneGAP for smallholders that is benchmarked with EuroGAP to allow exports to the EU.
PDMAS support to the capacity building of DPP in exports certification helped ensure that
commodities shipped to Europe were not rejected at destination ports. In addition, PDMAS
provided support to the renewal of the certification of Ceres Locustox (a reference chemical


                                             33
laboratory) for the monitoring of pesticide residues to ensure conformity of Senegalese
horticulture with international market standards. This support directly contributed to the
improved quality of local horticultural production intended for exports.

74.     While this indicator shows satisfactory progress, before and at project closing,
it was revised at restructuring. It did not distinguish between exports due to project
interventions and overall exports of the country, including those generated from non-
project beneficiaries. Nevertheless, it can be noted that the volume of horticultural exports
directly attributable to PDMAS intervention was 25,530 tons at project closing, or 30% of
national horticulture exports. In addition, the indirect positive impact of the project on the
overall horticultural industry is considerable as existing agricultural exporters in the
Senegal River Delta would not have operated continuously without the PDMAS
investment in structural irrigation infrastructures.

75.     The project interventions resulted in a significant increase in beneficiaries’
revenues. Table 4 summarizes average increases estimates in revenues for rice and selected
horticultural crop producers Interviews were conducted with project beneficiaries in the
targeted zones in order to collect on-farm data. Data were collected from a stratified sample
of 180 beneficiaries (small-scale and medium) across project areas on induced effects of
interventions, such as increases in cropped area, livestock herds, productivity and
production, diversification in farm activities, production costs, labor costs, project-
supported investments, irrigation water use and fees, products market prices. Figures show
average incomes before and after project interventions for small-scale and medium-size
producers. For small-scale producers, increases in income ranged from 53 percent for
banana growers to 192 percent for small-scale vegetable growers. Medium-size producers
experienced income increases from 50 percent in banana production to 192 percent in
vegetable production.

76.     Pre-AF1 PDO indicators achievement is rated Modest. The indicator “60
percent increase in farm revenues of producers supported by the project at the end of the
project” was dropped at restructuring. The indicator could not be measured at the outset as
beneficiaries were not yet known nor could they be measured at the MTR because results
of subprojects were not yet available. The indicator on horticultural and nontraditional
exports could not distinguish between exports due to project interventions and overall
exports of the country, including those generated from non-project beneficiaries.

77.     Post-AF1 PDO indicators achievement. The subsequent evaluation illustrates
project achievements based on the revised PDO indicators after restructuring. They include
the following indicators: (i) “Nontraditional agricultural exports in project areas reach
12,000 tons by the end of the project;” and (ii) “Local production of onion and banana
covers 75 percent and 50 percent of domestic consumption respectively.”

78.     Original project activities after restructuring remain the same as before the
restructuring. Additional components for improved rice and livestock production were
simply added to the parent project with AF 1 and AF2. The achievement of the PDO was
linked to the following activities/components:

  (i) Improved domestic marketing conditions. As a consequence of investments in
  rural market infrastructure and encouragement of innovative business models adapted
  to small producers and SMEs, local production of onions and bananas increased
  considerably, reaching 70 percent (93 percent of target) and 70 percent (140 percent of
  target) of local consumption, respectively. These indicators are derived as the ratio of
  local production over the aggregate of imported products and locally marketed
  production. The PDMAS contributed largely to increased local onion and banana
  production as it targeted the main production areas for onion production (Senegal River
  delta, the Niayes zone and the Groundnut Basin for onion) and banana production
  (Gouloumbou and Sedhiou). In the onion sector, the project supported increased
  production through the financing of 365 sub-projects for small-scale farmers, of which
  215 in the Senegal River valley. In addition, producers’ capacity building on good
  agricultural practices from nurseries to field and on post-harvest handling has been
  instrumental in expanding marketed production. To this should be added the
  construction of the PALMM of Guia, a main onion storage and handling infrastructure
  in the Senegal River valley. In the banana sector, project interventions included the
  construction of the PLAZA of Tambacounda (Gouloumbou), a logistics platform for
  banana collection, cold storage and handling before reaching urban markets; the
  construction of 54,5 km of access roads for the opening up of 700 ha of banana farms
  for better accessed to markets; the upgrade of 7 existing banana processing facilities and
  construction of 4 new processing units.

  (ii) Development of nontraditional exports. Non-traditional exports by project
  beneficiaries reached 25,530 tons (213 percent of target). They mainly consist in green
  beans, mango, sweet potato, tomato and processed foods such as dried mango and dried
  tomato. The volume of nontraditional exports reported is derived from total exports
  originating from actual project beneficiaries. The latter include small-scale producers



                                            35
and SMEs who benefited from matching grants and/or support along the value chains as
well as existing agribusiness which benefited from improved access to water through
PDMAS irrigation infrastructures. They are: Soleil Vert (1,440 tons), Bursine (346 tons),
GPE (767 tons) which were granted installation on the 2,500 ha perimeters developed
by the PDMAS for horticulture production; the Federative Cooperative of Horticulture
Actors in Senegal-CFAHS (13,536 tons) which benefited from financing for support
along selected value chains; agribusinesses along the Socas canal, (Agroval, Tensen and
Agrinord) which benefited from improved access to water with the construction of the
Canal of Krankaye accounted for 7,298 tons. Matching grant beneficiaries’ exports
amounted to 2,142 tons. The development of these exports was made possible by
investment in irrigation structural infrastructure including the construction of the
Krankaye canal, provision of matching grants for export promotion, introduction of
export quality standards, advice to participants along the value chain, and agricultural
export infrastructure covering all aspects from: (a) post-harvest infrastructure and
services (warehousing/packaging/cold storage facilities at farm gate level; to (b)
container handling/freight facilities; to (c) strengthening the capacities of
producers/exporters’ organizations.

(iii) Development of private irrigation under the PDMAS and irrigation
rehabilitation under the two AFs. Under the PDMAS, over 2,400 ha of drip irrigation
were developed for small farm families (600 ha), small and medium-scale enterprises
(500 ha), and larger agribusiness enterprises (500 ha). Intensive horticultural production
is now being practiced on these plots. The two AFs rehabilitated some 7,000 ha and
7,400 ha of village and private rice irrigated perimeters, respectively in the Senegal
River Valley and 3,380 hectares in the Anambe basin.

(iv) Improved rice production in Senegal River valley and Anambé basin. Rice
production was added to the project development with the two AFs with the objective
to rehabilitate 7,000 ha in the Senegal River valley under AF1 and 7,400 ha in the
Senegal River valley and 3,380 ha in the Anambe basin under AF2. During the
2013/2014 cropping period, SAED reported 5,571 ha cropped in the dry season and
7,000 ha in the rainy season. This resulted in an additional rice production of 86,660
tons in 2014 with an average yield of 6.76 and 7.0 tons/ha in both cropping cycles
respectively. At this time, the project had completed the first phase of rehabilitation of
7,000 ha under AF1. The rehabilitation of the 10,780 ha under AF2 was completed in
June 2015. SAED estimates rice production in project areas in the Senegal River valley
at 111,000 tons in December 2015. Overall, project targets are fully achieved, with an
achievement rate of 127 percent.

(v) Improvement of livestock production. Indicators on increased small ruminants
productivity (20% target) and swine productivity (40% target) were not available at the
time of project closing as related activities were carried out in the last year of the projects
and indicators can only be informed two years thereafter. Nevertheless, project activities
contributing to these objectives were carried out: (i) re-stocking of the swine population
with flocks of higher genetic potential for growth and disease resistance; (ii) expansion
of animal health and disease control programs such as animal vaccination and systematic



                                            36
  de-worming; and, (iii) provision of essential infrastructure including enhanced farm
  animal housing and slaughtering facilities. Sixty-five improved breed swine of higher
  genetic potential were introduced against a target of 40 (achieved at 162%), 14,500
  swine were vaccinated against (achieved at 39%) and 176,450 small ruminants were
  vaccinated and dewormed (achieved at 95%), 45 sheep shelters and 45 swine shelters
  were constructed. The five planned slaughtering facilities could not be completed due
  to delayed contract clearances from the national procurement agency.

79.      The achievement rates of intermediate outcome indicators further
demonstrate the project’s good performance in attaining its quantitative objectives.
Achievement of the quantitative project outcome indicators was made possible by project
investments in domestic supply chain consolidation, rural market infrastructure,
knowledge management, and development of animal products markets. The development
of agricultural exports was made possible by introduction of export quality standards and
agricultural export infrastructure. The development of private irrigation with its
accompanying increases in horticultural production is a direct result of the construction of
public irrigation infrastructure in the Senegal River Delta, the promotion of micro-
irrigation for crop diversification, and the promotion of micro-irrigation in the Senegal
River Delta and the Niayes zone. The project contributed to additional quality meat sold
through support to Senegalese Slaughterhouse Management Company (SOGAS) for
improved sanitary inspection and control of existing slaughterhouses and clandestine
slaughtering areas. The volume of marketed meat from slaughterhouses in norms as a result
of project support is reported in the intermediate indicator. To this, is added the volume of
marketed meat from butcheries which benefited from sub-projects financing. Intermediate
outcome indicators’ achievements by component are presented in Table 2:

80.     Innovative business models were introduced in commercial partnerships,
irrigation technology, and livestock production across nine value chains (bananas,
green beans, mangos, onions, tomatoes, sweet potato, red meat, poultry, and processed
foods). Several drying, cold storage, and rural produce collection centers (Poles agricoles
logistiques et de mise en marche – PALMM) were built to handle horticultural products. In
the livestock sector, food safety of animal products was improved through construction of
a modern slaughterhouse in Mbour and elimination of unsupervised slaughter of animals.


81.     In addition, the PDMAS supported renewal of the certification of Ceres
Locustox (a reference chemical laboratory) for the monitoring of pesticide residues to
ensure conformity of Senegalese horticulture with international market standards.
To support the certification of private exporters, the project produced various tools,
namely: a registry of all exporters of fruits; a database that allows the origin of products to
be traced; and a manual on SeneGAP for smallholders that is benchmarked with EuroGAP
to allow exports to the EU. Three centers of innovation and training for horticulture crops
in key regions were also created using existing training infrastructure.

82.    Furthermore, the project contributed significantly to building a sustainable
horticulture industry for both export and domestic markets. This was done through:


                                              38
(i) building up and enforcing food safety and quality standards; (ii) creating the physical
conditions for gradual relocation of horticulture-producing centers from the area around
Dakar, which is threatened by urbanization and soil salinization, to the Senegal River Delta;
and (iii) continuously and positively inspiring the government’s policies and strategies for
horticultural development. The agribusiness pillar in these documents was designed by the
PDMAS PCU team. Last but not least, the PDMAS and its pilot operation facilitated
private investment in the industry, resulting in around a 20 percent annual increase in
export volume during its implementation period (see Annex 4).

83.    Yields of horticultural crops. Table 3 summarizes the average productivity
(tons/ha) for selected horticultural crops before and after the PDMAS.

84.     Before the PDMAS, the majority of family farmers owned between 0.5-1.0 ha
of horticultural crops and about 1 ha of irrigated rice. With access to irrigation, inputs,
agricultural advice, and improved marketing conditions, all brought about as a consequence
of the project, many farmers were able to increase their landholdings and/or farm cropping
intensity. A significant number invested in livestock activities.


85.     Overall PDO achievement rating is rated Substantial. At restructuring, project
disbursement amounted to US$18.3 million, or 30% of total project disbursement at closing.
Using a four point scale1 rating Pre-AFI and pre-AF2 achievements are rated 2 (Modest)
and 3 (Substantial) respectively. Applying the corresponding disbursement weights of 30%
and 70% respectively, overall PDO achievement is rated 3 or Substantial2.

3.3. Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

86.    The ex-post evaluation done as part of this ISR (Implementation Status and
Results Report) estimated an overall economic rate of return (ERR) of 34 percent,
demonstrating the project’s soundness. At completion, the project’s estimated net
present value (NPV), discounted at a 17 percent annual interest rate was CFAF 42 billion

or US$84 million. The project’s economic impact is similarly robust across all regions of
project interventions (Table 5).

        Table 5: Economic analysis at regional level (NPV in US$ million)

87.     These economic analysis results compare favorably to the ex-ante evaluation
performed at approval stage. High ERRs are observed across all regions of interventions,
ranging from 24 percent to 57 percent. Although lower than the ex-ante analysis’s estimates,
results remain strong across all regions of interventions, indicative of the economic and
financial profitability of PDMAS investments. The highest returns are observed in the
Senegal River Valley and the Niayes zone, as anticipated at appraisal. The profitability of
investments in the Groundnut Basin are in line with the promising estimates of the
economic analysis at appraisal stage.


88.     The project also brought efficiency in water use by introducing new water-
efficient irrigation technology, such as drip irrigation and improved hydraulic
infrastructure. This resulted in an increase in field cropping intensity as well as an
increase in cropped area.


89.    Project efficiency might very well be rated as high were it not for the delays
observed in the establishment of small and medium-size producers in irrigation
perimeters. Taking into account delays observed in the implementation of subprojects for
small-scale farmers in the Senegal River Valley and the Niayes zone, efficiency is rated as
substantial.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory




                                            40
90.     Overall the project outcome is rated satisfactory. With Relevance of PDO, PDO
achievements and Efficiency rated substantial, the overall outcome rating is Satisfactory.
This is also in line with project’s major outcomes outlined above, intermediate outcomes’
achievements, and the project’s contribution to shaping a sustainable horticulture industry
through appropriate policy orientations and introduction of modern innovative irrigation
technology in export-oriented agriculture.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

91.     The project had an important impact on poverty through its outcome on
increased farm revenues. The improved access to water for beneficiary farmers in project
areas made an important contribution to poverty reduction. The PDMAS helped increase
agricultural productivity and cropping intensity in areas where only rainfed cropping was
possible. With better access to water, beneficiary farmers could increase their farm areas
and their cropping intensity, with agricultural production now possible in dry seasons.
Although no poverty data are available for comparison purposes, the project is believed to
have had an impact on poverty, with higher revenues from farming activities compared to
those that would have been realized without the project.


92.     The impact study conducted by the Senegalese Agricultural Research
Institute- Macroeconomics Analysis Unit (ISRA)/BAME revealed that the project
had a significant social impact. Matching grants provided to beneficiaries helped
modernize their farming activities with the acquisition of water-efficient technology and
agricultural equipment that afforded higher productivity and thus revenues. Increases in
farming revenue allowed beneficiary farmers to invest in household equipment, thus
improving their families’ well-being. Increased farming activities as a result of better
access to irrigation water directly impacted job creation in rural communities, where
farmers employed more agricultural workers. With greater income generation, beneficiary
farmers could also enter new subsectors, such as livestock rearing, which contributes
towards more secure revenues and improved food security. Furthermore, it is believed that
the project contributed to improved nutrition outcomes among beneficiary farming
households with its contribution to agricultural diversification.


93.     The project targeted women and youth beneficiaries and an output indicator
was included to monitor the participation of women and young people. At completion,
the project had benefited 3,639 women and 2,120 youth,, representing achievement rates
of 126 percent and 156 percent, respectively. These women and youth directly benefited
from matching grants that financed farming, marketing, or processing subprojects. They
also benefited from training activities in best agricultural practices, produce certification
programs, and participation in international fairs and study tours.




                                             41
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
longer-term capacity and institutional development)

94.     With its emphasis on software aspects (export quality standards, food safety,
introduction of innovations) and the creation of agricultural export infrastructure, the
PDMAS opened the door for export-oriented commercial agriculture by family farmers
and SMEs, which hardly existed before. This is gradually changing the perception of
agriculture as an activity practiced by poor farmers for subsistence purposes to that of
agriculture as a market-oriented, profitable business. While the future of FOS-F&L is
uncertain, the many other institutions supported under the project and that need to work in
a coordinated manner to allow agricultural exports into the EU are steadily advancing and
horticultural producers are becoming better organized as part of their federation (CFAHS).

(c) Technological Change
95.     The project introduced a major new technology (drip irrigation) that revolutionizes
the way agriculture is practiced. It impacts water use and use of agricultural inputs,
including labor, and increases production efficiency manifold. Given the huge
underutilized potential for irrigation development in Senegal, it is expected this new
technology will be adopted much more widely in the future and should lead to a much more
productive agriculture sector. In addition, the project introduced and tested many new
varieties of fruit trees and horticultural crops for export and new livestock-related
husbandry practices that other farmers are expected to replicate in the future.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

96.     No beneficiary surveys and/or stakeholder workshops were carried out for the
PDMAS, AFFS, or PASAEL. At the request of the PCU and IDA, however, ISRA followed
a sample of beneficiaries in the different project areas during 2012 to determine their
economic characteristics. These regional exploratory studies were used during 2014 to
estimate the economic impact of the project on participating farm families (see section on
efficiency).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

97.     Over the past few years, attitudes toward the agriculture sector changed
fundamentally as the sector became more open to foreign investment. Production of
irrigated rice and horticultural crops, especially for export, is increasingly looked upon as
a profitable economic activity that attracts wide interest. Meanwhile, improved
understandings with rural communities allow access to secure land ownership for outsiders
(from within the country and foreigners). As more and more enterprises (small, medium,
and large) make long-term investments to take advantage of market opportunities, a
network effect should be expected. This trend was observed in the PDMAS and is currently


                                             42
being observed in the ongoing Senegal Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness Project
(SSIAP/PDIDAS) The SSIAP/PDIDAS is already registering a large interest of foreign
investors as well local communities willing to allocate land for outside private investors.

98.     The supply chain approach developed under the PDMAS can further
strengthen the interactions between different actors in the sector. With the support to
the renewal of the certification of Ceres Locustox for the monitoring of pesticide residues
to ensure conformity of Senegalese horticulture with international market standards and
the provision of good agricultural practices to small-scale farmers, efforts have been made
to increase the quality of agricultural products originating from small-scale famers.
However it is not clear how long large operators facing highly demanding international
markets will continue their contractual arrangements with smaller operators if the latter do
not maintain adequate produces quality standards and good agricultural practices. A
continuous capacity building and monitoring of small-scale famers in full collaboration of
large agribusinesses will be necessary. The SSIAP/PDIDAS is supporting the CFAHS and
the Directorate of Horticulture in these efforts.

99.      Improved rural and market infrastructures built under the PDMAS together
with increased organizational and managerial capacities combined with better
market information will enhance this movement. The PDMAS supported the
construction of rural collective platforms agricultural for products handling (Guia for
onions, Gouloumbou for banana, Bignona for fruits and vegetables). With these
infrastructures, innovative private management models were established with the
involvement of local stakeholders and producers for their operation and management. In
the livestock sector, local livestock markets (Dahara and Dinguiraye) are managed by the
local herders association. All managing entities received capacity building in management
capacities in order to ensure the durability of the operation of these infrastructures. The
Mbour slaughterhourse is also privately managed by a recruited management team
overseen by the management committee composed of the local butchers association and
the municipality. The development of these innovative management systems for collective
facilities is critical for their sustainability. At project closing, they already proved to be
efficient and successful. The national agency for roads management, Ageroute, is
responsible for the maintenance of rural access roads constructed as part of its national
mandate.

100. Developing sustainable commercial agriculture requires securing access to
land for all. The PDMAS experience in the Senegal River Delta with the development of
2,500 hectare in the rural commune of Diama, has highlighted the importance to adopt
inclusive land allocation models that put local communities at the center of the negotiation
process in order to reduce the risk of reticence from local communities. In an effort to
develop such models, the Government, together with the Bank, are implementing a
lease/sublease land allocation model which provides full rights to the communities
(through a land lease to the community) to enter into negotiations with investors based on
agreed expectations from both parties. This innovative land allocation model is evolving
as a new legislation that will secure access to land in the country by private operators. This
approach is being implemented under the Senegal Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness



                                             43
Development Project (SSIAP/PDIDAS). It is also being used as the foundation for ongoing
land reform consultations led by the National Land Reform Commission. The Government
has confirmed its full commitment to this approach through an inter-ministerial agreement
endorsed by the Senegalese Prime Minister.

101. To ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure, the
government established a maintenance fund for irrigation infrastructure in the
Senegal River Valley (FoMAED) and will use a similar approach with SODAGRI in
the Casamance. In the Sengal River region, SAED is responsible for the maintenance of
structural hydraulic infrastructures and maintenance of primary canals. With PDMAS,
support was provided for the elaboration of the National Plan for Irrigation Development
In addition an action plan for operation and maintenance of irrigation with detailed annual
program of activities infrastructures is being implemented. Before project closing, SAED
received maintenance funds allocations as part of their overall annual operational budget.
There was not good visibility of the use of funds for actual operation and maintenance
activities. In 2014, the government decided to allocate the O&M funds through a dedicated
budget line separate from SAED overall operational budget. This was done to ensure a
better monitoring and efficiency of these funds, in line with agreed annual programs of the
O&M action plan. This will contribute to improved sustainability of irrigation operations.
Water users’ associations were also set up to look after the tertiary canals linking their
fields to the irrigation system. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the 2014
allocation of CFAF1 billion (US$2 million) needs to be increased in the following years in
order to ensure that required annual O&M activities costs are fully covered. Further efforts
are also needed for fees recovery from water users associations. The latter often fail to
apply required sanctions to water users who do no remit their fees. Capacity building and
close monitoring of waters users associations are being conducted.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

102. In this section, the PDMAS, AFFS and PASAEL are not addressed separately as
the two AFs were always treated as additional components to the original PDMAS.

5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

103. Project preparation started under the PPEA and took into account all lessons
learned. The value chain approach and emphasis on PPPs that underlies this operation was
of strategic relevance. The project concept included several components and
subcomponents that were well chosen and mutually reinforcing. Environmental and
fiduciary aspects were appropriately dealt with and the executing agencies well chosen.
For an APL, the elaboration of the second phase with its triggers was rather general. The
two AFs were well prepared with the help of the PCU. The highly focused interventions
allowed for very short preparation periods.

104. Project preparation also benefited from knowledge, experience, and expertise
accrued under the pilot project, and technical assistance and funding from the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), complemented by a Project
Preparation Facility extended by the Bank. This resulted in: (i) high-quality analytical
support (including a long-term profile for Senegal horticultural exports, and an Agriculture
Markets Infrastructure Investment Plan); (ii) detailed feasibility and technical studies for
irrigation infrastructure in the Senegal River Delta; and (iii) food safety action plans for
horticulture and livestock, positioning the project for swift implementation.

105. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Marginally
Satisfactory. The project could have been readied for implementation by undertaking the
transfer to private management of agricultural export facilities at preparation stage and
avoided effectiveness conditions that delayed some activities’ implementation. Small-scale
farmers’ capacity to mobilize their contribution could have been better assessed at
preparation. Under AF2, the time was insufficient to inform the livestock component
indicator on expected productivity improvements at project closing.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
106. Implementation support missions were always appropriately staffed and had
the required specialists to supervise all fiduciary and safeguards policies. Some



                                            45
support missions concentrated on close supervision of specific topics and the third
supervision mission concentrated primarily on reviewing in depth all safeguards aspects.
Issues were identified, dealt with in a timely manner, and brought to management attention
for resolution as needed. The MTR dropped or reformulated some of the outcome and
output indicators by making sure that they were measurable and that what was measured
could be unequivocally attributed to the project. Supervision missions were also proactive
in realizing that FOS-F&L was no longer central to achieving project objectives.
Supervision of AF1 and AF2 was unproblematic as the PCU and the two executing
agencies were performing well.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

107. This project as designed was very ambitious and took a comprehensive
approach to agricultural market and export development. It introduced many far-
reaching technical and institutional innovations. As such, it marked a new beginning for
involving the private sector (different forms of PPPs) in the development of irrigated
agriculture and the production and export of horticultural products. AF1 and AF2 are well
designed and focused on solving one critical issue: how to increase rice production. Project
delays were outside the control of IDA.


5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

108. The government fully supported the project, addressed counterpart issues
when they arose, and did not interfere in the day-to-day management of the PCU.
Remarkably, it is funding the core PCU staff from its own resources until December 31,
2015. Its performance is nevertheless considered as “moderately satisfactory” for the
following reasons: (a) it took a long time to deal with and decide on covenants and issues
that affected project execution but were beyond the PCU’s scope or ability to handle; and
(b) its participation on the Steering Committee (which was supposed to validate yearly
reports, annual work plans, and budgets) was unsatisfactory as the Committee only met
once per year and attendees from the different ministries changed constantly and were not
sufficiently well-informed of project activities to provide oversight and useful advice to
the PCU.




                                            46
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies’ Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

109. The PCU was well staffed and had the necessary expertise to cover all technical,
fiduciary, safeguards, and monitoring aspects of the project. Its management was
competent and proactive, worked closely with IDA staff, and adhered to all relevant Bank
rules. The PCU always looked for ways to solve problems as they arose. The whole team
was remarkably stable, with very few staff changes. The project manager remained the
same from beginning to the end (i.e., over a nine-year period). Project reporting was regular,
clear, comprehensive, and transparent. SAED and SODAGRI, the irrigation agencies,
satisfactorily fulfilled their roles as executing agency for irrigation rehabilitation. ANCAR,
in charge of technical advice to beneficiaries, was overstretched, however.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
110. Based on the above, overall Borrower performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

111. Increasingly involving the private sector in irrigation development (especially with
innovative water-saving technologies) is key to achieve a commercial agriculture that is
competitive and able to reduce rice imports and to increase production and export of
nontraditional agricultural products. This also requires foremost resolving the issue of
access to land by “foreigners,” be they Senegalese from other parts of the country or
investors from abroad.


112. It is easier to build agricultural export facilities with project funds than to find
private entrepreneurs willing and capable to take them over and run them. This holds true
even when project management is aware of this fact and tries from the beginning to prepare
for handover.


113. Horticultural production and exports, especially in the greater Dakar area, are
situated in a fast-changing environment, where factors such as rapid urbanization and
relative costs of different modes of transport (air, sea, and road) can quickly change the
optimal location of export facilities and render some of them no longer useful or financially
viable.



                                             47
114. In the agricultural export sector, the relative strengths of different producer and
export organizations can change rapidly. Therefore, institutional arrangements can be
overtaken by events and must be constantly monitored so that adjustments can be made
accordingly in a timely manner.

115. In supporting agricultural exports, government policy must systematically and
periodically evaluate the following issues: (i) What is the degree of concentration among
exporting firms? Do small and medium-sized producers have equal access to the export
market? What would happen if one or two big exporters left the field for whatever reason?;
and (ii) Is the agricultural export regime benefitting to the maximum the national economy
in terms of value added, foreign exchange earnings, and employment generation?

116. The classical project set-up, with its institutional and implementation arrangements
consisting of Steering Committees (Comite de Pilotage – CP), a PCU, and implementing
agencies, is not a satisfactory solution if one seeks sustainable project outcomes. In most
cases, CPs do not play the role they are expected to as their members meet very infrequently,
change constantly, and are not well prepared or informed. The link with agricultural policy
making is often very weak and PCUs act in a policy vacuum. At a minimum, CPs should
have clear terms of reference and their members should be nominally selected.

117.     Projects that seek to introduce game-changing institutional and technical
innovations and that depend for their success on the buy-in of people who cannot be
identified in advance (auto-selection) must have a first-class, professional, interactive
communication strategy that uses all forms of media, including the internet, and from the
very beginning. And the public must be able to easily access updated information about
how to participate in the project, otherwise implementation delays are unavoidable.

118. Whenever assets are created through project investments, especially if they have to
be recreated through rehabilitation, the government must ensure that sound policies
regarding O&M are in place and operationalized and implemented on the ground.

119. Lessons learned from the PDMAS were critical in designing the Senegal
Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness Development Project (SSIAP/PDIDAS) for
better efficiency. The latter aims to promote inclusive commercial agriculture and
sustainable land management through investments in irrigation infrastructure and support
to the private sector, including small-scale-farmers. Matching grants mechanisms were
carefully adapted to targeted beneficiaries’ propensity to mobilize their contribution and
avoid delays in project implementation. An inclusive model in the land allocation process,
putting communities at the center of negotiations with large private investors, will reduce
the risk of reticence from local communities’ members. SSIAP/PDIDAS also puts a strong
emphasis on interactive communication and local community awareness.

(b) Co-financiers


120. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) recognized the
project as well-designed while highlighting weaknesses regarding ANCAR’s role in
providing support to farmers and collecting data for the M&E of innovative irrigation
tests/pilot activities. As previously noted in the ICR, ANCAR was overstretched during
project implementation. The agency suffered a serious loss of experienced staff through
the course of project execution as a result of weak salary incentives. This had a direct
impact on the coverage of quality advisory services and monitoring of activities in project
areas. In addition, a lack of coordination between actors (ANCAR, individual consultants,
beneficiaries, and equipment supply firms) was observed in the delivery and installation of
test irrigation equipment. Delays in input delivery and occasional mismatches between
acquired hydraulic equipment and required water pressure specifications led to the
implementation of tests the results of which could not be fully exploited. These issues were
promptly identified during supervision. In light of this, the MTR recommended to reduce
the number of planned irrigation tests and pilot activities carried out by ANCAR and to
only focus on sites that guaranteed tangible results. It was also recommended that ANCAR
develop more realistic budgets and work programs in line with its capacity while working
in partnership with existing institutions such as the Regional Directorates for Rural
Development and the Directorate for Basins of Retention and Artificial Lakes.

121. CIDA pointed out the delay in launching some program activities because of
complex administrative procedures and procurement processes. This relates to the
lengthy time observed to meet the effectiveness condition regarding the transfer to private
management of agricultural export facilities built under PPEA. In addition, delays in the
implementation of subprojects for small-scale farmers were observed given beneficiaries’
difficulty in mobilizing their contribution (initially set at 50 percent of subproject costs).
These issues were identified during implementation and remedial measures were
appropriately applied.

122. The Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development
(AECID) mentioned issues related to implementation of Component “Improvement
of Livestock Production in the Casamance.” In AECID’s view, subprojects were
overdesigned, with animal shelters sometimes built to better quality than that of
beneficiaries’ own lodging. The Bank believes that the good design of these infrastructures
should rather be commended, attesting to the quality of required technical specifications
and respect of these requirements by civil works firms. AECID also pointed out that
beneficiaries’ selection was left to locals themselves, which could have led to a biased


                                             49
selection based on political criteria. On the contrary, this approach ensured an inclusive
participation process within local communities. The PDMAS included a communication
and awareness campaign at local level with several workshops held in the targeted areas.

123. AECID perceived little coordination between the Livestock Directorate
(DIREL), the regional development agency, and the PDMAS. DIREL was the executing
agency in charge of implementing field activities at regional level for the livestock
component. Implementation arrangements were agreed between the PDMAS PCU and the
regional Directorates of Livestock. These conventions guided the execution of vaccination
campaigns and infrastructure constructions under the supervision of the PDMAS livestock
expert. Meanwhile, the PCU was responsible for all fiduciary matters related to these
activities. All of these required constant interaction between the PCU and DIREL. It
naturally implied a strong coordination between the two agencies, and therefore the two
line ministries.

124. AECID expressed that its contribution to the project was not made sufficiently
explicit and that the agency was not given adequate recognition for its financing.
AECID was interested in participating more actively in project supervision missions
involving its technical staff in Dakar. It should be noted that PASAEL was funded through
the Food Price Crisis Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund (FPCR MDTF) under the Global
Food Response Program Facility (GFRP). Contributions to the FPCR MDTF were received
from Australia (AUD 50 million), Spain (€80 million), Korea (Korean won 3 billion),
Canada (CAD 30 million), and the International Finance Corporation (US$0.15 million).
Senegal was a recipient of the Spain financing window as one of the 10 eligible ECOWAS
(Economic Community of West African States) countries.

     Annex 2. Outputs by Component for the PDMAS, AFFS, AND PASAEL


1. PDMAS Financing ‒ US$35.0 million

  1. Component A: Improving Domestic Marketing Conditions (TPC US$10.10
   million, IDA US$6.35 million) aimed at improving food safety and the performance
   of domestic distribution channels for crop and livestock products. Subcomponents
   were: (i) domestic supply chain consolidation; (ii) construction of rural infrastructure;
   (iii) knowledge management; and (iv) development of animal products markets. The
   degree of achievement of intermediate outcome indicators as revised under PASAEL
   for Component A was as follows:

No. Intermediate Outcome Indicator                              Target          Actual
1   At least five subprojects for each of the five                45             247
    targeted supply chains in the domestic market
    have been funded through the Matching Grant
    mechanism and implemented
2   3,500 tons of quality meat (red meat and                    3,500            5,553
    poultry) are produced and sold

  2. Innovative business models were introduced and three categories of subprojects
   funded: (i) commercial partnership projects; (ii) irrigation subprojects; and (iii)
   livestock subprojects. Nine value chains were supported: bananas (19), green beans (4),
   mangoes (11), onions (66), tomatoes (49), sweet potato, red meat (139), poultry (8),
   and processed foods (5). All subprojects were selected by regional selection
   committees and underwent a technical and financial feasibility study as well as
   environmental screening.

  3. Several drying, cold storage, and rural produce collection centers (Poles agricoles
   logistiques et de mise en marche – PALMM) were built to handle horticultural products.
   In the livestock sector, food safety of animal products was improved through
   construction of a modern slaughterhouse in Mbour and elimination of unsupervised
   slaughter of animals. Meat production was increased through implementation of
   livestock subprojects.

  4. Component B: Development of Agricultural Exports (TPC US21.35 million,
   IDA US$12.02 million) aimed at expanding nontraditional agricultural exports by
   leveraging the results achieved under the pilot AEPP. Subcomponents were: (i)
   innovation and quality management; (ii) agricultural export infrastructure; and (iii)
   building agricultural export institutions. The degree of achievement of intermediate
   outcome indicators as revised under PASAEL for Component B was as follows:




                                            52
No. Intermediate Outcome Indicator                              Target           Actual

    EC No. 1148-2001

 5. In addition to the above achievements under this component, the PDMAS
  supported renewal of the certification of Ceres Locustox (a chemical laboratory) to
  monitor pesticide residues to ensure that Senegalese horticultural products are admitted
  onto international markets. To support the certification of private exporters, the project
  produced various tools, namely: a registry of all exporters of fruits; a database that
  allows the origin of products to be traced; and a manual on SeneGAP for smallholders
  that is benchmarked with EuroGAP to allow exports to the European Union. Also, three
  centers of innovation and training for horticultural and nontraditional crops in key
  regions were created using existing training infrastructure. In addition, as part of its
  efforts to build agricultural export institutions, the PCU supported FOS-F&L and a
  cooperative that represents all horticultural producers - Cooperative Federative des
  Agriculteurs de l’Horticulture (CFAHS). Finally, the PDMAS produced a whole series
  of agricultural extension and communication materials, covering such topics as: good
  phytosanitary practices, how to fight fruit flies and termites, quality characteristics of
  onions, bananas, and other topics.

 6. Component C: Development of Private Irrigation (TPC US$23.00 million, IDA
  US$11.57 million) aimed at promoting demand-driven, pro-poor investments in
  irrigation to support the expansion of agribusiness across Senegal. Subcomponents
  were: (i) construction of public irrigation infrastructure in the Senegal River Delta; (ii)
  promotion of irrigation for crop diversification in the Senegal River Delta; (iii)
  promotion of micro-irrigation for crop diversification in the Niayes zone; and (iv)
  knowledge management and strategic studies. The degree of achievement of
  intermediate outcome indicators as revised under PASAEL for Component C was as
  follows:

No. Intermediate Outcome Indicator                              Target           Actual
1   At least 2,500 ha have been developed or                    2,500            4,062

    costs are recovered from project beneficiaries
3   No. of km of canals constructed                               49                52

 7. Of the originally planned 2,500 hectares of innovative irrigation schemes, mainly
  with drip irrigation adapted to the business plans of smallholders, SMEs, and


                                            53
   agribusiness enterprises, not all were fully covered with equipment paid under the
   matching grant scheme. The establishment cost per hectare was higher than originally
   estimated and the contribution of smallholder beneficiaries had to be revised downward
   from 50 percent to 20 percent. Distribution of these newly developed irrigated areas
   was a complicated and lengthy process. Villagers that applied were given priority
   access to irrigation fields and outsiders (from within and outside Senegal) were only
   granted access once applications by locals had been satisfied. Even so, the relationship
   between locals and newcomers was tense at times. Overcoming these land tenure issues
   is one of, if not the most, critical limiting factors to private irrigation development in
   Senegal. The PDMAS carried out a series of strategic studies as originally planned.

  8. Component D: Project Coordination and M&E (TPC US$4.45 million, IDA
   US$3.86 million) had the following two subcomponents: (i) project management and
   coordination; and (ii) monitoring and evaluation. The PCU carried out all of its duties
   in a professional manner and respected all fiduciary and safeguards obligations.

2. Additional Financing 1 (AFFS) - US$10 million

  9. Component A: Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes in the Senegal River
   Valley (US$8.0 million) was added to the PDMAS under AFFS. The intermediate
   outcome indicator chosen was “No. of hectares of irrigated area rehabilitated for rice
   production,” with a target of 7,000 ha. By the end of the project, 6,964 ha were
   rehabilitated, or nearly 100 percent of the original target.

  10. Component B: Promotion of Intensive Rice Production in the Bignona Valley
   (US$2.0 million) was included under AFFS to enhance rice production in the Bignona
   Valley through exploitation of desalinated lands protected by the anti-salt dam of
   Affiniam. The intermediate outcome indicator chosen was “Number of meters of water
   catchment dikes constructed,” with a target of 7,500 meters. This component could not
   be implemented on time due to procurement issues. A candidate firm not selected for
   execution of the works contested the procurement process, which awarded the works
   contract to another firm. This triggered a long arbitration process involving the national
   contract regulation agency (Agence de Régulation des Marchés Publiques- ARMP) in
   which the Bank procurement team advised the Bank not to interfere. ARMP’s final
   decision was to relaunch the bidding process from the beginning despite the
   approaching closing date of the project six months later. This ultimately stopped the
   dam works from being executed. However, all detailed feasibility studies were
   completed and can be readily used if the government and/or other partners’ financings
   are available.

3. Additional Financing 2 (PASAEL) - US$20 million

  11. Component A: Promotion of Intensive Rice Production in the Senegal River
   Valley and the Anambé Basin (US$17.1 million) aimed at supporting rehabilitation
   of small-scale irrigation perimeters and improvement of domestic rice marketing




                                            54
   conditions in project areas. The degree of achievement of intermediate outcome
   indicators for this component was as follows:

 No. Intermediate Outcome Indicator                             Target           Actual
 1   No. of ha of irrigated area rehabilitated                  7,400            7,400
     in Senegal River Valley
 2   No. of ha or irrigated area rehabilitated                   3,180            3,380
     in Anambé Basin

12.   The irrigation perimeters were rehabilitated as planned and the needed motor
pumps and agricultural equipment delivered.

13.      Component B: Improvement of Livestock Production in the Casamance
(US$2.1 million) aimed at providing support to the national livestock production capacity
in the Ziguinchor and Sedhiou regions of the Casamance. The project provided support to:
(i) restock the livestock population; (ii) expand existing animal health and disease control
programs; and (iii) provide essential infrastructure, including enhanced farm animal
housing. The project outcome indicators chosen were productivity increases for small
ruminants (20 percent) and pigs (40 percent) in targeted farms at the end of the project. The
activities were carried out as planned; i.e., a vaccination campaign was carried out and
subprojects for livestock production were financed.

14.    Component C: Support to Project Coordination and Implementation (US$0.8
million), under which the PCU carried out all its duties in a professional manner and
respected all fiduciary and safeguards obligations.




                                             55
                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.       Summary. The PDMAS aimed to increase nontraditional agriculture and livestock
production as well as enhance the quality of production in targeted zones. While ex-ante
studies were conducted in 2006 and 2010, this annex assesses the PDMAS’s impacts ex-
post, after eight years of project implementation. The treatment effect approach is used in
conjunction with a cost-benefit analysis, assuming that trends observed before the project
would continue and comparing those to the actual trends observed with the project. The
overall calculated economic internal rate of return (ERR) for the project was 34 percent for
the period 2007-2014, assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 17 percent. The net
present value (NPV) was CFAF 42 billion (US$84 million), or 30 percent more than the
initial investments over the eight-year project life. Thus the project was a satisfactory use
of funds vis-à-vis alternative investment options. Calculated at market prices, the financial
internal rate of return (IRR) was 25 percent, with a NPV of CFAF 35 billion (US$70
million), or CFAF 2.9 billion more than the initial investment. These indicators
demonstrate the project’s economic and financial soundness.

A. Main Assumptions for Project Benefits

2.      Area considered for project benefits. PDMAS interventions areas consisted of
the Senegal River Valley, the Anambé basin, the Casamance region, the Gouloumbou area,
the Niayes zone and the Groundnut Basin. Interviews were conducted with project
beneficiaries in the targeted zones in order to collect on-farm data. Data were collected
from a stratified sample of 180 beneficiaries or 30 beneficiaries (small-scale and medium)
by intervention areas. The questionnaire focused on induced effects of project interventions,
such as increases in cropped area, livestock herds, productivity and production,
diversification in farm activities, production costs, labor costs, project-supported
investments, irrigation water use and fees, products market prices. For each of the main
farming activities, farm budgets were elaborated before and after project. Farming
activities included mainly rice and vegetable cropping in the Senegal River valley, rice in
the Anambe Basin, livestock in the Casamance, banana in the Gouloumbou area,
vegetables in the Niayes and cereals and vegetables in the Groundnut basin. Similarly, a
sample of 5 to 10 non-beneficiaries involved in the same activities as sampled project
beneficiaries were interviewed in each intervention area on their activities for the last seven
years. Data at local on farming activities 7-year market level were also collected during
field visits.

3.      Project costs. All project investment costs were included in the analysis. In the
Senegal River Valley, the project aimed to promote private investment and small-scale
farming of nontraditional crops on 2,400 hectares. Out of this, 600 hectares were allocated
to small-scale family farms that benefited from matching grants up to 80 percent of their
installation costs, 500 hectares to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with matching
grants up to 50 percent, and 500 hectares to large agribusiness firms. The rest of the
perimeter was developed by individual operators without direct support from the project.
In addition, 7,000 hectares and 7,400 hectares of irrigated rice perimeters were developed
under the two additional financings (AFs), respectively. Total hydraulic infrastructure costs


                                             56
and matching grants costs in this area were estimated at CFAF 17 billion, of which 3.9
billion were for the first AF and CFAF 5.8 billion for the second AF for rice production.
In the Anambé basin, the cost of rehabilitation of 3,180 hectares for rice production was
estimated at CFAF 2.7 billion. In the Niayes zone, project costs were estimated at CFAF
5.4 billion for the construction of boreholes and the financing of drip irrigation subprojects
over 30 hectares for small-scale and medium producers. In the Gouloumbou area, the
project supported the rehabilitation of rural access roads, the construction of a banana
storage platform, and the financing of drip irrigation subprojects for small-scale farmers
for a total cost of CFAF 1.8 billion. In Casamance, project costs were estimated at CFAF
1.96 billion for the promotion of small ruminants, swine, and poultry rearing. Project
investments in the Groundnut Basin were estimated at CFAF 388 million for small-scale
farmers’ subprojects and 474 million for irrigation infrastructure.

4.     Cropping intensities and agricultural production. Estimated incremental crop
productions due to the project, as well incremental livestock production, are shown in Table
A3.1 and Table A3.2.

5.     Prices. The financial and economic prices used in the project analysis were based
on 2015 constant prices. Farm budgets and incomes were based on prevailing market prices.
However, the economic prices of traded goods and production factors were deflated using
the prevailing Manufacture Unit Value Index (MUV).

6.      Farm incomes. The financial and economic analysis was based on farm budgets.
Two farm models, small- and medium-scale farms, were used for the analysis in each
project intervention area. In the Senegal River Valley, a small-scale farm consists of an
average 0.5 hectares of rice and 1.5 hectares of nontraditional crops. A medium-size farm
covers 1.5 hectares of rice and 2.5 hectares of nontraditional crops. In this area, rice is
cropped during the rainy season while tomato and onion are the main nontraditional crops
planted in the cold dry season. In the Anambé Basin, the models take into account rice
production, with 0.5 hectares for small-scale producers and 1 hectare for medium producers.
For the Niayes zone, key crops targeted by the project are cabbage, green bean, and tomato.
Farm sizes average 1.25 hectares and 2.5 hectares for small- and medium-scale producers,
respectively. In the Gouloumbou area, small farms average 0.25 hectare of banana while
medium size farms average 1 hectare. In the Groundnut Basin, small farms consist of 0.25
hectares of vegetables and 2 hectares of cereals. Medium-size farms comprise 0.5 hectares
of vegetables and 4 hectares of cereals. In the Casamance region, livestock production is
characterized by small farms with an average of 5 small ruminants, 3 swine, and 20 poultry
birds and medium farms with 10 small ruminants and swine and 50 poultry birds. Gross
revenues and production costs were computed by using the commodity prices at farmgate
or at nearest market point of sale or purchase.

7.      In the targeted areas, PDMAS investments proved to be profitable at farm
level. Net margins varied depending on the area and type of investment, as follows:

8.      In the Senegal River Valley, small rice farmers earned an average net income of
CFAF 331,000/ha and medium-size producers up to CFAF 393,000/ha. The beneficiaries
of these public investments increased their production area due to the availability and flow
of water through PDMAS interventions. Small- and medium-size rice producers gained an
additional net operating income of CFAF 166,000 and CFAF 216,000, respectively, during
the rice cropping season.

9.     Investments in crop diversification schemes in the Senegal River Valley
provided a net income of between CFAF 3.3-3.7 million/ha for small- and medium-size
onion producers and CFAF 688-705,000/ha for tomato producers. This induced an
additional gain in net income of CFAF 1.3 million and CFAF 1.4 million for small- and
medium-size farmers in this area, respectively.

10.     On small-scale irrigation in the Senegal River Valley, medium-size farmers’
high-valued crops earned an average income of CFAF 3 million, with an operating cost of
CFAF 125/kg. With a potential cultivated area of 500 ha each, medium-sized producers
collectively earned CFAF 1.5 billion, and produced a value added of CFAF 2.7 billion,
paying labor wages of nearly CFAF 246 million per year. Small producers cultivated
mainly tomatoes and onions, and earned an average annual income of CFAF 975,000 with
an operating cost of CFAF 46/kg per year. On an assumed potential of 600 ha each, small
producers produced a total income of CFAF 585 million and generated CFAF 1.5 billion
in value added, paying CFAF 165 million in wages annually. Overall, PDMAS investments
in the Senegal River Valley generated CFAF 2 billion in income and CFAF 4.2 billion of
value added per year, an impressive outcome given that the land in this area was previously
undeveloped.

11.     In the Anambé Basin, the PDMAS induced an increase in small and medium-size
rice farmers’ cultivated area from 462 ha in 2013 to 956 ha in 2014. The net margin was
CFAF 189,000 per year for small farmers and CFAF 247,000 for medium-size farmers.
This induced an additional gain in net operating income of CFAF 100,000 and CFAF
138,000 for small and medium-size rice farmers, respectively. Thus, both models remained
profitable but had relatively low margins.

12.      In Niayes, the PDMAS introduced not yet operational drilling and small-scale
irrigation, which generated a net operating income of CFAF 828,000 for small producers.
All small producers combined generated CFAF 39 million in value added and paid wages
for labor of CFAF 1.5 million per year. Medium-size farmers earned CFAF 2 million
producing bean and onion crops on an average 2.5 ha each. The combined induced value
added was CFAF 67 million, with CFAF 5 million paid for wages.

13.    In the Gouloumbou area, small banana producers had a net margin of CFAF
381,000 per year, or a gain of CFAF 131,000 over the “without project” situation. All small
producers combined earned CFAF 5.7 million of income and produced an overall value



                                            59
added of CFAF 60 million, while generating CFAF 4.2 million in wages. Medium-size
producers in Gouloumbou area received a net margin of CFAF 610,000, with an induced
additional net income of CFAF 200,000. Together, medium-sized producers generated
CFAF 69 million in added value and paid CFAF 4.8 million in wages.

14.    In the Casamance, small husbandry farmers earned an income of CFAF 217,500,
with an additional net profit of CFAF 162,000 compared to the “without project” situation.
Together, these smallholders earned CFAF 22 million with an added value of CFAF 122
million. Medium-size producers received an annual net margin of CFAF 845,000. All
medium-size livestock holders combined earned a net margin of CFAF 84 million and
generated an added value of CFAF 241 million.

15.     In the Groundnut Basin, smallholders’ net income averaged CFAF 87,000 versus
CFAF 108,000 for medium-size producers. Although the individual annual margin was
low, all beneficiaries combined earned CFAF 9 million in net income, produced CFAF 12
million of cash flow, and created CFAF 128 million in value added to the sector.

B. Economic and Financial Analysis

16.    The project’s investments were profitable at the scale of local economies,
although they could have been higher if some achievements had not experienced
administrative bottlenecks in implementation:
      Of all target areas, the Senegal River Valley recorded the highest ERR (57 percent)
       and an NPV of CFAF 21 billion (US$42 million). This performance is due to
       several forms of project interventions since 2007, including a strong rice self-
       sufficiency program and diversification of vegetable production in irrigated areas
       and small-scale irrigation in areas that were historically rainfed.
      With two years of activity on realized project investments, Anambé Basin
       produced a financial IRR of 21 percent and an ERR of 30 percent. Its economic
       NPV exceeds by 31 percent initial investments of CFAF 2.7 billion.
      In Gouloumbou Basin, investments in banana induced an ERR of 32 percent. The
       NPV was CFAF 2.6 billion (US$5.3 million), relative to an initial investment of
       CFAF 1.8 billion.
      The financial IRR of the Niayes zone is 25 percent and the ERR 31 percent. The
       zone’s economic NPV was 32 percent over initial investments. Although the
       achievements associated with drilling have not yet materialized, PDMAS
       interventions on small-scale irrigation and institutional quality support in Niayes
       zone have already induced a satisfactory level of performance.
      In the Casamance, the ERR was estimated to be 46 percent. The NPV was CFAF
       2.9 billion. The Casamance produced the lowest ERR (24 percent) on the livestock
       sector, but this is largely satisfactory given the assumed opportunity cost of capital
       of 17 percent. Thus, on an initial investment of CFAF 1.5 billion, the Casamance
       realized a NPV of CFAF 2.4 billion (US$4.9 million). The project’s soundness in
       this region could have been higher had the anti-salt dams for rice intensification not
       been stopped for procurement procedure problems.
      In the Groundnut Basin, the CFAF 2.7 billion of investments in small-scale
       irrigation and market infrastructure subprojects induced a 25 percent ERR and NPV
       of CFAF 3.7 billion (US$4.9 million).

Annex 4. Trends in Horticultural Exports from Senegal and the Role of PDMAS

                                       (2000 – 2014)

1.      Horticultural exports from Senegal are a relatively recent phenomenon. Until 2000,
horticultural exports totaled less than 9,000 tons, mostly green beans and cherry tomatoes,
and only one or two exporting companies operated. This started to change with the World
Bank-financed Agricultural Export Promotion Project (AEPP) and exports accelerated
under the Agricultural Markets and Agribusiness Development Project (PDMAS). The
PDMAS influenced government policies towards the sector and created a conducive
environment for international companies to start producing horticultural products for
export.

2.       The project put in place a whole series of measures that encouraged small and
medium-scale producers to get involved in horticultural production for internal and
external markets. These measures included inter alia improving domestic marketing
conditions such as construction of rural infrastructure for drying, cold storage, and produce
collection centers. It also included construction of agricultural export infrastructures and
building of agricultural export institutions. In addition, the PDMAS provided market
intelligence and supported the renewal of the certification of Ceres Locustox (a chemical
laboratory) to monitor pesticide residues to ensure that Senegalese horticultural products
are admitted onto international markets. To support the certification of private exporters,
the PDMAS produced various tools, namely: a registry of all exporters of fruits; a database
that allows the origin of products to be traced; and a manual on SeneGAP for smallholders
that is benchmarked with EuroGAP to allow exports to the European Union. In addition,
as part of its effort to build agricultural export institutions, the project supported the
Fondation Origine Sénégal-Fruits et Légumes (FOS-F&L) and a cooperative that
represents all horticultural producers – Coopérative Fédérative des Agriculteurs de
l’Horticulture (CFAHS).

3.      At the same time, the PDMAS promoted development of irrigation schemes,
especially private irrigation, to support the expansion of agribusinesses across Senegal.
This irrigation development also benefitted large commercial exporters as it gave them
access to year-round irrigation. Without investments in irrigation development, especially
the promotion of micro-irrigation (drip irrigation) for crop diversification, exports of
horticultural crops would not have taken off.

4.      The interplay of (i) big commercial firms’ increased production and export of
horticultural products given the favorable policy environment and (ii) PDMAS investments
that encouraged small and medium-sized producers to join in this endeavor led to a
dramatic increase in horticultural exports. Over the period 2000 to 2014, the volume of
horticultural exports increased nine-fold, from 9,300 tons in 2000 to 81,600 tons in 2014
(an annual increase of 17 percent).

Figure A4.1 shows the rise in exports of horticultural products to Europe between 2000-
2014:

                                    (in tons)




5.      More specifically, the average annual increase in volume of horticultural exports to
Europe between 2000–2014 was:
   ‐    14 percent for cherry tomatoes
   ‐    29 percent for melons
   ‐    32 percent for sweet corn (since 2005)
   ‐    4 percent for green beans
   ‐    Significantly diversified in 2014 with the appearance of butternut squash (1,900
   tons), green onions (1,960 tons), and radishes (1,000 tons).

6.     The value of horticultural exports to Europe in 2014 was estimated at €75 million
(CAF). The main horticultural products exported in order of importance were: melons and
watermelons; cherry tomatoes; sweet corn; and green beans. Particularly noteworthy is the
increase in mango exports by 25 percent in 2014 to reach 10,200 tons.




                                            69
7.      In addition to exports to Europe, Senegal exported horticultural products to the
regional market. In 2014/15, some 4,740 tons of fruits and vegetables were exported to the
subregion (Mauritania, Morocco, and Ivory Coast). The main export crops for the
subregion were cabbage (2,000 tons), squash (770 tons), carrots (740 tons), onions (610
tons), sweet potatoes (410 tons), and watermelon (118 tons).

8.      According to data from the PDMAS M&E system, in 2014 25,530 tons (31 percent)
of Senegal’s total exports of horticultural products of 81,600 tons came from producers
directly supported by the PDMAS. These beneficiaries were supported through matching
grants for subprojects, extension advice, provision of market intelligence, introduction of
improved irrigation techniques, export certification, and improved market infrastructure.
While some 80 percent of horticultural exports are handled by four big exporters, the
number of smaller exporters is increasing and with it the ease of access of smaller producers
to export markets. With an export growth rate for horticultural products of +/- 10 percent
per year, Senegal should be able to export 100,000 tons by 2017.

1. Introduction

The PDMAS was implemented over the 2007-2015 period. It benefited from two cycles of
national sector policies characterized by: (i) the National Economic and Social
Development Strategy (Strategie Nationale de Développement Economique et Social-
SNDES), the Agriculture Forestry and Livestock Orientation Law (Loi d’Orientation Agro-
Sylvo-Pastorale -LOASP), and the Accelerated Growth Strategy; and (ii) The Emerging
Senegal Plan (Plan Sénégal Emergent-PSE).

The PSE provides a comprehensive framework for efficient public policies through which
the national strategy in the horticulture sector aims: (i) to reach onion self-sufficiency by
2016 with a local production of 350,000 tons; and (ii) to promote the development of off-
season fruits and vegetables with an export target of 157,000 tons.

The PDMAS contributed to this objective with a target of nontraditional exports of 12,000
tons by 2015. The project aimed to promote investments as well as public-private
partnerships (PPPs) for innovation in the agriculture sector at the national level. Specific
objectives were to: (i) improve the competitiveness and diversification of agricultural and
livestock products with high added value; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of producers,
namely small-scale farmers, to sustainably enter promising national, regional, and
international markets to generate durable incomes.

2. Project description

The project consisted of the following seven components:
‐       Component A: Improving Domestic Marketing Conditions, which aims at
improving food safety and the performance of the domestic distribution channels for crop
and livestock products.
‐       Component B: Development of Agricultural Exports, which aims at expanding
nontraditional agricultural exports and leveraging the results achieved under the pilot
AEPP.
‐       Component C: Development of Private Irrigation, which aims at promoting
demand-driven, pro-poor investments in irrigation to support the expansion of agribusiness
across Senegal.
‐       Component D: Project Coordination and M&E, which comprises the following
two subcomponents: (i) Project Management and Coordination; and (ii) Monitoring and
Evaluation.
‐       Component E: Rehabilitation of Irrigation Perimeters in the Senegal River
Valley and the Anambé Basin, which aims to rehabilitate: (i) 7,000 ha in the Senegal
River Valley under the National Rice Self-sufficiency Program; (ii) 7,400 ha in the Senegal
River Valley; and (iii) 3,380 ha in the Anambé Basin under the PASAEL.
‐       Component F: Promotion of Intensive Rice Production in the Bignona Valley,
which aims to enhance rice production in the Bignona Valley through the exploitation of
desalinated lands protected by the anti-salt dam of Affiniam.



                                             73
‐      Component G: Improvement of Livestock Production in the Casamance,
which aims to provide support to the national livestock production capacity in the
Ziguinchor and Sedhiou regions of the Casamance.

4. Institutional assessment




                                           74
The project management structure was composed of: (i) a Steering Committee (SC),
chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment (MAER) and composed of
different ministries and state agencies, as well as representatives of farmers' organizations;
(ii) a Project Coordination Unit (PCU); and (iii) implementing agencies (SAED ANCAR).
In addition, four Regional Selection Committees (CRS) were established in each project
area (Niayes, Senegal River Valley, Groundnut Basin/Casamance). In some specific areas,
the PCU collaborated with other partners, such as associations of exporters/producers, the
Directorate of Livestock, Veterinary Services Directorate, the Directorate of Plant
Protection, CERES/LOCUSTOX, SONES, the Directorate of Rural Engineering, the
Senegalese Agency for Export Promotion (ASEPEX), and the Agency for Investment
Promotion (APIX).

The PCU was well-organized and efficient. The PCU was well managed until the end of
the project with committed staff, who even stayed after project closing, some without
salaries, to oversee final project coordination activities. The project was audited in the
second quarter of 2014 by a mission of the State General Inspectorate (IGE) and the Court
of Accounts of Senegal. The Bank’s financial management team conducted a thorough
supervision mission from September 22-26, 2014, that included a review of project
financial transactions, field visits to meet with project beneficiaries and implementing
agencies, and tours of facilities built under the project (CRIQ of Ndiaye in St-Louis and
PALMM of Guia in Podor). The Bank’s conclusions were overall positive and confirmed
the borrower’s positive perception of PDMAS achievements. In the borrower’s opinion,
the project contributed to the structural and socioeconomic transformation of Senegal’s
rural areas in line with Axis 1 of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE).

5. Project results

End-of-project performance indicators show a strong project performance. Indeed,
with regard to the overall objective of increasing nontraditional horticultural exports in the
project areas, the planned target of 12,000 tons was by far exceeded, with a completion rate
of 141 percent. The overall target of national onion consumption coverage by 75 percent
was achieved at 93 percent. The banana supply chain coverage increased 140 percent
(compared to the target of 50 percent). With regard to the target of increased annual paddy
production of 52,000 tons at the end of the project, the achievement rate was far beyond,
at 232 percent. In 2014, a record production of 86,660 tons was observed. Double cropping
of rice paddy is becoming a reality in the region with the construction and operation of
structural infrastructure such as the Krankaye Canal.

Marketing conditions have largely improved. Indeed, it was expected that at least five
subprojects of each targeted supply chain in the domestic market would be funded by the
matching grant mechanism and implemented. By December 2013, no less than 247
subprojects had been funded, for an achievement rate of 391 percent. By December 2014,
the achievement rate was 549 percent. Targeted supply chains were: bananas, green beans,
mango, onion, sweet potato, tomato, red meat, poultry, and processed foods (dried banana,
dried mango, and dried tomato). An achievement rate of 159 percent was observed in
additional quality meat marketed (red meat and poultry). It was also expected that at least



                                             75
one-third of beneficiary producers would implement the Good Agricultural Practices Guide
"Origin Senegal" based on Global Gap standards. In 2014, approximately 881 producers
were using the Good Agricultural Practices and other precision irrigation guides.
Furthermore, the target volume of 14,000 tons of certified agricultural export products in
compliance with EC Directive No. 1148- 2001 was largely exceeded, with 67,720 tons of
fruits and vegetables exported to Europe in 2014. By adding exports of fruits and
vegetables to the region (squash, onions, and mangoes), the achievement rate reached 665
percent, with 93,000 tons.

With regard to private irrigation development, the total number of hectares
developed for horticulture production far exceeded the target of 2,500 ha (at 4,062
ha). Overall maintenance of irrigation perimeters remains an issue, however. The MAER
is closely monitoring the situation. For this, an interministerial decree establishing the
FOMAED (Adductors and Drainage Canals Maintenance Fund) was signed and an
operator hired to assist the government in implementing the Action Plan for maintenance
of irrigation infrastructures in the Delta and the Senegal River Valley. Meanwhile, 52 km
of linear canals were created or rehabilitated. Major adductors were also recalibrated in the
Senegal River Valley, in Lampsar (24 km) and Gorom Aval (8 km). In terms of
rehabilitation of rice perimeters, 6,963.59 ha were rehabilitated, for an achievement rate of
99.5 percent. With regard to intensive rice cultivation in the Bignona Valley, technical
feasibility studies of the first phase were finalized but works for the development of 1,000
ha of irrigated land could not be completed as a results of a procurement-based complaint
and a long arbitration process that cancelled the contract award. The target of 7,500 meters
of water catchment was not achieved (0 percent).

6. Economic and financial analysis

ISRA/BAME conducted an impact analysis of the PDMAS’s economic and financial
profitability, using a “before” and “after project” approach. The economic internal rate of
return (ERR) was estimated at 30 percent by 2013 and 42 percent by the end of the project
in 2014, with a net present value (NPV) of CFAF 7.4 billion by 2013 and CFAF 9.4 billion
in 2014. The financial internal rate of return (IRR) was 31 percent by 2013 and 49 percent
by 2014, with a NPV of 1.8 billion CFAF by 2013 and CFAF 741 million by 2014. These
rates of return are well above the opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent used.

At the horticultural farm level, with the adoption of new improved irrigation
technology, the rate of return was estimated at 24 percent with an NPV of CFAF 2.3
billion for the duration of the project. These figures vary depending on the farm type
(area and amount of funding). The average IRR for small and large producers was
estimated at 26 percent. These indicators show the attractiveness of the investments
compared to the opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent in the agriculture sector.

These results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the PDMAS’s financial and
economic investments in the horticultural industry. In addition to increasing production
and productivity, project investments led to an increase in producers’ incomes and overall
profitability. The investments were also financially profitable from the point of view of the



                                             76
individual farm. In other words, the PDMAS produced an efficient use of national
resources with the generation of national income produced through its various components.

7. Project impact

Project overall impacts stem from the overall vision of structural transformation of
PDMAS. The economic and financial impact is largely presented above. The improved
access to remote production areas through the construction of rural roads, and more access
to existing markets, has significantly improved the lives of rural population. The
establishment of storage and marketing infrastructure has opened a path toward agricultural
modernization through the horticultural sub-sector.

8. Conclusions and lessons learned

On the managerial level, the professionalism and commitment of the PCU team must
be noted. The team’s commitment did not fail at any time, even after project closing and
even when wages were not paid for some time.

The main lesson learned is the need to focus on sustainable models that the Government
of Senegal, through its decentralized structures, must implement to preserve all physical
investments made.
    (i)    With regard to the maintenance of large hydraulic structures in the Senegal
           River Delta and Anambé Basin, as well as primary and secondary canals, the
           establishment of endowment funds seems unavoidable.
    (ii)   For the maintenance of tertiary canals, management modalities should be
           discussed with the concerned water users’ projects.
    (iii) The FOS-F&L is still slow to take on its role in the sector. An urgent need exists
           for the MAER to play an arbitration role and assess the measures to be taken to
           unlock the situation.
    (iv)   Rehabilitation of the network Beer Thialane was made possible with PDMAS
           funding, but the irrigation remains unused due to the absence of a management
           entity. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Water Resources has planned, pending the
           recruitment of the entity responsible for managing the complex, to entrust the
           network’s management to the SDE to allow the exploitation of targeted areas.

Key observations regarding procedures and deadlines relate to: (i) the excessive length
of bidding processes (between 4-6 months); (ii) the difficulty in using national procedures
on donors’ procurement methods, illustrating the need to harmonize them; (iii) the
unilateral management of complaints, particularly those from candidate firms, by the
Dispute Resolution Committee of ARMP. It is essential to listen to both parties to decide
cases in a fair and transparent manner and to mitigate abuse of the dispute resolution
mechanism.

Canadian International Development Agency - CIDA
1. In CIDA’s view, the project was well designed. The situational analysis was
   pertinent, research and development activities were appropriate, and irrigation
   test/pilot activities on a large scale were also sensible. They highlighted the
   following weaknesses: (i) the execution of some of the components was not very
   satisfactory; (ii) advice and support to farmers at the local level did not work very
   well; (iii) ANCAR extension agents did not perform as expected as they did not
   collect the information necessary to evaluate the tests that were carried out; (iv) the
   program was put in place too slowly, in part because of the complicated
   administrative procedures to access funding for subprojects and the procurement
   rules.

2. CIDA raised the issue of rapid urbanization of the Niayes vegetable-growing zones
   at early stage of the project. Concerning FELTIPLEX and the Gare de Fret, they
   felt that support to these two facilities made sense. They also highlighted the
   problems of water availability and O&M in the Anambé Basin. It was suggested
   that a national plan for O&M of irrigation perimeters together with a procedures
   manual be prepared. In light of these weaknesses, they believe that the project’s
   impact was good but could have been greater.

French Development Agency- AfD
3. AfD expressed a positive opinion of the project, highlighting the approach taken by
   the Bank concerning the co-financing mechanism with project beneficiaries.
   Previously, things were done “clé a main” and beneficiaries did not contribute
   anything. AfD is now following the project model in its own irrigation project along
   the Senegal River, where it introduced subsidies based on categories of
   beneficiaries. They indicated that the support to vegetable growing makes sense
   and results are visible. Senegal is exporting more and the production has become
   more abundant, diversified, and accessible to Senegalese consumers. They lauded
   the introduction of new technologies (drip irrigation) and new varieties. Finally,
   they expressed their conviction that plenty of opportunities still exist for
   agricultural export promotion in Senegal.

Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development - AECID

4. AECID financed the Food Security and Livestock Support Project (PASAEL).
   Comments focused on observed weaknesses of the project:

   a)     Subprojects were overdesigned and expensive. For instance, pig shelters
   included zinc roofs and cement walls for pork, which may tempt beneficiaries to
   move in case of destruction of their own thatched roofs by strong winds.
   b)     Selection criteria for beneficiaries were left to locals, who may have chosen
   them based on political criteria.




                                         78
 c)       Outcomes of vaccination campaigns are not clear. Vaccines were
 distributed to private veterinarians but it is unclear how many animals were actually
 vaccinated.
 d)       Little coordination occurred between local actors; e.g., the Livestock
 Directorate (DIREL), the regional development agency, and the PDMAS. Also, the
 collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Livestock
 was insufficient.
e)        AECID’s contribution to the project was not made sufficiently explicit and
 the agency was not given adequate recognition for its financing. It was interested
 in participating more actively in project supervision missions involving its technical
 staff in Dakar.
