In 1996 and 2000, the World Bank provided\n            two sector adjustment loans, or SECALs, for socially\n            sustainable restructuring of the Russian coal sector. During\n            this restructuring, some major reforms took place, including\n            a change in institutional roles that ensured an improvement\n            in accountability mechanisms in the coal sector, which\n            ensured better social protection for all workers. The\n            workers, including disabled miners, became aware of their\n            entitlements and could voice their opinions through their\n            local groups, which did not exist earlier. Wage payments\n            were made on time, and the workers started to receive the\n            entirety of their monthly salaries in cash. Safety\n            conditions for workers also improved. Inefficient mines\n            ceased to operate, and restructuring was aimed at ensuring\n            employment for the laid-off workers in other sectors.\n            However, this approach could not fully address the aftermath\n            of layoffs and terminations in the coal industry."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
