objectives of the Second Coal Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project are to: a) separate state management\n            functions and commercial activities in the industry and\n            improve sector governance; b) reduce the impact of the coal\n            sector on the federal budget by supporting the decrease of\n            subsidies; c) promote the long term efficiency, commercial\n            viability and sustainability of the sector, together with\n            its privatization; and d) cushion the impact of\n            restructuring on coal miners, their families and affected\n            communities.  The project consists of five components.  1)\n            Commercialization and demonopolization of the coal sector\n            will bring about competition among coal companies.  2)\n            Privatization and investment will complete privatization of\n            about 45 percent of the coal industry by the end of 1998.\n            In the interim, any state support will be in the form of\n            loans, provided on a competitive basis.  3) Mine closures\n            and workforce reductions will be conducted at minimal cost\n            and social protection benefits will be provided to all\n            eligible persons.  4) Subsidies will be paid to finance\n            physical mine closures, scientific research activities,\n            severance payments and wage arrears, disability payments,\n            and a contingency Social Protection Reserve Fund.  5) Public\n            participation and social impact monitoring will inform the\n            public regularly about the restructuring program and their\n            legal rights, and will consult them on decisions affecting\n            their social safety net."}, "docdt": "1997-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
