0.0   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      The execution on the field of the environmental
      study relevant to NCZ Kafue Factory revealed a
      situation really heavier than what was
      expected.
      The most remarkable aspects, as regards the
      liguid effluents, are:
      1 	 High contents of ammonium, free ammonia,
          nitrates and suspended solids as major
          pollutants in the waste waters for a total
          amount of about 10 tons/day ammonia in the
          sewers (almost 10% of the production at the
          time of analytical campaign) and 8 tons/day
          of nitrates (about 7% of ammonium nitrate
          production) and 56 tons/day of suspended
          solids (mainly coal ash and dust and calcine
          by-product from pyrite roasting not conveyed
          to the lagoon).
      2 	 A very chaotic situation of'sewers system,
          with many abusive connections between
          industrial and storm water trenches.
      3 	 A remarkable dispersion of the physical
          points of discharge practically distributing
          polluted streams along all the perimeter of
          the factory.
      4 	 The beginning of visible pollution even in
          Kafue River (whose northern bank by the
          confluence with Kasenje River is full of
          coal deposits, while a chemical analysis on
          the coastal waters reveals high ammonia and
          nitrates); considerable presence of algae
          was noticed even in the middle of the river.
      5 	 Operation of the two lagoons (for calcine
          by-product of pyrite roasting from Sulphuric
          Acid Plant (SAP) and for coal ash) not as
          closed systems of ultimate disposal for
          solid materials, but as open basins
          continuously discharging liquid overflows
          into the open land.
      All these aspects determine a situation highly
      not complying with national laws (Statutory
      Instrument No 161/8th November 1985 of
      Government of Zambia as regards Trade Liquid
      Effluents) and with every international rules.
                   2




To face this situation a control plan on liquid
wastes has been elaborated. However the
environmental control must begin with proper
maintenance and operation of each single part
of the plants. Sensitiveness towards the
environmental problems must be awakened in all
the personnel, starting from the management, by
means of tailored training courses and written
communications. Moreover a responsible person
for environmental protection must be urgently
appointed, following the model of developed
countries factories, who acts as landmark both
as regards the technical aspects of the
desirable realization of the proposed control
plan and the legal aspects relevant to the
inevitable needs of dealing with public
authorities about environmental matter.
The rough investment cost estimates (chapter
10.00) amount to US $3,008,000 of which only
496,000 liable to local supply (civil works,
labour, electrical cable and some steel work
fabrication), while the remainin'g 2,512,000
are machineries and materials to be imported.
The main objectives obtainable by means of this
interventions are:
- To fully comply with the tables of standards
  indicated in the above mentioned Zambian law,
  so discharging less than 354.3mg/1 of
  nitrates (as N03), less than 60.7mg/l of
  Ammonia and Ammonium (as NH3) to the public
  sewer and less than 221.4mg/l of nitrates,
  less than 12.1mg/l of total ammonium and less
  than 50mg/1 of total suspended solids as
  regards any other effluent.
- To recover most of the above mentioned
  conspicuous losses of production so allowing
  expected savings of about 12 equivalent tons
  of ammonia per day for a value of US $900,000
  per year (under the hypotheses of a value of
  2500 Kwacha/ton NH3, an exchange rate of
  10 Kwacha/US $ and 300 days of operation
  per year) versus an increase of operating
  costs only relevant to electriCity, chemicals
  produced in the factory (such as nitric acid)
  or already present (such as slaked lime),
  small quantities of polyelectrolite and some
  periodic make-up and substitution of ion
  exchange resins. Of courSe the proposed
  control plan cannot be a profitable plant,
  but, as it happens allover the world for
               3




 any ecological intervention, it must be
 regarded as an additional cost to the
 business of making fertilizers (just the
 same as utilities, depreciation, or other
 associated process costs) in order to get
 the priceless benefit that even in Zambia is
 the Environment Protection.

As regards pollution caused by solid wastes,
possible seepages and pollution risks of the
water table have been investigated by means of
some wells dug nearby the calcine lagoon site;
samples from the ground water were collected at
differenct depths, none of them showing
contamination by the toxic metals disposed of
in the lagoon. Some leachate tests (EP toxicity
suggested by Environmental Protection Agency)
were carried out as well on samples of the
solidified materials abandoned in the lagoons:
these latter indicate some reasons of worrying
about the possibility of toxic substances
(Selenium, Lead and Cadmium) release from these
heaps. Consequently cautions on the operation
of the lagoons (not to overfill above upper
limit) and fencing of the whole area are
suggested as recommendations.

As regards the future needs of the factory for
the next fifteen years two new lagoons are
required (260,OOOm2 for calcine and 215,OOOm2
for slurry and coal ash to be constructed after
five years, unless a possible utilization of
solid wastes is found.  As to this latter point
a feasibility study and marketing research are
recommended to exploit the iron contents of
pyrite cinders (about 50% for a total of 3MT/hr)
in producing sponge iron to be sold abroad to
some steel industry. As regards slurry and coal
ash the heat value looks too poor to be
exploited.

Moreover a fencing for the overall lagoons areas
and a guard post are recommended to avoid
vandalism and dangers to people who may come
into contact with toxic materials due to
ignorance. The amount for the new lagoons and
fencing intervention is about US $250,000.

1.00   INTRODUCTION

       The present study was carried out from July 1986
       to March 1987 in order to comply with EA
       obligations involved in the contract. Therefore
       the terms of reference for the study are the
       same as in the contract, while the inner meaning
       according to which it was carried out was in
       accordance with the guidelines of the World Bank
       (staff appraisal report of June 19, 1985) and
       following direct discussions with the World Bank
       specialist from 9th to 11th September 1986. For
       convenience sake herewith are the guidelines of
       the World Bank reported integrally:­

1.01   ABSTRACT FROM THE WORLD BANK REPORT   ~   5658 ZA

       G.   Envionment and Safety Aspect.s

       5.32 	 Presently, the NCZ FertiJ.izer complex has
              a severe pollution problem caused by
              nitrogen oxides (NOX) gaseous emissions
              from the NCZ I and NCZ II nitric acid
              plants. The current level (up to 2,200
              ppm) of such emissions 1s 6-10 times the
              maximum levels presently permitted in most
              industrialized countries. Such high
              levels are partly due to the higher levels
              permitted when these plants were designed
              and partly due to the deterioration of the
              facilities. This high level of emissions
              affects adversely the environment and the
              rains generated fron NOX gases corrode the
              plant facilities.   Under the Project, both
              NCZ I and NCZ II plants would be equipped
              with NOX abatement units to reduce
              contaminant in stack gases to a maximum of
              500ppm, the present international standard
               (paras 5.18 and 5.19).

       5.33 	 Solid waste and part of the liqUid
              effluents from the plant are sent to two
              disposal ponds. The remaining liquid
              effluents are neutralized in a water
              treatment plant before discharging into
              the Kafue Township sewage system. Under
              the Project, NCZ will rehabilitate the
              water treatment plant, install a closed
              loop system at the AN unit of NCZ II
              plant, and take other necessary measures
              to prevent pollution. After Project
              implementation, the liquid effluents will
              meet international standards. Under the
              environmental study to be carried out by
          5




OMP, by September 1986, all aspects
related to solid waste and liquid effluent
disposal will be reviewed in detail and
recommended measures will be implemented.
In addition, the proposed safety study
will recommend steps to be taken to deal
with any potential safety hazards at NCZ
(para 5.20). Assurances will be sought at
negotiations that NCZ will rehabilitate
and operate its facilities under
environmental and safety standards
satisfactory to IDA.
2.00   SCOPE OF WORK

       According to the terms of reference the scope
       of the study was mainly restricted to liquid
       effluents and solid wastes production. Air
       pollution and industrial hygiene probles were
       only outlined. However, some attention was
       paid to the overall ecological problem of the
       whole area Kafue-Lusaka, stated that the
       drinking water intakes for these towns are
       situation on the Kafue River downstream NCZ
       factory.

3.00     SURVEY ON POLLUTION PRODUCTION FROM THE PLANTS 

         In order to understand better the way of
         pollution generation from the single plants
         some interviews with the plant chiefs were
         carried out, on the basis of the questions
         contained in the information questionnaire,
         whose text is reported in Annex 1.
         The contents of questionnaires are resumed in
         the present chapter. The plants for which the
         investigations were carried out are listed in
         Table 1.
         The main purpose of this part of the study was
         to clarify from which apparatus or from which
         operations the liquid effluents, gaseous
         streams and solid wastes were originating from.
         The data were mainly drawn by the chiefs of the
         plants from the process books and material
         balance sheets.
         As a general consideration it appears evident
         the contrast between the collected statements
         from the interviews and the analytical results
         from the proper campaign (see chapter 5.00).
         From the declared discharges it would result
         an extremely clean and dry factory, with very
         few systematic process streams, some leakages
         and almost clean waters to the sewer system.
         On the contrary from the analytical campaign
         it results a conspicuous mass of liquid
         discharges, moreover distributed in many
         points, especially of the storm water sewer,
         with large pollutant contents, particularly
         suspended solids, ammonia and nitrates (for an
         amount up to almost 10% ammonia production).
3.01 	   Coal Gasification (including coal handling
                            and preparation)
         The plant consists of 4 units (1 stand-by) of
         about 7000kg/h coal capacity each and produces
         raw gas and steam as by-product. The employed
         raw materials, apart from coal, are unslaked
         lime (supplied by Ndola Lime Company), for the
         purpose of reducing the melting point of the
         ash and oxygen from the air separation unit of
         the factory. The employed utilities are
         demineralized water as feed for the numerous
         waste heat boilers, cooling water, kerosene and
         diesel Oil, nitrogen for sealing and purging
         coal dust transportation. As regards
         chemicals, sodium phosphate and sodium sulphite
         are employed for the boilers. As regards
         pollution the following was declared during the
         interviews.

             occurs. Clear Water comes ba'ck to
             gasification and slurry is pumped out to
             dedicated lagoon (for further details of
             this facility see the proper chapter 7.00 on
             the present effluent treatment plants).

3.01.4   Visit on Site
         During the visit on site it was noticed that
         the water consumption was much more than
         expected (one reasons was the water leakage
         from the shafts of ash extractor G1206 which
         necessitated the use of a lot of external
         water, taken from firewater, as seal water of
         the shaft). Besides, most of the waste water
         which was supposed to go to settling ponds was
         flowing to storm water due to choking and
         breakdowns of the industrial sewer. Even the
         "e" effluent from the other plants, which was
         only supposed to cross the area of the plant,
         was diverted to storm water. Recently the
         original path was re-established. For this
         purpose see the proper chapter 8.00 on the
         situation of the sewerage systems.
         Of course, the water flowing in all the open
         trenches loads coal dust and coal ash, while
         passing through the coal prepara.tion and coal
         gasification units.

3.02     QlQ Ammonia Plant (303)
         This plant produces an average of 84 t/day of
         Anhydrous Ammonia (versus a design capacity of
         95 	 t/daY)1 raw materials are raw gas from
         gasification and nitrogen from air separation
         plant. Many chemicals are involved: phosphate
         for the boiler, potassium carbonate, MEA and
         caustic soda for C02 removal, antraquinone
         disulphonic acid, sodium carbonate and sodium
         vanadate for H2S removal: as utilities
         demineralized and cooling water, steam and
         diesel fuel are employed.
3.02.1   Waste-water streams
         1 	 2M3/hr of demineralized water utilized for
             sealing of carbonate and caustic pumps
             continuously flow to the industrial sewer
             at room temperature without loss of
             solution;
         2 	 Once a day for cleaning of H~S removal
             filter press 1m3 of water containing sulphur
             and other chemicals goes for one hours to
             the industrial sewer;
         3 	 3M3/day of water at 45 Deg.C containing
             traces of K2C03 flow to the industrial
             sewer during the backwashing of K2C03 side
             stream filters which occur once per shift
             for 45 minutes;
         4 	 0,2M3 of caustic tower spent liquor go to
             industrial sewer once a shift for 30 minutes,
             temperature is 40 Deg.C and composition 8 :
             10% Na2C03 and 0,5% NaOH;
         5 	 150 It/hr of raw gas compressors condensate
             drainings continuously to industrial sewer
             containing only water (because there are
             installed oil separators).
         As a general consideration the plant has no
         emergency discharges into the sewers due to the
         presence of storage facilities to handle.
3.02.2   Gaseous Streams
         1   Continuous flowing to atmosphere of H2S
             traces at 20 mtrs height from slurry tank

             consisting of iron oxide once in 3 years
             is spread in the plant;
         3 	 Exhaust CO conversion catalyst consisting of
             porous iron oxide is forwarded every three
             years to lagoon;
         4 	 Old rashig rings are cracked and spread in
             the not paved areas of the plant or in fields
             for roads.
3.02.4   Visit QE site
         The storage facilities are in common with new
         ammonia plant and located in old nitric acid
         area. They consist of two spheres, one 800m3
         volume and the other 1715m3 (respectively SOOt
         and 1000t ammonia capacity). The operating
         refrigeration system is one for both the spheres
         and if one of the two compressors is out of
         order is not enough to maintain the low required
         storage temperatures, so that some NH3 is vented
         to atmosphere and, occasionally, even to the
         sewer; this amount can be up to 500 kg/hr.
3.03     New Ammonia Plant (A309)
         The plant produces on average 128MT/day of
         anhydrous ammonia (versus a design capacity of
         217MT/day: this is because of some bottlenecks
         and lack of apparatuses in the plant), moreover
         the plant produces 6MT/day of aqueous ammonia
         (25% concentration). The plant requires 5M3/day
         of demineralized water for start up and making
         NH3 solution, cooling water and chemicals for
         its conditioning, steam and sodium or
         potassium chromate for the start up of A303
         plant (H2S, C02 removal).

3.03.4   Visit En site
         This plant presents one of the few process
         effluents of the factory: the process condensate
         from CO conversion containing 2500ppm of ammonia
         (which is added for corrosion reasons) is
         responsible, together with the leakages from
         mechanical seals of refrigerating pumps, for one
         of the main industrial hygiene problems of the
         factory (NH3 concentration measured by means of
         Draeger pumps along the main road up to 150ppmJ.
         Some intervention is necessary for this point.
3.04     Methanol Plant
         It produces methanol at 91% (design capacity
         5 t/day) from synthesis gas. It utilizes
         cooling water and stearn as utilities.
         Practically daily production is 2,5t but only
         when the storage tank is not full.

         treatment plant and cooling water tower;
         practically the necessary quantities are less
         than 100m3/hr of raw water and 20m3/hr of
         cooling water but in order to avoid choking of
         the pumps due to the growth of sea weed the
         pumping station is operated at maximum rate and
         a continuous overflow of water is flowing to new
         Kasenje River through the point of discharge
         SW3.
         As chemicals for water treatment there are
         employed 400Kg/week of alum, 400Kg/week of
         caustic soda, 2Kg/week of aid coagulant and
         5MT/day lime for the neutralization in the
         waste water treatment (100 bags per shift).
         As 	 fuels 20,000 Itrs of diesel oil are
         utilized every start up of roaster and
         converter.
3.11.1   Waste-water streams
         Most of the discharges go to the autonomous
         S.A.P. waste-water treatment plant, which is
         briefly described below and in the proper
         paragraph 7.02.
            Back washing of F401 A/B/C/D sand filters for
            cooling water: 55m3 for 3 minutes every shift
            at room temperature to the anti-acid painted
            basin V1001.

          3     Washings of V201 settler, T201 cooling tower,
                T202 washing tower (for which design figure
                is 8,7m3/hr) even to Vl001.
          4     Washings of the "mist cottrell" electrostatic
                precipitators; very small for 2 minutes each
                day to V1001.
          5 	 Continuous sludge from V201; about 8m3/hr at
              80 Deg.C containing diluted sulphuric acid
              to the basin V901 (feeding for the
              neutrali2ation tanks V902, V903).

              tower T202 at 65 Deg.C containing diluted
              sulphuric acid conveyed to V901.
          7 	 Continuous calcine mixer IV108) effluent.
              It is surely the most important effluent of
              the plant (and perhaps of the factory),
              consisting of 76 : 90m3/hr (capacity of pumps
              Pl03 A/B) of sludge at 40 Deg.C containing
              mainly iron oxide Fe203 going now to the
              ageing tank V904 (V907 as design) and from
              there pumped by means of P902 to the
              dedicated lagoon.
          8 	 Overflow of pyrite heap pit in case of rain:
              directly to new Kasenje River, in
              consideration of lack of the pump Pl003 which
              has been moved to Vl001.
          9 	 Overflow of raw water in case of water
              treatment shutdown: to storm water (point
              SW3).
         10 	 Drainings from T203, T204, V201 in case of
              bad operations; the full contents of vessels
              to V1001 without pumping out.

3.11.3   Solid wastes
         The calcine by-product of pyrite roasting is
         pumped out of the plant in liquid form but in
         the lagoon water is progressively evaporating
         and there remains solid waste perfectly able
         to be trampled on.
3.11.4   Visit 2n site
         The areas around waste water treatment facility
         are full of calcine losses, so that it is hard
         to walk around.
         Most of raw water drawn goes overflooding, due
         to the fact that the pumps must work always at
         maximum capacity, otherwise choking occurs of
         too much living plants in the water.
3.12     Air Separation Plant
         It consists of two units; the old one employs
         22,OOONm3/hr of air to produce 2,800Nm3/hr of
         nitrogen and 3,850Nm3/hr of oxygen (the rest
         being impure nitrogen), the new one utilizes
         52,OOONm3/hr of air to produce 9,OOONm3/hr of
         nitrogen, 7,800Nm3/hr of oxygen and the
         remainder, most part, is impure nitrogen.
         For the coolers and air scrubbing the old plant
         requires 1000m3/hr of cooling water while the
         new 3000m3/hr, all recirculated on own cooling
         tower.
3.12.1   Waste-water Streams
         Only 30m3/day of cooling water for sealing
         oxygen, raw gas and impure nitrogen holders:
         coming from the not conditioned cooling tower
         located near the water treatment and flowing
         to storm water sewer.
3.12.2   Gaseous Streams
         Impure nitrogen vented to the atmosphere when
         coal handling or gasification are shutdown (air
         separation plant is not stopped because start up
         is a big problem).

3.13     Water Treatment Plant
         The water treatment plant for all the areas
         except SAP has a practical capacity of 400m3/hr.
         It consists of two precipitators 501 and A501
         (the new one is called npretreator n ) followed by
         the settling basin S601-1 from where water is
         pumped by means of 601 P03 A/B to the valveless
         filters. The chemicals employed in the
         precipitator are alum, lime and an aid coagulant
         called Himoloc. As demineralization plant there
         are an old NCZ unit consisting of one cationic
         and one anionic exchanger at present not
         working; therefore another unit, built up by
         Kobe Steel, consisting of cationic, degasifier
         and anionic sections for a capacity of 38m3/hr
         is running together with the newer Klockner
         unit, also consisting of cationic, degasifier
         and anionic sections for a capacity of 48m3/hr.
         Downstream of the treatment there are two
         reservoirs for demineralized water of capacity
         140m3 and 210m3.
3.13.1   Waste-water Streams
         1 	 Sludge from precipitator: it is intermittent,
             consisting of about 2m3 every 8 hours for
             half a minute containing 2% suspended solids
             and flowing to the same neutralization tank
             of the following point.
         2 	 Eluates from resins regeneration flow to a
             pit of about 100m3 volume where partly auto­
             neutralize themselves; then the effluent
             (an average of Sm3/hr) is pumped to the
             waste-water treatment (nOn effluent pond
             605 Cl0 A/B).
         3 	 Backwashings of sand valveless filters (No 1
             Kobe and No 2 built up by NCZ): overall 10m3
             once per day, duration 4 minutes, containing
             suspended solids.

3.14     Boilers

         At present in the factory four boilers are
         working (a new boiler is under erection): one
         coal operated and three fuel oil operated
         (even if two of them, called "twins" were
         designed for coal but were modified by NCZ
         to 	fuel oil). The new boiler will have a
         capacity of 30MT/hr steam and will be coal
         operated.

         The capacities are: 11t/hr of steam for the
         "carbon" boiler (which works with coal dust
         mixture with little fuel oil), 9t/hr for the
         for the "twins" and 6t/hr for the last "diesel
         boiler" (which is operated with light fuel oil
         and was degraded in the past from the initial
         design capacity of 10t/hr steam at 29 bar due
         to four explosion accidents.

3.14.1   Waste-water Streams

            Sharp blow down twice per shift for each
            boiler: about 5m3/each flowing to industrial
            sewer ("C" effluent).

         2 	 Effluent from sedimentation basin for the
             ashes of coal boiler: consisting of fire
             water containing suspended solids going to
             industrial sewer ("C" effluent).

3.14.2   Gaseous Streams

         Coal fired boiler is provided with a 30 mtrs
         high chimney. The other boilers are provided
         with only 6 mtrs high chimneys. The new
         boiler will be provided with a 35 mtrs high
         chimney. Sometimes, due to difficulties of
         pulverisers operation, light fuel oil is being
         used in the coal fired boiler, resulting in a
         dark smoke to the atmosphere for short time.
         A dark smoke is also coming out from the "twins"
         boilers during soot blowing operation every
         shift and at start-ups.

3.15     Fuel Oil Storage

         Fuel oil is supplied by Ndola Refinery; it
         travels by means of tankers on the roads.
                         28    ­




         Daily consumption is about 35MT/day. The
         storage consists of the two 70m3 tanks VOG A/B
         (of which one has no heater) one 100m3 tank
         (V06/C) for light fuel oil and of the new 300m3
         tank for "diesel" fuel oil (this latter to
         supply gasifiers, coal handling furnaces,
         ammonia plants, and in emergency, the boilers)
         Fuel oil is transferred to the storage tanks by
         means of a centrifugal pump (capacity 10m3/hr)1
         if this latter is broken a mohno portable pump
         is employed.

             remaining at the bottom of the tankers after
             pump transferring to the tanks the workers
             drain this oil in some drums and then pump
             the contents of the drum to storage. During
             this operation some losses of fuel oil in the
             surrounding areas occur, spreading mainly to
             the storm water sewer. Sometimes these
             losses are covered with lime.
3.15.2   Visit 2n site
         Fuel storage is located just close to the open
         trench effluent from the waste water treatment
         plant. There are restraining walls, but an
         eventual leak from the tasks risk to pollute
         the treated water.

4.00   LIQUID EFFLUENTS
       This aspect covers most of the efforts employed
       in the study. A considerable analytical
       campaign was carried out by the laboratory from
       23/07/86 to 19/09/86 and some supplementary
       analyses and tests were accomplished in October
       and November. Checking analyses were carried
       out in December 1986 and February 1987 to verify
       eventual changes after the turnaround of the
       factory. For this purpose some points of
       sampling, practically coincident with the main
       points of discharge of the factory sewerage
       systems, were located and the analysis schedule
       reported in Annex 2 was drawn up. Eight points
       of the storm water (SW) sewer were specified and
       eleven of the industrial sewer (namely IW1 :
       IW11), moreover three points for the sulphuric
       acid plant were specified and some
       intensification of the NOX and S02 controls were
       required as regards air pollutiorl.
       The location of these points can be found on the
       enclosed "map of sewers and points of sampling"
       (Drawing A201-0064). The data collected,
       together with the flow rate measurements and
       considerations on the actual situation of the
       sewerage systems of the factory were utilized
       to outline the necessary recommendations to be
       adopted for the pollution control of the
       factory.
       The analytical data collected during the
       campaign are contained in the Tables of Annex 3
       (pages 1 - 17). These data must be read in
       connection with the production situation of the
       plants of the factory during the time of samples
       collection, which is summarized in Annex 4
       (pages 1 - 2).
       The results of the flow measurements (carried
       out by means of several methods, in comparison
       with them when possible: propeller hydrometer,
       chronometer calculations of the paths of some
       floating materials and gauging weires) are
       reported in Tables 2 and 3. Some difficulties
       were met during the measurement, due to
       considerable amounts of sediments along the
       trenches and outward fouling in some of them.
       The location of points of sampling and the
       summary tables of the analytical campaign are
       even shown on the "simplified diagram of sewers
       system with points of sampling and analytical
       results" (Drawing No A60S-0010).

         The analytical campaign was driven as much as
         possible into the details of the single plants
         effluents; however, due to objective
         difficulties in catching representative samples,
         as usual in these kinds of studies, it was not
         possible to investigate every small branch of
         sewer inside the 	plants, but only the main
         collectors from the plants.
         The analytical results in the above mentioned
         sampling points are summarized in the following
         Table 2, for industrial waste water, and Table
         3, for storm water, elaborated from the single
         analysis by means of simple statistical methods
         and rejecting not representative data (samples
         taken during days of shutdown of some plants or
         figures 	visibly out of standard.
         During the execution of the analytical campaign
         two more points of sampling from the storm water
         sewer as to the previous schedule, namely SW9
         and SW10, were considered worthy of
         investigation.
         As regards the parameters investigated in the
         Table 2 	 and 3 chromium, nickel and cadmium are
         neglected since they were always found equal to
         nil in all the analyses.
         As to the sulphuric acid plant investigations
         and A321 slurry the analytical results are shown
         in Table 4.
5.02 	   QUANTITY
         The series of flow measurements were driven as
         much as possible into the single plants
         effluents; however, due to objective
         difficulties in introducing measurement
         instruments, it was not possible to investigate
         every small branch of sewer, but only the main
         collectors.
         Whenever the flow was so low as not to affect
         the sensitivity of the employed methods, it is
         assumed the flow be equal to lm3!hr or less.
         The results are shown as "Hourly Rate" parameter
         in the same above mentioned Tables 2 and 3.

       As regards point IW2 "D" effluent the flow rate
       is nil because at the time of the analyses the
       flow of this sewer was deviated into others and
       no effluent was flowing to the double "D"
       effluent pump. Where a dash is indicated
       instead of a figure the flow rate measurement
       was impossible because of too much sediment in
       the sewer or of the lack of the discharge pump
       in the pit of investigation (thus resulting in
       standing water in the pit and overflooding of
       polluted water into some storm water sewers.
       See the chapter 8.00 for this).
5.03   OVERALL POLLUTION
       By combining average flow rates with average
       analysis relevant to the most meaningful
       parameters as regards the complying with the
       law (see next paragraph 5.04 for the reference
       to discharge regulations) it results that Kafue
       NCZ factory is discharging towards the
       surrounding environment (mainly new Kasenje
       River or open drainages conveying into the
       Kasenje River), the quantities of pollutants
       exceeding the limits from the final points of
       discharge indicated in Table 5. Of course these
       computations are based on the hypothesis that
       24 hours a day both the hourly rate and the
       discharge of pollutants are constant and equal
       to the average.
       The considerable amount of suspended solids has
       been directly confirmed during a boat trip taken
       along the Kafue River by the compiler of this
       study together with NCZ Works Chemist as far as
       the confluence of Kasenje River with Kafue
       River. Here the distressing and impressive
       sight of some hundred square meters of Kafue
       northern side covered with black sediment could
       be observed. The height of the sediment layer
       was so big that the sampling bottle could not be
       immersed in the river water, even many meters
       from the bank. Samples of the sediment and of
       the supernatant water were taken. The
       analytical results, shown in Annex 5 and 6
       indicate that some alteration has started in the
       Kafue River natural geochemical concentration,
       at least on that portion of northern bank in
       proximity of the Kasenje confluence. Infact,
       ammonia, nitrates, salinity and solids are
       rather high, (see analysis of sample 2 in
       Annex 5) while at the center of the river
       ammonia and nitrates are nil. The position of
       sampling points on Kafue River are shown in
       Table 6 BIS.

       It is necessary to point out that the 20ppm of
       ammonia and the 32ppm of nitrates found in the
       water supernatant the above mentioned coal ash
       layer were relevant to a day, 14th November,
       during the general shutdown of the factory.
       The position of NCZ factory as to Kafue River
       is shown in the small map of Table 6.
5.04   REFERENCE TO LOCAL/INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS
       Till last year in Zambia there were in force
       only some old Local Government Acts regulating
       the discharge of "Trade Effluents". The ones
       which we got acquainted with (Kafue Township
       Council and City of Ndola) were rather lacking
       as regards contents and indications in the sense
       that many important parameters (among them the
       main pollutants of NCZ Kafue factory) were
       missing and for some of the others the
       concentration limits were not given.
       On the contrary on 8th November 1985 the
       Statutory Instrument No 161 (herein enclosed as
       Annex 7) was issued with the aim of disciplining
       in all the Republic of Zambia, the discharge of
       trade effluents both into a public sewer and
       into any water courses or lakes. of course, the
       limit specifications valid for any water course
       are stricter than those valid for the discharge
       into a public sewer. This law appears very
       clear, including even a very detailed formula
       for calculating the charge for the disposal of
       trade effluents into a public sewer and the
       amounts of fines in case of offences to any
       provision of these regulations. As regards the
       standard figures some parameter limits appear
       too high in comparison with European or USA
       ones, but it looks quite reasonable taking into
       account the substantially different level of
       Zambia industrialization.
       If someone just wants to move some critiques to
       some points of the Law, it appears unusual the
       presence of a limit for thallium, which is not
       taken into account by any international
       regulation. Moreover, the limit of 25mg/1 for
       zinc appears too permissible, as in all
       countries this compound is considered rather
       tOXic, on the contrary tin limit of 2mg/l looks
       too low, stated that this metal is generally not
       considered toxic. Even the limit for oil
       (1-2mg/l) is quite'low (for Italian Law if 5).
       Moreover, biological pollutants (coliforms and
       streptococci) are missing.
However, the Statutory Instrument No 161/1985
looks, in this context, the most reliable and
complete term of reference for the aim of
present Environment Stury and it will be taken
into consideration as the national regulation in
force which is mentioned in the contract,
neglecting any not very clear reference to
mysterious "International Standards",

6.00 	   GENERAL COMMENTS Qli THE RESULTS OF
         THE ANALYTICAL CAMPAING
         The previous pargaraphs with enclosed Tables 2,
         3, 4 and 5 practically reply to the demand of
         investigating the present quality and quantity,
         overall 	and plant by plant, of the liquid
         effluents.
         As regards the expected level of pollutants
         after completion of the technical rehabilitation
         of both the Kobe and the Klockner line it is
         likely not to be a large change to be expected;
         that is why on the one hand the capacity
         increase will produce higher level of
         pollutants, but on the other hand the
         ameliorations to the condition of apparatuses
         will involve a minor amount of leakages and
         losses of pollutants at present higher because
         of poor maintenance. Which of the two effects
         will be prevailing is rather hard to forecast,
         but we believe that to consider valid present
         levels of pollution even for the future will be
         quite conservative.
         AS general comments it appears evident that the
         final effluent from the industrial sewer (IW1),
         which is discharging, together with the sanitary
         sewer, into the main council public sewer line
         is, by itself, out of the Zambian Law as regards
         ammonia, nitrates and slightly, sulphides.
         If we consider the combined industrial/sanitary
         effluent from the factory, as confirmed by some
         analysiS, this latter remains faulty as to
         ammonia and nitrates. This is quite reasonable
         stated that, even if we do not know in detail
         the township sewage treatment plant project, a
         municipal waste water treatment plant usually
         does not present high capacities of
         nitrification and denitrification, while a
         fertilizer factory like NCZ typically discharges
         mainly ammonia and nitrates.
         However, the major problem for NCZ factory is
         the large number of storm water drainings
         polluted at a higher extent than the industrial
         sewer. The discharges through storm water
         drains must comply with column 3 regulation 4 of
         the Statutory Instrument No 161 of 1985, as
         they do not occur in a public sewer, so that the
         standards to be observed are stricter. As
         pointed out by the dashed lines in Table 3, at
         present storm water discharges not complying
         with the Law are the following for the mentioned
         parameters:­
                  41




SW10:    Total ammonia, sulphates, phosphates,
         nitrates, sulphides, iron, oil and
         suspended solids.

SW2:     Copper and suspended solids.

SW3:     pH, sulphates, sulphides, arsenic,
         copper, iron, salinity and suspended
         solids.

SW4: 	   pH, sulphates, selenium, arsenic, copper,
         iron, salinity and suspended solids.

sws: 	   Total ammonia, cyanides, copper, iron,
         oil and suspended solids.

SW6: 	   Total ammonia, cyanides, sulphides, iron,
         oil and suspended solids.

SW7: 	   (Which represents the biggest effluents
         from the factory, even in dry weather):
         Total ammonia, cyanides, nitrates,
         sulphides, oil, salinity and suspended
         solids.

SW8: 	   Total ammonia, cyanides, sulphides, oil,
         and suspended solids.

SW9: 	   Nitrates, oil and suspended solids.

The overall situation is summarized on the
simplified diagram (Drawing No A60S-0010).

It appears evident that the major responsibility
of this heavy and so widely dispersed pollution
is the chaotic situation of the sewerage system,
with a big mess of mixtures between industrial
and storm water trenches, breakages, blockages
and, may be, even improper conveyances of
polluted discharges to the wrong sewer for
design or construction mistakes.

As regards the sulphuric acid plant sewer (SW2,
SW3, SW4) responsible is the the heavy corrosion
and abrasion of piping and pumps, which often
are not working, resulting in discharging
effluents directly to new Kasenje River instead
of conveying them to the waste water treatment
plant and then to the lagoon.

To the above mentioned pollution frame there
must be added the overflow from the lagoon
which, as results from the analysis enclosed in
Annex 8 (pages 1 - 6), is systematically out for
sulphates.
                       42




For precision's sake Nez factory, apart from other
branches of storm water sewers which are surely not dry
only in rainy weather, has another discharge into the
public sewer from the sanitary sewer collecting
buildings located in the western area of the factory,
but this latter, as it originates exclusively from
hygienic facilities, surely comply with column 2
standards.
As further general comment, if we compare the quantities
of ammonia and nitrates averagely lost with the polluted
discharges with the production amounts in the period of
the analytical campaign, we can say that almost 10% of
ammonia production and 7% of ammonium nitrate production
has been lost with the polluted waste water in this
period (though plants were stopped many days). If this
percentage persists, once rehabilitated the plants at
maximum capacity, the lost amounts will be 31t/day of
ammonia and 35t/day of nitric acid for the considerable
value of Kwacha/year 43 million.
Of course, not the whole pollution is removable with
practical and economical methods, as it,occurs
invevitably in every factory of the world, but very much
can be done at Kafue factory to reduce present big
amounts, only by means of simple interventions, good
maintenance and some precautions, as we shall strive to
indicate with our recommendations.
A particular comment is worthwhile for oil parameter:
The standard limit of 1-2mg/l (it is odd that for this
parameter there is not indicated a clear figure "one" of
"two") for "any discharge other than sub-regulation 1"
looks quite low, especially in comparison with the
100mg/l for the discharge into public sewer; so that all
the storm water drains appear out of law as to oil, even
if this parameter can be easily assessed bringing back
the discharge to the proper industrial sewer.
As regards the visible effect of iridescence that can
strike the average man in the streeet it is necessary to
bear in mind that it is only a matter of the presence on
surface of a molecular layer of oil, but no massive
amount of oil is in the bulk of the waste water, as it
results from all the analyses.
Infact according to an experimental table supplied by
A.P.I. (American Petroleum Institute) in its "Manual on
disposal of refinery wastes" (see bibliography 1) to the
appearance of visible bright bands of colour it
corresponds an approximate thickness of 0,0000120 inch
film and a quantity of 200 gallons of oil for film 1
square mile in area; it means that about O,73cc of oil
everyone meter of iridescent open trench, since the
average trenches width is about 40cms.

As regards the s~z~ng data for the review of effluent
treatment plant for the fertilizers area We can notice
that, apart from smaller streams, the major contributors
are IW1 and SW7 for a total of about 700m3/hr, that is
approximately the same amount drawn from the water
intake for the same area.
Actually there is another water immission of water into
the factory, namely the drinking water coming from the
council; this latter flows through a 4" pipe and a meter
(supplied by Bosco & Co. Torino which however is not
working) and serves all the control rooms, toilets, the
canteen and the laboratory. The used tap water is
supposed to flow to the sanitary sewer system, so that,
even if some losses can be found in other sewers, this
contribution to the effluent treatment plant is not
remarkable. It is not at all clear as to why the
conspicuous figure of 700m3/hr are corning from the
practical observation and flow measurement of the main
factory effluents, while from the theoretical
examination of the waste water streams plant by plant
not more than an overall 100m3/hr are arising. The
suspicion that may be the balance tank effluent was not
really flowing to main council sewer, due to some
breakage in the sewer system and was in communication
with the storm water sewer discharging through SW7 must
be dispelled due to the different elevations of the two
sewers. On the contrary direct observation of the very
small flow in the branch of sewer directed to main
council sewer (by lifting the grating of a man hole
located in front of bagging house on the other side of
the railway/and the concomitant big flow at swa (usually
dry) in the period of the collapse of sanitary/
industrial sewer (see point 12 of Chapter a.OO)
convinced that the balance tank effluent contributes, in
case, to swa, not to SW7, so that the only likely
explanation for this discrepancy is that the number of
abnormal operations involving emptying and flushing of
apparatuses and various washings of vessels and plant
areas are very much more than what even the plant chiefs
can realize, due to the frequent shutdowns and leakages
of parts of the plants that occur for poor maintenance,
lack of spare parts or electric power failures.
Generally speaking no plant operating people interviewed
on the pollution control matter were conscious of the
problem, but their main interest was the production and
the operation of the plants without troubles. This can
explain the numerous diversions to the wrong sewer and
the other anomalies that will be object of the next
chapters a.oo and 9.00. Moreover this lack of
sensitiveness stresses the hypothesis of urgently
designating a responsible person for the environmental
control of the factory as proposed in paragraph 9.14

6.01   COMPARISON WITH OTHER FACTORIES
       As rough consideration if we compare the
       pollution generation from NCZ Kafue Factory
       with know figures from similar European
       Factories, we can state that NCZ is polluting
       more than 3 - 4 times bigger factories.
       This statement is indirectly confirmed by an
       application of American E.P.A. (Environmental
       Protection Agency) "Effluent Guidelines and
       Standards for Fertilizer Manufacturing" (see
       Bibliography 2), which supply some reference
       figures for effluent limitations as to well
       operated plants subdivided in the main
       fertilizer manufacturing categories.
       The subcategories of NCZ interest are as shown
       on the following tables: 7, 8, 9.,
       By applying the figures suggested by EPA to NCZ
       Plants, it results, as shown in table 10 that
       NCZ level of pollution is a long, way off the
       best practical control technology currently
       available, so that many improvements are still
       possible inside the Fertilizer Manufacturing
       Plants in order both to reduce pollution level
       and to increase valuable products recovery.

6.02   POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON THE   ENVIRON~£NT   AND HEALTH
       Water is considered polluted when it is altered
       in composition or condition so that it becomes
       less suitable for any or all of the functions
       and purposes for which it would be suitable in
       its natural state. This definition includes
       changes in the physical, chemical and biological
       properties of water or such discharges of liquid
       gaseous or solid substances into water as will
       or are likely to create nuisances or render such
       waters harmful to public health, safety or
       welfare, or to domestic, commercial, industrial,
       agricultural, recreational or other legitimate
       uses of water, or to livestock, wild animals,
       fish or other aquatic life. It also includes
       changes in temperature due to the discharge of
       hot water (Thermal Pollution). From these
       principles inspiration was drawn by all the
       legislation of the world, not excluding the
       statutory instrument No 161 of Zambia.
       Human Health may be affected by ingesting water
       directly or in food, by using it in personal
       hygiene or for agriculture, industry or
       recreation, and by living near it.
       Herein we shall briefly deal with possible
       hazards from some chemical pollutants, which
       are present in the discharges of NCZ Factory
       Wastes, since the hazards from biological agents
       (Pathogenic Bacteria, Viruses, Parasites and
       Nuisance Organisms) should be faced and covered
       by the Kafue Township Council Effluent
       treatment.
       If present above a certain level, some chemicals
       pollutants (eg Nitrates, Arsenic and Lead) may
       constitute a direct toxic hazard when ingested
       in water. Other water constituents, such as
       Fluorides, are benefiCial, and may be essential
       to health, if present in small concentrations,
       though toxic if taken in large amounts. Certain
       other substances or chemical characteristics may
       affect the acceptability of water for drinking
       purposes.
       Ingestion is, however, only one possible pathway
       to exposure. Man can be exposed to water
       pollutants through other types 0: direct
       contact, eg in recreation or the use of water
       for personal hygiene. The possible health
       implications of these non-drinking uses of water
       (including agricultural and industrial uses) are
                       50




         less well understood and no international
         criteria or guidelines exist for the control of
         such exposure. In addition to the possible
         effects of ingestion and other direct water
         contacts, chemical water pollutants may
         influence man's health indirectly by disturbing
         the aquatic ecosystems or by accumulating in
         aquatic organisms used in human food: for some
         pollutants these effects may be the most
         important public health aspects of water
         pollution.
6.02.1   NITRATES
         The concentration of Nitrate in surface waters
         is usually below 5mg/l. Much higher
         concentration are sometimes found in ground
         water. The consumption of water (or baby food
         preparations) with a Nitrate concentration
         higher than 45mg/1 may result in infant
         methaemoglobinaemia. Another hazard is the
         formation of Nitrosammines due to the reaction
         of Nitrites (coming from Nitrates reduction by
         means of intestinal bacteria) with secondary
         and tertiary Ammines present in food. Because
         of its carcinogenic power, Nitrosammines
         constitute a risk to man's health. The presence
         of high nitrate concentrations in the water­
         courses gives rise to the so-called phenomenon
         of "Eutrophication", that is the abnormal and
         excessive growth of Algae.
6.02.2   ARSENIC
         Concentrations of Arsenic in surface water
         bodies are usually low. Rather high
         concentrations (0.2 - 0.9mg/l) have been
         reported in some drinking water supplies and
         are associated with endemic Arsenic poisoning
         and the so-called "Blackfoot" disease. Arsenic
         is also known to accumulate in some marine
         organisms, such as clams and shrimps. Certain
         epidemiological studies assign arsenic even
         a carcinogenic power.
6.02.3   SELENIUM
         Selenium seems to couteract Arsenic toxicity;
         however the specific protective action of
         Selenium seems well established against the
         toxic effects of cadmium and mercury. Selenium
         levels in water appear to be subject to natural
         control by absorption by sediments and
         precipitation. In trace amounts Selenium is a
                        51




        micronutrient; at higher levels (over 2mg/l)
        it may have adverse effects on mammals. Some
        studies 	have indicated that Selenium increased
        the susceptibility to dental caries in early
        life.

6.02.4 	 TURBIDITY (SUSPENDED SOLIDS)

        The presence of Turbidity in a water body is
        mostly noxious for the interception of sun
        radiations, thus disturbing the regular
        chlorophyll photosynthesis.  In many cases
        suspended solids may directly damage fishes by
        means of abrasion or choking action or,
        indirectly, preventing them from a good sight
        of the prey, thus interfering with food
        assumption.

6.02.5 	 These have toxic effect on human health if
         present in drinking water above 0.05mg/1
         concentration.

6.02.6 	 METALS

        Copper concentration above 0.05mg/1 provides the
        water with astringent flavour, colour and
        corrosive properties. Lead content (even due to
        the use of lead pipes or of plastic pipes
        stabilized with lead compounds) may accumulate
        in shell-fish.   Zinc gives the water an
        astringent flavour and opalescence.   Iron causes
        unpleasant taste, colour, turbidity and iron­
        bacterial proliferation. Cadmium and Nickel,
        fortunately not present in NCZ discharges, are
        very toxic even in small concentrations.

6.02.7 	 SULPHATES

        In presence of Magnesium or Sodium, Sulphates,
        if ingested cause gastro-intestinal irritation.
                        52


7.00 	   PRESENT EFFLUENT TREATMENTS
         At present NCZ Kafue factory is provided with
         two effluent treatment facilities, one
         dedicated to Sulphuric Acid Plant and the other
         for the 	remaining areas; within this latter the
         settling pond and cooling tower system for hot
         slurries from coal gasification is inserted, at
         present operated in autonomous way, but before
         interconnected with the main system. A
         separate talk must be dedicated to the lagoons
         system.
7.01 	   FACTORY EFFLUENT SYSTEM (Refer to the part of
         the Drawing 605-0049 enclosed by dotted lines
         and entitled "Existing Neutralization Plant")
         The effluents treated in the Plant are the
         following;­
         - The so-called "S"-Effluent (point of sampling
           IW4) corning from Coal Gasification (the "A"­
           Effluent which was coming from the Carbon
           Dioxide removal at present does not exist any
           more due to the change of the removal
           process).
         - The "c" Effluent (point of sampling IW2) from
           Ammonia, Nitric Acid, Ammonium Nitrate,
           Ammonium Sulphate and NPK Plants.
         - "0" Effluent (point of sampling IW3) from
           Compressor House, Air Separation and Water
           Treatment (Precipitator and Demineralisation
           Unit) Plants.
         "B" Effluent orignates mainly from the T1201
         Cooling Washer for cleaning the gas corning from
         Gasifiers; the resulting Hot slurry (about
         40Deg.C) is conveyed by a gravity canal to the
         Four settling ponds A321 in which separation of
         coal dust from clear water 1s supposed to
         occur. After sedimentation the clear water
         recycles to T1201 Wash Water Cooling Tower;
         the average flowrate with three running
         Gasifiers is 360m3/hr. If too high water
         losses occur due to evaporation, windage or
         other a make-up water from A601-E01 is
         provided. Two slurry pumps (1211 A/B: 80m3/hr
         13.89 Bar) are sending the slurry collected
         at the bottom of the settling ponds to the
         dedicated lagoon outside the factory fence,
         from where overflow water is supposed to corne
         back to the ponds.
                53




The condition of the whole system is poor. The
settling ponds are equipped with moving
scrapers not working since years and the
original slurry pumps, which were not good have
been substituted by a submersible pump which is
alternately moved from a pond to another by
means of a crane. The practical result is to
often get an off-specification raw synthesis
gas with some problems at Ammonia Plant.
Moreover the pumping station for the clarified
water from the lagoon is not working since it
was stolen years ago, resulting in waste of
water for the Factory and awkward overflow out
of the lagoon. Sound interventions are
required for this section in order to establish
an efficiency situation as regards solids
separation and clear water recycle from the
lagoon, as to the recommendations contained
in the chapter 9.00 "Liquid Effluents Control
Plant") •
However the present way of operating this
section of the Effluent Treatment Plant as an
autonomous service to the Gasification Units
remains an idea to share.
The so-called "c" Effluent, most of the time
basic, is conveyed by gravity to the proper
605 C09 "c" Effluent Pond of about 160m3
volume ; the contents of the pond is maintained
in agitation by means of air flowing through
slotted pipes positioned on the bottom. The
air is coming from the service network of the
factory, while in the past was furnished by
proper blowers. The pond material is concrete
lined with acid proof asphalt. By means of the
605 POS AlB pumps "C tt Effluent is then pumped
to 60S Cll neutralizing tank together with "0"
Effluent. Here neutralization begins with the
help, if necessary, of lime milk or sulphuric
acid addition: this tank is provided with a
vertical mixer (Impeller Diameter 500mrn of
S.SKw power) and is built up in concrete coated
with epoxy paint.
DM Unit Effluent, together with sludge
intermittently spilt from Precipitator, is
collected into a transfer basin of about 100m3
volume located at the site of Water Treatment
Plant, from which is pumped through an aerial
pipe to the "0" Effluent double pond 605 C10
A/B. No more effluents are going at present
by gravity to this pond, due to blocks and
improper deviations of the sewerage system.
                 54



However the forecast figures for effluent
flowrates are low in comparison with "c"
effluent, so that it looks singular to provide
storage volume of 2 x 160m3 for the minor one.
The material of construction of "D" effluent
double pond is concrete lined with acid-proof
mortar.
The 605 neutralizing tank has a volume of about
22m3, such as to assure the contact time of
five minutes sufficient for a "flash mixer"
service. A pH indicator-controller regulates
the neutralization. The neutralized effluents
flow by gravity to the so-called "Balance Tank"
605 C08 (volume about 480m3) located
underground and built up of concrete line with
water-proof mortar where the neutralization
goes to completion; a pH indicator is inserted
into the Balance Tank in order to verify the
efficiency of neutralization. The water
contents of Balance Tank is maintained under
agitation by means of bubbling air. This
allows the mixing of the mass to be neutralized
but involves the solids to be kept in
suspension.
The outcoming stream from the Balance Tank then
flows by gravity through an open trench (point
of sampling IW1) to a pit where it joins the
sanitary sewage effluent so as to be conveyed
together to the main Kafue Township Council
Sewer line. As it results from the analyses
the pH of the final effluent from Balance Tank
is almost always within the correct limits, but
it is sometimes due to dilution with raw water
injection into the trench or directly into
Balance Tank from the nearby water intake pipe
for the factory (which usually is conveying an
amount of raw water exceeding the actual need
of the factory); this latter operation
represents a very poor ecology.

Sometimes, if Kafue Township Council waste
water treatment Plant suffers some troubles,
the effluent is diverted, by opening a slide
gate, to the storm water, from where it reaches
directly the Kasenje River.
To complete the description of this plant, it
must be mentioned that there was a section of
the plant (consisting in reaction tank,
clarifier and decomposition tank by means of
Chlorine) operating with a view to treat
Cyanide rich wash water; at present this
section of the plant is completely abandoned,
due to the change of C02 removal process to
Methanol, which causes very much less Cyanide
contents; the condition of this plant section
is a rust mass covered with deep layers of coal
dust piled up from year to year.

7.02 	   SULPHURIC ACID PLANT (SAP) EFFLUENT
         TREATMENT FACILITY (refer to Drawing
         ZS BOO 12
         There is a series of discontinuous acidic back
         washings, spillages, washings and drainings
         (as to the list of which refer to SAP Plant
         waste water stream paragraph 3.11 which are
         collected into an antiacid painted basin (V100'
         volume 137m3) where the effluent (point of
         sampling SAP1) is pumped from by means of Pl001
         at present sUbstituted by the pyrite heap pit
         pump Pl003 to the neutralization tank V907
         (diameter 2.4m, volume l2.6m3) at the rate of
         10m3/hr (V100l effluent represents point of
         sampling SAP 1).
         Other continuous process etfluents from the gas
         purification section (namely V20l Settler,
         Radial Flow Thickener type, Diameter 9m, for
         dilute Sulphuric Acid coming from wet dirty S02
         gas cooling Tower and from T 202 Washing Packed
         Tower for the removal of fine ,dusts and
         fluorides) are collected in the acid waste
         water basin V90l (volume 39m3) from where are
         pumped (point of sampling SAP 2) to the two
         neutralization tanks v902 and v903 in series.
         Neutralization occurs by means of lime
         addition. The effluents both from
         neutralization tank V907 and from V902-V903
         flow by gravity to the so-called ageing tank
         V904 (volume about 80m, equipped with two 5.5
         Kw paddle agitators) where che chemical
         reactions finish.
         It is necessary to point out that even the
         Calcine Slurry from V108 mixer, which
         constitutes the main waste from SAP, is pumped
         to the third neutralization tank V907; this
         Calcine represents the Pyrite roasting by­
         product and is collected from the roaster
         itself and from the first (most part) and
         second stage cyclones into an agitated mixer
         tank (V10S, diameter 2920rnm, height 3l50rnm)
         where it is dissolved by means of another
         group of effluents, accumulated into the pit
         V1002 (volume about 122m3), located in position
         adjacent to V1001. Main constituent of Calcine
         is Iron Oxide (about 50% Fe203) but, due to the
         lack of an iron and steel industry in Zambia,
         these contents cannot be exploited. Other
         constituents are metals like copper, Zinc,
         Lead, Arsenic and Selenium besides Calcium,
         Magnesium, Silica and some Sulphur; the solids
         contents of Calcine effluent from Vl08 is
         average 5-6%.
                56



The effluents utilized for dissolving Calcine
in the Mixer Tank are coming from the raw water
treatment facility, as follows:
Blow down from V502 Precipitator, overflow from
V503 Intermediate Tank, backwashings of V504
A/B valveless filters, overflow from V509
treated water storage tank and overflow from
V601 Cooling Water Pit. All these effluents
are collected in the pit V1002 from where the
pump Pl002 conveys them to the V108 Calcine
Mixer Tank.
Since V1002 Pit is often full, large part of
these effluents overfloods to the road, going
through the storm water sewer to the final
point of discharge SW2.
From the ageing tank V904 the liquid effluent
discharge pumps P902 A/B send the overall
neutralized effluent (point of sampling SAP 3)
to the Lagoon, located some kilometers outside
the Factory fence. The final effluent pH is
very high, about 12, in order to avoid sound
corrosion of the pumps and line to lagoon; the
pumps are even subject to considerable
abrasion effect, due to high solids content.
The daily lime consumption as 100% is about
five tonnesi the lime is fed as 5% suspension.
Owing to the pumps heavy duty and poor
maintenance sometimes it happens that the
final effluent, instead of being pumped to
the dedicated lagoon, is spread all around
to flow directly to Kasenje River through
point SW3 (or even SW4). No water return
from the Lagoon is provided: this represents
a big ecological fault, as we shall deal with
in next paragraph 7.03.
This effluent treatment process devised by the
SAP supplier appears suffering from lack of a
suitable destination for the Calcine byproducti
hence the idea to accumulate all, together with
liquid effluents, neutralized as well as
possible in a site far from the plant.
The big corrosion and abrasion problems
relevant to the plant together with the poor
design of sewerage systems, continuously
overflooding from industrial to storm water
trenches, complete the frame of the pollution
problems from this plant, which represents one
of the biggest annoyances of NCZ factory.
                     57




7.03   SLURRY LAGOONS (refer to Drawing 605 - 0032)
       The Lagoons system is located about 2Kms
       outside the southern fence of the factory.
       The furtherest corner of Calcine Lagoon is
       some 300m distance from the water intake pump
       house for the factory and 500m from Kafue River
       high flood level.
       There are three small lagoons already full with
       coal dust and ash, one slurry lagoon (No 8) not
       yet full and one Calcine lagoon (No 5:
       dedicated to Sulphuric Acid Plant Effluent from
       the waste water treatment facility illustrated
       in the previous paragraph) at present about one
       third full. The walls of the lagoons are made
       up of soil with well compacted hard corel the
       slope of the walls is 45Deg., the height is 2m
       for slurry lagoons and 3.5m for Calcine lagoon.
       The feeding of A321 slurry from the factory
       occurs through two 5 inches pipes (one spare),
       while coal ash is periodically· transported by
       means of trucks and spread over the dried
       slurry layer.
       Calcine slurry feeding from SAP is through a
       6 inches pipe.
       Since the evaporation capacity of this zone is
       reported to be about 1780mm per year, while the
       rainfall is 1020mm per year, the net
       evaporation is about760mm per year, so that for
       each 100,000 square meters of area the volume
       of evaporating water is 76,OOOm3 per year, that
       is 8.6m3/hr. It appears evident that the
       provided areas, about 192,OOOm2 for lagoon No 5
       and 320,OOOm2 for lagoon No 4 are not enough to
       evaporate all the water contents in the two
       supposed aOm3/hr streams from SAP and A321
       Settling Ponds (which contain an average of
       5-6% of solids) and that recycle of the
       surnatant water or overflow is necessary. As
       a matter of fact the provided pumping station
       for recycling exceeding water from slurry
       lagoon is not working as the pump was stolen in
       the past, while as regards calcine SAP lagoon
       no water recycling system was provided since
       the start-up of the plant.
       Moreover during the construction of the calcine
       lagoon a mistake was committed to realizing
       properly a side wall which resulted in a lower
       sector allowing the passage of water.
                  58




A remedy worse than the damage was found for
this defect, by installing a large overflow pipe
crossing the wall of lagoon which is discharging
towards the surrounding country. Furthermore
the slurry feeding line is broken along the path
and at present i t is discharging into the same
calcine lagoon so that the actual overflow is
relevant to an overall stream of about 160m3/hr;
the overflow analysis (Annex 7) shows that this
steam is systematically out of the Zambian law
for sulphates. Moreover, even if not pointed
out by the few analyses carried out, it still
visibly contains coal dusts coming from the
dissolving coal ash layer (due to the action of
the leakage from a point on the incoming pipe).
In the course of the study analyses of the
surrounding soil and water ponds were carried
out in order to find out suspended. seepages
and some wells were dug with the purpose of
investigating eventual pollution of water
table. The results relevant to this part of
the study are illustrated in the chapter
14.00 deciated to "Solid wastes·.
It remains to notice that some people from the
surrounding villages are used to fishing from
the liquid fraction of the disposal ponds,
despite the protection fences that in the past
were cut down (probably fish eggs were
introduced into the lagoons through the
emissions of raw water which occur at the
factory). Obviously nobody can guarantee about
the quality of fish taken out from a pond where
an industry is discharging water containing
Lead, Arsenic and other chemical compounds.

8.00   PRESENT SITUATION QE THE SEWERAGE SYSTEMS
       There are three different sewerage systems, at
       least in theory, in the factory: for industrial
       effluents (supposed polluted from the
       production plants), storm water drainages
       (supposed to collect only rainy water) and
       sanitary sewage (for offices lavatories
       discharges and the canteen). The up to date
       layout of these systems is shown by means of
       different pen marks in the enclosed drawing
       A201 - 0064, according to the legend there
       included. Even the line pieces running over­
       head or underground are there indicated. Most
       drainage systems are of the open trench type;
       this is responsible, as Nez factory main raw
       material is coal dust, for the invevitable
       loading into the water flowing through the
       sewers of large amounts of powder.s, especially
       in proximity to coal storage yard, of several
       kinds (coal, soil, ammonium nitrate, NPK) and
       other outward material (sacks, wood and metal
       scraps, grass, stones and so on). This state
       of things involves higher levels of pollution
       from suspended solids and frequent blockages of
       the sewer parts with subsequent deviation to
       another sewer system.
       One of the outstanding environmental problems
       at Kafue factory is the flowing of very
       polluted streams into sewer systems provided
       only for rainy water, thus not conveying to
       any waste water facility (neither in-plant nor
       centralized one), with the aggravating
       circumstance that the final points of discharge
       are spread along all the four sides of the
       factory perimeter. Responsible for this state
       of affairs is, besides initial design or
       construction defects, poor maintenance and
       cleaning practice of the open trenches.
       In the course of the study some major anomalies
       were individuated, as herein after reported,
       but a warm recommendation is addressed to every
       Process Engineer to investigate inside one's
       plant for every small anomaly, improper
       deviation to the wrong sewer, as built
       modification, construction defect which may
       give rise to pollution. The location of main
       anomalies are marked with special sign and
       figure in the same drawing A 201 - 0064 (see
       the legend).

B.01   MIXINGS

       1 	 At the coal handling site the branch of
           industrial sewer conveying the ..c .. effluent
           to 60S-COg pond is an open trench badly
           covered with concrete plates rather in bad
           condition. Apart from this fact, that by
           itself involves the loading of considerable
           amounts of coal dust, as the crossed area is
           very dusty, there is practised a junction
           with the storm water by means of the
           abatement of some meters of floor (not
           considered in the design) that allows part
           of the polluted "c" effluent to flow towards
           final point of discharge SW7 instead of
           being conveyed to the waste water treatment
           facility (see area portion marked with 1 in
           the Annexed Drawing A201-0064).
       2 	 At the coal gasification site, by the corner
           of E72 road with N257, the effluent coming
           from compressor house and air separation
           plant through the industrial sewer, and
           supposed to go to the treatment, is, on the
           contrary totally deviated to the storm water
           by means of an underground pipe crossing the
           N257 road that connects the collection pit
           from the plants with the open storm water
           trench located on the same abovementioned
           drawing). That is owing to the blocking of
           industrial sewer in a down stream pOSition
           by cooling spray pond.
       3 	 Another direct connection of the industrial
           sewer with the storm water draining can be
           found just by the sampling point IW9, at the
           corner of N182 and E72 roads, where a piece
           of pipe puts in connection the two kinds of
           sewers (Area 3 of the same Drawing).
       4 	 At NPK Plant the pump installed in the pit
           receiving polluted discharges is normally
           not working; it was supposed to convey waste
           water through an overhead line on the pipe
           rack to the effluent treatment facility but,
           owing to the abovementioned permanent
           shutdown of the only pump, the effluents are
           discharged into the storm water draining by
           means of a channel dug on the floor; final
           point of discharge is SW10.
       5   At Ammonium Sulphate Plant site too the
           pump, supposed to send to the same effluent
           facility as above, is not working; thus the
         effluents flow towards other directions
         through the storm water drainages to arrive
         to SWl and SW10 final point. Moreover, it
         is necessary to note for this plant that a
         direct derivation flowing into Kasenje River
         was realised by somebody from the discharge
         pipe of the pump.
8.02   BLOCKING AND BREAKINGS
       6 	 At Coal Gasification site one of the
           trenches conveying water washings to the
           A321 settling ponds is often blocked because
           of too much coal ashes that pile up in this
           area, thus deviating the washings charged
           with the coal dust to the storm water (and
           finally to SW7).
       7 	 Again at Coal Gasification the internal
           industrial sewer must be broken somewhere;
           infact water charged with coal dust is
           flowing through the electrical trench
           parallel to road E72. At a certain point
           from the electrical trench it was realized a
           small channel, digging the floor, through
           which the polluted water joins the storm
           water drainage along road E72.
       8 	 At water treatment plant the resins
           regeneration eluates are conveyed to the
           storage pit through an open channel which
           has even direct connection with the
           industrial sewer located at the other side
           of the N257 road (the same blocked, already
           mentioned at point 2). Since often the
           water level in the pit is too high. the
           water treatment effluent overflows from this
           channel and mixes with water flowing through
           the storm water drainage crossing the open
           channel.
       9 	 Then the same storm water draining along the
           N257 road mentioned above is blocked in the
           area opposite the cooling spray pond, so a
           small channel scrapped up from the floor
           provides an immission to the trench flowing
           to A321 Settling Ponds. In this way at
           least a polluted stream which was flowing
           through the storm water drainage system to
           the usual wrong point of discharge SW7 is
           conveyed to a treatment (but if the eluates
           pit is overflowing acidic water can go to
           the settling ponds).
                        02




       10 	 For long ti~e during the analytical campaign
            the underground pipe crossing N182 road to
            connect the two branches of industrial sewer
            was corroded and broken, so that a plate was
            put in the sewer in order to let the
            effluent overflood into the storm water
            trench (so going to SW7). More than one
            month passed before repairing.
       11 	 Storm water trench is choked on the southern
            side of N182 road, so the streams pass to
            the other side of the trench crossing the
            road through the existing connection. They
            reach the same pit located at W57.302 to
            flow to SW7. The pipe connected with the
            pit got broken long time just near the
            connection.
       12 	 At present the 450mm sewer, conveying the
            mixture of industrial effluent/sanitary
            sewage from the factory to the main council
            sewer line is broken in proximity of the new
            Boiler under erection, so pouring the waste
            water into the open storm wa~er trench below
            and supplying a big flow (about 90m3/hr) to
            SW8 that was almost standing during the
            analytical campaign.
       13 	 The concrete surrounding the "D" effluent
            sewer is broken in proximity of the crossing
            N182 road, thus allowing the connection with
            the near storm water sewer which is even by
            itself polluted since it is crossing the
            very dusty coal gasification area.
8.03   IMPROPER CONVEYINGS
       14 	 Surely an improper conveying is an Ammonium
            Nitrate site where a stream coming from the
           plant flows to the storm water drainage and
           may be it is responsible, together with road
           washings, for high nitrate and ammonia
           concentrations found in SW9. It is very
           likely that by examining into details all
           the designs and constructions of the
           existing sewerage systems, as built, many
           more improper conveyings can be found.
       15 	 Some "reverse" improper conveyings are
            present with almost all the gas holders.
            Infact considerable amounts of water
            utilized for sealing are unexplanably
            conveyed to industrial sewer, while they are
            clean, thus contributing to useless
                       03




          hydraulic load for the waste water treatment
          facility. Only the sealing water for the
          311-V10 nitrogen holder located at the N322
          road near the factory fence is properly
          conveyed to storm water sewer.
8.04   SULPHURIC ACID PLANT EFFLUENTS
       16 	 The liquid effluent discharge pumps P902 A/B
            are often out of order because of the heavy
            duty to suffer in terms of abrasion and
            corrosion, notwithstanding the particular
            material (high Chromium Cast Iron) adopted
            so that the final effluent containing
            calcine and neutralized streams ends
            directly to Kasenje River through the storm
            water sewer instead of going to decantate
            in the Lagoon.
       17 	 There is a crossing of open trenches
            conveying industrial effluents and rainy
            water with the consequence of passage of
            polluted streams to the storm water drainage
            and from which it flows to SW3, in case of
            frequent effluent overflooding.
8.05   LATEST MIXING
       18 	 At gas purification site along the northern
            side of N182 road there has recently been
           .realized a direct connection between the
            industrial effluent IW6 (running at higher
            level but broken and blocked) and the storm
            water sewer below, by means of a small
            channel dug in the concrete.

9.00   LIQUID EFFLUENT CONTROL PLAN
       In this chapter we shall indicate the
       recommendations that we feel like putting
       forward in order to solve the heavy pollution
       problems relevant to Nez Kafue factory liquid
       effluents. The reasons for such proposals and
       the advantages that can be got with the
       adoption of these proposals will be explained.
       Precautions to be taken for a proper and
       reliable realization of the proposed
       interventions will be herein indicated as far
       as possible in this preliminary study stage.
       The cost estimates relevant to each
       intervention are shown in the chapter 10.00.
9.01   SEWERAGE SYSTEM REARRANGEMENT
       Any attempts to restore the pollution situation
       originating from NCZ Kafue factory cannot leave
       sewer rearrangement out of conSideration,
       otherwise too much money would be wasted in
       vain as investment and operating costs in order
       to realize the too big and numerous treatment
       facilities that should necessitate in the
       actual present sewers situation.
       For this purpose we suggest to cancel the above
       mentioned 18 main anomalies as below
       indicated. Moreover we suggest to transform
       from open trenches to closed pipes (of diameter
       such as to ensure the same flowratel all the
       branches of industrial sewers crossing coal
       gasification and coal preparation areas.
       As regards industrial sewers to waste water
       facility this would produce the benefit of not
       overloading uselessly the already polluted
       streams with coal dust.
       The necessary inspection wells must stretch
       themselves well above ground and must be
       covered by dust-tight plates, though easily
       removable for inspection.
       Every inspection well must be realized with
       regular form and calibrated. A graduated scale
       in centimeters must be provided on one side
       from the bottom of the well in order to easily
       carry out flowrate measurements by means of
       Chronometer and observing level differences
       obtainable by closing the discharge pipes with
       plates.
                 65




As material of construction, by realizing the
sewer pipes of high density polyethilene, a
very low roughness Index will be ensured, thus
allowing a larger flow, even with small slopes.
The pipes can be positioned exploiting as part
of excavation of the same existing open
channels. Attention will be paid to provide
suitable rigid diaphragms above the pipes in
case of road crossings.
As regards the main anomalies already pointed
out and mentioned in the previous chapter we
suggest   to   settle   as   priority
interventions as follows:­
 1   COAL GASIFICATION
     Destroy the abnormal direct connection
     between industrial and storm water sewers,
     by building up again a concrete wall of
     separation and transforming the open
     trench of the industrial sewer to closed
     pipe.
 2   COAL HANDLING
     Remove all the blocking of the "0" effluent
     industrial sewer, realizing with closed
     pipes the crucial crossings of dusty areas,
     and destroy the abnormal connection with
     storm water draining.
 3   ~   (Pit by impure N2 Holder)
     Destroy the direct connection with storm
     water sewer re-establishing the underground
     pipe connection to .. c.. effluent sewer.
 4   NPK PLANT
     Install a new couple of pumps more reliable
     than present ones.
 5   AMMONIUM SULPHATE PLANT
     Install a new couple of pumps. Destroy the
     pipe branch directly pouring into Kasenje
     River.
 6· COAL GASIFICATION
     Remove materials blocking the sewer and
     transform it to closed pipe.
                    66




7    COAL GASIFICATION
     Repair point of breakage and remove the
     abusive small channel dug from the cable
     trench.
8    WATER TREATMENT
     Provide start-up of transfer pumps at lower
     levels of water in the pit in order to
     avoid overflows as much as possible.
     Transform the open channel for the eventual
     overflow from the pit in closed pipe just
     for ten metres tract crossing the storm
     water sewer in order to avoid not wished
     mixings.
 9   uB" EFFLUENT   ~    STORM WATER SEWERS CROSSINGS
     Re-establish the wall of separation between
     the two kinds of sewers and remove the
     cause of blockage by transforming a tract
     of open trench flowing to A321 settling
     ponds to closed pipe.
10   N182 ROAD CROSSING QK IW6 EFFLUENT
     Review very carefully the recent repairing,
     remove the cause of blockages changing into
     material more resistant to corrosion.
11   STORM WATER SEWER
     Remove cause of blockage and repair broken
     pipe.
12   SANITARY/EFFLUENT SEWER
     Substitute the broken 450mm pipe branch.
13   "D" EFFLUENT CROSSING OF N182 ROAD
     Repair the broken piece of concrete which
     allows the mixing.
14   AMMONIUM NITRATE
     Deviate the effluent path from storm water
     to the nearest industrial sewer.
15   ~   HOLDERS
     Deviate the clean sealing water from the
     gas holders to the nearest storm water
     sewer.
                           67




         16 	 SAP DISCHARGE PUMPS
             The suggested intervention to solve this
             problem is illustrated in the ambit of the
             review of SAP liquid effluent disposal
             system.
         17 	 SAP SEWERS CROSSING AND MIXING
             Even here the possible mixing must be
             avoided realizing some ten meters of closed
             pipes instead of open trenches at the place
             of crossing.
         18 	 IW6 EFFLUENT MIXING WITH 

              STORM WATER SEWER 

             Remove the materials blocking the
             industrial sewer and fill up the abusive
             channel dug for direct connection with
             concrete.
9.02 	   STUDY FOR THE COMPLETION OF
         SEWERAGE REARRANGEMENT
         The above interventions surely will eliminate
         the major anomalies relevant to the present
         situation or sewer systems, so allowing that
         as most as possible of suspended solids,
         nitrates, ammonia, sUlphates and metals will
         be conveyed through the suitable sewer to a
         treatment facility to undergo a purification
         process and not directly to natural water
         course.

         However some further sound ameliorations in
         this direction can surely be obtained by
         pushing forward the detailed analysis of the
         whole sewerage system in all the factory,
         including even a critical examination of the
         initial design, a punctual verifying of all the
         construction particulars and the elaboration of
         remedial modifications.
         We believe that such work can be carried out in
         two months' time by three people, a Process
         Engineer and a Geometer coordinated by the
         Environmental Control Superintendent (to be
         appointed as soon as possible: see paragraph
         9.14) under the responsibility of the Technical
         Manager. These people can be chosen from the
         factory personnel, if available, or otherwise
         the task can be assigned to an external firm.
The scope of the work will be to examine all
the sewer detailed drawings section by section
of the factory, to check with elevation
measurements on site the correspondence with
the as-built reality and to suggest deviations
and other modifications, keeping in mind the
following principles:­
(a) 	 Storm water drainages must receive only
      rainy water from surely not contaminated
      areas and clean streams (such as steam
      condensates, if not polluted and not
      recovered, gas holders sealing water,
      eventually not recycled cooling water,
      overflows from treated water basins and
      so on).
(b) 	 Industrial waste water sewe"rs must receive
      process discharges (continuous of batch)
      from the plants, rainy water originating
      from contaminated areas (eventually local
      drainage channels connected with storm
      water sewerage system must be provided in
      case of exceptional rains), washing of the
      floors and of the contaminated roads.
(c) 	 Sanitary sewer must receive only 

      discharges from latrines and the canteen. 

(d) 	 Every improper conveying of a kind of 

      water into the wrong sewer must be 

      eliminated. 

(e) 	 Every mixing, even potential, between the
      various types of waters must absolutely be
      avoided.
(f) 	 Open trenches for industrial sewers in 

      dusty areas must be avoided. 

The suggested modifications subsequent to this
study will be carried out as maintenance works.
One of the objectives of this study must be the
complete elimination of pollution from the
storm water final points of discharge SW9 SW8
SW6 SW5. That is why it would be too expensive
to collect small streams along all the sides of
the Nez complex by means of collection pits,
pumps and long pipes of discharge to the
centralized waste water facility.
As regards storm water sewerage system only SW7
can be allowed to carry massive suspended
                         69




         solids pollution, since the relevant branches
         of sewer serve the Coal Storage Yard. As
         regards this point SW7 we recommend the
         realization of the interventions suggested in
         the next two paragraphs 9.03 and 9.04.
9.02.1   CONTROL QK WATER CONSUMPTION
         In parallel with the above study the same task
         group can carry out a complete survey about
         overall water consumption in the plants in
         order to individuate all the abusive withdrawls
         from the firewater network, the once through
         streams drawn from the cooling water
         recirculation system and so on. The main
         purpose of this study is to explain the
         excessive discrepancy between the about
         700m3/hr resulting from the two major discharge
         streams, namely IW1 and SW7, and the scarce
         100m3/hr resulting as approximate overall total
         from the figures declared during the interviews
         object of the survey on pollution production
         from the plants in chapter 3.00, as regards
         the plants apart from SAP.
         Once individuated the abnormal withdrawals,
         these must be prohibited by means of suitable
         interventions or procedures. For instance
         excessive waste of water, that surely at
         present occurs at an extent many times larger
         than declared from the same plant chiefs, must
         be avoided, especially in the areas involving
         dusts of fertilizers, by increasing the
         practice of sweeping the lost materials as
         solids and recover them as a valuable product
         instead of dispersing them into the sewers with
         sensible increase of water amount and
         pollutants contents (Ammonia, Nitrates,
         Sulphates, Phosphates and suspended solids
         as coal dust or ash).
         The experience teaches that water savings up to
         50% are possible in this way, with all the
         subsequent benefits on pollution level
         decrease.
9.03     FIRST RAINY WATER TREATMENT FACILITY
         As a matter of fact all the areas, covered or
         uncovered, of an industrial complex are
         potentially polluted, so that when rainfalls
         occur we can be sure that storm water flowing
         in the sewers is not clean, but heavily
         polluted, due to entrainment of both dusty
         materials deposited on the areas and of
         emissions from the stacks (802 and others).
                70




Even more so it is valid for a complex like
NeZ factory where raw materials is coal dust
and final products are Ammonium Nitrate and
Sulphate and NPK fertilizers.
So that it is very reasonable to propose even
for NeZ what is the common practice in every
factory of providing a proper facility for the
collection of the waters of first rainfall and
their delivery to the waste water treatment
plant, which will be the present neutralization
unit completed with a new clariflocculator (see
the proper paragraph 9.08). This intervention,
after realizing the sewers system rearrangement
mentioned in the previous paragraphs, and in
plant treatments and interventions (paragraph
9.07) can be limited to the main storm water
sewer skirting the coal yard and conveying to
the final point of discharge SW7', the most
polluted one in the whole factory as to the
results of the analytical campaign.
This would prevent large amounts of suspended
solids from contaminating the open drainage
into which the sewer is discharging from the
point SW7, and from this the new Kasenje River
and from this the Kafue River. We would like
to stress here that Kafue River is already
contaminated from big deposits of coal dusts
and ashes coming from Nez factory, as pointed
out during the boat trip mentioned in paragraph
5.03.

The first rainy water treatment facility will
simply consist of an intercepting device
installed along the 675mm (27") storm water
sewer, designed to divert all dry weather flow
and first rainy weather flow to a collection
tank, realized underground in concrete and of
a pumping station positioned into the
collection tank in order to pump out the
collected waters to the effluent treatment
plant.
The intercepting device may be a diversion
weir of the overflow type or a leaping weir
(an opening in the invert of the sewer of such
dimensions as to permit the flow that is to be
intercepted to fall through) and must be
hydraulically well designed in order to allow
eventual following rainfalls surely consisting
of water cleaner than the previous) to pass
over and continue along the sewer to the storm­
water outlet into the open drainage (point
SW7) •
As for some patterns of intercepting devices,
see bibliography 3.
The design criterion for the collection tank
can be to retain 2 days amount of maximum
rainfall.
Since the most rainy days in Zambia present
30mm of rainfall and the area involved in SW7
sewer (Area II plus Coal Yard) is about 20,000
square meters, it means a volume of:
2 x 30.10-3.20,000   ~   1,200m3
That we suggest to raise up to 2,500m3
(depth 4m rectangular plan of 625m2) in
order to provide a certain holding basin even
for the day weather wastewaters that surely
will persist also after the sewer system
rearrangement.
As we estimate this latter amount about
200m3/hr the relevant pumping station,
consisting of centrifugal vertical pumps
installed in a corner of the basin, will
be sized for facing this flowrate plus a
rate of first rainy weather water capable
of draining all the stored quantity in one
day, eg   1200 : 50m3/hr
           24
for a total of 250m3/hr.
The collection basin must be operated
practically empty in dry weather, with the
pumping station always running at 200m3/hr,
while after rainfalls this latter will run
at 250m3/hr, delivering the waste waters to
the effluent treatment plant (liD" Effluent
Pond) •
When the basin is full or the. storm intensity
is around the maximum levels the following
rainfalls will pass over the intercepting
device to directly discharge into the open
drainage.

9.04   STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM
       The above interventions, once realised, will
       surely mitigate the hydraulic and pollutant
       load 	to the storm water drainages which, in
       theory, will result in clean and full only
       during the rainy season. However, due to the
       poor 	condition of the storm water draining
       branch discharging into the open drainage
       through the final point SW7 (about 25cm of
       sediment layer) and subsequent risk of over­
       flooding during the rainy season we recommend
       an overall treatment for the final discharge
       channel (similar to the one suggested by Brian
       Colquhoun and Partners Consulting Engineers to
       the new Kasenje River) as follows:­
       (a) 	 Removal of the silt deposits from the
             sewer pipe by means of mechanical devices.
       (b) 	 Totally clear the channel of all reed
             growth, shrubs, excessive grass, rubbish
             etc for a distance extending 200m.
       (c) 	 Cut and shape to a regular trapezoidal
             section with side slopes at a gradient
             of 1:2 the above mentioned, providing
             this open drainage with a concrete lining
             to achieve a constant value for the
             roughness coefficient of about 0.015.
9.05   WATER INTAKE IMPROVING INTERVENTIONS
       As reported in other part of the study, the
       Water Intake pumping stations both for
       Sulphuric Acid Plant and the remaining of the
       factory are usually operated at maximum
       capacity, even if the needs are much lower.
       That is why, choking the pump discharge, the
       water velocity is lower and too much sea weed
       can grow, so causing blockage of the discharge
       pipe.
       We suggest to install at the Water Intake
       Station a proper surface water intake screen
       of the self-cleansing type in order to stop
       the inflow of the Algae and other foreign
       bodies. Moreover from time to time it would
       be better to proceed with some shock injection
       of chlorine and specific algae-killing products
       for avoiding excessive accumulation (of course
       the installation of fixed devices for this
       purpose is not advisable owing to the long
       distance of the non-garrisoned Water Intake
       from the factory).
                           73




         This intervention will get the benefits of
         reducing power waste and avoiding clean water
         overflows in the factory, which turns into
         useless hydraulic overloads for the sewers or
         water facilities (here even involving waste of
         chemicals) with possible overflooding and
         mixing between different drainage systems.
9.06     Pw~CHASING   OF MOBILE OIL SKIMMERS
         In order to avoid excessive oil accumulation in
         some pits along the industrial sewers it is
         recommendable to provide the factory with at
         least two mobile oil skimmers and recovery
         system, in order to move these devices
         periodically from one point to another. Infact
         the pollution from oil is not so high to
         justify a fixed separation unit but
         accumulation in some pits, especially in
         proximity of compressor houses becomes
         considerable after many months of not cleaning
         practice.
9.07     IN-PLANT TREATMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS
         The nature of the origin sources of most
         discharges from Kafue factory plants, as
         resulted from the interviews mentioned in
         chapter 3.00, is such as to hardly suggest
         in-plant pretreatments for some streams.
         Infact only few particular process waste
         waters can be met and the major problems are
         arising for reasons of cleaning the plants or
         accidental leakages due to poor maintenance
         or washing the apparatus owing to too frequent
         shutdowns.
         So just some in-plant interventions will be
         suggested and for the rest recall to good
         maintenance, availability of spares for
         prompt substitution of the broken parts and
         some cleaning suggestions must be done.
9.07.1   ~    PREPARATION !tlQ GASIFICATION
         The factory must be provided expressly for
         these sections with one mobile industrial
         vacuum cleaning device of the mobile type
         trailed by means of lift truck. By regularly
         and periodically operating this device, capable
         of producing a SSOOmm H20 vacuum and of
         aspirating a quantity of at least 4t/hr, it
         will prevent the area surrounding the mills,
         the fuller pumps and everywhere the coal is
         dry to be excessively covered of fine coal
         dust with the consequence of polluting the
                           74



         storm water sewer (as regards industrial sewer
         crossing this area the pollution will be
         prevented realizing a closed pipe as already
         suggested in paragraph 9.01) and dispersing,
         by means of the winds, allover the factory.
         The vacuum cleaner will be equipped with
         discharge device of the screw type, in order
         to avoid a big cloud of dust when discharging
         the collected materials into the coal yard
         back. It will be possible to use the same
         equipment for cleaning the coal gasification
         area from the piles of coal ashes with the
         caution of cleaning the vacuum cleaner
         properly, after the discharge of the coal
         ashes into the lagoon, before using for coal
         dust, in order to avoid contamination of this
         latter.
         A rich series of spare parts will be purchased
         together with the main machinery,' in order to
         avoid long times of shutdown in case of
         maintenance needs.
         A sound relief even for industrial hygiene
         problems will arise from the adoption of this
         equipment.
9.07.2   AMMONIA STORAGE
         We recommend a sound and complete review of
         the refrigeration system relevant to this area,
         since it is clearly absurd that, even if
         sometimes, a certain amount of the valuable
         final product stored in the spheres must be
         vented to atmosphere or even discharged into
         the sewers just due to defiCiency of the
         refrigeration system.
         After having suffered all the production costs
         it is not admissable that even small quantities
         of Ammonia are utilized for creating air
         pollution, water pollution and industrial
         hygiene problems.
9.07.3   OLD NITRIC ACID PLANT (601)
         The plant must be equipped with a stainless
         steel (AISI 304) recovery tank of about 2m3 in
         order to recover acid from sampling lines and
         other drainages. From the collection tank a
         high prevalence pump will recycle to the system
         (bleaching tower). Moreover as regards the
         discharge of the Chloride contaminated acid
         from T04 trays a draining system must be
         installed able to send the contaminated acid
         to the product stock tank (similar to the one
         installed in A401 Plant).
                          75




9.07.4   NEW NITRIC ACID PLANT (A601)
         The present pit v-1201 is collecting even rainy
         water. It must be substituted by a closed tank
         and the recycle pump, often not working, must
         be 	reviewed or substituted by a more reliable
         one.

9.07.5   OLD AMMONIUM NITRATE PLANT (501)
         This plant together with the expansion one are
         highly pollutant. So a good deal of attention
         must be paid to every possible recovery of
         recycle intervention in these plants in order
         to reduce nitrates and Ammonia contents in the
         industrial effluent within the law standards.
         The following interventions are possible:­
         1 	 Recovery of continuous 1.3m3/hr condensate
             from first concentration (containing 1.5 ­
             2% Ammonium Nitrate plus free Ammonia) as
             process water in the nitrous gases absorber
             of the associated NItric Acid plant. The
             study about this recovery is in progress
             with the relevant plant Process Engineers.
         2 	 Connect to the existing recovery tank V25
             the sampling points at present missIng (80%
             Ammonium Nitrate solution from V04 and
             Nitric Acid Tank line to the reactor) and,
             if possible, all the drainages due to shut­
             downs of apparatus.
         3 	 Improve the maintenance of all the solid
             material handling equipments in order to
             reduce dust losses from chutes and other
             openings.
         4 	 Submit drums and buckets elevators to the
             aspiration of a fan connected with the
             existing wet cyclone separator scrubber
             system in order to recover Ammonium Nitrate
             solution in the V25 underground recovery
             tank.
             For this latter intervention, it is
             advisable to consult a solid handling
             equipment specialist.
         5   Abandon the practice of washing the floors
             with water by means of hose pipes, but adopt
             the habit of sweeping the large amounts of
             Ammonium Nitrate on the floors and roads
                          76




            collect in bags and recover or inside the
            same plant or in NPK plant. Unfortunately
            here the adoption of a vacuum cleaner of the
            type suggested for coal is not advisable due
            to the property of deliquescence of the
            particular product.
9.07.6   NEW AMMONIUM NITRATE PLANT (A5al I
         1 	 Like the Old Plant provide recycle of
             multiple effect concentration condensates
             (about 5.2m3/hr at 66 Deg.C from V1206
             collection tank) as process water to the
             absorber of the associated Nitric Acid
             Plant. This intervention too is in
             progress.
         2 	 Speed up the realization of the provided
             closed loop system (an underground recovery
             tank lined with stainless steel material)
             trying to collect as much as possible of
             sampling lines, possible overflows and
             shutdown drainages.
         3 	 Like the Old Plant improve the maintenance
             of solids handling equipment and adopt the
             cleaning practice of sweeping instead of
             washing the floors.
9.07.7   AMMONIUM SULPHATE AND NPK PLANTS
         1 	 Improve the maintenance of solids handling
             equipment, trying to reduce the losses.
         2 	 Recollect from the floors and recycle as
             much as possible of solids materials without
             washing the sewers. For this purpose it is
             advisable to purchase an Industrial Vacuum
             Cleaner dedicated to NPK plant since often
             in this plant many tons of materials are
             piled up due to various troubles. For this
             plant it is better to forecast, instead of
             a mobile unit, a fixed installation with a
             pipe network distributed at the various
             floors.
         3 	 Install a new couple of pumps in the pits
             collecting the discharges (as already
             mentioned in paragraph 9.011.
                       77




9.08 	   REVIEW OF LIQUID EFFLUENT DISPOSAL SYSTEM
         (see drawing No 605 - 0049)
         The adoption of the previous recommendation
         about sewerage system rearrangements, water
         intake and implant interventions will surely
         achieve a sensible reduction of the polluting
         load in industrial effluents and moreover, will
         concentrate pollutants on only one stream, the
         waste water facility feeding.
         At present this facility suffers from the
         absence of any suspended solids removal
         equipment (it is appropriate to be reminded
         of the surprising condition of the Kafue River
         portion 	by the confluence of Kasenje which was
         found during the already mentioned boat trip):
         so that 	we suggest to review this plant by
         realizing above ground a new unit of
         clariflocculation in the area now occupied by
         the old 	not utilized cyanide removal unit so
         that the neutralization plant will remain the
         same, while the new clarification unit will be
         able to 	treat 500m3/hr of polluted water (since
         we estimate that a 200m3/hr reduction in waste­
         water flow is possible due to the above
         mentioned interventions as regards to internal
         recoveries in the production plants, no over­
         flows of raw water after installations of
         screen at Water Intake, no floors washing and
         control of abusive water consumptions) with
         about 2000mg/1 of suspended solids.
         The clariflocculator can be either of the
         forced internal sludge recirculation (by means
         of a turbine) type or of the simple crossflow
         type equipped with mechanical flocculator drive
         assemblies. The difference between the two
         alternatives are the higher cost for the
         recirculation unit together with minor
         dimensions: 18 mts diameter for a recirculation
         unit versus 30 mts for a mechanical flocculator
         clarifier, which is simpler to operate. Both
         can run with or without flocculant addition.
         We suggest to experimentally study in operation
         the advantages of adding a poleylectrolite as
         coagulant.
         It is better to provide facilities for scum
         removal (a rotating scum blade attached to the
         bridge) •
         The sludge collected by the proper valves can
         be stored in a pit from where it will be

         settling ponds operating for "B" effluent.

9.09 	   REVIEW OF "a" EFFLUENT WASH WATER SYSTEM
         As regards the autonomous treatment for the so­
         called "a" effluent from gasifiers it is
         recommendable to arrqnge the repairing of the
         machinery installed into the existing settling
         ponds. Each pond must be provided with its own
         efficient scraper and slurry extraction pump.
         For this purpose we suggest to purchase from a
         specialised firm the new machinery to install
         in the existing ponds (so that 4 scraper
         bridges and 4 slurry pumps), sending the
         drawings of the settling ponds to allow a
         proper design. Such an intervention will
         improve the separation efficiency of the entire
         wash-water cooling tower system; thus resulting
         in a cleaner raw synthesis gas with less
         troubles to Ammonia plant.
9.10 	   THE PROaLEM OF AMMONIA AND NITRATES: PROpOSAL
         OF ION EXCHANGE UNIT FOR AMMONIA REMOVAL AND
         ii.MMONfUM NITRATERECOVERY               -­
         Till now the recommendations suggested will
         involve the benefits of ending the spreading
         or pollution without control in numerous points
         of discharge in the factory and to depurate the
         main waste water streams (IW1 and SW7) from the
         particular pollutant "suspended solids" (mainly
         coal dust). The major problem of Ammonia and
         Nitrate pollutants remains to be solved.
         If we pay attention both to the single analyses
         relevant to the campaing (Annex 3 pages 1 - 17)
         and to the average summary Tables 2 and 3, we
         realize that the Iron Ammonium contents in the
         waste waters is a lot beyond the amount tied to
         the Anion Nitrate in the molecule of Ammonium
         Nitrate; it means that Ammonium is bound even
         to other Anions, such as sulphates (so very
         probably coming from Ammonium Sulphate Plant),
         carbonates and some phosphates; moreover often
         a considerable amount of free Ammonia can be
         found in practically all the points of
         discharge and mainly in the major streams IWl
         and SW7.
         By means of the in-plant interventions
         suggested for the Ammonia, Nitric Acid,
         Ammonium Nitrate, Ammonium Sulphate and NPK
              79




Plants, it will be possible to reduce
considerably the quantities of Ammonium and
Nitrate, Sulphate and Phosphate Ions but sure
it will not be possible to reduce Ammonium
concentration below the Zambia regulation
standard of 12.1mg/1 as NH3 (10mg/l as
Nitrogen), since this latter is very low, even
if higher than most international standards.
Infact if we look at the figures of the tables
2 and 3, apart from SW9 and SW10 that must be
led back to the main streams IW1 and SW7 due to
sewer rearrangements, we realize that Nitrate
contents are in average of 480mg/1 that must be
reduced below the standard of 3S4mg/1 as N03
(80mg/1 as Nitrogen). This is quite achievable
if we adopt the recommendations already
indicated to avoid the arrival into the sewers
system of only part of the various tons of
solid Ammonium Nitrate particles that usually
are present in the two Ammonium Nitrate plants.
The same is not possible as regards Ammonium,
since it is an average of 597mg/1 which must
be reduced to 60.7mg/1 as Ammonia (SOmg/l as
Nitrogen).
A specific treatment for the elimination of
Ammonium from the effluent discharging into
the public sewer, and possibly to recover
Ammonia since a big percentage of the present
production is going to the sewers, is
subsequently recommendable.
As regards the suitable technology for Ammonia
depuration in a context such as NCZ Kafue
factory we cannot appeal to the conventional
biological plants, that are able to work only
with a well defined ratio between organic
substances load and Nitrogen (otherwise
bacteria cannot survive), As this latter
ratio is about 4, it would be necessary for
the Ammonia load of:
    S97mg/l .SOOm3/hr .24   =   7.16t/day
(SOOm3/hr being the overall flowrate under
the hypothesis of 200m3/hr reduction of the
waste waters).
About 4. 7.16 = 29t/day of BODS/BODS is
the amount of oxygen consumed at 20 Deg.C in
five days for the oxydation of the organic
substances present in waste water, by means
of aerobic bacteria, in order to obtain
stabilised compounds, Carbon Dioxide and
water).
                      80   ­



The problem involved in NCZ Rafue factory is
that it includes exclusively inorganic plants
producing only fertilisers or Sulphuric Acid,
so that BODS of the relevant waste waters is
nil; on the contrary in Europe or America the
fertilizer production units are generally
associated in a factory which comprises even
a refinery or some petrochemical plants, so
that supplying an organic load to the relevant
waste waters, which can be conveyed, together
with the fertilizer ones to a common biological
plant.
Infact the only organic compound handled in the
factory is methanol, but it is utilised in the
Rectisol process for the CO conversion plant
(A306) and its presence into the discharges
certainly is not agreeable and is practically
very low. However, even if the methanol
synthesis unit would run at the maximum
capacity of St/day, it could not supply the
necessary amount of 29t/day of BODS because
1Kg of methanol is equivalent to only O.SKg
BODS. Even the organic load obtainable from
the sanitary sewege would be very low in
comparison with the needs.
Infact even in the case of considering that all
the 1500 employees utilize every day the public
conveniencies of the factory, so supplying to
the sanitary sewer the high amount of 50 grams/
day per person BODS, it would be possible to
get, by joining the sewer systems only:
                  3
     1500.50.10       =    75Kg/day BODS
Among the other technologies stripping and ion
exchange can be considered.
Stripping can be performed by means of air or
steam. However air stripping looks rejectable
since it is the less efficient process as
regards ammonia removal and requires very large
air amounts, so involving a series of large
diameter column; moreover it requires the
consumption of cospicuos quantities of caustic
soda in order to replace ammonium cations bound
to Nitrate and Sulphate Anions with sodium in
order to allow the stripping of Ammonia and
then, if not followed by an absorption unit
with Sulphuric Acid in order to produce
Ammonium Sulphate, it transforms the water
pollution problem into an air pollution
problem. Unfortunately in the context of NCZ
factory at present it is not possible to
concentrate a dilute solution of Ammonium
Sulphate since the Ammonium Sulphate plant is
lacking of a crystallization section. On the
contrary it is a very small unit only consisting
of a reactor working with gaseous Ammonia and a
centrifuge to separate the formed crystals.
Even the steam stripping solution can hardly
be applied at NCZ factory: it would be the
simpler one, performing high efficiency (by
means of a 25 plates column of 1.2mts diameter
we can estimate less than 30mg/1 Ammonia in the
effluent) but the limiting factors are the
operating costs. Infact, apart from the 6 bar
steam consumption (which amounts to about 7.2
tons/hr at the rate of 0.12 tons/m3 treated
water, that might be supplied by the new Thermax
Boiler), it is necessary to replace any Ammonium
cations bound with strong Anions (Nitrates,
Sulphates and Phosphates) with sodium by means
of caustic soda addition prior to feed the
stripping section, otherwise this latter cannot
work (only Ammonium tied to carbonates and
bicarbonates, apart from free Ammonia, can strip
away without chemicals because of the low
decomposition temperature). It means for every
ton of Ammonium to be removed there are required
2.2 tons of 100% caustic soda that is very
expensive in Zambia (it is imported at about
US $700 per ton).
Due to all the above reasons the more attractive
solution to· reduce the Ammonia pollution is to
apply ion exchange to selected streams from the
plants, presenting higher Ammonia concentrations
so collecting about 60m3/hr with 4000mg/l
Ammonium concentration. This proposal is on the
model of the choice, reported in literature (see
bibliography 4), effected in the past by many
US Fertilizer and Explosive producers (such as
Chemical Farmers Industries Inc., Illinois
Nitrogen Corp., American Cyanamid Co., Joliet
Army Ammunition Plant and others), allowing
simultaneously to solve a pollution problem and
to recover valuable product. Infact by
utilizing Nitric Acid, a chemical produced
inside NCZ factory itself, as regenerant for the
cationic resins to be installed for Ammonium
fixing, it is possible to produce an Ammonium
Nitrate solution. The concentration of this
latter can vary from 12% iri the case of a fixed
bed installation to 22% in the case of a
continuous counter current unit, which allows
to reach higher concentration.
We suggest to resort to a fixed bed
installation, as it is simpler to run,
consisting of two cation exchangers in series,
one carboxylic and one sulphonic. The selected
streams, to be collected in a suitable storage
tank, must be taken from the Ammonia, Ammonium
Nitrate and Ammonium Sulphate plants. We
believe that is better to leave NPK plant
discharges out of this treatment in order not
to introduce too many trash cations other than
Ammonium in the treatment system and
subsequently in the final Ammonium Nitrate
solution produced.
We trust that for NPK plant pollution a big
benefit will come from the adoption of the
industrial vacuum cleaning system, as suggested
in paragraph 9.07.7.
The acid effluent from ion exchange unit
(containing all the anions, sulphate and
nitrate, previously bound to Ammonia) can be
delivered to the present neutra'lization plant
of the factory.
The produced Ammonium Nitrate solution at 12%
would not overcharge the present evaporation
section capacity of the Ammonium Nitrate plants
as it represents a small percentage (about 25
tons/day; versus an overall design capacity
of the AN plants of more than 500 tons/day);
otherwise a strengthening of the evaporation
section must be provided.
If we examine the possible sources of Ammonia
in the sewers plant by plant we realize that
the major contributors are not the Ammonia
production plants (for which only a process
condensate from CO conversion of the new plant
can be found as systematic discharge), but the
Ammonium Nitrate plants and even the Nitric
Acid plants (emptying of Ammonia Evaporators
at shutdowns and so on).
From the data collected in the laboratory file
Ammonium concentrations up to 10 - 11000mg/1
(with free Ammonia up to 3000mg/1) can be
found in single samples taken from the sewers
just inside the Ammonium Nitrate plants.
So that it looks quite reasonable to propose
to collect every Ammonia concentrated discharge
from the production plants by means of a proper
closed sewer system, that we can call the
"Ammonia Sewer" and convey all the streams to
the proposed new ion exchange unit.
                83



This new "Ammonia Sewer" system will collect
any possible discharge containing Ammonia more
than 200mg/l arising for process reasons or
from operating or maintenance procedures and
must be surely not contaminated by rainy
waters or outward pollutants (as dusts, oil or
other) •
We estimate that, carefully choosing among the
great deal of polluted streams corning from the
production plants (Ammonia, Ammonium Nitrates
and Ammonium Sulphate) the ones provided with
similar characteristics and not susceptible of
any internal recovery, a total amount of 60m3/hr
of waste waters with a concentration of 4000mg/l
of NH4+ can be found, which represents the
design basis for the ion exchange Plant, which
must include three lines (two on stream and one
under regeneration) each one consisting of a
series of two columns.
9.11 	   REVIEW OF SULPHURIC ACID PLANT
         EFFLUEN~TREATMENT FACILITY

         The actual effluent facility has been already
         described in chapter 7.00 on present effluent
         treatments paragraph 7.02.
         As already outlined the main deficiency of this
         facility is to be in strict connection with the
         calcine lagoon system which has not been
         provided as a final closed system for the
         disposal of solid materials (the cinders by­
         product of pyrite roasting) since a liquid
         effluent is fed to the lagoon (that is why it
         is necessary to provide a carrier means for
         the calcine) and the excess water is not
         recycled to the plant but is allowed to over­
         flow in the open land, so infringing the
         provisions of Zambian law as regards sulphates.
         Infact if we think that the main constituent
         of the effluent to the lagoon, apart from iron,
         is calcium sulphate, whose solubility in water
         at ambient temperature is about 2,500mg/l, we
         realize that the calcium and sulphate contents
         relevant to the lagoon overflow, as drawn from
         the analyses reported in Annex 8, are just in
         the stoichiometric proportions of a saturated
         solution of calcium sulphate (deriving from the
         neutralization of dilute sulphuric acid present
         in wastewaters with lime).
         From the above considerations it derives a
         simple idea about reviewing the sulphuric acid
         wastewater treatment, apart from eventual
         adoption of a proposal on possible utilization
         of solid wastes as outlined in paragraph 11.07,
         which hereinafter we illustrate.
         It is only a question of considering the lagoon
         as an enormous decanter for iron, heavy metals
         and even calcium sulphate from where the water
         carrier, saturated in calcium sulphate, is
         recycled to the SAP to dissolve calcine and
         enrich its calcium and sulphate contents above
         saturation limits, in order to allow
         precipitation of the excess at the lagoon site.
         For this purpose of obtaining the above­
         mentioned the following interventions are
         necessary:­
         - Elimination of every possible arrival of raw
           water (overflows from V502 precipitator over­
           flow and V509 treated water storage tank)
                85



 into the Vl002 pit from where water is drawn
 to dissolve calcine in Vl0B mixer tank; this
 can be obtained first of all by installing a
 screen at water intake facility in order to
 be capable to draw the right amount of raw
 water necessary to run the plant and not a
 big excess (see paragraph 9.04). Moreover
 a suitable sewer rearrangement must be
 provided for the whole area in order to
 convey, in case of inevitable presence of
 raw water overflows despite of the above
 intervention, all the clean streams, before
 eventual mixing with any contaminated flows,
 directly to Kasenje River.
- Equip the lagoon/effluent treatment system
  with a suitable pump (with the due spare one)
  possibly mounted on a platform floating above
  the liquid level of the lagoon, and a long 6"
  pipe in order to recycle the excess water to
  the plant (Vl002 pit).
- Substitute the present liquid effluent
  discharge pump P902 A/B, very often out of
  order with a more reliable one; according to
  our opinion the actual pump is not suitable
  because it is a centrifugal with high number
  of rounds per minute. These pumps can be
  substituted by centrifugal ones equipped with
  decentralized impeller, which is suitable for
  fluids with high solids solids percentages,
  running at low number of rounds per minute.
  Another alternative is the eccentric screw
  type pump (so called "mohnott) operated at
  very low speed.
- As regards the pipes it would be advisable to
  utilize the present 6 tt carbon steel line for
  the water return from the lagoon (pH of this
  water, saturated in calcium sulphate, is
  surely neutral) and to provide a new pipe
  made up of plastic material for the onward
  line to the lagoon, which is susceptible of
  some corrosion hazards in case of failure of
  the neutralization system.
  The proposal of review so is to leave the
  neutralization system as it is at present,
  apart from maintenance needs and substitution
  of the final pumps, to rearrange the sewer
  lines, to dissolve if possible the calcine
  mixing with less quantities of water and to
  operate this water in a sort of closed
  circuit with the lagoon.
             86



 As regards the material balance the streams
 that can be admitted to the various
 collection pits and from there to the lagoon
 are the following:
- Precipitator blowdown sludge: 1m3/hr
- Cooling tower blowdown:       24m3/hr
- Valveless filters backwash:   2m3/hr
  Continuous and batch discharges collected in
  V901 and V1001 and sent to the lime
  neutralization system: 19m3/hr.
These amounts are clearly not enough to realize
the calcine dissolving and the subsequent
discharge to the lagoon, 3kms far, of the over­
all effluent, stated that the design capacity
of the relevant pump is 120mc/hr and the
practical figures are 70 - 80cm/hr (with solid
contents up to 3.5%) so that the remaining
quantity to be mixed with the calcine must be
supplied by raw water in close circuit.
At the lagoon site the possible· losses are by
means of evaporation (during rainy weather on
the contrary there will be an increase of
water) and of percolation into the surrounding
soild (this latter is to be hoped nil or
minimum otherwise serious problem of seepages
and subsequent needs of impermeabilazation
arise): in average the evaporated quantity for
the calcine lagoon will be about 16m3/hr but
sure during dry season this quantity will be
more, while during wet seasons will be be less
or even, after rainfalls, not a loss but an
increase.
It follows the necessity to provide the
possibility of a make-up that we suggest to
realize by means of an immission of raw
water by the V1002 pit and of a blowdown, that
we suggest to realize by means of a deviation
pipe equipped with a butterfly valve connecting
the return line from the lagoon with a sewer
man hole of the sewerage system flowing to the
main council sewer.
In this way mixing this stream with the overall
factory effluent the sulphate contents will be
lowered below the low limits.
Incase of necessity (dry season) a controlled
make-up of raw water will be fed into the
V1002 pit.

9.12   LIQUID EFFLUENTS MONITORING
       with immediate effect all the sampling points
       which were considered during the analytical
       campaign must be subjected to a regular
       monitoring programme.
       This programme must include the routine
       analysis mentioned in the following table 11.
       The analytical methods to be employed are the
       ones collected in the volume "Standard methods
       for the examination of water and waste water ­
       APHA 15th Edition 1980" considered official by
       the Zambian law.
       It is obvious that if some parameter will be
       found abnormally high in the overall
       discharges, it is necessary to carry out more
       frequent analysis of the partial streams
       responsible for these high figures as long as
       the phenomenon persists.
       Once a year it is advisable to carry out a more
       complete analysis of the overall discharge IWl
       SW7 and SW10 with reference as much as possible
       to the 54 parameters provided by the Statutory
       Instrument No 161 of 1985. This is in order
       to be ready for any eventual control by the
       Council.
       AS regards the Laboratory staff organisation it
       is advisable to train a dedicated crew of
       people to this specific job of waste water
       analysis.
       Needs for apparatus and reagents must be
       adapted to the routine monitoring programme
       herein illustrated.

9.13   ORGfu~IZATION   AND TRAINING NEEDS
       As regards the job organization in NCZ factory
       it is advisable to appoint a responsible person
       for the specific task of environmental control,
       since the public attention to this problem is
       increasing even in Zambia and the problems
       arising from the factory are serious.
       The person to be responsible for the
       environment must urgently be identified and
       trained. Training can start at Kafue factory
       as counterpart of EA expatriate Environment
       Specialist. In future participation to the
       next eventual seminars on environment at Kafue
       or to specific courses and fairs abroad must be
       ensured.
       However the whole production staff (from the
       Managers to the General Workers) of NCZ factory
       must receive sound sensitization to the
       environmental problems and subsequent controls
       by means of written cOllUTIunicati'ons and! or
       specific meetings for explanation.
9.14 	   LAY-OUT (Drawings No A60S C-0009 and
                  A60S-C-0011 )
         Remarkable difficulties were encountered in
         order to find out a proper lay-out for the
         installation of the main facilities for the
         treatment of factory waste waters. That is
         why no free areas were provided at the time
         of the first factory planning for eventual
         environment protection plants and generally
         the whole area of the factory is crowded of
         plants, buildings and various facilities.
         Moreover the collection of dry weather and
         first rainy waters from the storm water sewer
         that we suggest in paragraph 9.03 is clearly
         obliged to be effected at the end of the path
         of the sewer, near the points of discharge SW7
         and SW6, but this zone is pressed between the
         new boiler (whose ash bunker must be served by
         the road for collection trunks), the railway,
         the open drainage, the fence and a tract of
         calcine pipes to lagoon. Anyway as regards
         this facility, mainly composed- of the big
         2,SOOm3 collection tank we believe that the
         best position is to get the intercepting
         chamber just comprising the concrete storm
         water outfalls SW7 and SW6 (in this way even
         SW6 is included in the deviation and collection
         but we can accept it because it is not a big
         contribution since this branch of sewer serves
         practically only the methanol storage area) and
         to realize the collection tank in the zone at
         present occupied partly by the drainage ditch
         itself and mostly destined to the coal storage
         yard extension. This job requires the partial
         re-routing of the open drainage and another
         small bridge to be realized down stream. The
         solution is shown in the drawing No AGOS C-009.
         As regards the clariflocculation unit and the
         ion exchange plant we suggest to realize these
         facilities between the zone at present occupied
         by the abandoned cyanide removal unit and the
         non-utilized Sulphuric Acid storage tank
         60S-v07 and the free zone along one side of the
         A602 boiler plant and the water treatment
         dosing area. This solution allows the
         clariflocculator to be positioned near the
         neutralization plant and the ion exchange plant
         to be installed downstream the flow of the new
         "Ammonia" sewer that must collect concentration
         discharges from the plant in an area where
         other water treatment plants, so rather
         homogeneous to the one proposed, are already
         installed.
                91




This solution involves the dismantling of the
mentioned units (partly already planned) and
may be some re-routing for the access way of
the maintenance means for the boiler that must
enter from another road. This lay-out proposal
is shown on the drawing number A605-0011.

        In the following tables the data relevant to
        investment cost estimates and realization times
        can be found.
        Of course these estimates are rough figures,
        as at present we are at the stage of a
        feasibility study and not of a detailed
        project.
        As regards the possibility of local supply,
        this latter is limited to civil works,
        manpower for the erection of the plants,
        some manufacturing of steel works ~nd
        electrical cables.

            abatement plant, unless certain tests in the
            production plants, to be carried out changing
            some operating parameters will be successful.
            However it does not seem appropriate to end
            the environmental study on NCZ Kafue factory
            without an outline on air pollution.
11 .01      NECESSITY OF DISPERSION    ~


            It is recommendable to prepare an inventory of
            all the sources of gaseous streams to the
            atmosphere, reporting on a map position and
            height of the chimneys. Moreover it is
            necessary to plan a proper analytical campaign
            of the same kind of the one carried out for
            liquid effluents, in order to investigate
            flowrates and pollutant contents of such
            streams. With the help of meteorological data
            (ambient temperatures, directions and
            velocities of the winds) it is possible, by
            means of computerized methods of calculation,
            to draw maps of dispersion for each pollutant
            towards the outside environment; the interest
            in this maps is obviously very high.
~   1 .02   THE PROBLEM QE AIR INTAKE LOCATION
            Just to remain inside the factory the marking
            out of such maps could suggest a more
            appropriate location of the air separation
            plant, which at present is positioned amidst
            Nitric Acid Plant and Ammonia Storage thus
            collecting partly the emissions from these
            facilities; this fact has been pointed out on
            the occasion of the last blowing of the air
            separation plant for defrosting purposes:
            300ppm of Ammonia were found in the outcoming
            hot air. Apart from corrosion problems the
            emission of Nitrous Oxides into the air
            separation plant can cause explosion.
            For these reasons in Europe the location of
            air intake is usually many hundreds of metres
            outside the factory in a position considered
            safe by the maps of dispersion as regards
            pollution.

11 .03   POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON   ~   ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH
         As regards biological effects on man the
         Nitrogen Oxides, whose paradigmatic
         representative is N02 as the others
         (NO, N20, N20J, N204, N205) tend to transform
         into N02 due to chemical reactions in the
         atmosphere, cause odour nuisance and
         irritation of eyes and nose mucous membranes;
         this at concentration of J - 13ppm. Higher
         concentrations can cause heaviour consequences:
         150ppm a bronchiolite, 500ppm for some minutes
         pulmonary oedema and death. As regards chronic
         effects there are mentioned pulmonary
         fibrositis and pulmonary emphysema for
         continuous expositions to 10 - 40ppm.
         As regards Sulphur Dioxide S02 in the
         atmosphere this compound is transformed into
         S03 that, in presence of humidity, becomes
         Sulphuric Acid causing the well known acid
         rains.
         S02 is high soluble gas, so itis absorbed in
         man by the mucous membranes of the first
         respiratory apparatus, reaching only partially
         the lungs: O.5ppm are noticed as unpleasant        <




         odour; at lppm wrist and breathing quicken
         10ppm cause irritation to eyes, nose and throat
         in case of first exposition of some subjects.
         As regards long taerm effects many cases of
         nose-pharyngitis, persistent cough and abundant
         expectoration have been noticed among workers
         exposed for years to S02 levels as far as
         40ppm.
         The effect of carbon monoxide CO, which
         originates from not perfect combustions, is to
         tie with the heamoglobin present in the blood,
         so that this latter cannot achieve his task.
         The dangers depend on the CO concentration and
         on the exposition duration. At 12 - 31ppm CO
         psychomotory disturbances appear, while at
         100ppm dizziness, headache and general
         weakness.
         In Annex 3 page 7 some analytical results are
         reported about Nitric Acid tail gases during
         the time of liquid effluent analytical
         campaign.
         As regards SAP tail gases the analyses are on
         page 4 of the same Annex.

12.00   OUTLINES ON INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE 

        The term Industrial Hygiene (as it is called in
        the United States and Canada) or Occupational
        Hygiene (as it is called in United Kingdom) is
        often confused with Environmental Hygiene (or
        environmental health or environmental
        protection). It is necessary to point out that
        Industrial Hygiene or Occupational Hygiene deals
        with problems in the internal environment ie
        man, his working environment (plant, laboratory,
        workshop etc) and the interaction between the
        two. Environmental Hygiene on the other hand
        deals with the external environment and is
        directed towards the control of all factors in
        the environment which exercise or may exercise
        a harmful effect on man's physical development,
        health and survival. This protection of the
        environment essentially deals with the pollution
        impact towards the outside environment eg
        atmosphere, rivers, lakes and the soil where
        gaseous, liquid effluents and solid wastes are
        discharged to from factories.
        That is why industrial hygiene is beyond the
        scope of present study.
        However, while carrying out the environmental
        study, we would not do but notice some big
        problems of industrial hygiene hereinafter
        briefly mentioned that would require the proper
        examination of a specialist:
        - High Ammonia concentration at the site of
          Ammonia Plants.
        - Dusty atmosphere due to coal powder
          gasification.
        - Dusty atmosphere due to dust coming out from
          pyrite roasting.
        - Dusty atmosphere due to lime for workers
          opening manually the lime bags at the site
          of water treatment plants.
        - Excessive noise at the compressor houses and
          from the new nitric acid plant by the main
          guard post.
        It is presumable that, after rehabilitation
        programs completion, these problems will be
        reduced.
        However it is recommended that a specific study
        on this subject be carried out.
1 3. CO   SOLID WASTES
          There is a main misunderstanding when dealing
          with solid wastes discharged from Kafue
          factory. Infact at present only coal ash is
          handled in solid form (trucks and trailers are
          transporting them from the factory to the
          lagoons), while SAP calcine and A321 slurry are
          transferred in liquid form through proper
          pipes, since they are pumped out mixed with
          considerable amounts of water as carrier means.
          This probably due to the choice by the previous
          Process Engineers of avoiding the installation
          of dewatering specific equipment applied to the
          factory slurries for exploiting that formidable
          dewatering machinery which is the african sun.
          However it would be quite reasonable dealing
          with small hourly amounts of slurries or more
          concentrated ones, but it is impossible to rely
          on african sum in order to dewater almost
          exclusively liquid streams as the ones actually
          conveyed to the lagoons disposal system of
          Kafue factory.
          As already shown with the simple calculations
          in paragraph 7.03 even the enormous recipient
          surfaces of the lagoons cannot dry all the
          water sent with the solids unless an overflow
          or a recycle is provided.
          Since the overflows to the open land are
          prohibited by the law (without written
          permission of the Council; see Article 3 of
          Statutory Instrument No 161 of 1985), only the
          practice of recycling excess water to the
          factory can avoid the installation of specific
          dewatering equipment and the subsequent
          handling of almost solid matetlals by means of
          trucks.
          It was not possible to find out any possible
          linkages in the treatment of the two kinds of
          wastes (liquids and solids).
                      -:02




13.01   OTHER SOLID WASTES
        Many other forms of solid waste have been found
        to be produced in the factory premises. These
        included scrap metal in various forms, used
        empty drums and rashig rings. The latter
        (rashig rings) are at the moment properly
        disposed of (having no monetary value) by paving
        parts of the factory grounds to alleviate
        stagnation of water during the rainy season.
        Since we can see big deposits of rashig rings
        abandoned inside drums in certain areas of the
        factory, it is recommended to utilize them by
        filling in of depressions in the factory grounds
        for the same purpose as above. Moreover,
        consultations with Kafue District Council can be
        made in order to utilize these materials in
        mosquito larvae (malaria) contr,ol drainage works
        programme, as is the present arrangement for
        coal ash. Scrap metal and used' empty drums,
        however, have been stockpiling in the area south
        of the coal storage yard. Apart from
        contravening the law (Public Health Act Cap 535
        of the laws of Zambia) in that they might
        facilitate mosquito breeding during the rainy
        season as well as harbour undesirable vermin,
        the stockpiling of scrap metal in the said area
        is an economic loss to NCZ. The metal may be
        saleable to Small Scale Industry Organization
        in Zambia as well as individual blacksmiths as
        raw material for making hoes, axes, braziers,
        knives and wash basins. It is recommended that
        research be made into the marketability of the
        scrap metal.

14.00 	    PRESENT QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE
           WASTES CONVEYED TO THE LAGOONS

1 4.01 	   CALCINE LAGOON

           with reference to design figures the effluent
           pumped out to the lagoon from the Sulphuric
           Acid plant effluent treatment facility has the
           following characteristics:

               Flowrate                  105m3/hr
               Temperature               Ambient
               Solids contents    =      6000Kg/hr (=5.4%)
               Specific Gravity          1 .06

           Practically, the actual flowrate is about 

           70 - 80m3/hr while the solids contents ranges 

           from 1 to 3.5% and the specific gravity 

           1 - 1.03; Sulphates contents is about 5000ppm. 

           For the complete analysis see column 2a, 

           Annex 9. 


           In addition to these reduced figures it is 

           necessary to mention that the Sulphuric Acid 

           plant is usually on shutdown for many months in 

           a year, owing to in-plant problems or storage 

           saturation and that often the effluent 

           discharge pumps P902 A/B are out of order, thus 

           forcing direct discharging into the Kasenje 

           River.   It follows that from the start-up of 

           Sulphuric Acid Plant (September 1983) only 

           about one third of the dedicated lagoon is full 

           of solid materials. The remaining lagoon is 

           filled with liquid effluent which, as already 

           mentioned in the chapter 7.00 paragraph 7.03 

           dedicated to the existing waste disposal 

           system, is overflowing along one side towards 

           the open land by means of a pipe installed on 

           purpose. The breakage of the adjacent pipe 

           carrying the A321 slurry is worsening the 

           situation because even black liquor is over­ 

           flowing. 


           The liquid portion of the waste disposed of 

           into this lagoon seems to let rapidly its 

           decanted solid contents since its aspect is 

           clear (people from the surrounding villages are 

           even used to fishing there), but the analyses 

           of the lagoon overflow show a high Sulphate 

           contents (see Annex 8, pages 1 - 6) and visibly 

           contains coal dusts. 


           As regards the quality of the product 

           accumulated in the already soli"dified part of 

           the lagoon is composed of: about 51% Iron; 

           6.4% Sulphates; 4.5% Calcium (as CaO); 1.5% 

           Magnesium (as MgO). Moreover contains 9900ppm 

           Copper; 842ppm Zinc; 107ppm Lead; 79ppm 

           Arsenic; 40ppm Selenium (see column 2a analysis 

           in Annex 2.).

14.03 	    POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT
           The noxious effects arising from the disposal
           of solid wastes in an open lagoon are that the
           eventual faulty impermeability of the bottom
           or of the walls of the pond may allow seepages
           towards the surrounding land and mainly may
           contaminate the water table.
           EXamining the chemical composition of the
           handled products this means a possible
           pollution of the water table from Arsenic,
           Lead, Selenium, Zinc and other metals, besides
           sulphates.
                            ~   C5




        The risk of possible overflows due to
        exceptional storms is remote, since even
        the maximum rainy intensity of 150mm/hr
        cannot allow the outlet of the solid material
        from the large ponds, provided that the above
        level is maintained 150mm below the top level
        of the walls.
        Moreover this problem is overcome since the
        Calcine lagoon, as already mentioned, is
        managed with liquid effluents and has a
        continuous overflow to the surrounding land.
14.04   ADEQUACY OF DISPOSAL PONDS
        If the present Calcine lagoon were operated
        properly with exclusively solid wastes, stated
        that these latter ones have a loose pour bulk
        density of 1.17g/ml, it would be possible to
        store totally:
           192,OOOm2.3.5m. 1.170t/m3                = 786,260     tons
        It means, even considering the· exaggerated
        solids production of 6t/hr = 52560t/year from
        SAP, a duration of the disposal pond equal to:
                   786260            =   15 years
                   52560
        Since the actual lagoon is at present about one
        third full it follows that a duration of 10
        years at least is expected.
        Of course the above calculations presuppose
        that excess water in the solid wastes must be
        recycled to the factory, as proposed in the
        review of SAP effluent treatment plant
        (paragraph 9.11)
        As regards the slurry and coal ash lagoon, at
        present half full, the total storage capability
        is:
              1 • 320000m2.2m • It/m3                  =   320000t
              '2
        The incoming solids are:
              £     . 80    + 1.5        =   6.3t/hr       =   55200t/year
             100
        so the duration of lagoon No 4 may be:
             320000        = 5.8 years
             55200
                          106




         The above programme is al~ays based on the
         hypothesis of recycling the excess water, as
         it was in the first design of the slurry
         lagoon system.
         It follows that this lagoon is scarce for the
         future needs.

         Some leachate tests, according to the procedure
         suggested by the American EPA (Environmental
         Protection Agency) with its EP (Extraction
         Procedure) toxicity test, were performed on the
         solid materials accumulated in both lagoons.
         The relevant results are shown in the following
         table 12 and Annex 9 (column 2b).
         Since the maximum concentration of contaminants
         for characteristic of EP toxicity are as
         follows (see bibliography 5):
             Arsenic                           5mg/1
             Barium                          100mg/1
             Cadmium                           lmg/l
             Chromium                          5mg/1
             Lead                              5mg/1
             Mercury                         O.2mg/1
             Selenium                          lmg/l
             Silver                            5mg/1
             Endrin                         0.02mg/1
             Lindane                         O.4mgl/
             Methoxychlor                     10mg/l
             Toxaphene                       O.5mg/l
             2.4 Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid   10mg/l
             2.4.5 - TP Silver                 lmg/l
         it follows that both products disposed of in
         the lagoons are toxic for selenium and cadmium
         and near the limits for lead.

14.06   SEEPAGES   ~   POLLUTION    ~~~   OF   ~   WATER TABLE
        In order to check possible seepages from the
        floors and walls of the lagoons system, the
        digging of some wells on the surroundings of the
        calcine lagoon was organized with the purpose of
        reaching the water table, collect samples and
        analyze them.
        The wells were executed by the firm Water Wells,
        Lusaka from 4th to 15th March 1987; they were
        two in number and their approximate position is
        shown as BH1 and BH2 in the drawing 605-0032
        "key plan showing location of slurry lagoons and
        slurry lines lay-out" already mentioned.
        As regards the borehole No 1 the first water
        table was found at about 22ft (approximately 7m)
        while for the second at 15ft (approximately
        4.5m). The digging was then continued as far as
        GOm with the aim of encountering other lower
        water tables that could have been contaminated
        by possible seepages due to possible passages of
        pollutants through the very complicated network
        of ground water that occurs in Zambia.
        Of course by continuing the digging it was not
        possible to be sure of realizing when the
        second or the third water table has reached but
        the samples taken out were expected to be a
        mixture of the first and following water tables.
        Anyway if some sUdden differences in the course
        of analytical results relevant to the different
        depths occurred, we would have been able to
        realize that the difference was due to a seepage
        reaching the water table from a major depth.
        The most important parameters investigated were
        the metals: lead, arsenic, selenium, zinc,
        copper and iron.
        Anyway even other parameters common to water
        analyses, such as pH, alkalinity and so on,
        Were investigated. The complete results are
        reported in the following table 13. They show
        that no worrying reason from seepages to
        contaminate the ground water must exist as
        regards NeZ lagoons.
        All the metals were found present well below the
        limits of World Health Organization for drinking
        water (as regards lead this organization in 1972
        raised the previous limit of 0.05 (1963) to
                       110   ­




0.1mg/l), more especially considering the
substantial dilution that can be offered to
water tables by the portion of Kafue River
between Mazabuka and Kafue Township, as pointed
out even in the "Paper for the Annual Conference
of the Local Government Association of Zambia"
presented on 3 : 5 September 1986 at Lusaka by
National Council for Scientific Research (NCSR)
(see bibliography 6).
It follows that no need for special artificial
material lining exists to improve the
imperrneabilization of lagoons.
This latter fact is not obvious: infact, stated
that the floors and walls of lagoons are
constructed of "well compacted hard core" layer
of clay, we would expect a permeability
                        -7
coefficient not above 10 cm/sec,that,
multiplied by the about 600,000 square meters
covered by all the present lagoons, represents
anyway a loss to the ground of about:
  -7      -2 

 10       10     ill     • 600,OOOm2   3600   =   0.2m3 

                 sec                                 hI 

for every 1m of hydraulic head.
Considering an average head of 3m this loss
becomes:
3 • 0.2   = O.6m3/hr = 6001ts/hr =                14m3/day
with possible entrainments of dissolved metals
to the water table.
On the contrary the analytical results shown on
Tables 13 and 14 indicate that the nature of the
disposed sludge is such as to create itself in
an impermeabilized layer on the bottom and walls
that auto defends even the layer of clay.
        14.07   POSSIBLE UTILIZATION OF SOLID WASTES
        All the troubles resulting from the management
        of Calcine lagoon would be overcome if this
        roasting by-product from pyrite could be sent,
        as it happens allover the world, to a
        utilization with an Iron Industry.
        On this purpose it would surely be hazardous to
        propose to realize a small electrical blast
        furnace (6000KVA power) for the production of
        Pig Iron like in many countries occur from
        pyrite roasting by-products with 50 - 55% Iron
        contents. The amount of iron recoverable would
        be 3t/hr. However we suggest to carry out a
        feasibility study, involving even marketing
        researches in the countries bordering Zambia,
        in order to investigate the possibility of
        producing, by means of a proper investment, and
        selling abroad sponge iron 2£ desulohurized
        pellets from the pyrite cinders, thus exploiting
        their iron contents.
14.08   SOLID WASTES CONTROL PLAN
        Apart from the feasibility study suggested in
        the previous paragraph and from the suggestions
        contained in 13.01 relevant to "other solid
        wastes", as regards the needs of NCZ's
        facilities for the next fifteen years, we
        recommend to build up two new lagoons with the
        following capabilities:
            Calcine Lagoon                    260000m3
            Slurry/Coal Ash Lagoon            215000m3
        The characteristics of these new lagoons can be
        more or less the same as the present ones:
            Depth   =3   - 3.5m, Sides Slope 45 Deg.

        Preferably the new sites must be chosen in
        areas far from the Kafue River and Water
        Intake.
        Even the new lagoons must be equipped with
        pumps, mounted on platforms floating with above
        the liquid fraction of the lagoon contents, and
        subsequent lines which will recycle excess water
        to the factory for utilization as already
        mentioned in paragraphs 9.09 and 9.11. The
        pumps for the new lagoons can be transferred
        from the old ones, once the filling of the
        latter 1s completed.
              ~I   12




The reason for a floating pump is that with such
a facility it is easier to adjust the position
of the suction pipe for the water recycle not
withstanding the continuous variation of the
bottom level due to sludge deposit and
progressive solidification of the material sent
to lagoons, The other reason is that a floating
pump would be more difficult to steal than a
fixed one,
We call attention to the impossibility of
making higher the walls of the existing lagoons
by means of the same material accumulated
inSide; that is why these materials as verified
by the EP Toxicity Tests, are rather close to
the limits of toxicity (and even beyond as
regards Selenium and Cadmium),
Anyway as regards vandalism, possibility of
robbery as well as the protectfon of people in
order to avoid fishing in contaminated waters,
cultivating on coal ash piles and, may be, to
collect and ingest toxic materials, we suggest
to spread a metal fence all around the present
perimeter of the old and future lagoons and
moreover to install a guard post ensuring the
presence of Security Guards day and night to
avoid these kinds of problems.
The position of the guard post can be chosen
such as to be able to guard even the Water
Intake Pump House by means of suitable rounds,

15.00 	   SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS WITH COST AND TIME
          ESTIMATES-FOR THE SOLID WASTEs-CONTROL PLAN

          In the following table the data relevant to
          investment cost estimates and realization times
          can be found for the purpose of realizing new
          lagoons 	capable to cover, together with the
          present 	ones, the needs of the factory for the
          next 15 	years.

          Of course these estimates are rough figures as
          at present we are at the stage of a feasibility
          study and can vary according to the suppliers
          contacted.
