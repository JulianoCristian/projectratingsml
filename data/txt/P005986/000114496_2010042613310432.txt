                       Project) Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sir:
      Please refer to the Loan Agreement between International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank) and the Argentine Republic (the Borrower) dated November 
18, 1988.  We are pleased to inform you that, in light of the full disbursement of a 
parallel Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan referred to in Loan Agreement 
Section 1.02 (t), the Bank agrees to increase to 100% the percentage of expenditures 
financed by the Bank for works and services included under the Yacyreta Project for 
the remainder of the Loan.  The Bank, therefore, proposes to amend the Loan Agreement 
to reflect this increase, and also takes the opportunity to at the
same time extend the Closing Date and other pertinent dates cited in the Loan 
Agreement.  These amendments to the Loan Agreement are as follows:
