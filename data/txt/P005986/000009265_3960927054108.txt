TO THE REPULC 0 ARGZTN
NOR T  UECRC P0131 SETR PROJECT
1.       I submit the following  report  and  recommendation on a proposed Power
Sector Loan to the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$252 million to
support the Government's electric power sector project. The proposed loan would
be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would have a term of 13
years, including six years of grace. The Government would retain US$2.0 million
for its Secretariat  of  Energy  and  onlend  the  remaining US$250.0 million to
Entidad Binacional Yacyreta on the same terms and conditions.
PART I - THE SECTOR
2.       The energy sector occupies a  central point in the Government's adjust-
ment program. The cost, timeliness and availability of energy are important for
the competitiveness of the agricultural and industrial sectors and hence to the
Government's overall export drive.   Its macroeconomic significance is indicated
by the sector's almost 7 percent share of GDP in 1987. Further, since energy is
the largest sectoral consumer of public funds, Improving the quality of sectoral
investment is pivotal to Government's attempts to rationalize public investmeiit.
Additionally, the sector has considerable potential for foreign exchange sav-
ings. It also provides an important vehicle for domestic resource mobilization,
and has been identified as a prime candidat for expanded private investment.
3.       Argentina has a substantial and  aiversified energy base.  The exploit-
able hydro-electric power potential over 50 years is estimated at 2,200 million
tons of oil equivalent (HHTOE); the official proven and potential reserves of
gas amount to 880 MMTOE and of oil, 560 MMTOE. The country also has uranium and
coal. Argentina has been generally self-sufficient in energy since 1981, but
resources and demand are not well balanced. Hydroelectric potential, represent-
ing over half of the country's energy resources, supplies only about 11 percent
of final demand. Natural gas meets somewhat less than one-third of demand, but
could ;eet a substantially larger  share.    Conversely, crude oil, whose proven
reserves are smaller and production has been declining, meets 56 percent of
demand. The Government has tried for some time to stimulate more reliance on
hydroelectric power and natural gas.   The latter has replaced heavy and middle-
distillates in power and industry consumption, and LPG and kerosene in residen-
ces, commerce and the public sector. These trends are expected to continue as a
result of the hydroplants being built and expanding gas pipeline capacity.
4.       Per capita energy consumption in  1987 was  1.5 TOE, compared with the
Latin American average of 1.0  TOE  p.a.    This  relatively high level of usage
partly reflects Argentina's energy-intensive agricultural and industrial produc-
tion, the extensive distances which traffic must travel and historically low
energy prices during the era of high international oil prices in the 19708 and
early 1980s.    Fortunately,  there  is  an  ample  resource  endowment, but the
assurance of sufficient future energy requires significant sectoral changes.
5.       Electric Power.  Argentina has  a well developed electric power public
service. However, the sector is diffused and its performance has been uneven.



Power companies' finances are poor.   Despite rather high tariffs, the utilities
do not cover their costs or contribute significantly to investment because of
distorted pricing policies, heavy taxation and poor collection rates. The sec-
tor also is burdened by the costs of an investment program predicated on the
past high demand expectations and ready access to external finance. There is an
expensive nuclear power program, while the criteria used for sector planning
have led to questionable facilities and inadequate transmission and distribu-
tion. Poor legislation and complex institutional arrangements compound the
sector financial strains and the difficulties of the Central Government.
6.       The Government has  begun  to  address  these  issues  through a policy
package encompassing the following objectivess (a) ensure that future energy
requirements are met through investments at least cost to the economy; (b)
ensure that indigenous resources are exploited according to more rigorous econ-
omic principles; (c) achieve and maintain economic pricing policies; (d) develop
a stronger Goverrment energy planning unit; (e) obtain greater operating effici-
ency in the utilities; (f) sharpen the delineation of sector responsibilities;
(g) streamline and upgrade the sector's organization and legal structure; and
(h) fix environmental safeguards as an essential element of project planning.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The results of the Bank's substantial
involvement in the sector have  been  uneven.   Although physical objectives of
past projects were largely met, there has been less success on other counts,
notably the financial performance of the sector and investment decisions. The
major stumbling blocks have been the Government's limited capacity to plan and
govern adequately sector operations, the unstable macroeconomic environment and
irregular commitments  to  undertake  comprehensive  improvements.   To overcome
these problems, the Bank and the Government have been discussing policy changes
and improving the institutional framework.   Extensive  sector work as well as a
detailed review of the Government's energy investment program have taken place.
The proposed loan represents the outcome of this dialogue which has produced
agreement on a broader gauged approach than existed previously. The proposed
loan is also part of the Bank's global effort to help the Government achieve a
better allocation of its  scarce  funds.    Improving sector resource allocation
would also help to rationalize power investments, promote the integration of the
hydrocarbon and hydropower sectors, and speed the financial recuperation of the
power utilities. To these ends, the Government and the Bank have agreed on the
proposed operation as the first in a planned series of sector loans. These
would address sector issues in a phased manner, concentrating on selected key
near-term targets within a longer-term sector strategy. This revised approach-
-a specific agenda for action derived from a broad sectoral focus--is designed
to bring about lasting improvements.
PART II - THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.       A loan of US$252 million  is  proposed  in support of an electric power
policy program outlined in para. 6, especially to meet the objectives of: (a)
confining the expansion program to least-cost solutions; (b) rehabilitating the
finances of the national power utilities; (c) promoting more rational use of
electricity through a tariff system based on economic costs; ,d) improving the
efficiency of the utilities; (e) strengthening the institutional structure of
the sector; and (f) establishing greater environmental safeguards. The proposed
loan would thus directly support the Government's new structural reform program
documented in the Letter of Development Policy dated September 22, 1988 (ref.
President's Report, Second Trade Policy Loan, P-4858-AR), particularly the
efforts to improve the efficiency of public enterprises.



-3-
9.       US$250 million of the loan would  help fund the 1988-89 -time slices  of
the sector investment program.   This  would be utilized to advance construction
of the Yacyreta hydroelectric project, the most pressing need of the sector
(ref. paras. 19-21). The remaining US$2 million would be made available for
strengthening the Energy Secretariat (SE).    The proposed loan was appraised in
May 1988 and negotiations took place in September 1988. The Argentine Delega-
tion was led by Mr. Ramon da Bouza, Director for External Economic and Financial
Policy, Ministry of Economy.  The  sector-specific reforms integral to the pro-
posed loan are described below.
10.      Sector Planning and  Investment.    Although the Government methodology
for defining the least-cost solution for generation ezpansion is generally
sound, the Bank has had reservatious regarding its underlying assumptions and
economic parameters. These concerned, in particular, the use of a lower dis-
count rate than the estimated opportunity cost of capital for Argentina and the
reluctance to consider gas-fueled thermal plants as a basic option for expan-
sion. These biased planning towards costly hydro projects in contrast with the
potential contribution of natural gas.   During appraisal, agreement was reached
on the adoption of a 12 percent p.a. discount rate, which is considered suitable
for expansion planning in Argentina.    This has resulted in substantial changes
which, inter alia, puts greater priority on gas-fueled thermal plants. This
agreement constituted the first step in the rationalization Gf sector invest-
ments and sets the framework for a sounder approach to the development of
electric power resources and services. Additionally, during negotiations it was
agreed that the Energy Secretariat would carry out an intensive study of thermal
generation options that would lead to further optimization of the sector
expansion plan in next year's update.
11.      The expansion program, which provides  the  basis for the proposed pro-
ject, was prepared for appraisal under agreed principles and methodologies.
With the reduction of demand projections and the revision of other questionable
assumptions described above, the sector authorities recast the investment pro-
gram to more acceptable targets, which now contain the least-cost sequence for
the 1988-95 development program. They cancelled some and postponed other major
hydro projects, thus trimming investment requirements. The generation component
now consists of nondeferrable projects already under construction and two new
medium-size gas-fueled thermal units.   The  revised investment program also now
stresses transmission and distribution more, which will lead to more efficient
use of existing generation capacity.
12.      Under the proposed project, new  generation investments to be initiated
will be periodically reviewed in the light of updated demand projections and the
results of the aforementioned study on generation options. To ensure approp-
riate measures to implement the optimum sector expansion program, the Government
agreed at negotiations, that, by April 30, 1989 and every April 30 thereafter,
it would update the sector expansion plan under mutually satisfactory methodolo-
gies and assumptions. It also agreed to reassess, on the same schedule, the
feasibility of financing schemes for major projects included in this expansion
plan. Further, it was agreed that the Government would only authorize the con-
struction of major public generation or transmission projects which meet the
criteria of the sector expansion plan and have adequate financing plans.
13.      The Nuclear Pro8ram.   Argentina's  national nuclear energy comuission
(CNEA), which is independent of the sector organization, has developed a nuclear
program that is more costly than other power sources. CNEA now operates two



- 4 -
power plants and is building a third (Atucha IT) which is very expensive and has
had implementation delays and cost  overruns.    An analysis of this option com-
pared to a conventional thermal plant (assuming that investments already made
are considered sunk costs) concluded that, even though the project should not
have been started, from an economic point of view there are not sufficient
grounds to recoammend its caneellation given the advanced status of implementa-
tion and the procurement  commitments  already  made.   During negotiations, the
Government confirmed that the criteria governing the addition of new generation
projects to the sector expansion plan will be applied to any proposed new
nuclear project. Also, it will further ensure that consumers do not bear the
costs of CNEk's development  of nuclear  power.    The Government over the last
several years has kept CNEA's tariff for the power it provided to the national
grid at about that of other supply sources. To help continue this practice, it
committed itself during negotiations to hold CNEA's future tariffs to levels not
higher than that of power generated from other sources.
14.      Sect;r Finances.    Argentina's  electricity  pricing  system  is quite
complex. Utilities pass a substantial part of their revenues to the Federal
Government in the form of taxes and surcharges, for which the Government pro-
vides compensatory equity contributions, along with part of the proceeds of
petroleum product sales. In addition to these taxes and surcharges, users pay
provincial and municipal taxes which vary substantially throughout the country.
Most tariff structures have not been designed on the basis of economic criteria
although the national average level of tariffs is in line with estimated econom-
ic costs. But there are significant differences among utilities whose compar-
able consumers pay considerably higher or lower prices without relation to their
corresponding costs.   The  Bank  and  the  Government have repeatedly discussed
possible ways and means of establishing a price system that would improve this
complex situation. The Energy Secretariat is now carrying out a previously
agreed tariff study based on long run marginal cost principles which is expected
to provide the basis for restructuring the system. During negotiations, it was
agreed that results of this study, to be available by February 1989, would be
implemented in a manner and on a schedule mutually satisfactory to the
Government and the Bank.
15.      In March 1986, the Government  prepared  a program to address the prob-
lems created by the large 1976-1982 external borrowings. The program included a
commitment to increase internal cash generation in the sector and a prudent mix
of self-financing and external borrowings.    However, the subsequent recurrent
wage and price freezes have impaired the planned steady accumulation of rate
increases. In compensation, the Government has returned to the sector a larger
proportion of taxes collected from it than had been anticipated. Over the first
eight months of 1988, the conduct of pricing policy has been more successfult
the major national utility's tariffs rose almost 41 percent in real terms with
lesser hikes (also above inflation) for the other two national utilities. Fur-
ther, the Government has just underscored its commitment to the longer term
objectives of achieving economic pricing. The aforementioned Letter of Develop-
ment Policy emphasizes this in connection with both pursuing increased account-
ability by the  public  enterprises  and  restricting  their  access to Treasury
finance.
16.      In connection with the proposed loan, the Government, with Bank assist-
ance, has prepared a Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP) covering the national
utilities (60 percent of sector operations). It calls for each utility to real-
ize important improvements, in particular their cash operating ratios (cash
operational expenses as a percentage of operating revenues) and contributions to



-5-
investment. The required tariff increases would be phased consistent with the
Government stabilization program. Other FRP goals are to balance the financial
situation among utilities and to ensure that investments of each utility are in
line with the least-cost expansion program. During negotiations, the Government
agreed to FRP targets of cash operating ratios of 91 percent in 1988, 81 percent
in 1989, and 79 percent in 1990; and investment contributions of not less than
30 percent. By May 31 of each year beginning in 1989, the Government and the
Bank would carry out a review of the sector's financial performance and any
needed remedial measures.
17.      Environmental Considerations.    The  Government  is  aware that sector
operations could result  in  environmental  degradation.    It has already taken
initiatives to develop an institutional capacity in the power sector to identify
and analyze the impact of its activities, and to structure these so as to miti-
gate adverse consequences. In discussions with the Bank, the sector officials
have agreed that, in order to ensure long-term compliance with acceptable envi-
ronmental standards, it would be important to entrench provisions to meet these
standards in the design and execution of power projects. The Government has
already issued regulations requiring national utilities' to report on all pos-
sible effects of the construction of hydroplants on the environment and the
population, and demonstration of adequate remedial actions. These commendable
regulations codify the best international practices in this field. The Govern-
ment has informed the Bank that it will now conclude comparable regulations for
thermal plant construction, which will be sent to the Bank for coamments. The
Bank would also receive a report by May 31, 1989 on the operational safety of
nuclear plants in Argentina.   Meanwhile,  the  Yacyreta project entity has been
adequately addressing potentially adverse effects of the project works on the
environment and on the affected population, which the Bank has been monitoring.
The relocation component is well advanced and there is agreement on the plan for
future environment and resettlement operations.
18.      Institutional Problems.   The  power  sector  has a complex, fragmented
organization as a result of inadequate legislation and a somewhat unclear pat-
tern of institutional responsibilities. These have been exacerbated by problems
in sorting out Federal-Provincial relationships during the course of the in-
creasing decentralization of government functions. Consequently, there is not a
coherent Central Government regulation, and sector policy development, coordina-
tion and resource allocation have been weak. In order to address these problems
systematically, the Government has begun to carry out a comprehensive study on
sector organization, efficiency and accountability, whose terms of reference
have been agreed. The study, which would be completed by March 31, 1989, is
expected to identify guidelines for overcoming these problems, including pos-
sible private enterprise participation  in  the  sector.   Its findings would be
linked with the outcomes of the related institutional improvements planned under
the recent SEGBA and Power Engineering  Projects.   Further, in order to upgrade
the quality of Central Government regulation, the proposed project would provide
technical assistance to the principal sector entity, t1* Energy Secretariat,
whose role is crucial in facilitating resource transfers and supervising invest-
ment planning.
19.      Yacyreta.  The Yacyreta project, for which the Bank approved in 1979 a
US$210 million loan (Loan 1761-AR), has suffered significant implementation
problems which have caused an eight-year delay in the completion schedule. The
slippage resulted from difficulties in securing external financing, a protracted
dispute on procurement issues which delayed the contracting of civil works, and
lack of local funds due to the country's economic difficulties. These in turn



-6_
causeds (i) the principal of most of contracted debt to become due; (li)
increased financial charges; and (iii) the sector's loss of substantial cash
generation from energy sales.
20.      For these reasons and in  order  to  seek possible economies, the newly
elected authorities in 1984  assessed  their  options  regarding Ole fate of the
project. After careful consideration, the Government decided to complete it,
and appointed a new management to carry out its revisiou and optimizatiou. This
resulted in changes in project design, renegotiation of contracts with construc-
tion and engineering firma and a rescheduling of project execution to adapt to
updated demand projections, producing significant cost reductions. The Bank
meanwhile independently considered how Yacyreta currently compares with alter-
native schemes. Analysis shows that completion of the project is still the
least-cost option for expanding national generation facilities for discount
rates lower than 18 percent. The investment that would be required to replace
Yacyreta with thermal plants is greater than that needed to complete it.
21.      The problems which have affected  the execution of the Yacyreta project
could not be anticipated  during  design.   After  overcoming the causes of the
delays, the implementing agency has effectively cut expenses and improved pro-
ject execution. The design of the project and its advancing construction stage
preclude any possibility of further reducing its scope. The additional foreign
financing required to complete the project is far beyond the Government's capac-
ity and its efforts to mobilize additional long-term bilateral funds have so far
not materialized. Although civil works would be coa,-,'ated in 1992, the proposed
Bank loan (and a parallel IDB loan) would help _over project implementation
through the end of 1989 in line with the strategy to confine future power pro-
gram support to  short-term  increments  (pars.  7).    While  the Government is
committed to finishing the project, the Bank (as well as IDB) has indicated its
intention to condition possible subsequent financing for it on progress in
meeting the agreed sector objectives.
22.      Loan Terms, Procurement and Disbursement.  The proposed loan would have
a grace period of six year3, one more tanA the present norm for middle income
countries. This is needed because of the extended period of time still required
to complete construction of Yacyreta and because of the desirability of minimiz-
ing refinancing  before  the  project  starts  to  generate  revenues.   This is
compensated by a maturity period of 13 years.
23.      The bulk of the  loan  (US$209.4 million)  would finance ongoing civil
works and engineering contracts of the Yacyreta project awarded under Loan
1761-AR through ICB and selection of consultant procedures, both in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. Thus, the sole new procurement under this operation would
be for the US$2 million technical assistance component. The proposed loan Is
expected to be disbursed over a period of two years. It includes provisions for
financing of interest during construction on the proposed loan and on 1761-AR
(US$40.6 million) and for establishing a special account (with an initial
deposit of US$50 million).
24.      ARreed Actions:  The  Government has  agreed on the following actions:
(a) to maintain an optimal expansion program bated on criteria mutually accept-
able, and only to authorize major public generation or transmission projects
which meet these criteria and have adequate financing planss (b) to have the
national utilities achieve and maintain (i) cash operating ratios of 91 percent
in 1988, 81 percent in 1989 and 79 percent in 1990, and (ii) contribute to
investment not less than 30 percent each year; (c) by May 31 of each year, to



-7-
carry out a review of the sector's investment and financial plan in order to ti)
assess past performance and (11) define aud take all  ecsesary masurts to reach
the above targets: (d) to implement plans of action baeed on the reconmndation
of ongoing studies on sector organization and power tariffs; mad (e) to issue
environmental protection regulations for nw thermal plants. As a condition of
effectiveness, the parallel IDS loan agreement, as well as a subvidiry loan
agreement between the Government and EBY. should have been executed. Disburse-
ments of more than US$170 allion would be subject to ti verification of
compliance vith loan conditions In the May 1989 revievl (1i) satisfactory pro-
gress in implementing the organization study action plant and (III) fulfillment
of all conditions of disbursement under the IDB loan.
25.      Benefits. The project would  enhance  the  allocation of Argentina's
scarce financial resources through the improved economic selection of projects
and setting of electricity prices which, in turn, would give incentive to more
rational use of energy resources. Sector productivity would be improved through
efficient operation of existing installations and institution building efforts.
Better protection of environmental aspects of power projects would be achieved.
If all revenues generated by the sector are considered, the economic rate of
return is expected to be 15 percent.
26.      Risks. The major risk  facing  the  project  ould be lack of funds to
execute it during the envisaged time  schedule  as a result of inadequate imple-
mentation of measures Included in the  MR.  Considerable effort will be needed
to ensure that electricity prices reflect inflationary changes so that planned
cost recovery targets are met and that other supporting finanilal measures are
taken in time to avert deterioration of sector finances. The Bank would pay
particular attention to these matters, Inter ala, by carrying out periodic
reviews of sector perforance.
27.      Recommendation. I am  satisfied  that  the  proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recoamden that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
