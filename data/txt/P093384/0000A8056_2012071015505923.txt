                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The most important issues regarding project implementation are summarized below:

                         1. Mid Term Review
                         A Mid Term review was held from 9-17 April, 2012. The Aide Memoire is attached to this ISR and has a detailed discussion of progress on reaching the indicators.
                         An issue discussed was that as a result of the international financial crisis the Sustainable Biodiversity Fund has to date had a lower than projected return on investment. The Bank
                         agreed to facilitate an expert to assist FONAFIFO in finding ways of improving this performance.

                         2. Extension of the Project
                         It was agreed that in order for the Project to reach its PDO and GEO an extension was necessary. Considering the two year delay for effectiveness the project is well advanced with
                         respect to its indicators. Subsequent to the mission a Restructuring Paper has been prepared and is being processed.

                         3. Efficiency of the program
                         The outstanding challenge for the program is a combination of ensuring the sustainability and continuity of the area under conservation contracts and improving the efficiency of the
                         program. A challenge for the PSA program is ensuring that a consistent and sufficient flow of resources is available to make conservation payments, since each new contract implies
                         a five-year financial commitment. This complicates the budgeting process for FONAFIFO as their budget depends on revenues from the gasoline and water taxes, and those
                         revenues received must be spent each fiscal year. By extending the project, FONAFIFO will be able to use project financing to help stabilize the number of contracts and hectares of
                         land under administration, reducing the dramatic annual swings in area under conservation and administrative burdens that have characterized the program to date due to
                         uncertainties regarding budgeting. Furthermore, four studies are being contracted (with drafted TORs) that cannot be contracted unless the closing date of the project is extended.
