1      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.     At appraisal of the Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental
Management (“Ecomarkets II”) Project in 2006, Costa Rica was considered to be a country
with pioneering leadership and remarkable progress in environmental management and
biodiversity conservation. Still, the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) faced a number of
challenges, including achieving financial sustainability in the environment sector 1. The latter
was considered a key goal of the GOCR for supporting and maintaining the national park
system and securing the financing of the country’s Payment for Environmental Services
program (PES2; Programa de Servicios Ambientales (PSA in Spanish)).
2.      PES, established in 1997 and supported from 2000 to 2006 by the IBRD/GEF
Ecomarkets I Project (Report No. 20434-CR), had been considered a groundbreaking and
widely successful program that had strengthened Costa Rica’s global efforts to promote
biodiversity conservation and environmental management. By 2006, PES had been credited
with supporting the country, once known as having one of the world’s highest deforestation
rates, in achieving consistent net increases in forest cover3 (see Annex 10 of this ICR for a
graphic display of Costa Rica’s historic forest cover).
3.      The 2007 Ecomarkets I ICR4 agreed with the 2005 independent “Blue Ribbon Panel”
       5
review , which concluded that Ecomarkets I reached its key targets and objectives. The
review also concluded that there was considerable scope to improve the efficiency of PES,
and identified the following priority issues: i) developing additional funding mechanisms to
complement current funding sources and allow an expansion of the area under conservation,
ii) drawing a greater proportion of funding from service users for future sustainability, iii)
increasing targeting (prioritizing the selection of conservation areas with unique biodiversity
features), and differentiating payments, iv) targeted efforts to ensure that small and medium
landholders are able to participate in the program, as well as v) improving program
monitoring, in particular on service generation and socioeconomic impacts.6 Annex 11 of this
ICR includes the key targets and objectives of Ecomarkets I, as well as relevant conclusions
of the Blue Ribbon Panel review.
4.     The present project, Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental
Management II (“Ecomarkets II”), was conceived to address these priority issues, building on
the experience gained and lessons learned during Ecomarkets I. The implementing agency,
the National Forestry Financing Fund (Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal,
FONAFIFO), had by 2007 more than a decade of experience administering the PES program.
1.2     Original Project Development Objective (PDO), Global Environmental
        Objective (GEO) and Key Indicators
5.      Table 1 shows the project’s original PDO, GEO and Key Indicators as stated in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD). It should be noted that neither the Bank nor the GEF
loan/grant agreements included the PDO in their respective project descriptions, and that
different descriptions exist for Key Indicators within the PAD (PAD main sections B.2 and 3
differ from Annex 3, Results Framework and Monitoring). For this ICR, the text in Annex 3
has been assessed, as it provides more detail for indicators 1, 5 and 6 (see below).

1.3     Revised PDO and GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and
        Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justifications
6.      Neither the PDO nor the GEO were revised. Nevertheless, following a Mid-Term
review (MTR) in April 2012, a Level Two restructuring was approved on June 29, 2012,
which revised and raised the targets expected at project closing for PDO outcome indicators 1
and 4; revised and downgraded the target PDO indicator 2; and dropped PDO indicator 3 and
GEO indicator 6. Table 2 includes the PDO and GEO and revised indicators. A second
restructuring took place in July 2013, additionally modifying some intermediate outcome
indicators (see section 1.6 of the ICR).

                                                due to an increase in vehicular traffic, therefore resulting in an

1.4     Main Beneficiaries
7.      Main beneficiaries of the project included: (i) environmental services providers who
maintain or adopt desirable land uses and practices, and (ii) environmental services users
expected to co-finance the program. The user side of the relationship included users of (a)
hydrological services (municipalities, utilities, water bottlers and beverage producers, farmers
utilizing irrigation, individual consumers), (b) globally significant biodiversity (tourism
industry, society as a whole), and (c) carbon sequestration (purchasers of verified emission
reductions, carbon markets, and the international community). The environmental service
providers were the recipients of the environmental service payments This group included
landholders in targeted priority conservation areas, including biological corridors and priority
watersheds.
8.      Additionally, the PES program specifically targeted indigenous communities, who
benefitted most from direct payments, and women, whose participation in the project was

measured with a dedicated indicator. According to a recent consultancy report 8
commissioned by the Bank to evaluate the socioeconomic impact of the program, between
2008 and 2013 an average of 12,000 ha of forests were protected in indigenous territory;
payments for these services are generally being used not individually but through a
community consensus for the acquisition of agricultural machinery, medical equipment and
educational material, among others.
1.5      Original Components
9.       Table 3 shows the project’s summarized components and subcomponents.
Table 3. Components and subcomponents
Original Component/Subcomponents
Component 1. Developing and implementing sustainable financing mechanisms: Component 1 focused on
developing and implementing sustainable financing mechanisms tailored to the characteristics of each group of
environmental service users. Likewise, rules would be developed for the use of these funds to generate
environmental services that users desired.
 Subcomponent 1A: Promoting watershed conservation via application of the new water tariff. This
  subcomponent was intended to mainstream sustainable natural resource management by instituting water
  tariffs to finance, inter alia, upstream watershed conservation, with 25 percent of the income generated
  channeled to the PES Program to protect priority watersheds.
 Subcomponent 1B: Implementing and capitalizing the Trust Fund for Sustainable Biodiversity Conservation
  (FBS). This subcomponent was intended to help strengthen and capitalize the FBS -established by the
  project -to enable it to provide sustainable, long-term financing for areas of globally significant biodiversity
  where other financing was either unavailable or insufficient.
 Subcomponent 1C: Accessing global carbon markets. The subcomponent was intended to support
  FONAFIFO’s efforts to develop carbon sequestration projects to finance forest regeneration in degraded
  areas that the PES program had been unable to support given their high up-front cost.
 Subcomponent 1D: Developing voluntary markets for biodiversity conservation. This subcomponent was
  intended to support a more systematic approach to seeking funding from voluntary or ‘retail’ markets. The
  funds generated were intended to help capitalize the FBS.
Component 2. Scaling-up the Environmental Services Program: This component supported FONAFIFO and
other institutions in implementing the expanded PES program. Key outputs included: (a) strengthened capacity
of FONAFIFO and other governmental institutions that, together with NGOs working to implement the PES
Program; and (b) a more efficient PES program.
 Subcomponent 2A: Strengthening capacity to implement the expanded PES program. This subcomponent
  was intended to support the strengthening of FONAFIFO’s technical capacity to implement the expanded
  program, while ensuring that FONAFIFO’s recurring overhead costs remained at less than 10 percent.
 Subcomponent 2B: Increasing the efficiency of environmental service contracting. The subcomponent was
  intended to support the development and introduction of a more targeted, differentiated approach in which
  the land uses promoted, the eligibility criteria, and the payments offered were set on a region-by-region
  basis in light of local needs and conditions.
 Subcomponent 2C: Strengthening technical monitoring capacity. This subcomponent was intended to
  support the strengthening and/or establishment of appropriate systems to monitor the PES program’s
  effectiveness in generating the desired environmental services, in cooperation with other institutions.
 Subcomponent 2D: Contracting landholders to provide environmental services. This subcomponent was
  intended to finance environmental service contracts with participating landholders.
Component 3. Removing Barriers for Small Landholders’ Participation in the PES Program: This component
aimed at reducing obstacles to participation of small landholders, many of whom are poor, in the PES
program. Although the program was not primarily designed for poverty reduction, the high spatial correlation
between areas that supply environmental services and low-income rural areas were assumed to create
opportunities to contribute to this complementary objective.
 Subcomponent 3A: Strengthening the incorporation of low-income landholders in the PES Program. This
  subcomponent was intended to support efforts to remove obstacles that could impede participation by poor
  landholders, including the high transaction costs of dealing with many individual medium and small
  landholders and the lack of cadastral plans.
 Subcomponent 3B: Piloting improved watershed management in low-income areas. This subcomponent was
  intended to develop and implement watershed management plans in three pilot areas with high poverty rates.
 Subcomponent 3C: Monitoring social and economic impacts. This subcomponent was intended to strengthen
  monitoring systems related to measuring socioeconomic impacts of the program, with a particular emphasis
  on the poor as well as small- and medium-sized landholders.

1.6     Revised Components
10.     Project components were not changed. However, following the MTR in April 2012,
and then again during a second Level Two restructuring in July 2013, five intermediate
results indicators were revised. These changes are reflected in Table 4 (below).

1.7    Other significant changes
Extension of Closing Date
11.    Following the MTR and the subsequent 2012 restructuring, an extension of the
closing date of the project from July 31, 2012 to March 31, 2014 was approved. The
extension sought to accommodate the project’s two-year delay in effectiveness, to allow for
the capitalization and financing of the administrative costs of the Costa Rica’s Sustainable
Biodiversity Fund (FBS), as well as to secure the completion of studies critical for the
achievement of the PDO and GEO, 9 namely (i) a socioeconomic impact study; (ii) the
biodiversity monitoring study by INBio; and (iii) a carbon sequestration study to define Costa
Rica’s emissions baseline to support the country’s carbon market.
Reallocation of Loan Proceeds
12.    As a result of the need to capitalize and finance unexpected administrative costs of the
FBS and complete key critical studies, a reallocation of funds from components 1a and 3 to
components 1b and 2 of the GEF grant was approved during the restructuring of June 29,
2012.
2       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
13.     The project was prepared building on achievements of the Ecomarkets I Project and
taking into consideration a number of lessons learned to improve the sustainability of the PES
program, in particular to promote the consolidation, efficiency improvement, and coverage
expansion of the program. Overall, the project was conceived as a follow-up implementation
phase of Ecomarkets I, and aimed at resolving the shortcomings of the previous project and
providing long-term financial sustainability to the PES program. The project was
implemented by FONAFIFO, which by BOP had more than a decade of experience
administering the PES program.
14.    The project objectives were consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for 2004-2007, which called for strengthening the country’s leadership in
environmental management, as well as achieving financial sustainability in the environmental
sector, in particular by securing the sustainability of the PES program. The project
preparation team had access to significant information, since Costa Rica was widely
considered a pioneer in PES initiatives and conservation. In addition, extensive literature
about both topics was readily available. Furthermore, Ecomarkets II was being prepared
while Ecomarkets I was still under implementation, which provided additional input to design
a project that would address both forest protection and biodiversity conservation.
15.    The project was primarily designed as a forestry-based intervention that provided
funding for promoting afforestation, forest protection and development of social inclusion in
the PES program, all of which contributed to the PDO. Yet, project design failed to include
concrete actions to directly promote and improve biodiversity conservation (which was the
aim of the GEO), and put in place adequate mechanisms to measure the impact of the PES

                                                                                                               6
program on conservation on the ground. With more than 85% of the GEF grant allocated to
capitalize the FBS, the project design assumed that, by default, successful implementation of
the PES program and guaranteeing its long-term financial sustainability would be sufficient
to ensure improved biodiversity conservation. While there are a number of publications that
support this assumption (e.g. Pagiola, 2008 10; Costa Rica, 2012 11 ; INBio, 2006 12 ), others
disagree with the direct causal link assumption of payment for ecosystem services and
improved conservation (e.g. Hohberg, 201413; Mena (ed.), 200814; Boelens and Hoogesteger,
201415).
16.     The project selected its intervention areas based on the recommendations of the
GRUAS II report, produced under the Ecomarkets I project16. This report identified areas of
high biodiversity value and recommended that future PES interventions be carried out in such
areas. The report also indicated that further work was required as there were knowledge gaps
about biodiversity baselines. Ecomarkets II’s project design appears to have incorporated the
former recommendation, but not the latter. This resulted in the project starting without an
adequate biodiversity baseline (not completed until EOP) and without mechanisms to provide
physical evidence that the PES program was having an actual impact on conservation.
17.     One of the expected results of the project was to increase the participation of
downstream users in the financing of the program. However, by simultaneously providing a
large amount of external resources for actual PES contracts and promoting the creation of the
FBS, the project sent conflicting signals from the onset. Indeed, during implementation user
participation did not reach the expected target, since government funding - supplemented by
the Bank loan as well as eventually the FBS - provided ample resources, effectively reducing
the motivation for FONAFIFO to actively increase user co-financing of PES contracts.
18.     The project’s risk at Appraisal was assessed as low to moderate (L/M). Nevertheless,
the risk assessment framework seems to have included only risks for which a mitigation
measure had already been planned, as opposed to also considering less manageable risks that
could have disrupted project implementation.
19.     Overall, the project’s objectives were ambitious considering the realities on the
ground. Project design relied on the results of the successful predecessor project, without,
however, fully incorporating all of its lessons, while at the same time not sufficiently
appreciating requirements and risks of a conservation-oriented GEF component (in addition
to the development-focused IBRD investment).
2.2     Implementation
20.     Appraisal was carried out in March 2006, and the Board of Directors approved the
project loan and grant on June 8, 2006. The legal documents were only signed in May 2007,
and the project became effective on July 31, 2008, more than two years after approval. While
there were a number of reasons for this (including lengthy legislative approval processes
which applied to externally funded operations), and although there is no formal requirement
for revisiting project design in cases of delayed effectiveness, the project would have
benefitted from a thorough review to ensure that conditions as appraised were still valid at the
time of effectiveness.
21.     The challenges of project implementation were a direct reflection of the project’s
design. Although the Bank ISRs regularly stated that project progress was satisfactory or
moderately satisfactory, delays were common throughout the project’s life. Although both the
client and the Bank team were successful in resolving most of the issues, by EOP a number
of targets had not been fully achieved, and activities that should have been carried out much
earlier were only starting as the project was in its final stages. A number of delays can
arguably be traced back to factors outside the implementing agency’s control, such as (i) the
significant drop in carbon certificate prices by the time the project became effective, or (ii)
                                                                                             7
long processing and approval times by central government and the National Assembly, which
delayed the initial disbursement and the establishment of the FBS. Still, delays were also the
result of incomplete baseline information, the nature of the project’s design and the client’s
capacities in biodiversity management.
22.     Ultimately, the implementation of on-the-ground activities related to the PDO was
moderately successful. While some of the target values were not fully achieved, a number of
indicators were exceeded even after being revised during both Level Two restructuring
events. This in turn was the result of adequate management by the Bank and client teams to
address issues inherent in project design. Implementation was able to address most of the
problems identified by the Blue Ribbon Panel review. FONAFIFO succeeded in carrying out
the tasks for which it had the capacity, which was (and still is) managing forestry contracts
under a PES scheme and establishing channels of communication and outreach with the
target population, including priority groups like indigenous communities and their territories.
23.     With regard to the GEO, project implementation was less effective. The main focus of
the activities financed under the GEF-funded portion of the project was to address the
“enhancing long-term (financial) sustainability of conservation of globally significant
biodiversity” element of the GEO. With about 85% of GEF resources used to establish and
capitalize the FBS Endowment Fund, a fund which as of July of 2014 had received close to
US$20 million in additional resources through other donors, the GEF grant succeeded in
promoting the sustainability of the PES program.
24.     Nevertheless, FONAFIFO’s lack of experience and expertise in carrying out
biodiversity conservation initiatives and measuring their impact resulted in implementation
delays of critical activities related to achieving the GEO. As mentioned previously, Project
design assumed that successful implementation of the PES program would automatically
result in impacts on biodiversity conservation. Considering the focus on the FBS and the
described lack of expertise and capacity of the implementing agency in measuring and
monitoring this impact, little evidence is available to indicate whether this relationship held.
In addition, the optimistic goal of being able to “enhance the conservation of globally
significant biodiversity” with less than US$2 million (the non-FBS portion of the GEF grant)
was impossible to measure as the project did not include a definition of what ‘globally
significant’ meant in this context, nor did it include indicator species/ecosystems (since, as
has been previously mentioned, no biodiversity baseline was available).17
25.      Establishment of the FBS was only completed during the late stages of project
implementation. A number of political delays and unexpected legal financial requirements
(including the lengthy project approval process in the National Assembly and fiduciary
complications that prevented the GEF grant from being available until 2013) hampered the
establishment of the Fund. Only in mid-2013, after the Fund started operating under new
management (where professional and experienced fund managers and fundraisers replaced
the person that had been originally hired by FONAFIFO) and some restrictive investment
policies (that in practice limited returns to no more than 2.5% annually) were lifted (which
were originally required by the German Financial Cooperation, KfW, as additional donor),
did the Fund start to show its real potential (by, among others, diversifying investments,
increasing risk tolerance and actively looking for higher returns – see Annex 10). Although
by EOP the FBS had not yet proven to be an effective new sustainable financing mechanism,
implementation was well underway; concurrently the GOCR was able to raise significant
additional financing (reaching US$27 million in 2013) for the PES program through the fuel
tax and water tariff, which removed the urgency of tapping into the FBS capital base,
therefore enabling FBS management to focus on the protection and investment of the Fund’s
capital.

                                                                                              8
26.     Carbon payments were originally considered a viable option for raising US$10
million (selling 2.7 million tons of CO2 on international carbon markets). Conversely, the
lack of a proper legal framework to support a national carbon market, the incompatibility
between the PES program itself and the carbon market mechanisms (as approved by the
Kyoto Protocol Secretariat), and the slow advances in a separate project funded by the Bio
Carbon Fund (Carbon Sequestration in Small Farms in the Brunca Region – Coopeagri,
P094155) that was intended to “field test” this component, resulted in FONAFIFO deciding
not to focus on this line of engagement.
27.  Based on the rational outlined above, project implementation has been rated
Moderately Satisfactory
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
28.     The M&E framework design and implementation is one of the most significant
weaknesses of this project. A number of indicators and target values were changed following
the 2012 Mid Term Review (MTR) and again during a second restructuring one year later.
Tables 2 and 4 show the extent of these modifications. While it would have been expected
that revisions to indicators during project implementation were accompanied by corrections
in the measurement protocols or adaptation of the M&E framework, such changes would
only be effective if introduced early enough to enable adjustments during implementation.
Given that the project design was not reviewed and adapted to changed realities soon after
becoming effective, this constitutes an important limitation. The fact that the MTR was only
carried out 21 months before the closing date (of an implementation period of 68 months)
meant that the project’s trajectory did not fundamentally change.
29.     The previously described differences between PDO and GEO achievements were
apparent in the M&E application as well. The indicator framework was satisfactory for
FONAFIFO’s area of expertise, which is the PES program and forestry management.
Modifications during implementation resulted from either overambitious or underestimated
targets, or from incomplete due diligence during indicator design (in cases where indicators
turned out to be too difficult or complicated to measure). For the GEO, the M&E framework
only included two indicators and no biodiversity baseline. One indicator (vegetation cover)
was dropped given the difficulties of measurement, while the other indicator (buffer zones
and ecological corridors) achieved about 58% of its EOP target value. As a result, during and
after the MTR the project actually adjusted its results framework to align it with
FONAFIFO’s capacities, rather than building capacity to compensate for institutional
weaknesses.
30.    Available information was not assessed in a proper and timely fashion, resulting in
delays in improving project implementation. Combined with the fact that beyond standard
PES program data collection and statistical progress reviews, the project did not make full
use of the M&E framework as intended, M&E Design, Implementation and Utilization is
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
2.4     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
31.     Safeguards implementation during project execution was generally satisfactory. While
environmental concerns were sufficiently taken into account, social impacts were initially not
systematically identified, recorded and/or mitigated. FONAFIFO required strengthening the
identification, documentation and incorporation of PES participants’ socioeconomic data into
their management information system. By EOP, FONANIFO was well advanced in
systematically documenting particular impacts of PES on indigenous communities and
women. In fact, the targets for gender inclusion were raised and exceed by EOP. The 2013
CATIE (Center for Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education) study on
socioeconomic impacts of PES in Costa Rica did focus on poverty reduction, but did not
                                                                                            9
consider the situation of minorities in the country. However, complementary consultancies
have been carried out, providing evidence that the PES program has had a significantly
positive direct and indirect impact on targeted communities, including priority groups like
indigenous communities and women. In the latter case, impacts even exceeded the upward
revision of the target value and almost doubled the original goal.
32.    Project financial management was considered to be Satisfactory throughout project
implementation, as was procurement. As a result, Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance is
rated Satisfactory, in overall accordance with the Project’s ISRs.
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
33.    Given the GOCR’s strong interest in developing a program aimed at capitalizing on
the productive base of forests both in terms of their commercial value (for plantation forestry
and agroforestry) and the value of the full array of ecosystem services they provide (e.g. for
conservation forestry, water supply/storage, agroforestry), as well as investments in
improving agricultural productivity, Section 6 of this ICR contains Lessons Learned that will
be valuable for this new potential program, which would emphasize sustaining the country’s
achievements in the rehabilitation and conservation of forest ecosystems while maintaining a
stable macroeconomic performance and taking into account the challenges of climate change.
34.    Two actions by the GOCR have direct causal links with or result from project
investments: (i) the implementation of the project’s biodiversity monitoring once the INBio
report was delivered in March 2014; and (ii) the increasingly effective performance of the
FBS, which had reached a 5.3% return on investments by December 2013 and was predicting
a possible 6% return by end of 2014 (see Annex 10).
3       Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
        The original PDO is fully consistent with the Bank’s CPS, which states that “[…] the
Bank will continue to support the Government’s commitment to including more land under
the System of Payments for Environmental Services (PES), which compensates owners of
forest and forestlands for carrying out conservation, natural regeneration and reforestation.
[…], the Bank will contribute to the capitalization of the Biodiversity Endowment Fund
through a GEF facility already approved, once matching resources become available. The
expectation is that the capitalization of the Biodiversity Endowment Fund by the end of the
CPS period will contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the PES.” As a result, the Bank’s
objective for Ecomarkets II is current and the Relevance of Objective (as pertains to the
PDO) is rated High.
        The relevance of the project’s GEO has been assessed against GEF’s programmatic
directions, which became effective on July 1, 2014. The GEO is fully compatible with and
contributes towards GEF’s Biodiversity Objective 4 (Mainstream biodiversity conservation
and sustainable use into production landscapes and seascapes and sectors), Programs 9
(Managing the Human-Biodiversity Interface) and 10 (Integration of Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Services into Development & Finance Planning). As a result, the ICR concludes
that the GEF objective for Ecomarkets II is current and rates the Relevance of Objective (as
pertains to the GEO) as High.
        It is evident that this project was a complex operation that did not sufficiently take all
country challenges into account. Difficulties resulting from the inclusion of PDO and GEO
that required different implementation and M&E arrangements indicate that future operations
need to consider more carefully the requirements for development (PDO) or environmental
(GEO) objectives and be more sophisticated in developing indicators that are better aligned.
As a result, the approach used for Ecomarkets II is no longer valid and the Relevance of
Design and Implementation is rated Modest.
                                                                                               10
3.2    Achievement of PDO and GEO
38.    The PDO intended to (i) enhance the provision of environmental services of national
and global significance, and (ii) assist in securing their long-term sustainability. As has been
explained in this ICR, given that the FBS was not able to provide funding for the PES
program during project life as originally conceived, Bank funds were ultimately important in
supporting FONAFIFO in expanding its coverage of PES contracts and land areas under PES
coverage, although this small grants-based approach was not the originally intended method
of implementation (in fact, it was rejected as an alternative during project design). However,
based on the indicator values reached by EOP it can be argued that thes goal of expanding the
coverage of PES contracts was nevertheless achieved in a way that strengthened the PES
program and effectively increased local participation, especially of priority groups like
indigenous communities.
39.     As mentioned in section 2.1, the project design did not fully embrace the strict
concept of a PES, where users of the environmental service significantly fund the ecosystem
conservation by compensating landholders/service providers. As a result, the project failed to
address one of the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon panel review (‘the need to draw a
greater proportion of funding from service users for future sustainability’); in fact, during the
project’s life funding from service users decreased in such way that the corresponding
indicator had to be revised downwards. However, activities under the PES program were co-
financed by substantial resources provided by GOCR, leveraged from levies on fuel and the
water tariff. That said, despite delays in the FBS’s becoming fully operational and given past
trends, projections and current investment policies, it is evident that the FBS will turn into a
significant source of sustainable funding for the PES program in the near future (within the
next 2-5 years), thereby achieving this part of the PDO. Annex 10 provides graphic
representations of the FBS’s performance over the past years.
40.     Bank intervention was key in supporting the program while sustainable funding was
being put in place. Without the Bank’s loan, it would have been very difficult i) for the
GOCR to provide leveraging funding and maintain the PES program until the FBS was fully
established, and ii) to provide coverage for the areas established by government policy. The
efficiency analysis (see section 3.3) confirms this. As a result, the ICR considers that there
was a clear causal relationship between project intervention and the goals sought, and that,
although under less than optimal circumstances, the PDO was sufficiently achieved to be
rated Satisfactory.
41.     The GEO had a similar structure as the PDO, intending to (i) enhance the
conservation of globally significant biodiversity and (ii) ensure its long-term sustainability.
The key output of the GEO was to support “the development and implementation of market -
based instruments to promote forest conservation in buffer zones of protected areas and
biological corridors connecting them.” As has been described earlier, while the focus of the
project was, among others, the financing of PES contracts that encourage forest conservation,
the lack of a biodiversity baseline until the EOP made it difficult to substantiate the actual
impact of project activities on globally important biodiversity.
42.     Nevertheless, GEF funds were used to establish and capitalize the FBS (which is
considered a market-based instrument), putting in place arrangements and structures that will
eventually generate revenues (additional to the ones generated by the fuel tax and water
tariff) and support conservation in the mid- to long-term. Project resources provided
FONAFIFO and the GOCR with valuable time to compensate for the delays in setting up the
FBS and to complete the development of the missing biodiversity baseline. Under these
circumstances, although there is recognition that there were weaknesses in the design of the
project that prevented the project from reaching the goal of effectively conserving

                                                                                              11
biodiversity of global significance, the ICR considers that the GEO was achieved at least
partially. As a result this ICR rates achievement of the GEO as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
3.3    Efficiency
43.    The ex-post economic analysis reveals positive results in terms of net present values
and very high economic rates of returns based on the various scenarios simulated. The
robustness of the results was tested by assuming significantly lower estimations of economic
benefits in different scenarios (for more detail see Annex 3).
44.     Correspondingly, the level of confidence in the high economic returns generated by
the project is bolstered by the fact that benefits associated with the reforestation component,
the sale of carbon credits, the revenues realized by service contracts by public and private
water suppliers, and the poverty reduction benefits have been left out of the analysis.
45.     For an economic value of US$4,500 per ha of annual benefits associated with
protected areas, the analysis finds that at 4% discount rate, Net Present Values are as high as
US$48 million, which represents a benefit/cost ratio of 2.4. As a result, the project’s
efficiency is rated as Substantial.
3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
46.     As discussed above, the outcomes with respect to the PDO were significant and
warrant a Satisfactory outcome rating. This has also been confirmed by the Substantial
efficiency rating. The GEO was only partially achieved due to shortcomings in design,
implementation, borrower performance and the quality of M&E, which resulted in a rating of
Moderately Unsatisfactory. The outcome rating also takes into account that the PDO
portion of the project was achieved through the IBRD loan (which accounted for 75% of the
overall project resources of the blended IBRD/GEF funding). While relevance of objectives
remains High, the relevance of design and implementation has been rated Modest.
47.    Based on the above the Overall Outcome of the project has been rated Moderately
Satisfactory.
3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
48.     Ecomarkets II was not designed as a poverty reduction project, nor is CR’s PES
conceived as such. However, besides facilitating access to the program and fine-tuning the
targeting of its contracts, project funds have provided an important additionality for PES to
be able to significantly strengthen the capacities of local indigenous communities within the
target areas to understand and fully use the resources provided by the program. Target
indigenous communities have been able to largely avoid the individualization of the contracts
and make decisions regarding conservation of their land collectively. At these locations,
project funds have been primarily used to support the purchase of farming and medical
equipment and supplies. While FONAFIFO does not condition the use of payments, the
program has been successful in promoting investing PES receipts, which in some cases
possibly even surpassed regular government allocations18. In addition, by being required to
acquire the necessary skills to navigate the legal and bureaucratic intricacies of PES
contracting, communities have been able to apply these same skills to promote their rights
and solve problems with local and the central government in a much more proactive and
effective manner.19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
49.    In addition to the PES program, FONAFIFO leads CR’s REDD+’s secretariat and is
tasked with implementing the program in the country. While the project’s failure in achieving
its CO2 trading target impacted negatively on the overall project outcome rating, it did
provide an opportunity for the agency to recognize and address weaknesses in this regard.

                                                                                            12
Although in a strict sense PES has not been intended to be a primary mechanism for carbon
sequestration (nor does it fulfill REDD+’s focus of a market-based emissions-reduction tool -
see section 3.2 and 6 of this ICR regarding PES’ strong reliance on subsidies 20,21), the project
has significantly strengthened FONAFIFO’s capacities to manage relatively large investment
operations, similar to what a REDD+ initiative looks like. As a result of this project and
concurrent Bank engagements, FONAFIFO is now better prepared to manage carbon
sequestration schemes and emission reductions through forest management. In fact, in
September 2013 the Bank and FONAFIFO did sign a letter of intent for the purchase by the
Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) of emissions reduction certificates for up to
US$63 million.22
3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
50.     No formal beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted specifically
for purposes of reviewing project performance. However, there are preliminary findings from
a Bank-commissioned consultancy to evaluate the project’s socioeconomic impact. These
findings are described in Annex 5. Likewise, FONAFIFO held a closing session where a
number of beneficiaries were invited to provide testimonials about the impact of the project
on their livelihood. Annex 5 also provides a summary of these testimonials

4      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
51.    Long-term sustainability of the PES program is somewhat complex to assess.
Although the project has contributed significantly towards consolidating the program,
sustainability will depend on the GOCR’s commitment to provide funding to finance future
PES contracts.
52.     On the one hand, while the PES Program has been an important instrument to increase
forest cover, its ability to continue doing so is limited on both financial and political grounds.
Scarce fiscal resources could also be redirected to more urgent ends given the 52% of forest
cover achieved. Considering that the more substantial part of the PES program is being
financed through revenues from the fuel tax, current efforts to promote Costa Rica as a
carbon neutral country will in the long run reduce tax revenues as the consumption of fossil
fuels is likely to decrease. To address this risk, the Bank is currently engaging in a dialogue
to provide advice on how to reform the PES, following an analysis of the program’s impact
and the sustainability of its financing in the context of the country’s overall development
agenda.
53.     On the other hand, given that the PES program originated prior the Bank’s
engagement, it is likely that it will continue with or without Bank support, especially if the
FBS continues its current growing trend and starts providing sustainable funding to the
program. In addition, with GOCR’s interest to promote green and inclusive growth through
mainstreaming sustainable management practices and systems in productive landscapes, there
is an expectation that the PES program will continue. The Risk to both the PDO and the GEO
has been rated Negligible to Low.
5      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
54.    Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of this ICR describe a number of issues in the Project’s
preparation and design. These issues had a cascading effect on implementation, which
required the Bank to carry out two restructurings of the results and M&E framework.
55.    Problems with Costa Rica’s slow and lengthy project approval process as well as
FONAFIFO’s capacity constraints in terms of biodiversity conservation were known by the
time of project appraisal, which should have prompted the Bank to pay more attention to
                                                                                               13
these issues. Indeed, the first ISRs later pointed out these shortcomings, confirming lapses in
Project design. While the Bank focused sufficiently on the project’s PDO, it underestimated
the capacity of the implementing agency to properly address the shortcomings of the
biodiversity M&E system. As a result, Bank Quality at Entry is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
56.     Considering the delayed effectiveness, which caused the project to start
implementation under a different set of conditions from the ones under which it was
designed, the Bank missed an opportunity to apply corrective measures immediately after
effectiveness, in particular as regards its overambitious nature and the ill-suited M&E system.
57.    The fact that the project was supervised by five different Task Team Leaders had an
impact on project execution. Also, although agreed upon in principle during the MTR, the
June 2012 restructuring did not include a revision of three critical intermediate results
indicators under Component 1 (indicators 4 and 5) and Component 2 (indicator 2). To
address this shortcoming, the September 2012 supervision mission discussed and agreed on
incorporating the revised indicators through an additional restructuring in 2013.
58.    The Bank did flag potential issues and took corrective action, albeit with much delay.
For example, during the difficulties with the establishment and capitalization of the
endowment fund, the Bank supervision and financial teams provided intensive support in
finding solutions and supporting FONAFIFO. Ultimately, however, the Bank could have
been significantly more proactive in its supervision; quality of supervision is therefore rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
59.     Bank quality at entry and during supervision have been rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory. This ICR recognizes the Bank supervision team’s efforts to solve the
difficulties found during implementation, in particular problems with the timing of
establishment and capitalization of the FBS. The Bank failed to identify some challenges that
led to delays in project start-up and execution, and did not sufficiently adjust the M&E
system during and after the MTR. Consequently, Overall Bank Performance is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.
5.2     Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
60.     The government of Costa Rica performed as expected, including delays caused by
bureaucratic processes that, as mentioned, prompted the Bank to specifically address this
issue in its current CPS. Once underway, the government maintained strong commitment
throughout the project life, both specifically to the project’s goals as well as to the underlying
environmental and conservation background issues. The GOCR did leverage substantial
funding for the FBS (even exceeding the original capitalization target value) and maintained
its goal of securing funding to the PES through the fuel tax and water tariff. The GOCR also
applied a policy change and raised the target area of land under PES coverage to 310,000 ha;
while the decision to include this target in the project ultimately proved to be overambitious),
it did demonstrate Costa Rica’s confidence in its abilities to sustainably conserve and manage
its forest resources through the program. Considering the above and the fact that GOCR
embraced and supported the project within the scope of its mandate, Government
Performance is rated Satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
61.     FONAFIFO implemented the project within the reach of its mandate and capacity. As
mentioned, the agency excelled at managing the PES program, but had (and still has)
insufficient experience and capacity in implementing biodiversity conservation initiatives.
                                                                                        14
Likewise, many of the initial issues with the FBS can be traced to the fact that FONAFIFO
did not have prior experience in establishing and managing large Conservation Trust Funds.
62.     However, once issues became apparent, FONAFIFIO did deal with them within its
limitations. The agency’s problems with the GEO and the M&E system resulted from
capacity constraints and led to delays in finding solutions. FONAFIFO’s performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
63.    Considering the above-mentioned issues, Overall Borrower Performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
6       Lessons Learned
64.     Project design and implementation need to acknowledge country-specific
complexities and pay particular attention to project readiness prior to appraisal. Delays in
effectiveness can lead to a situation where the project design is not aligned anymore to the
situation on the ground. Where project effectiveness is delayed, the validity of assumptions
made at appraisal needs to be reviewed, and corrective action taken as early as possible upon
effectiveness.
65.     To ensure that a project’s M&E Framework serves its purpose as a project
management tool, relevant project stakeholders need to adequately understand its concepts
and display the capacity to ensure appropriate implementation. Where this is not the case,
these deficiencies need to be identified and addressed as a matter of priority. This could be
done by either providing additional technical assistance to the implementation agency or, in
circumstances where better suited capacity is available outside, bringing this expertise into
the project at the design stage.
66.     While ecological baselines are not always readily at hand, science offers a number of
alternatives for properly measuring conservation achievements when data is difficult to
obtain or not available. Only biodiversity operations and/or components that incorporate
simple, but proven data collection and measurement tools will ultimately be able to deliver on
the outcomes expected from such programs in the long term.
67.     PES programs have proven effective in promoting afforestation/ reforestation as well
as forest conservation, while providing a number of environmental services to downstream
users. However, there are instances of PES programs creating the perverse incentives that this
project precisely tried to avoid. Given high opportunity costs for cash crops (such as
pineapple), areas formerly participating in Costa Rica’s PES program are being converted
into agricultural lands. Recent analyses of Ecuador’s SocioBosque program (similar to Costa
Rica’s PES) show that the program has mainly produced healthy forests. Nevertheless, with
an inadequate regulatory framework and prices for timber higher than compensation
payments for the ecosystem services, these forests are being cut down. If programs are
mainly financed through government subsidies (and/or co-financed by external resources),
the incentive for the symbiotic relationship between providers and users of the environmental
service is removed. With this in mind, it is important to ensure that a value is attached to
Biodiversity as part of the PES system, so that the financial incentive for not converting is
higher.
68.     Given the conditional cash transfer nature of PES, engaging with vulnerable and
disadvantaged communities can not only help to increase PES performance, but also
significantly improve the livelihoods of these stakeholders. The availability of cash income
provides communities in participating indigenous territories with bargaining powers to co-
finance GOCR social programs leading to (i) improved access to basic public services such
as education and health; (ii) improvements of infrastructure like roads and electricity; and
                                                                                           15
(iii) the implementation of social development programs, such as construction of houses. At
the organizational level Indigenous Peoples Organizations can benefit from assistance given
to improve management skills and self-government capacity.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
69.    The main issue raised by the Implementing Agency was related to a perceived less-
than-optimal support by the Bank’s TTLs until late into project implementation. FONAFIFO
argues that many of the issues encountered, especially with regard to delays, could have been
prevented or at least mitigated given shorter Bank response times to client enquires.
70.     The ICR agrees with the client in this regard and extensively analyzed the issues
surrounding project design and implementation, which could have been addressed earlier and
more proactively through better and timelier Bank supervision and communication with the
client.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
A formal economic analysis was not carried out during preparation and appraisal of the
project due to lack of quantitative data. However, relying on qualitative analysis, the project
team was able to prove that the PES program shows strong evidence of generating substantial
national benefits in terms of improved hydrological services, biodiversity conservation, and
carbon sequestration. The economic value of these benefits was expected to outweigh the
proposed costs for the project.
Benefits related to improved hydrological services include: (i) avoiding the degradation of
water quality and the higher treatment costs that lower water quality would imply. The town
of Heredia, for example, does not filter the water it obtains from the Rio Segundo watershed;
if the watershed were degraded, the town would have to build a costly filtration plant; (ii)
reduced sedimentation of reservoirs and water intakes, thus avoiding the need for costly de-
silting operations; and (iii) reduced flood risk.
Improved biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty: Although biodiversity is primarily a
global benefit, it also brings direct benefits to Costa Rica in particular through its contribution
to the tourism sector. There are also local benefits to agriculture, for example, through
improved pollination. Neither of these impacts can be easily quantified.
The costs of undertaking conservation activities under the program include: (i) opportunity
costs of foregone land uses, in cases where landholders would have undertaken other land
uses; (ii) transaction costs of the PSA program, including FONAFIFO’s administrative costs
and costs borne by program participants; (iii) costs related to forest management or
reforestation; and (iv) deadweight losses arising from the manner in which financing is
generated. These costs could be approximated by the costs of the projects using the actual
yearly disbursement figures.
At the ICR stage, although the same limitations of data persist the team has tried to perform
an economic analysis of the results of the project. The same benefits identified at appraisal
stage stand and this analysis focuses primarily on the benefits related to areas of existing
forests brought under conservation contracts in terms of avoided deforestation. The analysis
assumes a rate of deforestation of 10% which is very conservative given that Costa Rica
achieved negative net deforestation in the early 2000s. Andam, K. S. et al. (2008) “find that
approximately 10% of the protected forests would have been deforested had they not been
protected” 1 for the period between 1960 and 1997. The project also contributed to
reforestation which in the long run will generate increasing benefits. These benefits have
been ignored in the economic analysis. Another benefit associated with the project sale of
carbon credits, which unfortunately has not really materialized due to the recent collapse of
the carbon market.
At the end of the implementation phase, 47,432 ha of forest had been contracted under
PSA, which represented about 4,743 ha of avoided deforestation (10%). Estimating economic
benefits of protected areas involves estimating both market and nonmarket benefits.
Nonmarket benefits are associated with non-extractive carbon, recreation, and biodiversity. A
recent analysis performed for the Belize Protected Areas Project concluded that the benefits
of primary forest protection net of the indirect opportunity costs could be estimated at
US$4,500 per ha per year2. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature
categories I–VI) are valued at the lower returns per hectare to pasture land and crop land—a

Protected Areas, which is compiled by United Nations Environment Programme’s World
Conservation Monitoring Centre. Based on these data, benefits associated with protected
areas in Costa Rica are estimated to US$8,600 per ha.
Four scenarios have been used in the analysis. The first and second scenarios assumed the
estimated benefit to be US$8,600 and US$4,500 per ha, respectively. To test for robustness
of the results, scenarios 3 and 4 used much lower benefits (US$3,000 and US$2,000 per ha,
respectively). Scenarios 3 and 4 allowed the team to correct for any overestimation of the
economic value associated with protected area by applying as much as 65% and more than
75% of discount to the original estimate of US$8,600. The simulations applied the following
discount rates: 2%, 4%, 5%, and 10%. It turns out that results are positive for most situations,
except at the 5% and 10% discount rates under scenario 4.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results3

The main expected benefits of Ecomarkets II were: conservation of biodiversity, increase in
the participation of indigenous women in the program, participation of small forest owners,
and public recognition that intact forests and their environmental services are valuable.
Ecomarkets II applied the following modalities to implement the PES program: a) protection
of forest; b) reforestation; c) natural regeneration; d) management of forest; e) agroforestry
systems (SAF) for participating forest owners in priority areas established by the National
System of Conservation Areas (SINAC).
One of the main participants in the PES program were indigenous territories, representing
about 2% of the national population with approximately 350,000 hectares (7% of the country,
according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census, 2000). In Costa Rica there are 24
indigenous territories with eight different ethnicities; under Ecomarkets II all but two of these
did not enter the PES program. This is important as indigenous territories are particularly
relevant, given the high concentrations of forest located in their territories. The highest
participation in the program has been concentrated in the Bribri-Cabécar territories belonging
to the La Amistad Biosphere Reserve and in Guaymi of Coto Brus, Conte Burica and Osa,
which are the indigenous territories with more forests and agroforestry systems in the
country.
The project’s design was consistent with the country’s long-term development goals; its
strategies and components had the same purpose, although with different modes of action, but
always aimed at improving forest conservation.
However, Ecomarkets II had a limited monitoring and evaluation system to measure the
environmental, economic and social impact it had. A limited number of indicators was
available that only allowed monitoring of some variables. Still, anecdotal evidence found
during the preparation of the ICR shows that all PES participants in indigenous territories
used the program’s resources for various activities with significant development results in
environmental, social and economic aspects, especially in the context of strengthening the
administrative, organizational and financial management capabilities of the Associations for
the Integral Indigenous Development (ADII).
The benefits generated by the PES in indigenous territories contributed to the human
development of these communities, located in areas where coverage by many public
institutions is limited. The direct insertion of capital into the local family economy represents
(i) an opportunity for many indigenous families (especially for women and children) for
acquiring food and clothing, (ii) the recovery of the territory through the purchase of land,
(iii) the improvement of the standard of living with access to basic services, and (iv) the
strengthening of indigenous governance and capacity building for government and self-
management.
Regarding environmental indicators, the project used FONAFIFO’s monitoring system,
which has been useful to monitor the conservation of forest cover. However, it has not been
able to demonstrate the impact on conservation of globally significant biodiversity by
creating connectivity between protected areas that are geographically isolated or have high
levels of biodiversity, because a biodiversity baseline was not available at the start of the
project.
Ecomarkets II generated a series of unanticipated impacts, which have helped to increase its
level of performance. Men and women of participating indigenous territories experienced

significant improvements in their livelihoods: they saw improved access to basic public
services such as education and health; improvements of infrastructure like roads and
electricity; and the implementation of social development programs, such as construction of
houses. Other members of the communities had direct access to increased income. Similarly,
the ADII befitted from improved management capabilities and self-government. In general,
there was a high level of local satisfaction.
The Project has learned important lessons that can be taken up in the field of forest
conservation:
   PES has the potential to promote conservation, and at the same time, reduce the
    vulnerability of the rural poor through the provision of additional income and financial
    stability.
   The concept of conservation used by the PES implies the exclusion of communities in
    areas that generate the environmental services. For the indigenous communities this
    means restrictions of access to and use of the natural resources, and a loss of use value in
    non-timber species.
   Environmental conservation funded by the PES did not promote the development of
    indigenous territories through the production of non-traditional goods and services such
    as ecotourism. Additional sources of funding could be used by the ADII.
   The PSA has promoted the diversification of land use and the adoption of improved
    farming practices, such as agroforestry systems, generating environmental services and
    contributing to local food security.
   The ADII consider that the indigenous character of the territories require an indigenous-
    specific PES.
   While Ecomarkets II did not aim for an explicit targeting of the poorest indigenous
    communities, the distribution per se of forests in Costa Rica resulted in such. No
    evidence of any barriers to the participation of the poorest indigenous communities has
    been identified in PES.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                                  Ecomarkets II:
   A stimulus to Costa Rica’s Payments for Environmental Services (PES) Program
Two agreements were signed for this project: loan agreement IBRD 4557-CR and donation
agreement 23681-CR. Both became priorities for the Costa Rican government since they
were unanimously approved by the Legislative Assembly on the vote for loan contract No.
7388-CR and its annexes between the Republic of Costa Rica and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which created Law No. 8640.
Ecomarkets II was implemented from 2008 to March 2014 with the following funds:
 Loan of US$30 million from the World Bank & a Global Environment Facility (GEF)
   grant of US$10 million. Of this amount, US$9.2 million went to capitalizing the Fund for
   Sustainable Biodiversity (FSB) and US$0.8 million for institutional strengthening.
 Counterpart contributions in the amount of US$72.2 million from the Costa Rican
   government, primarily coming from the hydrocarbon tax and from the Water Tariff as
   counterpart funding for the loan.
 Additionally, US$8.5 million in revenue from other Donors (including Germany (KfW).
In total, Ecomarkets II provided FONAFIFO with US$120.7 million to implement the
country’s Payments for Environmental Services (PES) Program.

Main outcomes
Tariff for the Use of Water
In the context of project formulation, a study was conducted on “Identification of important
water areas and estimates of revenues from the water tariff.” Based on this research, a map of
the important water areas was developed. In addition, the information from this map and the
map of the distribution of the number of concessions per watershed was combined with the
2005 forest cover map. This was done in order to ensure that payments were made to forest
areas that protect water resources.
Based on research regarding the Ministry of the Environment and Ener gy (MINAE)’s
collection of water tariff payments, the Río Grande de Tárcoles watershed contributes 29% of
the water tariff fees collected, followed by the San Carlos River watershed with 16%, and the
Reventazón River watershed with 11%. Before it had this information, the National Fund for
Forestry Financing (Spanish acronym FONAFIFO) prioritized watersheds with the highest
water potential; but since 2011, it has been setting priorities based on the collection of Water
tariff fees obtained per watershed. This distribution was adjusted to the administrative
coverage of each one of FONAFIFO’s nine Regional Offices.
With the approval of the Ecomarkets II Law, Law No. 8640, the Fund for Sustainable
Biodiversity (FSB) was created in 2008. “The Fund for Sustainable Biodiversity (FSB) is an
endowment fund mechanism with institutional autonomy, which injects financial resources
for the long-term sustainability of the PES program in areas with high biodiversity. As a trust,
it is ascribed to the state banking system through the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica”
(Obando, 2013).
This trust constituted by the Environmental Bank Foundation (Spanish acronym FUNBAM),
aims to preserve nationally and globally relevant environmental services provided by forest
ecosystems; to accomplish this it must develop new economic incentive schemes.
The GEF provided US$9.2 million in initial funding for the FSB, with one-to-one counterpart
funding for a maximum of US$15 million. The goal is to have eventually a US$100 million

                                                                                             10
endowment fund by 2021. By the end of the Ecomarkets II project in March 2014, a total of
US$18.5 million had been raised.
The Fund for Sustainable Biodiversity concentrates on private areas within biological
corridors and indigenous areas that have high levels of biodiversity and have also been
prioritized using the National System of Conservation Areas (Spanish acronym SINAC)
criteria.
Global carbon markets
Through the initiative “Carbon Sequestration on Farms of Small and Medium-size Producers
of the Brunca Region,” Costa Rica registered its first CDM (Clean Development Mechanism)
forest project in February 2013, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). This project generated 23,080 tons of Certified Emission Reductions
(CER). FONAFIFO successfully negotiated a price of US$4.15 per ton of certified CO2 with
the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund. It is important to recall that the progress and the ground
covered on this matter has contributed to Costa Rica’s participation in the International
Strategy for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) and in the
National Carbon Neutrality Program. All of the experience that Costa Rica obtained has meant
that, in addition to the global market, it has explored the national market, selling carbon to
those businesses that need to offset their emissions. Therefore, FONAFIFO is promoting three
national projects to offset greenhouse gas emissions through farms under PES contracts. The
projects are in Guanacaste, Northern Zone and Southern Pacific.
Through 2013, the year Ecomarkets II was closed out, it is estimated that approximately
300,000 tons of net accumulated increase of carbon fixed through the contracts were included
within the area of the three projects cited.
Obtaining financial resources to fund PES
Under Ecomarkets II a series of initiatives have been developed in order to secure funding for
PES, including: (i) Environmental Services Certificate; (ii) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Mitigation
Service Certificate; (iii) Clean Flight Program; (iv) Donations, as well as (v) Agreements with
different organizations. Others, such as the “Ecomarchamo” and the “Servibanca Green Credit
Card” are both handled by the National Bank of Costa Rica (Spanish acronym BNCR), which
allocates 10% of its commission to the FSB endowment fund. FONAFIFO has started
negotiating a Green Credit Card with BNCR and a prepaid tourism card with the Costa Rican
Tourism Institute.
Technical strengthening of FONAFIFO
During the execution of the Ecomarkets II project, the technical and technological platform for
each one of the Regional FONAFIFO Offices was supported.
In addition, a number of steps have been taken to promote South-South cooperation, including
during the Ecomarkets II project. For example, in 2013 an International Workshop was held
that was organized jointly with the World Bank, whose aim was to present the lessons learned
from PES and to support the implementation of Costa Rica’s Preparation Proposal REDD+.
This workshop was attended by experts from 26 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and
America.
Similarly, during the execution of the Ecomarkets II project, FONAFIFO officials have
participated in various workshops or conferences in several countries including: Germany,
Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. They have also received
more than 150 representatives of international organizations interested in learning about
aspects of how the PES program operates. In addition, a cooperative program was developed
on the subject of PES with the government of Bolivia.
In parallel and as part of the efforts made during Ecomarkets II, the participation of
                                                                                            11
community-based organizations was enhanced.
Finally, in conjunction with the ONF, PES procedures were analyzed in order to make them
faster and easier. This analysis helped define more efficient processes.
Monitoring: PES contracts
Thus, from 2008 to 2013, FONAFIFO has channeled its monitoring and oversight efforts to
PES contracts through the Department of Control and Monitoring. In the field, this Department
monitors the different modalities of PES contracts and verifies compliance with the obligations
of the contract and the information contained in the technical documents.
It should be noted that FONAFIFO has an Institutional Geographic Information System for
recording each PES contract on a geographical basis, which allows monitoring forest cover
and the changes that can occur over time.
In support of these actions, the Regional Offices also perform control tasks on farms with PES;
each one of the Offices must conduct inspections on at least 50 farms per year. Due to the
working synergy, field tracking is done annually for more than 1,000 contracts in different
modalities, which generally represents 20% of all valid contracts.
Also, throughout this monitoring process SINAC also assists with supervisory activities for
PES contracts, since it must include them in its monitoring strategy. Apart from all this work,
FONAFIFO also hires external consultants to evaluate PES performance.
Biodiversity monitoring
With Ecomarkets II, a study was conducted to determine the baseline for biodiversity
monitoring. In this research, a pilot area was selected (in the northern region of the country),
with an estimated sample of 10% of the farms under PES contracts in the modalities of Forest
Protection, Protection in Protected Areas and Protection in Conservation Gaps, in accord with
the statistical design. The baseline for the terrestrial biodiversity of the PES program used the
contracts for the farms subjected to the program in 2012 as a starting point, considering three
areas for analysis: national, regional and farm.
For this baseline measurement experience and making improvements based on lessons learned,
the average cost of measuring an isolated farm, regardless of transportation costs, amounts to
US$15,000.
As part of the future actions suggested by this study, emphasized is the need to implement this
methodology country-wide, selecting farms at random in a stratified way, with representation
from different areas, categories, sizes, proximity and/or connection to other areas that could
affect biodiversity.
Also, it will be necessary to gather more detailed information about the total number of farms
with PES that are under protection, their spatial location, the area subject to PES, as well as
start and end dates of the contract.
Payment for Environmental Services
At the beginning of the Ecomarkets II project, the goal established for PES for the period 2008
- 2013 was to maintain at least 288,000 hectares of land under PES contracts in order to provide
environmental services of local as well as global importance.
At the close-out of Ecomarkets II, FONAFIFO had met this goal satisfactorily for a total of
about 297,432.23 hectares in the different modalities of the PES program. According to
FONAFIFO’s Department of Environmental Management Services, a total of 6,510 contracts
were reported. Regarding the Agroforestry Systems modality, almost 3.5 million trees (2008-
2013 data) were counted.
As has been mentioned, the partnering, advising and monitoring carried out by the Regional
                                                                                              12
Offices has been vital, not only in accompanying the beneficiaries during their process of
admission to the PES program, but also so that farms already in the program can successfully
conclude their contracts.
Evaluation matrix
Since 2011, FONAFIFO has been using a matrix that sets the priorities for rating the eligible
pre-applications to the PES program in the Forest Protection modality.
The matrix combines important aspects of forestry and ecosystem resources, such as location in
relation to the protected wilderness areas, biological corridors, and protection of water
resources, among others. In addition, using a point system, higher scores are assigned to farms
located in districts with low Social Development Indices. More points are also given for farms
located in indigenous communities or with sizes smaller than 50 hectares. Because of these
provisions, more small and medium-size landowners are involved. In 2012 the matrix was
revised and to increase the point score for farms smaller than 50 hectares.
Landowners with farms smaller than 100 hectares
It was because of the matrix that Ecomarkets II successfully achieved the goal of increasing the
number of small and medium-size landowners participating in the PES by 50%. It began with a
baseline of 1,900 and by project end it had more than 4,700 small and medium-size landowners
participating.
Participation of indigenous communities
In Costa Rica indigenous territories are established as special priority areas, especially as buffer
zones, such as those situated in the Talamanca Cordillera and the Osa, as well as their
biological corridors. Although the lack of deeds for land ownership in some territories was
inconvenient, Ecomarkets II facilitated entering into contracts with most of the Indigenous
Integral Development Associations (Spanish acronym ADIRI). Between 2008 and 2013, more
than 67,500 hectares in indigenous territory have been under the PES program in different
modalities, mainly for Forest Protection.
It is important to point out that FONAFIFO, by legal mandate, signs contracts with ADIRI,
which is the legal owner of the territory and is responsible for fulfilling the contract; but ADIRI
has autonomy in its decision making about how to allocate or invest the resources from the PES
program. From 2008 to 2013, FONAFIFO had committed more than US$31.4 million with
ADIRI through the PES program until 2023.
Participation of women
Keeping the number of women landowners registered in the PES program at 474 was one of the
goals set by Ecomarkets II. For 2013, the final year of the project, there are 877 contracts
signed with owners of forests and plantations (the average for the period reaches 173% of goal
fulfillment).
Watershed Management in low income areas
Three watersheds were selected for this subcomponent of the Ecomarkets II project:
 Jesús María River Basin, located on the Central Pacific slope. The predominant economic
   activities are beef cattle and agriculture; both have exerted strong pressure on the forest, soil and
   water resources of this area. According to the National Action Program to Combat Land
   Degradation, this basin has the highest levels of land degradation in the country.
 Morote River Basin, Guanacaste. The following problems have been identified in this
   watershed: unsound land use and management, poor water resource management, deficient
   environmental management and weak organization of the agricultural and forestry sectors to
   enhance their productive activities.
 Volcán River Basin, Buenos Aires, Puntarenas. The highest parts of the watershed are in the
   protected area of La Amistad International Park, but there is a significant presence of grazing
                                                                                                    13
    livestock and coffee farming in the park’s buffer zone.
Due to these situations, it was decided that Ecomarkets II would start to generate PES contracts in
these areas and it would also provide solutions that would go far beyond forests, encouraging the
engagement of all actors in these basins: community grassroots organizations, government agencies,
donors, groups of women, artisans, and others. As a result of the research conducted in each one of
these watersheds, management plans were developed. These planning tools are essential to more
efficient land use.
Social and economic impact
In order to explore the potential impacts of the PES program on the socioeconomic dimension,
FONAFIFO conducted a study to determine these aspects. In particular, the potential effects on the
direct beneficiaries of the payments were evaluated as were the indirect effects on poverty and the
job market in the PES coverage area. The study did not consider indigenous territories. The main
results were:
 The main use of the money received from PES goes to investments on the farm or the part of the
    farm under PES. Secondly, payment is useful to them for meeting household expenditures and
    consumption, followed by investments on the farm or part of the farm without PES.
 PES can have an impact on income to the extent that the net payment for environmental services
    is higher than the income from an alternative activity.
 The PES program is aimed at landowners. This situation can exclude groups in extreme poverty.
 By introducing agricultural and other land use restrictions, PES tend to have an impact that
    decreases the job supply.
 Effectively, farms under PES use less fixed labor than ones that do not have a contract.
In 2013 the study found that there is no tool that allows the measurement of poverty when requests
are received; however, part of the strategy will be to encourage the participation of landowners with
low income. Towards this end, the use of indicators such as farm size, educational level and
household income is essential.
Lessons learned
Evaluating the results obtained and what was achieved from the actions implemented during the
Ecomarkets II project, several lessons learned can be listed, especially:
 Resource requirements: Landowning families increasingly want to apply to the PES program
   but they cannot be included due to the limited resources of the program. Here, interventions by
   private enterprise or autonomous institutions become more relevant.
 Revising the matrix: It is necessary to revise the pre-application matrix in the Forest Protection
   modality in order to allow the participation of farms smaller than 50 hectares. Many
   smallholders have found it impossible to participate in PES due to the size of their farms or even
   the level of their income.
 More forest advisors with fewer projects: The participation of a greater number of forest
   advisors is needed to provide more control, monitoring and quality technical assistance. It is also
   essential that forest regents devote more time to advising PES contract beneficiaries.
 Greater dissemination of results: It became necessary to establish a direct channel between
   FONAFIFO’s Directorate of Environmental Services and the institutions, international agencies
   and private groups that constantly seek information about the PES program. Currently, this
   channel addresses demands for information from these institutions although there are continued
   actions to strengthen it.
 Indigenous territory. The indigenous communities have commitments to the PES program,
   progress and sustainability in their areas. In addition, the active participation of women has been
   a factor for success in the indigenous territories, particularly because women are the ones who
   manage household resources; therefore, it is essential to continue fostering that participation.
 Increased participation of private enterprise to ensure the sustainability of the PES program.
                                                                                                  14
    More and more companies are showing interest in participating in the PES program, due to,
    among other things, the same marketing efforts being carried out inside as well as outside the
    country. Given this situation, it would be beneficial to strengthen outreach activities that could
    also provide stronger support to the capitalization of the FSB. Along this line, it should be noted
    that many private companies in Costa Rica are carrying out various actions for corporate social
    responsibility. In this sense, it would be appropriate to encourage the participation of those that
    want to mitigate their environmental footprint.
   Control and monitoring. It is essential to continue strengthening ongoing monitoring processes
    in order to adjust and fine tune the PES platform. Program stakeholders should be fully
    acquainted with each one of the results that are being achieved, even those done by the
    contracted consultancies.
   Participation of owners of small and medium-size lands. It is essential to continue seeking
    mechanisms that encourage the participation of small and medium- size landowners. Studying
    and providing solutions to the main barriers to participation and providing more advice and
    information could be key factors for increasing their presence in the PES programs.
   Inter-institutional synergy. Based on the various partnerships that have been created around the
    PES platform, the participation and active engagement of the different organizations involved
    must be continually strengthened.
   Sustainability. While the PES program has developed different strategies to achieve fluid
    development, its economic sustainability will depend on the maintenance of government
    support, increased agreement processes with private partners, and continued international
    support.

Annex 9. Ecomarkets I goals, expected results and key performance indicators

The Ecomarkets Project’s Global Environmental Objective was to foster biodiversity
conservation and preserve important forest ecosystems through conservation easements on
privately owned lands outside of protected areas in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor of
Costa Rica (MBC/CR). The project development objective was to increase forest
conservation in Costa Rica by supporting the development of markets and private sector
providers of environmental services supplied by privately owned forests. The project directly
supported the implementation of Forestry Law No. 7575 (passed in 1996) by providing
financial incentives to forest owners in buffer zones and interconnecting biological corridors
contiguous to national parks and equivalent reserves for the provision of environmental
services relating to biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, hydrological services,
and scenic beauty.

The Ecomarkets Project’s goals were to: i) Support the supply of and demand for
environmental services provided by forest ecosystems; ii) strengthen management capacity
and assure financing of public-sector forestry programs administered by the Ministry of the
Environment and Energy (MINAE), including the National Forestry Financing Fund
(FONAFIFO), and the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC); and iii) strengthen
management capacity of local non-governmental organizations.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the Ecomarkets Project in achieving its GEO and PDO, the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) proposed six targets (the associated “output” is in
parentheses, when different from the indicator): (i) 150,000 ha of land incorporated into the
PSA program; (ii) 100,000 ha of conservation easements in MBC/CR priority areas
incorporated into the PSA program; (iii) establishment of a sustainable financing mechanism
to support conservation easements (i.e., a Trust Fund to be established in accordance with
GEF best practices); (iv) six NGOs working in priority areas in the MBC/CR strengthened
(six local NGOs providing services to the PSA program, and facilitating its access to small
landowners in priority areas of the MBC/CR); (v) 30% increase in participation of women
landowners and women’s organizations in the PSA program; and (vi) 100% increase in the
participation of indigenous communities in the PSA program. The Project Log Frame lists
two other anticipated outputs: (vii) fulfillment of existing contractual obligations by 2003;
and (viii) increase in the local capacity to value and market environmental services, as
measured through technical studies and the introduction of market mechanisms.

Key Performance Indicators

 • 150,000 hectares (ha) of forest land incorporated into the Payment for Environmental
   Services (PSA) program by the EoP, including 50,000 ha of privately owned lands
   within the MBC/CR in Tortuguero, Barbilla (Amistad- Caribe), Corcovado-Piedras
   Blancas (Osa), and the Paso de la Danta-Fila Costeña (which is in both the Osa and
   Central Pacific Conservation Areas) biological corridors, and 50,000 ha of privately
   owned lands within other Conservation Areas as identified in the GRUAS report.

 • 30% increase in the participation of women landowners and women’s organizations in
   the PSA program by EoP;

 • 100% increase in the participation of indigenous communities in the PSA program by
   EOP; and


                                                                                           19

Annex 10. FBS historic performance and 2014 projections

Data provided by the FBS during ICR preparation shows that by EOP the Fund was well on
its way to reaching an expected average return of close to 6% by the end of 2014. The data
below shows values up until April of 2014.

The graphs display FBS monthly portfolio (Figure 1), monthly returns (Figure 2) and average
annualized returns (Figure 3) for the period from July 2011 to April 2014. The graphs also
tell the story of the Fund’s performance and problems: GEF and KfW resources started
flowing into the Fund in 2010. Due to legal issues with the way GEF funds were transferred
to the country, the FBS portion of the GEF grant had to be withdrawn from the account in
early 2012 and was not returned until mid-2013.

KfW’s investment policies (which mandated a very risk-averse approach) limited the return
on investment to between 2.4 and 2.5% annually until mid-2013, at which time KfW
relinquished control of its donation and the FBS legally assumed full control of its investment
mechanisms. This coincided with the switch in FBS management; the outgoing fund manager
(a FONAFIFO Forestry Engineer) was replaced with a team of experienced fund managers
that were less risk-averse and more proactive in seeking better returns.

  PES is a market-based approach to conservation financing based on the principle that those who benefit from
environmental services should pay for them, and that those who contribute to generating these services should
receive compensation for providing them.
