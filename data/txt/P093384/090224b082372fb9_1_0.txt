                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last ISR prior to the closing of the project, which also records a final restructuring to re-allocate proceeds from the GEF grant portion of the project. While the IBRD loan
                         has been fully disbursed since December 2013 and the re-allocation will enable the full disbursement of GEF grant proceeds as well by project closure. With most activities finalized
                         or about to be completed, it is expected that the project will close orderly by March 31, 2014.
