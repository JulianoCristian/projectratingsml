for Environmental Management\n            Project for Costa Rica as follows: GEO outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to GEO outcome was\n            negligible to low, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project design and implementation need to acknowledge\n            country-specific complexities and pay particular attention\n            to project readiness prior to appraisal. Delays in\n            effectiveness can lead to a situation where the project\n            design is not aligned anymore to the situation on the\n            ground. Where project effectiveness is delayed, the validity\n            of assumptions made at appraisal needs to be reviewed, and\n            corrective action taken as early as possible upon\n            effectiveness. While ecological baselines are not always\n            readily at hand, science offers a number of alternatives for\n            properly measuring conservation achievements when data is\n            difficult to obtain or not available. Only biodiversity\n            operations and/or components that incorporate simple, but\n            proven data collection and measurement tools will ultimately\n            be able to deliver on the outcomes expected from such\n            programs in the long term. To ensure that a project\u0092s\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework serves its\n            purpose as a project management tool, relevant project\n            stakeholders need to adequately understand its concepts and\n            display the capacity to ensure appropriate implementation.\n            Where this is not the case, these deficiencies need to be\n            identified and addressed as a matter of priority. This could\n            be done by either providing additional technical assistance\n            to the implementation agency or, in circumstances where\n            better suited capacity is available outside, bringing this\n            expertise into the project at the design stage."}, "docdt": "2014-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
