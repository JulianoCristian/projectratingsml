                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The most important issues regarding project implementation are summarized below:

                         1. Disbursement delays of the Loan and GEF funds.
                         Due to changes in the legal structure of the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR), the no-objection from BNCR lawyers, specialists in administrative contracting, was required to
                         move contracts forward. Consultations were held with the World Bank's Legal Department and subsequently meetings were held with BNCR to clarify that the Bank procurement
                         rules, agreed between the Bank and Costa Rica and reflected in the Project Loan Agreement, were both compatible with the legal framework and binding for the country.
                         Subsequent to this clarification and to a 2 day training course on Bank Procurement Procedures in August, specifically prepared for BNCR staff, these roadblocks were removed with
                         a resumption of normal disbursement.

                         The Sustainable Biodiversity Fund is now operational having being capitalized with US$15.4million (US$7.5 million GEF and US$7.9 KfW).

                         2. Improving efficiency of the PES program.
                         Improving the PES program's efficiency is one of the project's main objectives, and has become all the more urgent with Costa Rica envisaging using PES as the main instrument of
                         its REDD strategy. A proposal for a study that would provide a much greater understanding of landholder opportunity costs in high deforestation areas and contribute to the design of
                         new contracts with much higher additionality was discussed. This proposal was prepared by a team from Harvard, UCSB, and UMD. FONAFIFO expressed interest in including the
                         study as part of component 2 activities aimed at improving PES program efficiency and requested that a detailed workplan and budget be prepared by the team as soon as possible.
                         This is currently under preparation.

                         3. Mid Term Review preparation.
                         During the mission one of the main topics was the preparation of the Mid-Term Review. It was agreed that similar to the previous project an evaluation of the project should be
                         undertaken by an independent expert party so as to maintain their independence. Studies that are currently being undertaken are targeted to specific areas where improvements are
                         needed. Considering that the evaluation will take approximately 3.5 months and has only recently begun and that end of the year festivities are coming up it was estimated that the
                         Mid Term could be held at the earliest middle of February.
