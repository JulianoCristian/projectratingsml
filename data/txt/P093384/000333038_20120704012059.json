The changes extend the closing date of both the loan\n            and the grant the project from July 31, 2012, to March 31,\n            2014. The extension of the closing date seeks to accommodate\n            the project's two-year delay in effectiveness to allow\n            for the sustainable and regular capitalization of Costa\n            Rica's Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) program\n            and Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS).
