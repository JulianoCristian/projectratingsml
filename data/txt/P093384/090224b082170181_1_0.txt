                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an Interim ISR to enable a re-allocation of proceeds from the GEF grant portion of the project. With a Closing Date of March 30, 2014 and occurred delays in the contracting
                         of a large consultancy (which cannot be implemented), funds currently allocated under the consultancy disbursement category cannot be utilized and will be reallocated to the
                         Endowment Fund (Fondo de Biodiversidad Sostenible - FBS). This reallocation will not affect the achievements of the PDO. A more substantial ISR will be prepared following the
                         Level 2 restructuring to accommodate the re-allocation.
