                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is providing an update on implementation progress reviewed during the April 1-5, 2013 supervision mission.

                         With a Closing Date of March 30, 2014, there is a need to accelerate implementation of planned consultancies (to be financed under the GEF grant) to ensure orderly closure of the
                         project.

                         The challenge of consistent fund flows to make regular conservation payments (over a five-year financial commitment period) remains; FONAFIFO is currently working on an
                         approach paper to address that revenues received from the gasoline and water taxes must be spent during the fiscal year they are received.

                         Addressing the recognized need to strengthen the communication/outreach strategy of the project, both internally and externally, will be critical for the long-term sustainability of the
                         project. In this context, the systematization of lessons learned (including social issues and the impact of the project on women, indigenous people and low income groups) as well as
                         achievements and challenges will be important.

                         The Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS) has been capitalized and is operational. However, given the low interest (2%) earned by the FBS, FUNBAP’s board has identified and is
                         reviewing a number of options to address this issue.

                         To take advantage of the experiences of other recognized Conservation Funds in the region it is proposed that FONAFIFO becomes part of the Latin America and Caribbean Network
                         of Environmental Funds (RedLAC), which will have its 15th Annual Assembly in Costa Rica in November 2013.
