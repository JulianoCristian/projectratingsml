                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is providing an update on implementation progress reviewed during a October 8-12, 2012 Task Management hand-over mission.

                         While the the agreements reached during the April 2012 Mid Term Review (MTR) have been formalized during a June 2012 restructuringof the project, it is now critical for
                         FONAFIFO, as implementation agency, to speed up ongoing/outstanding consultancies and field activities to be able to close the project orderly by the newly set Closing Date of April
                         30, 2014. This is critical to address the need of ensuring the sustainability and continuity of the area under conservation contracts, while at the same time improving the efficiency of
                         the program.

                         The main challenge continues to be the availability of a consistent fund flow to make regular conservation payments (over a five-year financial commitment period), while depending
                         on revenues received from the gasoline and water taxes, which must be spent during the fiscal year they are received. A number of new products and income generation activities (e.
                         g. a green credit card, a decal to off set carbon emissions from car use) are currently being implemented and/or developed. However, outreach and communication activities to
                         mainstream and promote these products need to be scaled up to be able to make a contribution to the fund flow problem. In addition, there is a need to strengthen efforts to better
                         communicate the achievements and lessons learned of the Payment for Environmental services, while at the same time critical analyze challenges and failures (if any) at the local
                         level.

                         Considering the low return for the Fondo de Biodiversidad Sostenible (currently at 2%), FONAFIFO and the Bank will work together to identify way for improvement, through different
                         activities, including the provision of international technical assistance, reaching out to other regional funds supported by GEF (such as PROFONANPE in Peru or Patrimonio Natural
                         in Colombia).
