¢MOKANDN WAND RECOHENUDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent oi US$350 million to help finance the Second Highway Sector
Investment Project. The loan would be at the standard variable interest rate
with a maturity of 20 years including five years of grace.
2.        Backtround and Maior Challenass.  Owing to the high priority given
by GOI to transport--and in particular to road transport, which is the
dominant mode--the sector has been able to meet the rapidly growing demands of
a fast expanding economy and the geographic coverage and availability of
services have improved considerably. In particular, GOI's expenditure
policies have consistently emphasized development, rehabilitation and
maintenanC of the road network and the capabilities of the Directorate
General of Highways (DGO) have been improved significantly both at the central
and provincial levels. For national and provincial roads, maintensace
allocations are at adequate levels and a sound road management system has been
introduced. For district roads, the planning and Implementation arrangements
are being improved and extended to the entire country and emphasis is now
being given to adequate maintenance.
3-        To improve the efficiency of road use and the quality of road
transport services, the Government adopted in 1989 a comprehensive Policy
Statement and Short Term Action Plan (PSAP) which was supported by the ongoing
Highway Sector Project. Major achievements under the Short Term Action Plan
(covering the period 1989-1992) includet
(a) Enactment of a new Road Traffic and Transport Lawl
(b) Decentralization of road traffic and transport functions to
provincial and district authorities;
(c) Increase of the automotive diesel price to its opportunity costi and
(d) Increase and restructuring of the annual motor vehicle tax on
commercial vehicles
4.        However, if the road sector is to continue meeting the increasitgly
heavy demands from sustained economic growth at 6-7 percent par ann,m, there
is a need for capacity Increases of the road network and for further
efficiency improvement. In particular, efforts will have to concentrate on
three broad areas: the judicious allocation of available budgetary funds
between competing needs, the quality of execution of road expenditure
programs, and the efficient use of the transport infrastructure and
facilities.
S.        The four-fold Increase in traffic on inter-urban roads during the
past two decades was mainly absorbed by spare capacity and road Improvement
works, including minor widening, of the existing network. However, on may
road links capacity constraints and congestion are emerging rapidly while
there will be much less spare capacity to accommodate the three to four-fold
increase in traffic in the next twenty years. The part of the existing network



- 2 -
which is in need of capacity expansion (e.g., widening to three or four lanes)
over the next ten years has been estimated to be in the range of 4,000 to
8,000 km. There is, therefore, a need for developing an appropriate strategy
--which takes into account environmental aspects and strikes the right balance
ia the allocation of resources between capacity expansion and preservation of
the network--to meet the expanding demands on the network.
6.        The second challenge facing the road sector is to raise further the
quality of road works. Although good progress has been made in the range of
factors which have a bearing on the effectiveness of road expenditures,
including design standards, specifications, the capability of the construction
industry, contracting and supervision arrangements, there remains scope for
continued improvement, in particular, under the dictrict roads programs.
7.        The third major challenge is to increase the efficiency of the
overall road transport system and to improve the quality of transport
services. To this end the Government has already established the required
legal and regulatory framework and adopted policies on road user charges,
vehicle weight and dimension regulations and road safety. It also prepared a
Stage II Action Plan covering the implementation of these policies during 1993
- 1996. The task ahead is to implement these policies effectively.
8.        Bank strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The above
transport sector challenges constitute an important subset of the development
challenges the Government will be facing during the coming years, namelys
(a) building and adapting institutions to the changing roles -if the public and
private sectorss (b) improving incentives to increase the effk._.._ncy and
competitiveness of the economy; (c) investing more in infrastructure and human
resources but with increased efficiency; (d) reducing poverty; and
(e) protecting the environment. As indicated in the Country Assistance
Strategy presented to the Executive Directors in December 1992, the Bank wlll
assist the Government to meet these challenges and the proposed project is
fully consistent with and indeed an important component of this strategy. Due
to its long association with the transport sector in Indonesia, the Bank is
well placed to support Government's efforts for its further development.
9.        Lending Exzerience.  Civil works under past projects supporting
national and provincial roads have in general been implemented within
schedule. Construction quality has improved considerably over time but
further improvement is needed. Past investments have been well justified and
the ERR. have been found to be only marginally lower than estimAted at
appraisal. The experience indicates that: (a) major and lasting improvements
can be achieved In the preparation and implementation of road programs;
(b) such improvements take a long time to introduce and require sustained
effort and participation from the Bank and the various government agencies
involved; and (c) improvements in procedures and practices need very careful
design and testing. These lessons have been incorporated in the design of
recent projects, whereby improvements are introduced on a pilot basis for
project financed works with a view of replication on a program-wide basis.
The experience of the most recent projects also underlines the importance oft
(i) strengthening of the local contracting industry; (1i) careful pre-
qualification and supervision of civil works; (iii) streamlining of
administrative procedures and of monitoring and reporting systems in an
increasiugly decentralized environment; and (iv) project start-up to tie in
with GOI's budgetary cycle. These issues have been taken up with the



- 3 -
concerned GOI authorities during Country Portfolio Performance Review
discussians and have been given close attention during project preparation.
10.       The results of assistance in t>^ area of road sector policies have
been mixed, particularly until the mid-1980s, with weak Bank super%tsion and
follow-up being a contributing factor. This experience demonstrate. the
importance of systematic dialogue with all concerned GOI agencies during
project preparation, and the need to carefully tailor the pace of
implementation to absorptive capacity. These lessons were incorporated in the
ongoing Highway Sector Project in the form of a detailed Action Plan which
already resulted in some significant advances (para. 3).
11.       Prolect ObJ1ective.  The objectives of the project are to meet the
rapid growth in road traffic and to reduce road transport system costs by
improving the .ervice quality of national and provincial roads, expanding the
capacity of the road network and farther strengthening the institutional
capability of the Directosate General of Highways and the agencies responsible
for road sector policies.
12.       ProLect Descrutign. The main components of the project are:
(a) network Improvement through 2,000 km of periodic road maintenanDe,
2,200 km o@ road betterment and 5,300 s of bridge replacement;
(b) capacity expansion and upgrading on 210 km of roads;
(c)  institutional strergtheDn8 of the central and provincial road
agencies (in planning, programming, design, execution, and
supervision of works) and buman resource development; and
(d) assistance to the Ministry of Communications (HOC) for further
progressive improvements in road user charges, the enforceument of
vehicle weight and dimension regulations and road traffic safety.
13.       Pro1ect Pinancin  agnd Imlementatik%.  The proposed Bank loan of
US$350 million would help finance the above components amounting to a total
project cost of US$680.5 million. Every year, DGH would prepare for Bank
review its three-year forward and annual work programs, formulated on the
basis of agreed criteria and principles, and would select civil works
contracts therefrom for Bank financing. The selected civil works contracts
and equipment procurement and the techneical assistance related to the road
agencies would be lmplemented by DGH. The technical assistance contracts and
the activities related to road sector policies would be the responsibility of
HDC. To accelerate implementatiorn of the first year program the project would
provide retroactive financing of up to US$3k5.0 million for civil works and
consultancy services contracts, let between June 1, 1993 and the signing of
the Loan Agreement. A breakdown of costs and the flnancing plan are shown in
Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A tlmetable of key project
processing events and the Status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia 'ae
given in Schedule C and D respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No 12161, dated February 7, 1994 is being distributed
separately.
14.       wnviron_ental Assessment. The vorks to be carried out on existing
alignments and within the existing right of way--the periodic maintenamce,
bridge works, more than 99 percent of the betterment works and an estimated
60 percent of the capacity expansion works--amount to more than 80 percent of



- 4 -
the value of the civil works. These works will have minor adverse
environmental impacts. In some instances--for example improvement of drainage
structures--project investments may reduce environmental problems. Minor and
short torm impacts from road widening works, such as loss of vegetation and
soil erosion, will be managed through standard mitigation measures for design
and construction which will be incorporated in the designs and the contract
documente.
15.       The works which require extension of the right of way and land
acquisition--less than 1 percent of the betterment works and an estimated
40 percent of the capacity expansion works--may have some impacts on the
environmnt and based on 01 regulations, require site-specific ZIA and
mitigation consisting of an Environmental Information Report (PIL) and
associated Management (RUL) and Monitoring (RPL) Plans. The Bank bas found
this process satisfactory and agreed to its use for several ongoing similar
programmatic type projects. The ezisting GOI regulations both ensure a sound
sczeening frami-ork and provide for appropriate impact mitigation measures
where necessary. As the ZIA and its associated impact mitige_Lon plan will be
submitted to the Bank as part of the approval of betterment and capacity
expansion subprojects requiring land acquisition, the Bank will satisfy itself
of the adequacy of the environmental assessment and mitigation measures before
loan funds are committed for such subprojects. Supervision of implementation
of the environmental mit:igation measures will be the responsibility of the
consultant in charge of works supervision.
16.       Land gcauisition and Resettlemwnt. As noted above, in a very few
instaucas there would be a need for oame land acquisition under betterment
works with minor widening and a number of subprojects under the capacity
expansion component involve land acquisition and resettlement/relocation. The
feasibility studies completed unuer the first phsse program of capacity
expansion indicate that four of the seven subprojects (which account for only
35 percent of the total length of these subprojects) require land acquisition
and that three of these four involve relocation of households. The land
acquisition requirements would range from 1.3 ha to 5.5 ha and would not be
concentrated in any one location. The number of households affected range
between 19 and 83. The nature of the surrounding rural environment would
enable replacement plots to be found in the vicinity.
17.       To ensure that resettlement and compensation plans are prepared in
accordance with the requirements of OD 4.30, agrement has been reached with
GOT on the principles to be followed in the preparation of these plans and the
detailed engineering designs. The Bank will review the detailed engineering
and resettlement and compensation plans before funds are committed to finance
subprojects requiring resettlement and/or compensation. Implementation of the
plans will be supervised by the works supervision consultant who will receive
training and support under the project.
18.       Pro1ect Sustainabllitv.  The civil works components are sustainable
because DGHis practices and procedures meet adequate standards. Moreover, as
the project would further strengthen program management, quality of execution,
and Integration of environmental aspects in the project cycle, sustainability
will continue to Improve.



- 5 -
19.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations GOI agreed on the followings
(a) annual review of the implementation of the current year's road
egpenditure program and of the forward work program and budget,
including the criteria used in preparing the work programs;
(b)  establishment of arrangements for coordinating and monitoring
imaplementation of the Stage II Action Plan for Subsector Policies
and a=nual revi_w of the Action Plan;
(c) principles and procedures for selecting and preparing subprojects
and for preparing environmental assessment and mitigation plans and
aotion plans for resettling and/or compensating affected people; and
(d) approval of subprojects (including the arrangewmets for the
appointment of conwultants for construction supervision, and as
rsquired, an environmental action plan and/or resettlement action
and monitoring plan) will be a condition of disbursement of each
civil works subproject.
20.       Proaram Obiective Cateaories.  The project does not lend itself to
directly addressing poverty and WID issues. Its focus is on infrastructure
development. Because of the importfqnt role played by private contractors and
consultants in the execution of road works it will indirectly contribute to
development of the private sector. Improvement in the adequacy and quality of
roads will be important for private sector development in general.
21.       Prolect Benefits.  The project will reduce the cost of road
iftrastructure provision and use and help forestall infrastructure bottlenecks
which could constrain future economic &rowth. Lower road transport costs will
be passed on to consumers and producers and over time will translate Into
lower agricultural and industrial production costs. They will also contribute
to a better integration of the Indonesian economy. The overall economic rate
of return on the civil works subprojects is expected to be 38 percent.
22.       RJsks.  The risk of inadequate improvement in the quality of works
is being addressed through the various components and arrangements under the
project aimed at enhancing construction quality. The risk of unsatisfacto%y
progress in planning and programming will be reduced through the further
extension of the mAnagement support systems under the project and introduction
of data quality assurance measures. To help minimise the risk of slippages in
the implementation of parts of the Stage II Action Plan, agreement was reached
on the establishment of an effective mechanism for coordination and
implementation monitoring.
23.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
