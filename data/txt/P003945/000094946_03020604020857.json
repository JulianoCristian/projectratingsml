with only modest\n            institutional development impacts. Among the lessons\n            learned, it is suggested that while the focus was mainly on\n            maintenance, and rehabilitation works - in principle a sound\n            response to the crisis at the time, to seek the highest rate\n            of return - however in practice, this caused works which\n            were viable (but with lower rates of return) to be dropped.\n            The economy would have been better served by a balanced\n            program, one that retained a small high priority\n            congestion-relief program, with high returns. Furthermore,\n            current practices in the road sector hinder incentives to\n            achieve good quality. Thus it is recommended that\n            output-based, and performance-based contracts, be\n            implemented on a trial basis for maintenance, and\n            rehabilitation works. And, improvements to the financing of\n            the road sector, needs to focus both on savings in\n            implementation costs, and on relating revenues more closely\n            to costs recovery incurred through road usage. Other lessons\n            address: a) management and information technology, i.e.,\n            more affordability, and sustainability of surveys, accuracy\n            and reliability in a decentralized environment, and,\n            conversion of the database to a geo-referenced location\n            referencing system; b) programmatic lending should in the\n            future adhere more closely to the annual budget cycle, with\n            stronger internal controls to ensure rigorous preparation,\n            and implementation; and, c)future sector dialogue should\n            build on improving cost recovery, and the structure of road\n            user charges."}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
