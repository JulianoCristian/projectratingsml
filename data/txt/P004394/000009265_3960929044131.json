           performance was on an improving trend in the second half of\n            the 1980s. Overall economic growth revived sufficiently\n            during 1985-88 to allow some recovery in per capita income\n            following several years of decline. The objective of this\n            Structural Adjustment Loan is to support the stabilization\n            and structural adjustment program the Government has\n            embarked on in response to adverse shocks, including the\n            closure of Bougainville mine. The program focuses on : 1)\n            macroeconomic policy adjustments to maintain financial\n            stability; 2) improvements in public resource management; 3)\n            improving expenditure management; 4) enhancing institutional\n            capacities; and 4) promotion of the nonmining private\n            sector, through adjustments in exchange rate and wage\n            policies, investment deregulation, privitization, and trade\n            policy reform."}, "docdt": "1990-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
