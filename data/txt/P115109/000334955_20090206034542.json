rural\n            businesses by improving the ability of farmers and rural\n            entrepreneurs to access markets and by stimulating\n            market-oriented private and public investments in rural\n            areas. The project consists of four components to be\n            implemented over four years. The major focus will be to\n            support the continued development of commercial activities\n            in the rural areas by improving market linkages, product\n            quality, competitiveness and capacity of Armenian rural\n            entrepreneurs and producers. The project will have a\n            three-tiered approach by addressing critical gaps at the\n            farm level, at the community level, and at the rural\n            business and agro processor level. Regarding investment\n            financing, the project provides resources for on-lending to\n            farmers and farmer groups, agro-processors, and other\n            agri-businesses through qualifying Participating Financial\n            Institutions (PFIs)."}, "docdt": "2009-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
