                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project team would like to highlight the support that the Bank provided in response to a request from Armenian Government and establish a credit line facility to mitigate the
                         impact of the global financial crisis on rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the country. During nearly one and half year of implementation the project was advancing smoothly
                         towards achieving its development objective through proving necessary liquidity support in local currency to participating financial institutions and improving the access to finance for
                         domestic SMEs.

                         about 1,300 SMEs operating in trade, services, production and agricultural sectors for both investment and working capital needs, and so far SMEs have received more than USD
                         20.7 million. Lending is provided by 9 banks and 1 non-bank financial institution and several are expected to join the project in forthcoming year.
                         The project supervision team believes that overall the PFIs are more satisfied with the facility after the requested revisions into the POM were authorized by the Bank in the summer.
                         And in general, the participating banks were found to be operating in line with the AFSME project requirements. The mission had a wrap-up meeting with the Chairman of the CBA,
                         Director of the GAFPMU and other senior CBA officials wherein few issues to further improve the performance were discussed.
