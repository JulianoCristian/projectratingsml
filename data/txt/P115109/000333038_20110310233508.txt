Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for 
Armenia, Access to Finance for Small and Medium Enterprises,
 
Loan No. 7657-AM, P115109 
will be extended
 
from
 September 28, 2011
 until 
December 31, 2012
.
2. 
As of now US$ 30 mn. has been disbursed to the Project’s Designated Account, of 
which about US$ 22.8 mn. (AMD 8.3 bln.) has been disbursed cumulatively at end-
2010 to about 1,450 borrowers. Relatively slow disbursements can be attributed to the 
launch of a parallel US$50 million SME facility made available by a bilateral donor 
to the Government of Armenia in mid-2009.   This SME facility, priced at the same 
rate as the AFSME facility, was offered with more flexible conditions and was fully 
disbursed in less than a year.  With this competing facility fully disbursed, and 
considering that several banks and one micro-finance organization joined the AFSME 
facility in late 2010 and more banks are slated to participate in the coming months, it 
is estimated that project disbursements will pick up sharply going forward. 
3. 
Based on the recent mid-term review for the AFSME project, the task team currently 
considers the overall implementation of the project as satisfactory, the current actions 
to facilitate the Project implementation are acceptable and the objectives of the 
Project continue to be achievable. The performance of the borrower and the 
implementing agency is satisfactory. The Mid-Term Review mission Aide-Memoire 
provides an action plan acceptable to the Bank to facilitate the project 
implementation, and the project is in compliance with financial management 
requirements. 
4. 
The proposed extension is necessary to absorb all the funds without lowering the 
quality of participating banks’ portfolios and will further reinforce the project 
outcomes, 
inter alia
,
expanding financial intermediation with growth in SME credit 
lines as a share of total credit. 
5. 
This will be the first extension of the project.
