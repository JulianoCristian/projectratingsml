                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Through the Access to Finance SME (AFSME) facility the Bank responded to a request from the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) and the Armenian Government to establish a credit
                         line to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the country. The project has achieved its development objective of improving the
                         access to finance for domestic SMEs through providing access to medium-term finance for participating financial institutions to a highly satisfactory extent. As of end-October 2012,
                         more than 6,800 loans have been provided cumulatively to SMEs (with target value of 2,500 loans) operating in trade, services, production and agricultural sectors for investment and
                         working capital needs. Cumulatively, SMEs have received more than US$ 91.5 million through the revolving credit line (with target value of US$ 50 million, representing the loan
                         amount). On the average the medium and long term lending accounted for 98% of the total SME portfolio throughout all the project implementation period. SME financing was
                         provided through 13 banks and 2 non-bank financial institutions (there are 21 banks and 33 NBFIs).

                         In general, the SME portfolio of the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) grown more than 2.4 times since 2008 (baseline year) and reached AMD 256.4 bln as of June 2012
                         (AMD106.5 bln in 2008). Specifically, additional lending by PFIs to SMEs is 5 times the amount drawn down under the project (the target was a multiplier of more than 1). The quality
                         of the project portfolio is considerably higher than targeted, and is better than the overall performance in the banking sector.
