                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Through the Access to Finance SME (AFSME) facility the Bank responded to a request from the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) and the Armenian Government to establish a credit
                         line to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the country. During two years of implementation, the project has advanced
                         towards achieving its development objective through providing access to medium-term finance for participating financial institutions, thus improving the access to finance for domestic
                         SMEs.

                         The project is progressing towards achieving the development results by providing mid-term financing to SMEs in Armenia. As of end-December 2011, more than 3,800 loans have
                         been provided cumulatively to SMEs operating in trade, services, production and agricultural sectors for investment and working capital needs. Cumulatively, SMEs have received

                         about USD 55.2 million through the revolving credit line. Progress is further demonstrated by the improvement of Armenia's ranking in access to credit improved by 5 points according
                         to the Doing Business 2012 report and, as a result, the CPIA rating for access to finance was upgraded from 3.5 to 4.0.

                         SME lending is provided through 13 banks and 2 non-bank financial institutions, including four new banks that signed Master Loan Agreement only in recently, suggesting demand is

                         slated to rise further throughout the remainder of the project life. The implementation support team believes that overall banks have a better understanding of the project
                         requirements, and as a result the commercial practice in the banks have been improved since the project establishment. In general, the participating banks were found to be
                         operating in line with the AFSME project requirements.
