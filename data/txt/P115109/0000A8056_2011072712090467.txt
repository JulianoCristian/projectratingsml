                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Through the AFSME facility the Bank responded to a request from the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) and the Armenian Government to establish a credit line to mitigate the impact
                         of the global financial crisis on rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the country. During two years of implementation the project has advanced towards achieving its
                         development objective through providing access to medium-term finance for participating financial institutions, thus improving the access to finance for domestic SMEs.

                         The project is progressing towards achieving the development results by providing mid-term financing to SMEs in Armenia. As of end-May 2011 about 2,000 loans have been
                         provided SMEs operating in trade, services, production and agricultural sectors for investment and working capital needs. Cumulatively, SMEs have received more than USD 30
                         million through the revolving credit line. SME lending is provided through 9 banks and 1 non-bank financial institution; four new PFIs joined the project only in recent weeks,

                         The implementation support team believes that overall PFIs have a better grasp of the AFSME project requirements, as the quality of loan files has improved as demand for the
                         AFSME facility has markedly increased from late 2010 onwards. In general, the participating banks were found to be operating in line with the AFSME project requirements. During
                         the May 2011 mission the team held a wrap-up meeting with the Chairman of the CBA, Director of the GAFPMU and other senior CBA officials wherein further improvements to the
                         POM were discussed to enhance the performance of the Project.
