      Re:  Sudan Emergency Drought Recovery Project
           IDA Credit 2290 SU - Amendments
Dear Mr. Abdelrahman,
      I refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the Emergency
Drought Recovery Project dated August 7, 1991, between the Republic
of Sudan (the Borrower) and the lnternational Development
Association (the Association).  We also refer to discussions
between National Reconstruction Implementation Unit and the
Association during the last supervision mission in September this
year.  I refer in particular to paragraph 6(c) of the Aide Memoire
prepared by the supervision mission.  In that paragraph the
Government is on record as requesting that emergency essential drugs
can be used in the Northern and Southern states as well as Kordofan,
Darfur and the Red Sea Hills of Eastern State.
      We are pleased to inform you that the Association has agreed
to amend the Credit Agreement as follows:
      Part BI o f Schedule 2 to the Development Credit Agreement
shall be amended to read as follows:
"I.   Acquisition of emergency essential drugs, vaccines and medical
equipment  and their distribution to persons in areas affected by
drought in the States of Kordofan and Darfur, the Red Sea Hills area
of the Eastern State, and in the Northern and Southern State."
      All provisions, of the Development Credit Agreement as amended
herein shall remain in full force and effect.
      Please confirm your agreement to the amendments by
countersigning and returning to us the enclosed copy of this letter.
                                  Sincerely yours,
                                  Francis x. Colaco
