Access to clean water was limited, and old\n            leaky pipes meant massive water losses that Palestinians\n            could simply not afford. As a result, water was relatively\n            scarce and costly. In one of the most densely populated\n            areas in the world, the need for a dependable water supply\n            was critical. The World Bank and other donors got together\n            with the Palestinian Water Authority to launch the Gaza\n            Water and Sanitation Services Project. The project targeted\n            the efficiency of the water distribution system, the quality\n            of water supply and wastewater treatment. The water\n            authority, a newly created agency unifying the sixteen\n            municipalities of the Gaza strip, has proved one of the most\n            effective national institutions, given that it relies on a\n            dialogue with the private sector, distributors and\n            residents. Providing safe water for more than 1.2 million\n            residents required significant repairs, which increased\n            water availability by 69 percent by May 2002. More than\n            1,260 kilometers of pipes were surveyed and more than 50,000\n            water meters repaired or replaced. In addition, some 22,000\n            household service connections were replaced. In 1996, only\n            50 percent of water supply was treated, but now 96 percent\n            of the supply is safe for drinking. Gaza strip resident\n            Majed Mahmoud says that during the hot summer months his\n            family used to be deprived of water, particularly those\n            members who lived in outlying areas. \u0091But in the past four\n            years, we have seen a steady increase in the amount of water\n            available for our basic household needs.\u0092"}, "docdt": "2003-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
