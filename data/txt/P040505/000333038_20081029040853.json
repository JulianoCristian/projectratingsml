The project contributed to\n            better water supply and sanitation services for the\n            population of Gaza. By 2001, water use had gone up from 70\n            to 100 liter per person per day. Water quality had improved.\n            Unaccounted for water had decreased from 50 percent to 30\n            percent, and revenues had increased. This performance\n            improvement was achieved despite the difficult political\n            situation, the absence of a clear legal and regulatory\n            framework, and tariffs well below cost recovery levels."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
