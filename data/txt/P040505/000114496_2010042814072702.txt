under 
the Trust Fund Credit Agreement or to achieve the objectives of the

the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account shall have been

thirty 
days, or (b) at any time, the Administrator determines, after

required to finance the Project’s costs to be financed out of the proceeds of 
the 
Credit, or (c) at any time, the Administrator determines, with respect to 
any 
contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit, that corrupt or

a 
beneficiary of the Credit during the procurement or the execution of such 
contract, without the Borrower having taken timely and appropriate action 
satisfactory to the Administrator to remedy the situation, and establishes the 
amount 
of expenditures in respect of such contract which would otherwise have 
been eligible 
for financing out of the proceeds of the Credit, or (d) at any 
time, the 
Administrator determines that the procurement of any contract to be 
financed out 
of the proceeds of the Credit is inconsistent with the procedures  set forth or 
referred to in the Trust Fund Credit Agreement and establishes 
the amount of 
expenditures in respect of such contract which would otherwise 
have been 
eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Credit, or (e) 
after the 
Closing Date, an amount of the Credit shall remain unwithdrawn from 
the Credit 
Account, the Administrator may, by notice to the Borrower, 
terminate the 
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals to such amount. Upon

Agreement; or (ii) sold, leased, transferred, assigned, or otherwise disposed
