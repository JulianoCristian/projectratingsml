Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall,
proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to another Category
and which in the opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other
expenditures; and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the
estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then ap-
plicable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals
under such Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder
shall have been made.

ment of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the proce-
dures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures
for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting any
other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement,

SCHEDULE 4
Procurement
1.   Contracts for civil works and equipment shall be let under
procedures consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by
the Bank in August 1975 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on
the basis of international competitive bidding.
2.   With respect to any contract for civil works:
(a) Bidders shall be required to prequalify and at least 45
days shall be allowed for submission of prequalification documents.
The Borrower shall, before prequalification is invited, inform the
Bank in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall introduce
such modifications in said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably
request. The list of prequalified bidders, together with a state-
ment of their qualifications and of the reasons for the exclusion
of any applicant for prequalification, shall be furnished by the
Borrower to the Bank for its comments befbre the applicants are
notified and the Borrower shall make such additions to or deletions
from the said list as the Bank shall reasonably request.
(b) Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to
the Bank fbr its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and
the specifications and other bidding documents, together with a
description of the advertising procedures to be followed for the
bidding. The bidding documents shall include a price variation


﻿~31
formula satisfactory to the Bank, substantially as set forth in
Annex A to this Schedule. The Borrower shall make such modifica-
tions in the said documents or procedures as the Bank shall rea-
sonably request. Any further modification to the bidding documents
shall require the Bank's concurrence before it is issued to the
prospective bidders.
(c) The firms invited to bid shall be allowed at least 60
days for the submission of their proposals. The bidding documents
shall be accompanied by a bid bond or bank guarantee amounting to
not less than 2% of the estimated contract value.
(d) After bids have been received and evaluated, the Bor-
rower shall, before a final decision on the award is made, inform
the Bank of the name of the bidder to whom it intends to award
the contract and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time
for its review, a detailed report, by the consultants referred to
in Section 3.02 of this Agreement, on the evaluation and compari-
son of the bids received, together with the recommendations for
award of the said consultants and the Borrower, and the reasons
for the intended award. The Bank shall, if it determines that the
intended award would be inconsistent with the procedures set forth
or referred to in this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower and
state the reasons for such determination.
(e) The successful bidder shall, at the Borrower's option,
furnish either a performance bond or a bank guarantee in an
amount of not less than 5% of the contract price, which bond or
guarantee shall remain in effect until the final acceptance of the


﻿- 35 -
works provided for in the contract. In addition, the contract shall
provide for retention of not less than 5% of the cost of works on
each monthly invoice. One-half of the retention monies shall be
released when all the work has been provisionally accepted, and
the other half upon final acceptance of the works.
(f) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not,
without the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from those on
which bids were asked.
(g) Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to the delivery
to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds from
the Loan Account in respect of any such contract.

ANNEX A TO SCHEDULE 4
Price Variation Formula for
Civil Works Contracts
Price Adjustment
All monthly payments made to each contractor in Sucres and
foreign currency in respect of work carried out within the original
term set for the execution of the contract entered into by the
Borrower and such contractor (the Contract) will be subject to
adjustment to offset variations in the cost of materials, equip-
ment and labor.
Such adjustment will be calculated or the basic- of the fol-
lowing formula in respect of the Sucres component:
Pre = Ps (A Si + B Ti + C Ui + D Vi + E)
So     To     Uo     Vo
Where:
Pre -     Adjusted amount of the Sucres component of each monthly
statement of work and of other services performed by such
contractor.
Ps =      Amount of the Sucres component of each monthly statement
of work executed, calculated at the unit prices of the
Contract.
(1) Si/So = the adjustment ratio for labor;
(2) Ti/To = the adjustment ratio for equipment;


﻿- 37 -
(3) Ui /Uo = the adjustment ratio for fuel; and
(4) Vi/Vo = the adjustment ratio for local construction
materials.
The formula to be used for the foreign currency component
will be as follows:
Prd = Pd (F Si + G Ti + H Ri + J Wi + K Pi + L Xi + M)
So     To     Ro     Wo     Po     Xo
Where:
Prd = Adjusted amount of the foreign-currency component of each
monthly statement work executed by such contractor.
Pd = Amount of the foreign-exchange component of each monthly
statement of work executed by such contractor, calculated
at the unit prices of the Contract.
(1) Si/So = the adjustment ratio for labor;
(2) Ti/To   = the adjustment ratio for equipment;
(3) Ri/Ro   =  the adjustment ratio for steel;
(4) Wi/Wo   = the adjustment ratio for cement;
(5) Pi/Po   = the adjustment ratio for other construction
materials; and
(6) Xi/Xo   = the adjustment ratio for electrical equipment.
The indicated adjustment formulae will be applied individually,
as necessary to similar work categories. The categories and work
items as defined in the bidding documents for Licitaci6n Inter-
nacional 01-75 dated November 1975 are as follows:


﻿- 38 -
Category I     -   items Nos. 1-6, 163-164. These are not subject
