"Major components of the proposed project\n            are: (a) construction of an earth dam and its appurtenant\n            works on the Saigon River in the southwestern part of Viet\n            Nam; and (b) construction of a gravity irrigation system for\n            about 42,000 ha of currently rainfed land, including an\n            adequate drainage network, inspection and access roads and\n            two low-lift pumping stations to serve about 4,000 ha within\n            the 42,000 ha service area. The project also makes provision\n            for the engagement of experts for the dam review panel;\n            training of construction engineers and heavy equipment\n            operators and maintenance personnel; procurement of\n            vehicles, equipment, and construction materials and\n            supplies; and the preparation of a comprehensive program for\n            agricultural supporting services."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
