manufacture and distribution of 180,000 hand tubewells; (b)\n            the purchase of tool kits for installation and maintenance\n            of hand tubewells; (c) medium-term credit to enable farmers\n            to purchase hand tubewells and tool kits; (d) research and\n            testing of appropriate hand tubewell equipment to develop\n            design improvements to increase efficiency; and (e)\n            procedural training of IDRP and TCCA staff and simple\n            technical training for village mechanics and farmers. Some\n            135,000 farm families would benefit from hand tubewell\n            irrigation and improved domestic water supply, while another\n            45,000 farm families would use the hand tubewell principally\n            for meeting domestic needs. The project faces no major risks."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
