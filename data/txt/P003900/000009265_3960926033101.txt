PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (LOAN 2757-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The project objectives were primarily to enhance the overall
efficiency of PERUMTEL through (a) improving its systems and procedures for
planning, procurement, project implementation and supervision; (b)
restructuring of its Development Directorate; and (c) oIn-the-job training of
PERUMTEL staff. In addition the project was also to strengthen PERUMTEL's
tariff review capability, improve financial management, and provide training
for PERUMTEL staff in new technology, management and finance. The project
would also help GOI develop local telecommunication consulting industry in
Indonesia.
Implementation ExDerience
Project implementation was satisfactory. The Program Management
consultants entrusted with the principal component of the project, i.e., to
improve the overall efficiency of PERUMTEL in project implementation, carried
out their task quite effectively in accordance with the agreed plan. The
computerization of the financial management and accounting system, though
somewhat delayed, was also implemented satisfactorily. PERUMTEL also arranged
and completed the training programs for tariff review, financial management
and new technology for specialized staff satisfactorily.
Results
The project achieved its physical and institutional oblectives. The
main result of the project was the improvement in the overall effi.Jency of
PERUMTEL's Directorate of Development, increasing its capability in project
implementation to add about 150,000 to 200,000 telephone lines per annum from
the 50,000 lines capability. It helped in establishing a computerized
implementation monitoring system for efficient project management. The
project also introduced a computerized financial management information system
and was responsible for the creation of the Tariff Review Group supported by
specially trained staff. The overseas training provided by 40 fellowships in
Technology, Business Management and Finance strengthened PERUMTEL's overall
capability in its business. It established an appropriate framework to
rapidly put in place a modern and affordable telecommunications network to
match the pace of emerging economic development. The fruits of this effort
are already being realized in the implementation of the ongoing Third
Telecommunications Project and will continue to be realized in future



- iii -
projecLs. The long-term relationship established between GOI, PERUMTEL and
the Bank will enable concerted efforts to be focused on implementing the
agreed strategy. In this regard GOI approved on May 1, 1991, to change
PERUMTEL's status from a PERUM to a PT, giving it increased autonomy to manage
itself and to hold it accountable for the results. PERUMTEL in turn has
decided to restructure its organization and implement a phased
decentralization program.
Although this Technical Assistance Project pursued limited
objectives which were all achieved, its real contribution must be evaluated in
a broader context. Telecommunications forms a major part of Indonesia's
infrastructure program. Annual investments for telecommunications are
estimated at about US$600 million for the ten year period 1991-2000. Being an
archipelago, Indonesia will need an extensive and reliable telecommunications
network. Furthermore with the private sector being now recognized by the GOI
as the engine for development, a well functioring and expanded
telecommunication system would be an essential element of Government's program
to develop the private sector and explore market potential for its exports.
Lessons Learne
The overall success of this project has resulted mainly because:
(a) the need for technical assistance was clearly developed as the overriding
objective for resolution of the larger problem of the sector; (b) Bank's
commitment in forms of staff continuity, skill miax and adequate CAM sources
were available to facilitate in-depth supervision; and (c) an intensive and
continuous dialogue was maintained between the Bank, PERMUTEL and consultants
to overcome implementation issues and introduce needed improvements. The main
lessons learned were:
(a) advanced project preparation for planning and program design was
essential for the smooth implementation of the project;
(b) when adequately planned and monitored, TA contracts may make
contributions to developing the local consulting companies; and
(c) availability of sector survey (carried out subsequently) by the Bank
has helped both the Borrower and Bank staff to see the project in a
broader context which enhanced interactions between project issues
and sector-wise policy and strategy.

2. Background
2.1       Public telecommunication services in Indonesia are provided by two
state-owned public enterprises under the Ministry of Tourism, Posts and
Telecommunications. Perushaan Umum Telecommunikasi (PERUMTEL) provides
domestic services and the Indonesian Satellite Corporation (PT INDOSAT)
provides international services. Recently, private operators have been
allowed to enter the sector under revenue sharing arrangements with PERUMTEL
to provide mobile radio telephone, paging services and very small aperture
terminal (VSAT) services via the PALAPA satellite.
2.2       In 1971, the Bank extended its first assistance to Indonesia's
telecommunications sector (Credit 210-IND--$12.8 million) for: (a) a trans-
Sumatra microwave link to Java; (b) a tropcspheric scatter system linking Java
and Kalimantan; (c) local distribution cables for Jakarta (5,000 new
subscribers); (d) a new 100-line telex exchange in Medan in North Sumatra; and
(e) consultants and expert services for PERUMTEL. The project was completed
successfully in 1976.
2.3       In 1973, a second telecommunications project was appraised.
However, its processing was discontinued when the Bank-and GOI failed to reach
agreement on tariff and investment program issues. Telecommunications in
Indonesia were subsequently developed using bilateral assistance.
2.4       Recognizing the high cost of inadequate telecommunications and hence
the need to rapidly develop an adequate and modern cost effective
telecommunications system, GOI requested resumption of Bank assistance to the
telecommunications sector in early 1984.



- 2 -
2.5       Bank missions in May and November 1984 reviewed the sector and
identified significant problems in PERUMTEL's organizational. structure and
management system and several areas for possible Bank assistance.  Since
project implementatior. delays and quality lapses have enormous costs, both GOI
and the Bank agreed that the Bank's initial support ought to concentrate on
urgently needed technical assistance to develop PERUMTEL's capability to
undertake rapid expansion of its telecommunications services. As a result,
tce proposed technical assistance project was appraised in April 1985.
Negotiations were held in Jakarta between June 3 - Jtne 5, 1986.
3.   Prolect Obiectives and Description
Proiect Objectives
3.1       The project's major aim was to enhance the overall efficiency of
PERUMTEL's Directorate of Development through (a) improvements to systems and
procedures for planning, procurement, project implementation and supervision;
(b) rest.ucturing of its organization; and (c) on-the-job training of PERUMTEL
staff. This was to facilitate timely implementation of the different
components of the total program and accelerate the laying of cables and
connection of new subscriber lines from 50,000 lines per annum to 100,000
lines per annum by 1989. The project was also to strengthen PERUMTEL's tariff
review capability, improve its financial management, and provide training for
PERUMTEL staff in new technology, management and finance as well as upgrade
PERUMTEL's training facilities. In addition, the project was to provide a
basis for the development of the local telecommunications consulting industry
in Indonesia through collaboration with an international firm.
Project Description
3.2       The main project component was the provision of Rrogram management
consultants to help PERUMTEL (a) develop planning and supervision systems for
implementation of the outside plant network of Batch I of the 1984-89 program;
(b) design and prepare bid documents on a turnkey basis for the outside plant
network for Batches II and III/; (c) introduce computerized techniques to
improve planning, engineering, management and utilization of the local
network; and (d) develop PERUMTEL's capacity to carry out its development
tasks in the future by strengthening existing organization and management of
the Development Directorate and developing PERUMTEL's counterpart staff and
local consultants through on-the-job as well as formal classroom training.
3.3       In addition the project comprised the following components:
(a) computerization of the Financial Management Information System
(MIS);
1/   PERTUMTEL's investment program comprised three relatively self-contained
batches, I, II and III, of 320,000, 240,000 and 300,000 news telephone
lines connected, respectively.



-3-
(b) development of PERUMTEL's Tariff Review Capability; and
(c)  training for PERUMTEL staff on advanced network technology, by
providing fellowships, overseas staff training and provision of
classroom and laboratory equipment for upgrading the central and
regional training facilities.
4. Proiect Design and Organization
4.1       The primary thrust of the project was to accelerate the network
growth rate in response to unmet and rising demands and to take advantage of
state-of-the-art management and technologies to reduce unit network expansion
costs. !n addition, to improve PERUMTEL's future financial management, the
project also provided for improving PERUMTEL's MIS and strengthening its
capability to review and formulate appropriate tariff levels and structure.
To avoid building over capacit- as well as to avoid future problems of
r 'undancy of staff in PERUMTEL, the project was designed to foster private
entertrise participation in areas where it can do so effectively (para. 6.1).
The project design and organization was very appropriate and timely.
5. Proiect Imalementation
Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up
5.1       The loan became effective on May 5, 1987, following the signing of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOI and PERUMTEL, and PERUMTEL's employment
of consultants for the major component (Part A of project) had been met.
5.2       Project preparation had advanced to the stage that the contract for
the major item, program management consultants, was signed in January 1987,
soon after the approval of the Loan, thereby keeping the commitment fee to a
minimum.
Implementation Schedule
5.3       The program consultants began working on April 1, 1987.  The
contract for consultants for computerization of financial accounts and MIS was
signed on February 11, 1988. During 1987 PERUMTEL also initiated action on
the formation and training of the Tariff Review Team and identifying the
trainees and overseas training institutions for fellowships under the project.
A summary of the status of the implementation of the main project components
follows:
(a)  Program Management Consultancv (PMC).  The Management Consultants
completed their tasks.in November 1989. They assisted PERUMTEL in:
(i) completing the outside plant design for seven major cities; (ii)
introducing a computerized integrated project implementation
reporting system; and (iii) assisting in the preparation of the
Third Telecommunications Project, including prequalification of
bidders for Outside Plant Works (OSP), as well as the bid documents
for the OSP construction and the timely implementation of the
project.



- 4 -
(b)  Co!nuterization of Financial MIS.  PERUMTEL's new management team,
appointed in 1988, gave high priority to improving the timeliness of
accounting data and preparation of financial reports. In early
1989, a core team within PERUMTEL introduced a new chart of accounts
in PERUMTEL's head office and all regional offices. Accounting
systems were further improved with -he assistance of these local
consultants. General ledgers in th- ad office and regional
offices have been computerized.  I   ._ition, the contracts of the
local consultants under the Project were modified to include
assistance in developing PC-based accounting and financial MIS to
be implemented at the subregional level as a pilot project. All
these have been successfully completed. These initiatives have
helped reduce the time and effort required to prepare financial
reports and have made it possible for PERUMTEL to get an unqualified
audit report for the first time for the financial year 1989.
(c) Tariff Review and Training. Over the project period, PERUMTEL has
significantly strengthened its capacity to analyze and assess its
tariffs by creating a tariff team and arranging extensive training
for the team members by British Columbia Telephone international
(BCTI) consultants from Canada. As a result, in the fall of 1988,
the tariff team was able to undertake a comprehensive review of
PERUMTEL's telephone and telex tariffs and prepare proposals for
their revision.
(d) .verseAs Fellowships for Trainin    40 overseas fellowship in
project planning and accounting, service quality and traffic
engineering, demand forecasting, and business management and finance
were arranged for PERUMTEL staff. The training was provided by
Alberta Telecommunication International (ATI) Canada.
5.4       Except for item (b) above, all other project components were
completed as expected by June 30, 1990. The delay of about six months beyond
this period in completion of item (b) was due to: (i) delayed appointment of
consultants; (ii) the need to incorporate the result of the work on the new
chart of accounts into the task; and (iii) modification of the consultants
contract to inclh'   PC-based MIS at the telephone office level (para. 5.3
(b)).
Project Costs
5.5       The estimated cost of the project at appraisal was $17.9 million
with a foreign exchange component of about US$10.1 million. The actual cost
of the project is now estimated to be about $20.5 million, an increase of
about 14.5%. There has been a 36% increase in the foreign cost but the local
cost decreased by about 12%. The increase in foreign cost is mainly due to
the fact that the currency of payment for the PMC contract, the main component
of the project, was in Japanese Yen; the Yen to the US dollar exchange rate
appreciated significantly during the project period. The decrease in the
local costs in equivalent US dollars is also due mainly to the substantial
devaluation of the Indonesian Rupiah during the project period.



-5-
Disbursemeg
5.6       The disbursement performance on Loan 2757-IND is given in Table 3A,
Part III. The disbursements were a little slow in starting but accelerated
later. The loan was closed on December 31, 1990, as originally scheduled and
an amount of $95,010.31 which then remained undisbursed was canceled.
5.7       The original and revised allocation by categories for Loan 2757-IND
are shown in Table 3B, Part III. Slightly increased requirements for category
II for consultant's services caused by the extended terms of reference for the
consultant services were met from savings from other and unallocated
categories.
6. Project Results
6.1       The project achieved all its objectives.  With the strategies
developed for project implementation and procurement, PERLTMTEL's capability
has been enhanced to carry out an investment program of about US$600 million
per year and connect over 300,000 new customers annually, thus tripling its
implementation capability during the last five-year development plan (Repelita
IV). Besides the integrated network packaging approach and competitive
procurement systems introduced would not only result in significantly lowering
unit network expansion costs but also ensure that new customers would be
promptly connected when the facilities become available. This will avoid the
past problems of nonperforming assets and associated financial losses. By
encouraging the association of the local consulting companies with the
International Program Management consultants, it was possible to develop a
reasonable base for the Indonesian telecommunication consulting firms to
support the sector. Use of prequalification to select competent contractors
and introduction of large scale single-responsibility contracting has promoted
association of domestic contractors with foreign companies that can provide
project construction expertise and train local workers. Improvement in
financial MIS is enabling PERUMTEL management to use financial data in the
efficient management of its operations and, more importantly to complete its
audit reports in a timely manner. It is expected that commencing FY91
PERUMTEL would be able to submit to the Bank its audited report within nine
months of closing accounts covenanted under the Third Telecommunication
Project. With regard to the tariffs review, PERUMTEL now has a good basic
capability to assess and develop tariffs.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1       A twin-pronged approach has been taken to promote project
sustainability. First, PERUMTEL's capability in project implementation, the
primary object of this project has been enhanced (para. 6.1) and is expected
to be sustained as PERUMTEL implements a performance-based incentive scheme to
motivate results-achieving staff. The key staff who have been trained in
various disciplines are expected to act as mentors to train other staff.
Second, Indonesian capability in telecommunications consultancy and
construction is expected to be further developed on the foundations provided
by the Project (para. 6.1).

8. Bank Performance
8.1       The Bank's performance has been good.  Bank involvement was timely
in response to Indonesia's request for assistance at a critical time after a
lapse of nearly ten years. A quick identification of needs, followed up by
the processing cf this project for Technical Assistance, was appropriate and
effective (pr.ra. 6.1). The Bank provided extensive support to the Government
and PERUMTEL through this project not only in implementation of the project as
such but in quickly organizing a sector mission and producing a comprehensive
sector report to provide the Government with the issues and options for sector
policy, organization, regulation and development. The sector study has
contributed significantly to: (a) the Bank's strategy in the sector; (b) the
Bank's dialogue with GOI with respect to measures to develop the
telecommunications sector; and (c) preparation of a pipeline of projects for
both the Bank and other sources of finance, in particular the IGGI members.
The first in the series of projects, a loan (3182-IND) of US$350M cofinanced
with Germany, Japan and UNDP, was approved by the Board in March 1990. A
second and third project of similar size are scheduled for FY92 and FY94 to
contribute to the financing of Indonesia's massive telecommunications
investment programs. Building on the foundations laid in the earlier phases,
these operations should transform PERUMTEL into a modern and mature utility.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.1       The Borrower's performance has been generally good and it improved
further with the appointment of competent management leadership at PERUMTEL in
1988. The GOI and PERUMTEL have demonstrated their commitment and support
throughout the project. The initial delay in getting an appropriate
counterpart team in place to work with the Program Management consultants was
quickly overcome. Throughout project execution, the Bank received strong
support for the various initiatives and processes required not only in the
implementation of the project but in other issues relating to the sector as a
whole. Although PERUMTEL was unable earlier to provide in time the audit
reports as required in the Project Agreement (Table 7, Status of Covenants)
the performance has improved significantly since then (para. 6.1). It is
expected that with the experience gained during this project and systems and
procedures implemented under the project the ongoing Third Telecommunications
Project (Loan 3182-IND) will be implemented successfully. This is evidenced
by the fact that 70% of the loan under this project was committed within one
year of loan signature and disbursements are ahead of schedule and
implementation is progressing well.
10. Project Relationship
10.1      The Bank maintained an excellent and harmonious working relationship
with PERUMTEL management and staff and also with government agencies, in
particular BAPPENAS, throughout the project implementation. PERUMTEL's
management was fully responsive to the Bank's requests for information and
data relating to the project and its operations. The Resident Mission in
Indonesia facilitated this to a large extent. Bank missions also had good
relationships throughout with the consultants and the agencies (ATI and BCTI
Canada) and institutions which provided the support in training PERUMTEL's
staff.

11, Consulting Services
11.1      In this technical assistance project, consultants played the major
role. The Program Management consultants' international group associated with
a local partner together performed well. The local Financial Management
consultant also performed well. The training support given by the overseas
training institutions in tariff review and various sections of
telecommunication business covering technology and business management were
good.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1      The President's Report and legal agreements were adequate for the
project. The Program Management consultants provided monthly and semi-annual
reports of good quality which were very useful to monitor program
implementation. The database developed in PERUMTEL will be quite useful in
managing future operations in this Sector.

PART II: Project Review frorm Borrower's Perspective:
(Text supplied by PERUMTEL)
A.   Adeguacv and Accuracy of the Factual Information Contained in Part
III of the PCR:
The Borrower is not in a position to confirm the contents of Part
III of the PCR, since the item in question has not yet been received
by the Borrower at the time of the Part II preparation.
B.   Comment on the Analysis Contained in Part I of the PCR:
Ditto, Consult paragraph A above.
C.   Evaluation of the Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned:
The Bank's personnel were respected for their professionalism and
deep attention to any issues relating to the project.
Major Lessons Learned from the Proiect:
(i) The smooth coordination and cooperation between the Bank and
the Borrower have also strengthened the good relationship
between the Borrower and governmental organizations such as
the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Tourism, Posts and
Telecommunications, National Planning Board, Bank oC
Indonesia, and others.
(ii) The difference in the format of the audit report required by
the Bank and the National State Auditor has caused a delay in
submitting the said report to the Bank. Therefore, proper
adjustment would be quite meaningful to speed up the process.
D.   Evaluation of the Borrower's Performance and Lessons Learned:
(i) The performance of the participating parties in the overall
project implementation was extremely significant for the
success of the project.
(ii) The Consultant Team assigned to the project performed well,
and the overseas trainings were carried out timely according
to the schedule.
(iii) The project of MIS for Accounting has been progressing well,
however, some additional facilities for hardware and software
are required for the smooth operation at the completion of
the project in the near future.
Major Lesson Learned
Past experience taught a lesson that early preparation, primarily in
designing the programs, was quite essential in order to accomplish
the project within a shorter time.

E.   Effective and Relationship between the Bank and the Borrower:
The visits of the Bank's periodic missions, and continuous.
consultation between the Bank's consultant team and the Borrower,
created an effective relationship which was able to overcome
problems that arose during the implementation of the project.
