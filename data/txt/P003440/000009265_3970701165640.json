support of the Government's\n            program to triple production of freshwater fish by the year\n            2000, the proposed project would expand and develop\n            intensive pond culture in the vicinity of eight major urban\n            centers. It would introduce into each project area an\n            integated fisheries production, extension and marketing\n            system operating on a fully commercial basis. The credit\n            would provide equipment, vehicles, and support facilities,\n            including 14 feed mills, 4 cold storage plants, 4\n            overwintering facilities, a hatchery, a vaccine factory and,\n            7 trade centers. Also the project would strengthen fisheries\n            research and extension services through the provision of\n            technical assistance and training and the construction\n            and/or equipping of eight technical service centers. The\n            technical assistance and training component would also be\n            used to upgrade the qualifications of project staff to\n            implement the proposed project and further fisheries\n            development activities."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
