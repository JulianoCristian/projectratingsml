the level of\n            rural incomes and promote exports by improving and\n            diversifying production of the principal crops in the Borgou\n            Province, primarily cotton and maize. Specifically, the\n            project provides for expanding agricultural production\n            through the strengthening and support of institutions and of\n            technical infrastructure, integrated with improved\n            extension, cooperatives, training, and social services. At\n            full development, the project is expected to reach about\n            39,000 farm families (about 50% of the total in Borgou), and\n            to generate an incremental production of some 10,400 tons of\n            seed cotton, 5,000 tons of maize, 6,000 tons of sorghum,\n            1,200 tons of groundnuts, and 1,000 tons of cowpeas. The\n            project's major quantifiable benefit will be increased\n            production of cotton and foodcrops which, by the end of the\n            implementation period, is expected to yield additional real\n            income to participating farmers."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
