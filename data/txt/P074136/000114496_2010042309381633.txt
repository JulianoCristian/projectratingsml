Prof. Dr. Lubomir Geric, the General Manager of the Elektroprivreda of Serbia dated December 27,

We hereby propose an amendment to the Administration Agreement as follows:

First sentence of paragraph 4 of the Administration Agreement is amended to read: 
 
“It is expected that the Contribution funds will be fully utilized in accordance with the provisions 
of this Administration Agreement by April 30, 2005.” 
 
2. 
All other provisions of the Administration Agreement shall remain unchanged. 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing, dating
