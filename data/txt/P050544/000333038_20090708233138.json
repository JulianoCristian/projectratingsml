Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) the FMIP experience confirms that\n            project design needs to be kept simple and within the\n            capacity of the staff and agencies who are responsible for\n            its implementation; 2) in countries where political\n            influence is difficult to avoid, the project team was able\n            to successfully adopt a decentralized implementation\n            mechanism which shielded the municipalities and the\n            implementing agency from various political interferences in\n            the country; 3) the project lacked clearly defined\n            monitoring indicators. For monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) to succeed it should focus on achieving results,\n            particularly for the poor and should not be unduly\n            burdensome to the municipalities. Strong M&E can also\n            help reduce the expense of cost-benefit analysis by\n            providing data needed to carry out economic analyses; and 4)\n            the project did not have any cost recovery mechanism built\n            in its design, possibly because it was evident that full\n            cost recovery will almost be impossible for several\n            municipal infrastructure investments. It will be prudent\n            however, if consideration could be given during future\n            project design to define realistic cost recovery system."}, "docdt": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
