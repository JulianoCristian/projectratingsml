The project will, in\n            the short term, restore selected basic municipal\n            infrastructure to improve living conditions, and, in the\n            medium term, set the stage for the development of the\n            municipal sector by enabling municipalities to begin\n            addressing local infrastructure maintenance and\n            rehabilitation needs. The project consists of three\n            components: a) Upgrading and rehabilitating basic municipal\n            infrastructure will carry out a program for the\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of essential infrastructure in\n            all the municipalities of the Borrower, which includes\n            constructing, upgrading, rehabilitating, and maintaining\n            essential roads and sidewalks, retaining walls, pedestrian\n            crossings, street lights, safety barriers, etc. b) Capacity\n            building will develop, implement, and maintain a program for\n            infrastructure rehabilitation, including feasibility\n            studies, tender document preparation, subproject technical\n            design, and maintenance programming. It will also support\n            the strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry of\n            Municipal and Rural Affairs. c) Project coordination unit\n            will support provision of equipment and consultant services."}, "docdt": "2000-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
