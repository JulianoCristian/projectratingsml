Government's\n            efforts to accelerate the growth of the sector and improve\n            the living conditions of Peru's farmers. The project\n            would provide both working capital and medium- and long-term\n            investment credits to individual farmers and cooperatives\n            for all types of crop and livestock operations. It would\n            also include agroindustrial projects. The project would\n            include technical assistance and training to improve the\n            efficiency of BAP's operations. Finally, studies would\n            be undertaken to: (i) design a rediscount facility in BAP to\n            help stimulate commercial bank lending for agriculture; and\n            (ii) complete preparation of a sugar rehabilitation project."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
