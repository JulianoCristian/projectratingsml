Lessons address the\n            following. Particularly highlighted are horizontal\n            communications, that leads to better troubleshooting,\n            namely, it improves problem solving, and increases\n            effectiveness and efficiency in decision-making. The highly\n            technical aspect of forest master plans involved\n            participation of interested groups; yet, to date only six\n            community forestry pilots have been implemented. The lesson\n            to be learned is that in designing TORs for these plans, it\n            would be appropriate to incorporate participatory planning\n            processes. Currently, the new Forestry Law is under\n            discussion in the Congress: as a result of this project the\n            proposed law has pursued a new direction in participatory\n            community forestry. Although improvements in technology,\n            through the provision of technical information in the\n            cultivation of uplands was important, there were, however,\n            clear needs for initial investment capital in the form of\n            some materials such as hoses for small-scale irrigation, and\n            other tools. The living standard of the rural poor, for whom\n            the project was targeted is still very low: equal\n            participation, ownership of the project, as well as equity\n            issues should be included in extension activities.\n            Furthermore, community development skills in managing\n            groups, and mobilizing community members were required in\n            extension services, and the protection of biodiversity. It\n            is essential to respect, and respond with flexibility to\n            communities' demands for development without deviating\n            from the project's objective. These lessons were well\n            considered in the formulation of Forestry and Rural\n            Productivity Project."}, "docdt": "2004-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
