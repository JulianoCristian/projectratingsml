Forest protection programs and\n            formalized public participation will relieve pressure on\n            common and open resources in environmental, rural, and\n            forest zones. Rehabilitating only existing forest roads,\n            including a drainage structure and sediment control designs,\n            and using vegetative stabilization will abate increased\n            erosion and sedimentation. Intensifying agricultural\n            production will lead to land use conversion, increased soil\n            loss and degradation, and non-point source pollution.\n            Focusing on existing crop lands and including conservation\n            systems, training and extension in moisture conservation,\n            fertility management practices - together will arrest these\n            impacts. Livestock overgrazing, increased soil loss, reduced\n            groundwater recharge, increased pasture burning, forest\n            conversion, and water quality impacts will be mitigated by\n            allowing only household-level production and use of existing\n            pastureland, practices to reduce or control burning, and\n            improvements to pasture fertility."}, "docdt": "1997-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
