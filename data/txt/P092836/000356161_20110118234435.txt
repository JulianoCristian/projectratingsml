7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Building on the achievements of the first operation, the project development objective is to enhance 
service-delivery by ANSES by improving its efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability 
through institutional reengineering, fraud and error detection, change management and greater internal and 
external oversight, as well as institutional strengthening of the Social Security Secretariat. In particular, the 
proposed project will: (i) consolidate and expand selected organizational reforms of ANSES through 
business process reengineering, integration and automation of core processes, functions, and products, and 
ICT investments for continuous dynamic change with a view to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of 
service-delivery; (ii) support the institutional strengthening of the Social Security Secretariat to enhance its 
policymaking and oversight functions, strengthen the accountability of ANSES and other social security 
institutions, and promote outreach to other stakeholders; (iii) enhance access to information and exchange 
of
information, help fraud and error detection in benefit determination and liquidation, and promote 
effective channels for citizen engagement and oversight, with a view to improve internal and external 
transparency and citizen participation; and (iv) promote change management, innovation, and 
dissemination of good management practices to enhance project performance and sustainability.
