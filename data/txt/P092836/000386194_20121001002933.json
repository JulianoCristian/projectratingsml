Progress towards achievement of\n            PDOs is satisfactory. The project has already achieved two\n            (PDO) (out of four) and the other two PDOs will be achieved\n            by the closing date. Intermediate indicators are being\n            achieved as planned. Adjustments are being made at the\n            request of the Ministry of Finance to formalize the actual\n            use of the funds in support of the achievement of the PDOs.\n            As a result of the new responsibilities assumed by ANSES in\n            2008, and conforming to ANSES strategic plan 2009-2011,\n            there was a need to allocate more funds to the\n            implementation includes support to new activities (social\n            security observatory; e-learning platform; transparency of\n            procurement processes; good practices for technological\n            management) which resulted in more Bank funds allocated to\n            consulting services. Bank funding for goods, training and\n            non-consultant services has been reduced with no impact in\n            the planned activities, thanks to the savings generated in\n            the procurement of goods and that ANSES was able to provide\n            funding for some non consulting services and training."}, "docdt": "2012-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
