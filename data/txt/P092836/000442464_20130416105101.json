Some lessons learned included:\n            slower than expected disbursements should not automatically\n            be equated with a lack of commitment to project objectives.\n            The regular, physical presence of bank team members can play\n            an important role in facilitating implementation in\n            challenging conditions. Implementation of the Second\n            National Social Security Administration (ANSES II) project\n            advanced successfully, in spite of several challenges, aided\n            by ANSES\u0092s strong ownership of the project.
