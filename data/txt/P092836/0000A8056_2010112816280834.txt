                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Building on the achievements of the first operation, the project development objective is to enhance service-delivery by ANSES by improving its efficiency,
                         effectiveness, transparency and accountability through institutional reengineering, fraud and error detection, change management and greater internal and
                         external oversight, as well as institutional strengthening of the Social Security Secretariat.
                          In particular, the proposed project will: (i) consolidate and expand selected organizational reforms of ANSES through business process reengineering,
                         integration and automation of core processes, functions, and products, and ICT investments for continuous dynamic change with a view to improve the
                         efficiency and effectiveness of service-delivery; (ii) support the institutional strengthening of the Social Security Secretariat to enhance its policymaking and
                         oversight functions, strengthen the accountability of ANSES and other social security institutions, and promote outreach to other stakeholders; (iii) enhance
                         access to information and exchange of information, help fraud and error detection in benefit determination and liquidation, and promote           effective channels
                         for citizen engagement and oversight, with a view to improve internal and external transparency and citizen participation; and (iv) promote change management,
                         innovation, and dissemination of good management practices to enhance project performance and sustainability.
