Delays in project\n            implementation are due to two main factors. On the one hand,\n            effectiveness authorization was granted sixteen months after\n            loan approval due to an eleven month delay in the internal\n            approval process of the loan by the Argentina Government,\n            and additional time required reaching an agreement on the\n            establishment date and specific composition of the project\n            steering committee. On the other hand, large scale internal\n            reorganization in ANSES during 2008 absorbed critical\n            resources and attention of the agency that could otherwise\n            have been dedicated to project implementation. The closing\n            date of the project will be extended by 18 months from March\n            31, 2011 until September 30, 2012. This will be the first\n            extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
