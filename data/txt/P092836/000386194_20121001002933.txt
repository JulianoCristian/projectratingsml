       Progress towards achievement of PDOs is satisfactory. The Project has already
    achieved two PDO (out of four) and the other two PDOs will be achieved by the closing
    date. Intermediate indicators are being achieved as planned. Progress towards the
    achievement of the PDO includes: (i) reduction of average time in provision of new
    benefits; (ii) reduction of error rates in the determination of new benefits; (iii)
    satisfaction rates with service delivery is close to be achieved (76% in 2011 versus end
    target of 80%), and (iv) Surveys to Employees and other stakeholders that reflect
    support of project activities and openness to change (78.5% supportive responses in
    2011 versus end target of 80%). Additional Intermediate Objectives have also been

achieved, such as the establishment of a Claim Management System and
Communication Strategy. Overall, the operation is contributing to improve the social
service delivery provided by ANSES and citizen satisfaction through Institutional
Strengthening.

3. Adjustments are being made at the request of the Ministry of Finance to formalize the
actual use of the funds in support of the achievement of the Project Development
Objectives. As a result of the new responsibilities assumed by ANSES in 2008, and
conforming to ANSES Strategic Plan 2009-2011, there was a need to allocate more
funds to the implementation of SAP and include support to new activities (Social
Security Observatory; E-learning platform; Transparency of procurement processes;
Good practices for technological management; Institutional Strengthening of the Fondo
de Garantía de Sustentabilidad de ANSES) which resulted in more Bank funds allocated
to consulting services. Bank funding for goods, training and non-consultant services has
been reduced with no impact in the planned activities, thanks to the savings generated in
the procurement of goods and that ANSES was able to provide funding for some non-
consulting services and training. Total project costs do not change.
