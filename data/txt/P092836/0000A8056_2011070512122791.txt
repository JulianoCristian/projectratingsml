                         Building on the achievements of the first operation, the project development objective is to enhance service-delivery by ANSES by improving its efficiency,
                         effectiveness, transparency and accountability through institutional reengineering, fraud and error detection, change management and greater internal and
                         external oversight, as well as institutional strengthening of the Social Security Secretariat. In particular, the proposed project will: (i) consolidate and expand
                         selected organizational reforms of ANSES through business process reengineering, integration and automation of core processes, functions, and products, and
                         ICT investments for continuous dynamic change with a view to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service-delivery; (ii) support the institutional
                         strengthening of the Social Security Secretariat to enhance its policymaking and oversight functions, strengthen the accountability of ANSES and other social
                         security institutions, and promote outreach to other stakeholders; (iii) enhance access to information and exchange of information, help fraud and error
                         detection in benefit determination and liquidation, and promote effective channels for citizen engagement and oversight, with a view to improve internal and
                         external transparency and citizen participation; and (iv) promote change management, innovation, and dissemination of good management practices to enhance
                         project performance and sustainability.
