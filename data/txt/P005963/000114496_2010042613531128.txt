Dear Dr. Cavallo:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement between the Argentine Republic (the Borrower) 
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated 
November 29, 1988 as amended on September 16, 1992.  We are pleased to inform you 
that, pursuant to a letter forwarded to the Bank by the Subsecretaria de Vivienda y 
Ordenamiento Ambiental of the Ministerio de Salud y Accion Social on October 22, 1993, 
the Bank has agreed to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
A.
Schedule 4
Paragraph 1.(c) is hereby amended by substituting the figure of $20,000,000 in 
place of $10,000,000.
Schedule 6
Paragraph 2. of Part C. of Section I of this Schedule is hereby amended by 
substituting the figure of $350,000 in place of $250,000, and shall read in its 
entirity as follows:
"2. Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of $75,000 or more but not 
exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000, up to an aggregate not exceeding the 
equivalent of $139,000,000 and goods estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$75,000 or more but not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000, up to an 
aggregate not to exceed the equivalent of $47,000,000, may be procured under 
contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in 
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank."
     Section II of this Schedule is hereby amended by adding a new paragraph 2. to the 
existing text (which becomes paragraph 1.):
"2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section, the 
provisions of the Consultants Guidelines requiring prior Bank review or 
approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, 
proposals, evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to contracts with 
firms 
estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent each, or to contracts 
with 
individuals estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each. However, 
this 
exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to the terms of reference  for such 
contracts nor to single source selection of firms, to assignments of 
a critical 
nature, as determined by the Bank, and to amendments of contracts 
raising the 
contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above for firms, or to 
$50,000 
equivalent or above for individuals."
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating
