Argentina. The First Municipal Development Project (MDP-I)\n            was primarily designed to contribute to more effective\n            public sector management at the provincial and municipal\n            levels through improved financial mechanisms for municipal\n            investments. In this way, the project effectively supported\n            two critical national objectives: a) the mobilization of\n            resources in a non-deficit, non-inflationary manner; and (b)\n            increased public sector efficiency. These objectives were\n            quite ambitious given the macroeconomic conditions\n            prevailing during 1987-88. Argentina's economy was\n            crippled by high inflation, widespread stagnation and\n            massive public sector deficits after decades of economic\n            strategies characterized by heavy state interventionism,\n            inward-looking trade orientation, and disregard for\n            macroeconomic equilibrium. Capitalizing on the growing\n            awareness of the need to introduce drastic reforms at all\n            levels of government, the project laid the foundations for\n            municipal reform by enhancing municipal practices and\n            putting in place sustainable mechanisms for the financing of\n            needed municipal investments. With its emphasis on fiscal\n            responsibility and improved efficiency of municipalities,\n            the project fully supported the objectives of the reform\n            program that was later implemented by the Argentine Government."}, "docdt": "1997-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
