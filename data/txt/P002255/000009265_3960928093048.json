program.\n            Specifically, the project aims to : a) redefine the role of\n            Government in the PE sector and formulate principles for\n            future interventions in new enterprises; b) improve the\n            institutional and legal framework for PEs by increasing the\n            autonomy and accountability of PEs and by better defining\n            the role and responsibilities of the different bodies\n            involved in PE decision making; c) increase sector\n            efficiency through rehabilitation of PEs that can be made\n            economically viable, divestiture of those which can be\n            privatized and liquidation of nonviable PEs; and d) develop\n            national capacity to design, implement and monitor PE\n            reforms. The project is comprised of two components, which\n            are the following : 1) technical assistance and equipment to\n            a) revise public enterprise legislation; b) develop and\n            implement restructuring plans for viable enterprises; c)\n            assist in the liquidation of nonviable enterprises and in\n            the Government's design of the privatization strategy;\n            and d) strengthen the Finance Ministry; and 2) training of\n            PE managers and MINFIN staff."}, "docdt": "1990-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
