The key lessons from the\n            ODS-1 project have particular relevance for the\n            implementation of the ODS-2 and future subprojects. 1) The\n            overall timetable for project implementation was not viable.\n            A minimum of 30 months should be provided for the\n            implementation of each project. 2) The project suffered from\n            the haste in preparing the data on production, consumption\n            of ODS and baseline equipment as well as sub-project\n            preparation. There was shortage of aerosol and foam experts\n            in the field causing delays in sub-project processing. 3)\n            Close cooperation and coordination among government entities\n            proved vital in the smooth implementation of the project. 4)\n            The Bank has to review its policy regarding the application\n            of its guidelines and procedures to all projects funded by\n            the donors. The Montreal Protocol has their own guidelines\n            and procedures. This causes some uncertainty to the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2000-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
