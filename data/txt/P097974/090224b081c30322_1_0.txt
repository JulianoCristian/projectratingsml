                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to: (a) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (b) increase the reliability and
                         quality of electricity services; (c) increase the quality and reliability of water supply services, with primary focus on Bujumbura; and (d) strengthen REGIDESO financial
                         sustainability.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project’s global environmental objective is to selectively improve the energy efficiency of buildings in Bujumbura city and to strengthen the policy frameworks for
                         energy efficiency. The project will result in GHG emission reductions from the energy saved through the use of energy efficient equipments.
                         The GEF energy efficiency project will be operationally blended with electricity sector investments under the IDA financed Multisectoral Water and Electricity
                         Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP). The MSWEIP was approvedby the World Bank Board of Directors on May 13, 2008, and is currently been implemented by the energy and
                         water utility REGIDESO.

                         The project development objective of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase reliability and quality
                         of electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO’s financial sustainability. The MSWEIP is helping
                         REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viabilityand the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers and
                         economic agents. The MSWEIP has been designed to provide a balance between immediate needs and medium- to long-term planning. It addresses to the urgent need to
                         fill the current gaps between supply and demand in both electricity and water supply. At the same time, the project supports long term planning activities and studies, as
                         well as the strengthening of the operational capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Based on January 2013 implementation support mission and the quarterly report of March 31, 2013, the team rates the project implementation performance as marginally
                         satisfactory. This is due to accumulated delays in procuring and implementing major contracts and poor progress on revenue collection efficiency of REGIDESO (about 74% out of a
                         target of 93%). Now, all these delays are being addressed and all the major investment and rehabilitation works have been completed and commissioned. In fact, about 96 percent
                         (reference to SDR curve in disbursement portal) of the grant has been disbursed and about 100 percent is committed. The project is likely to achieve all its objectives with no
                         significant shortcomings. The projections indicate that the total grant amount will be fully disbursed by June 30, 2013, the expected closing date.

                         Most of the project target indicators for the water component have been achieved. On the electricity side, most of the project target indicators for electricity were also met with delay
                         with the exception of the additional electricity production by existing 5.5 MW diesel plant which scored 2.8 GWh/year out of a target of 11. This is due to delay in procuring fuel for the
                         plant and breakages of one of the four generators. Furthermore, on the capacity building component, the project has accumulated delays in implementing key recommendation of the
                         external audit of performance contract signed between the government of Burundi and REGIDESO and the revenue collection for FY 12 by REGIDESO is still below target (74% out
                         of a target of 93%).

                         Currently, 14 of 18 key target indicators have been reached. These included (i) 128,940 additional people gained access to standposts or private water connections in selected peri-
                         urban areas of Bujumbura out of a target of 121,440, (ii) strategic sector plans for water and electricity were prepared , (iii) electricity technical and non technical electricity losses per
                         year reduced from 24% in 2008 to 18.8% in 2012 out of 19% target, (iv) non-revenue water at REGIDESO reduced from 45% in 2008 to 25% in 2012 out of a target of 22% (very
                         ambitious target), (v) water production capacity (m3/day) increased from 66,000 to 96,000 cubic meters per day, (vi) full coverage of operations and maintenance costs (including
                         depreciation) of REGIDESO through revenues (101% out of a target 100%, thanks to new tariff revision) and (vii) signing of 130 delegated standposts management contracts in
                         Bujumbura between REGIDESO and private operators out of a target of 130. On institutional strengthening, on the basis of a comprehensive tariff study, the Government increased

                         water tariffs in two phases to more cost reflective levels in 2011 and 2012. The first phase of tariff increase was undertaken since September 2011 and the second phase of the
                         progressive tariff revisions took place on March 1, 2012.

                         On the electricity sector, the medium term outlook of insufficient electricity supply to meet fast growing demand is still valid. Currently, electricity demand is increasing at between
                         10-12 percent per year However, there is daily load shedding of between 20-30MW. This situation is an impediment to the Burundi economic and growth, and limits investments. The
                         project supported detailed feasibility of the two best evaluated hydropower sites (Jiji and Mulembwe). The estimated output is about 50 MW capacity (both combined) which will offer
                         a credible low-cost alternative to bridge some of the expected medium-term supply deficit before larger hydro developments such as Rusizi III and Rusumo falls can be made
                         operational. On October 26, 2012, the Bank has approved a country assistance strategy for Burundi for FY13-16 which foresees the Jiji-Mulembwe Hydropower project for about US$
                         70 million. The current cost estimate for the development of Jiji-Mule project including the transmission line to Bujumbura stands at about US$200 million (to be confirmed with the
                         ongoing sites investigation).
                         The EIB (European Investment Bank) has confirmed its interest in co-financing the Jiji and Mulembwe hydropower project and its associated transmission lines. The detailed site
                         investigation and tender documents, including for the transmission line, are being supported the Dutch cooperation through the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands.
