                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to: (a) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (b) increase the reliability and
                         quality of electricity services; (c) increase the quality and reliability of water supply services, with primary focus on Bujumbura; and (d) strengthen REGIDESO financial
                         sustainability.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project’s global environmental objective is to selectively improve the energy efficiency of buildings in Bujumbura city and to strengthen the policy frameworks for
                         energy efficiency. The project will result in GHG emission reductions from the energy saved through the use of energy efficient equipments.

                         The GEF energy efficiency project will be operationally blended with electricity sector investments under the IDA financed Multisectoral Water and Electricity
                         Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP). The MSWEIP was approvedby the World Bank Board of Directors on May 13, 2008, and is currently been implemented by the energy and

                         water utility REGIDESO.

                         The project development objective of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase reliability and quality
                         of electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO’s financial sustainability. The MSWEIP is helping
                         REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viability and the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers
                         and economic agents. The MSWEIP has been designed to provide a balance between immediate needs and medium- to long-term planning. It addresses to the urgent
                         need to fill the current gaps between supply and demand in both electricity and water supply. At the same time, the project supports long term planning activities and
                         studies, as well as the strengthening of the operational capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is a multi-sectoral water supply and electricity infrastructure operation that focuses on provision of electricity and water services to Bujumbura, the capital city of Burundi
                         and to improve the financial and operational capability of REGIDESO, the public utility in charge of production and distribution of water and electricity services in urban centers. The
                         project implementation performance has been marginally satisfactory. As of May 01, 2012, about 64 percent of the grant has been disbursed and about 98 percent is committed. The
                         projections indicate that the total grant amount will be fully disbursed by June 30, 2013, the expected closing date. Currently, out of 32 project target indicators, 20 are on good track.
                         These include: (i) Electricity technical and non technical electricity losses per year reduced from 24% in 2008 to 17% in 2011, (ii) Electricity generation per year from additional
                         sources increased by 12.9 GWH in 2011, (iii) Non-revenue water at REGIDESO reduced from 45% in 2008 to 35% in 2011, and (iv) Water production capacity (m3/day) increased
                         from 66 to 96 cubic meter per day. The remaining will be attained after the completion of the ongoing investments in water and electricity sectors implemented under two major
                         contracts absorbing alone 60 percent of the project amount. It is worth mentioning that implementation of above two contracts experienced significant delays during the early stages
                         of procurement. These delays have essentially been addressed and works are expected to be commissioned before end of calendar year 2012.
                         On institutional strengthening, on the basis of a comprehensive tariff study, the Government increased tariffs in two phases to more cost reflective levels in 2011 and 2012. The first
                         phase of tariff increase was undertaken since September 2011 and the second phase of the progressive tariff revisions took place this March 01, 2012. The new tariffs reflect
                         operating costs and adjustment mechanism to allow the utility to properly maintain its assets and honor multilateral agreements to pay for power imports from regional hydro power
                         plants.
                         The major shortcomings in the two sectors are as follows:

                         (i) The recommendations of the external auditor of the performance contract signed between the Government of Burundi (GoB) and REGIDESO suffers from poor monitoring by the
                         steering committee set-up by the GoB and the results are poorly disseminated.
                         (ii) Project cost overruns precluded support to the the following scheduled activities: (a) REGIDESO Organizational Audit, (b) Strategic Electricity Development Plan and identification
                         of a priority investment program, (c) financing to establish reliable information systems including interconnecting the four main offices of REGIDESO and main production and
                         customer centers; (d) an update of systems for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Management Information Systems (MIS) and (e) Purchase of fuel for the third year for the
                         existing thermal plant.
                         (iii) The medium term outlook of insufficient electricity supply to meet fast growing demand has been confirmed. It has led to the GoB's request (attached) to the World Bank and
                         European Investment Bank (EIB) to co-finance development of Jiji and Mule run of river hydropower sites that together would add 50MW of installed capacity. National electricity
                         demand is increasing at between 8-12 percent per year. Currently, there is daily load shedding of between 20-30MW. In the absence of adequate and reliable electricity supply,
                         local industry has to make use of small and medium sized generators installed in their premises that costs on average 0.35 US$/kWh. In the short term, the installation and
                         commissioning of additional thermal plant of 5MW financed under PMIEE expected by March 2013 and the demand side management (distribution of Compact Fluorescent Lamps)
                         implemented under the Emergency Energy Project would help to reduce the amount of load shedding but will not eliminate it. The total estimated cost of developing the two sites and

                         constructing an associated transmission line of about 80km to transport the power to Gitega has been estimated at about US$ 200 million by Fichtner in feasibility studies financed
                         under this Project. The team will consult with management on possible World Bank participation in a joint IFC/EIB/WB mission in June 2012 whose purpose would be to reach
                         preliminary agreement on how the priority projects could be developed and financed. The client suggested that such a joint mission should be scheduled around June 18 2012.
