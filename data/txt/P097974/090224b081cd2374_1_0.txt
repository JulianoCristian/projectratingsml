                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project’s global environmental objective is to selectively improve the energy efficiency of buildings in Bujumbura city and to strengthen the policy frameworks for
                         energy efficiency. The project will result in GHG emission reductions from the energy saved through the use of energy efficient equipments.
                         The GEF energy efficiency project will be operationally blended with electricity sector investments under the IDA financed Multisectoral Water and Electricity
                         Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP). The MSWEIP was approvedby the World Bank Board of Directors on May 13, 2008, and is currently been implemented by the energy and
                         water utility REGIDESO.

                         The project development objective of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase reliability and quality
                         of electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO’s financial sustainability. The MSWEIP is helping
                         REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viabilityand the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers and
                         economic agents. The MSWEIP has been designed to provide a balance between immediate needs and medium- to long-term planning. It addresses to the urgent need to
                         fill the current gaps between supply and demand in both electricity and water supply. At the same time, the project supports long term planning activities and studies, as
                         well as the strengthening of the operational capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Based on the final assessment carried out this June 10, 2013, the team rates the project implementation performance at closing date as marginally satisfactory. This is due to
                         accumulated delays in procuring and implementing major contracts. Now, all these delays are being addressed and all the major investment and rehabilitation works have been
                         completed and commissioned. In fact, about 98 percent of the grant has been disbursed and about 100 percent is committed. The project is likely to achieve all its objectives with no
                         significant shortcomings.

                         Most of the project key outcome indicators have been achieved. These include (i) the number of persons with access to stand-posts or private connections in selected peri-urban
                         areas of Bujumbura were increased from 19,250 to 136,890 out of a target of 134,000, (ii) Number of persons with access to potable water in other areas of Bujumbura were
                         increased from 166,000 to 231,112 out of a target of 229,000 , (iii) the minutes of unplanned quarterly power interruptions have been reduced from 3100 in 2008 to 703 with the
                         second quarter of 2013( out of 800 minutes end –target of medium-voltage interruptions / quarter), (iv) full coverage of operations and maintenance costs (including depreciation) of
                         REGIDESO through revenues (101%, thanks to two series tariff increase to cover cost in 2011 and 2012).

                         On the electricity component (part 1), during this first semester 2013,5.6 Gigawatt hours of power has been produced by additional sources out of a target of 5.5 and technical
                         losses were reduced from 24% to 18% (Percentage of kilowatt hours billed / Kilowatt hours produced with an end-target of 18%).

                         On the water component (part 2), the water production capacity (in cubic meters / day) was increased from 66,000 to 96,000 out a target of 96,000 and the number of functioning
                         stand-posts was increased 35 to 190 (out of an end target of 130) and non-revenue water was reduced from 46% to 28% (out of a target of 20%, which was too optimistic!)

                         On the institutional component (part 3), on the basis of a comprehensive tariff study, the Government increased water tariffs in two phases to more cost reflective levels in 2011 and

                         2012. Furthermore, the average number of unconnected persons served per stand-post in selected project areas was reduced 2,946 to 843 out of a target of 877 and collection
                         efficiency of REGIDESO (Percentage of billing revenues / amount billed) was increased from 82% to 83% out of a target 95%. It is worth to mention that on the issue of collection
                         efficiency, REGIDESO has just resolved to increase the number of prepaid meters to 100% of its customers by June 30, 2014. Already 35,532 prepaid meters have been installed out
                         of 72,000 customers, additional 15, 000 meters have been already purchased and REGIDESO has just contracted the installation work of this batch of meters for the coming three
                         months. In addition, REGIDESO has earmarked resources for this fiscal year and has launched tendering process for the supply and installation of another round of 36,000 meters by
                         June 30, 2014.

                         On the electricity sector, the project supported detailed feasibility of the two best evaluated hydropower sites (Jiji and Mulembwe). The estimated output is about 50 MW capacity
                         (both combined) which will offer a credible low-cost alternative to bridge some of the expected medium-term supply deficit before larger hydro developments such as Rusizi III and
                         Rusumo falls can be made operational. On October 26, 2012, the Bank has approved a country assistance strategy for Burundi for FY13-16 which foresees the Jiji-Mulembwe
                         Hydropower project for about US$ 70 million. The current cost estimate for the development of Jiji-Mule project including the transmission line to Bujumbura stands at about US$200
                         million (to be confirmed with the ongoing sites investigation).

                         The EIB (European Investment Bank) and the African development Bank (ADB) have confirmed its interest in co-financing the Jiji and Mulembwe hydropower project and its
                         associated transmission lines. The detailed site investigation and tender documents, including for the transmission line, are being supported the Dutch cooperation through the
                         Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands.

                         Relevance of Project Objectives: The objectives of the project remained valid throughout the project life because of the persistence of the situation which prevailed during the project
                         appraisal. In fact, the persistent strong energy deficit in Burundi in the order of 50-80%, an average energy consumption of about 23 kWh / pers. / year (which is the lowest in the
                         Africa region), the high percentage of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) of about 46% combined with the deterioration of the main Bujumbura system pumping and metering highlight the
                         relevance of the project objectives.

                         Furthermore, the IDA Emergency Recovery Project ($15 million) includes components for (ii) the supply and installation of diesel engines representing additional 5 MW of thermal
                         generating capacity to be operational by early July 2013. This will complement the effort being made by REGIDESO and GoB through the existing 10 MW (diesel generator plant)
                         power purchase a greement signed between INTERPETROL and REGIDESO/GOB and started in May 2013; the rehabilitation and expansion of REGIDESO’s medium voltage
                         transmission and distribution system; the rehabilitation of exiting hydropower plants; the installation of 15,0000 pre-payment meters, and fuel for the diesel plant for approximately one
                         year of operation.
