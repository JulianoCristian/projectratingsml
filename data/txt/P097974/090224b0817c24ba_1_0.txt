                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project’s global environmental objective is to selectively improve the energy efficiency of buildings in Bujumbura city and to strengthen the policy frameworks for
                         energy efficiency. The project will result in GHG emission reductions from the energy saved through the use of energy efficient equipments.
                         The GEF energy efficiency project will be operationally blended with electricity sector investments under the IDA financed Multisectoral Water and Electricity
                         Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP). The MSWEIP was approvedby the World Bank Board of Directors on May 13, 2008, and is currently been implemented by the energy and
                         water utility REGIDESO.

                         The project development objective of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase reliability and quality
                         of electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO’s financial sustainability. The MSWEIP is helping
                         REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viability and the quality and continuity of services in the face of the increasing demand from individual consumers
                         and economic agents. The MSWEIP has been designed to provide a balance between immediate needs and medium- to long-term planning. It addresses to the urgent
                         need to fill the current gaps between supply and demand in both electricity and water supply. At the same time, the project supports long term planning activities and
                         studies, as well as the strengthening of the operational capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is a multi-sectoral water supply and electricity infrastructure operation that focuses on provision of electricity and water services to Bujumbura, the capital city of Burundi
                         and to improve the financial and operational capability of REGIDESO, the public utility in charge of production and distribution of water and electricity services in urban centers. Based
                         on the Mid-term review mission carried out this June 14 to 30, 2012, the team rates the project implementation performance as marginally satisfactory. In fact, about 79 percent of the
                         grant has been disbursed and about 98 percent is committed. The projections indicate that the total grant amount will be fully disbursed by June 30, 2013, the expected closing date.
                         Currently, 10 out of 15 key target indicators are on track to be reached.

                         These included (i) Strategic sector plans for electricity and water sectors prepared , (ii) electricity technical and non technical electricity losses per year reduced from 24% in 2008 to
                         19% in 2011, (iii) the number of electricity installed prepaid meters increased from 5100 to 31500, (iv) non-revenue water at REGIDESO reduced from 45% in 2008 to 39% in 2011,
                         (v) water production capacity (m3/day) increased from 66,000 to 96,000 cubic meters per day and (vi) 80% of scheduled works on rehabilitation of Bujumbura water network including
                         extension to the northern peri-urban has been completed and the remaining will be completed by December 30, 2012. This will enable REGIDESO to increase by 10, 000 additional
                         water connection 58 standpipes. The remaining are expected to be reached after the completion of the ongoing investments in water and electricity sectors implemented under two
                         major contracts (representing 60% of the project amount). It is worth mentioning that the implementation of two contracts mentioned above experimented significant delays during the
                         early stages of procurement and during implementation. The works are expected to be commissioned around November 2012.

                         On institutional strengthening, on the basis of a comprehensive tariff study, the Government increased tariffs in two phases to more cost reflective levels in 2011 and 2012. The first
                         phase of tariff increase was undertaken since September 2011 and the second phase of the progressive tariff revisions took place on March 1, 2012. The new tariffs reflect operating
                         costs and adjustment mechanism to allow the utility to properly maintain its assets and honor multilateral agreements to pay for power imports from regional hydro power plants.

                         The medium-term outlook of insufficient electricity supply to meet fast growing demand was confirmed. Currently, electricity demand is increasing at 8-12 percent per year However,
                         there is a daily load shedding of 20-30MW. In the absence of adequate and reliable electricity supply, local industry has to make use of small- and medium-sized generators installed
                         on their premises that cost about 0.35 US$/kWh. This situation is an impediment to the Burundi economic and growth and limit investments. The project supported detailed feasibility
                         of the two best evaluated hydropower sites (Jiji and Mulembwe) from the previous phase. The plants would be of run-of-the-river type, thus not requiring any major dam works and
                         could therefore be realized with limited environmental impacts in approximately three years. These two hydropower plants of about 50 MW capacity (both combined) offer a credible
                         low-cost alternative to bridge some of the expected medium-term supply deficit before larger hydro developments such as Rusizi III and Rusumo falls can be made operational. The
                         total estimated cost of developing the two sites and constructing an associated transmission line of about 70km to transport the power to Bujumbura, the capital city of Burundi has
                         been estimated at about US$200 million by the consulting firm. The GoB has formalized a financing request to the World Bank and European Investment Bank (EIB) for the
                         development of Jiji and Mule hydropower plants. The European Investment Bank (EIB) confirmed its willingness to support the development of the two sites through a co-financing of
                         up to 50% of the total cost. On October 23, 2012, the Bank has just approved the Burundi country assistance strategy for Burundi for FY13-16 and an energy project has been
                         foreseen in support to energy deficit reduction and boost economic growth. During this June Mid-term review, the Bank team visited Jiji and Mulembwe hydropower sites with a
                         delegation of REGIDESO and EIB on June 19-20, 2012. Therefore, in order to accelerate the detailed design of the two above sites, a number of priority actions have been agreed

                         •         For Jiji and Mulembwe hydropower developments, although the heights of the two dams are respectively 14 and 13.5 meters, based on the geographical configuration of the
                         two sites (close each other located in a radius of less than 7km) and high density of population , the team recommends that the safeguards policies, OP/BP 4.37 on safety of dams be
                         triggered if the two sites are to be supported by the Bank.

                         The major short comings in the two sectors are as follows:
                         (i) The recommendations of the external auditor of the performance contract signed between the Government of Burundi (GoB) and REGIDESO is poorly monitored by the steering
                         committee set-up by the GoB and the results are poorly disseminated.
                         (ii) The project cost overrun could not allow supporting the costs associated with the following scheduled activities: (a) REGIDESO organizational audit, (b) strategic electricity
                         development plan and identification of a priority investment program, (c) establishment of reliable information systems including interconnecting the four main offices of REGIDESO
                         and main production and customer centers and (d) of additional geological investigations and tender documents for the two sites and feasibility study/ environmental and social
                         impacts assessment and tender documents for transmission line from Jiji to Bujumbura. The Embassy of Netherlands in Burundi has confirmed their willingness to support the above
                         cost overrun and negotiations have been going on for about three months.
