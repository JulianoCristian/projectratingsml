                         This ISR is based on a mission conducted October 28-November 7 and subsequent follow up. Progress toward the PDO as well as Implementation performance both continue to be
                         Moderately Satisfactory, with 93% of the total credit disburses and the remaining $13 million committed. Since the Project’s restructuring in June 2013, which resulted in extension of
                         the closing date to June 30, 2014, implementation performance has been positive for the two components for which the extension was sought: National Payments System and
                         Inspection Panel management action plans (MAP)), whereas progress continued moderately and steadily on other components still supported by the Project extension (investment

                         climate and, to lesser extent, SOE transformation).

                         DETAILS:

                         1. Acquisition of the National Payments System reached the point of bid evaluation and is now pending award, following submission of evaluation recommendations and Bank
                         clearances at Regional level. Contract award is expected by end January, and completion of the first phase before closure of the Project in June 2014. Full installation will be
                         supported under a new Bank operation currently being prepared for approvals before end of June 2014.

                         2. Progress continues generally smoothly (with COPIREP providing tightened fiduciary vigil) with execution of activities under the Inspection Panel management action plan (MAP).
                         This relates to the Gecamines plan (free health and education to families of 10,600 ex-workers), as well as to the audits of INSS, and to the calculation of pension financing arrears as
                         part of reinstatement of ex-workers’ rights (of Gecamines and three liquidated banks). The government is still grappling with formulation of strategy for financing the reinstated
                         pension rights of the ex-workers from Gecamines and the liquidated banks, as well as to address demands from the associations of ex-workers from the above companies for
                         considerably higher financial settlements from the government, to which they claim to be entitled by law. Combined, the amounts in question represent a significant fiscal burden and
                         require the government to consider difficult solutions. Moreover, the Ministry of Labor charged with revamping the Labor Law and renegotiating all collective bargaining contracts en
                         force at state-owned enterprises (SOEs) - (activities supported by the Project) is confronted with having to deal with the political dimensions of this process, and, alongside the Project
                         executing agency COPIREP, also with the challenges of resolving employment-related debts accumulated by all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) over decades of poor economic
                         management.

                         3. Implementation of reforms to improve the investment climate is also progressing well, though many of the achievements, including some significant reforms, such as establishment
                         of new commercial tribunals and a One-Stop Shop for business registration, came too late to be acknowledged in the 2014 Doing Business assessment, on which DRC was rated
                         183 out of 189 (essentially no change from 2013) but will be recognized in the 2015 measurements. Time to register a company was reduced once again this year, to 31 days, from
                         58 last year, while the indicator for access to credit improved substantially due to introduction of regulations for secured transactions (specifically, providing legal definition of movable
                         collateral) that was funded by the Project. The establishment of a movable pledge registry is currently in process as well.

                         4. Good progress continues (albeit unevenly) toward completion of financial and operational restructuring of the entire SOE portfolio of 20 enterprises and 21 public establishments
                         (6 of which were placed in liquidation). Of the 7 strategic SOEs, Gecamines is the only one to complete all steps in its transformation, including debt restructuring, asset ownership
                         confirmation, new balance sheets, etc. The other 6 are all in different stages due to their specific sector structure and circumstances, some aided by other Bank or donor operations,
                         and still face a lengthy process, including preconditional government policy guidance on sector-level strategies. All of the SOEs face the heavy burden of resolving their employment-
                         related debts, which is a subject being addressed at wholesale level by the Ministry of Labor and COPIREP. and each is in different stage of transformation, for example: (1) SNEL
                         (under management contract) is mostly done with asset and debt revaluation; (2) SNCC (with private management team, valuation in progress, but complicated by unfinished
                         liquidation of SNCZ); (3) SCTP (mostly valuation left to do); (4) OCPT (complicated by not having yet spun off the postal network and the need to register a new corporation for the

                         telecom business); (5) REGIDESO (under management contract, on track, resolved social debts, still needs unbundling), and (6) RVA (no progress achieved, until government
                         decides on division of company and separation of regulatory functions). The issues of common concern to all SOEs, and to the authorities, are that (a) all of these SOEs will need to
                         be re-registered again under OHADA corporate statutes to SA by the deadline of September 2014 (unless exempted by special law), which require them to finalize valuations of
                         capital and prepare new balance sheets, as well as implement governance structures, taking into consideration that the President's powers to appoint the government's delegates to
                         the Board of Directors will be supplanted by the OHADA regime, and (b) after having been transformed into commercial enterprises in 2011, which terminated their access to direct
                         and regular government subsidies and transfers, and after having had much of their debts taken over by the government as part of their overall transformation to SARL, these SOEs
                         now face considerable tax liabilities that will need to be addressed.

                         5. The project has broadly achieved the majority of its outcome indicators, which will be fully evaluated during the next 6-month ISR period using results of the Impact Assessment
                         studies that will soon be launched. Virtually all measurable indicators show that targets have been achieved or surpassed, as reflected, for example, by annual Foreign Direct
                         Investment (FDI) volumes across key industry sectors (in 2012 was US$3.3 billion vs target of US$1 billion), growth in total domestic credit to priv ate sector to 7.66% of GDP (vs

                         in reduction of cost of doing business, as reflected in 70% reduction in number of days to register a business, in the application of specialized courts and arbitration centers to enforce
                         business contracts, by the explosive growth of microfinance industry (over 800,000 accounts vs target 300,000), improved compliance with prudential framework by commercial
                         banks due to better supervision capacity and privatization, and irreversible transformation of the large SOEs into viable corporate entities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Project was restructured in June 2013 to extend its closing date by 12 months to June 30, 2014, to allow completion of the Management Action Plan of the Inspection Panel
                         case, and uninterrupted progress toward modernization of the National Payments System. A reallocation of funds was also completed, and disbursement has resumed.

                         2. SOE governance was strengthened with additional management training, this time in OHADA accounting and corporate structures, especially since all of the DRC enterprises will
                         soon in late 2014 be required to re-register according to OHADA requirements and definitions.

                         3. The benefits of free health care extended to the PVs of Gecamines were expanded to include a number of medical needs generally faced by the older population.

                         3. Financing support of the operating costs of CPCAI (Steering Committee for Improvement of the Investment Climate) was extended until the end of the Project, in recognition of its
                         good performance in leading Doing Business reforms and other improvements in the business environment.
