                         The Project has been performing very well since the six month extension was granted in December 2012 but will require a further 12 month extension to complete two high-risk
                         activities (National Payments System or NPS, and the Inspection Panel management action plan or MAP), after it became necessary to reformulate the approach to their full and
                         satisfactory completion. The following are the highlights: (i) Progress towards DO is MS with most of the outcome indicators achieved; (ii) Disbursements reached 97% of the original
                         credit and 74% of the additional financing; (iii) Recent major implementation achievements include (a) parliament approval of NY Convention and further deepening of OHADA

                         application and national capacity; (b) SOE governance reinforcements, via management training, performance contracts, and tightened enforcement of transparency/disclosure
                         regulations; (c) modification to design of the NPS for better technology and accelerated implementation; (d) steady progress to improve overall investment climate, including
                         completion of three commercial courts, a one-stop-shop business registry, liberalization of working hours, expanded use of electronic and mobile payments system, and other actions
                         to reduce the cost of Doing Business as well as improve gender parity; (e) completed calculations of pension arrears and government liabilities to all ex-workers covered by the MAP
                         with restoration of pension rights, along with refinements of the Gecamines health and education entitlement program administered by NGO Caritas in order to provide greater
                         medical benefits to the older age groups. Explanation of extension:

                         -- The extension of the Project by 12 months to June 30, 2014 along with reallocation of residual funds is needed to complete: (a) Remaining actions under the MAP, including the
                         Gecamines program and analytic support to the government in resolving social issues such as pension arrears owed to SOE ex-workers, and strengthening of the INSS pension
                         agency; and (b) completed procurement and installation of the NPS (the newly repackaged Automated Transfer System) which will constitute the core platform for continued
                         expansion and integration of the NPS with other financial sector technologies and the regional payments framework.
                         -- All other components of the Project are completed (or will be discontinued, including the operational support to the investment climate reform committee CPCAI, and the
                         construction of two commercial courts in conflict-affected cities of Goma and Bukavu). Comprehensive completion of the SOE reform agenda continues to hinge on implementation
                         of delayed government actions to resolve issues of debt and asset holdings. However, progress expected under the MAP during the suggested 12 months extension will also
                         advance resolution of the social dimension of SOE reforms.
                         -- Risks continue to be substantial due to unpredictable circumstances across the country affected by conflict, political fragility and complex implementation framework.

                         DETAILS:

                         The six months extension had been granted in order to facilitate an orderly resolution and transition of two high-risk components, including the Inspection Panel management action
                         plan (MAP) and the procurement of the National Payments System (NPS), to other projects, one of which would need restructuring and the other still under preparation. A second
                         reason was to allow for accelerated progress on several priorities of the investment climate and SOE governance which were of critical importance to the Bank's overall program in
                         DRC.

                         Excellent results were achieved on all fronts of investment climate and substantive progress was made on SOE governance, as reflected in Board approval of the new Country
                         Assistance Strategy and affirmation of new programs in DRC. However, the complexity of the two high-risk components compelled a management-supported reformulation of
                         approaches to their resolution:
                         -- Transfer of the MAP became complicated by the need to restructure not one but two other operations, one in health and the other in education sector, both of which had already
                         been restructured more than once and have limited latitudes for accepting the new components.
                         -- The NPS, on the other hand, was to be transferred to a projects whose preparation has been prolonged, due to need to synchronize with completion of the FSAP, whose start was
                         also delayed by operational reasons as well as the appointment of a new Governor of the Central Bank. Moreover, procurement of the NPS components was affected by changes in

                         design of the technical architecture due to new technologies on the market which are more economical and appropriate for facilitating regional integration of DRC with SADC and
                         COMESA.

                         Progress toward Development Objectives remains Moderately Satisfactory, though improvement would be possible with completion of installation of the NPS and significant progress
                         with SOE reforms, particularly with the social issues of SOEs addressed under the MAP. Performance of the Borrower (and of the executing agency) are satisfactory, there are no
                         outstanding audits, or IFRs for the credit and grant. FMS and Procurement ratings are Satisfactory. The team agrees with the Government's plan for completing the project.

                         As of May 2013, the initial credit is about 97% disbursed, while about 74% of the Additional Financing has been disbursed.Of the approximately $24 million left undisbursed, about $5
                         million is ready to disburse pending the forthcoming Level 2 restructuring, while $5.2 million will be needed to complete the MAP and approximately $7 million to purchase and install
                         the NPS components. Remaining IDA funds will be available for transfer to other projects.

                         The project has broadly achieved the majority of its outcome indicators, as reflected in surpassed targets for annual Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) volumes across key industry
                         sectors (was US$4 billion vs target of US$1 billion), growth in total domestic credit to private sector to 7.66% of GDP (vs target of 4.8% by 2011), and increase in total savings (M3) in
                         financial sector at 12.69% of GDP in 2010 (vs target of 10.4% by 2011). Supporting these outcomes are achievements in reduction of cost of doing business, as reflected in 70%
                         reduction in number of days to register a business, in the application of specialized courts and arbitration centers to enforce business contracts, by the explosive growth of

                         microfinance industry (over 800,000 accounts vs target 300,000), improved compliance with prudential framework by commercial banks due to better supervision capacity and
                         privatization, and irreversible transformation of the large SOEs into corporate entities registered under new legislation with government as single shareholder.

                         -- Government-led implementation of a corporate debt resolution framework for SOEs, including the settlement of accumulated claims by organized labor, has produced first cases of
                         successfully transformed SOEs into commercially-managed corporate entities, with restated accounts and updated valuations of capital contributing to restoration of solvency, and
                         facilitating the transition to private sector governance with management and regulatory structures conducive to Public-Private Partnership arrangements;
                         -- A series of high-impact reforms has propelled improvements in investment climate and financial sector, including irreversible adoption of a new commercial legal framework of
                         OHADA, the adhesion of DRC to the NY Convention on Arbitration, and implementation of a One Stop Shop for business registration targeting 3 day processing, as part of c
                         omprehensive reform program on fronts of investment climate spearheaded by the Project-supported CPCAI (IC Steering Committee) championed personally by the Prime Minister;
                         and completion of three more commercial courts in addition to three completed earlier under the Project.
                         -- Central Bank-led strengthening of bank regulation, microfinance sector supervision, reinforced with promotion of financial literacy, consumer protection, mobile banking, and further
                         supported by establishment of a credit registry, have strengthened financial intermediation, while the construction of a modern IT data center was completed by the Central Bank in
                         which to house the new Payments System.
                         -- Government's renewed attention to successful liberalization of the insurance sector, introduction of leasing, streamlining of the tax code, and improvements in enforcement of
                         commercial contracts, have further contributed to improving access to finance for improved economic competitiveness.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Project was restructured in December 2012 to extend its closing date by 6 months to June 30, 2013. There is need to reallocate funds in order to reflect changes in the work
                         program until revised Project closing date (including the suggested extension).

                         2. Parliament's adoption of the New York Convention on Arbitration crowned a list of long-awaited breakthrough improvements in investment climate. Others include the completion

                         of three additional commercial courts (Matadi, Kisangani and Mbuji-Mai), the setting up of a one-stop-shop for business registration, completion of a substantial amount of OHADA
                         training which strengthens DRC’s capacity to apply the new commercial framework, the completed drafting of labor law reforms, the submission of gender equality legal reforms to
                         Parliament, the approval of Insurance liberalization law after several years debate, and the implementation of mobile payments and direct deposit salary payments for civil servants,
                         etc.

                         3. SOE governance was strengthened by performance contracts at SNEL, REGIDESO, which provide model for other SOEs; PPP feasibility/strategies completed for waterways and
                         ports authority companies; and continued progress on implementation of decree regulating non-secured liabilities of the SOEs. However, completion of SOE transformation into viable
                         commercial entities still awaits decisions of government on asset holdings and valuations, as well as implementation of decisions on debt restructuring.

                         4. Modifications were made to the design of the NPS to take advantage of emerging technologies which are more economic, and functionally more appropriate for the regional
                         harmonization needs of DRC. Instead of relying on separate components for RTGS, ACH, Central Registry, Payment Incidents Bureau, etc., the NPS will utilize an Automated
                         Transfer System (ATS) with integrated RTGS, ACH and Central Registry, while the PIB will no longer be required due to linkages of the NPS with the newly established Credit

                         Information Bureau. This new design will accelerate installation of the NPS at lower cost than earlier projected, and furnish DRC with the most modern technology on the market,
                         making DRC the first francophone country in Africa to use this technology. However, the modifications to the NPS also resulted in delayed launch of procurement, which is now
                         ongoing and will not be completed under the current timeframe of the Project, unless a new Project extension is granted.
