{"cdata!": "The objective of the Private Sector\n            Development and Competitiveness Project for Democratic\n            Republic Congo (DRC) is to support the Borrower's\n            policy of the promotion of private-sector led growth\n            through: (a) improving the investment climate; (b)\n            supporting parastatal reform in the telecommunications,\n            energy, finance, transport, and mining sectors; and (c)\n            improving mining competitiveness in the Katanga region of\n            the Borrower. This restructuring paper seeks your approval\n            to proceed with the extension of the Project closing date by\n            6 months, from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The 6\n            month extension was approved in principle by Regional Vice\n            President (RVP) on October 17, 2012, conditional upon\n            fulfillment of prior actions which have now been satisfied,\n            enabling the transfer of certain activities of high\n            corporate reputation risk to other Bank projects for\n            continuation and completion of their implementation. These\n            include (i) an activity of the Management Action Plan (MAP)\n            approved by the Board in May 2011 in response to an\n            Inspection Panel request on behalf of ex-workers of the\n            mining enterprise Gecamines who took part in a\n            Project-supported labor retrenchment program in 2004-5, and\n            (ii) a critical phase of the National Payments System (NPS)\n            implementation at the Central Bank of Congo (BCC). The\n            extension of closing date would allow the Project to make up\n            for the time lost due to disruptions caused by election\n            related political instability from mid-2011 to January 2012,\n            including a period of one and a half months when the Country\n            Office was closed and all staff evacuated. This is the\n            second extension of the Project, pushing its cumulative\n            extension to 39 months and age to 9 years and 11 months at closing."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
