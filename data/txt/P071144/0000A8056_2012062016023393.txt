                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To increase the competitiveness of the economy, and thereby contribute to economic growth. The project will achieve these objectives by assisting with improving the
                         investment climate; by supporting reform of public enterprises in the mining, telecoms, financial, transport, and energy sectors; by stimulating economic diversification
                         and development in the Katanga region through community-driven development approaches and by facilitating the reintegration of retrenched workers in the local
                         economy through support for training, business development services and finance.

                         The Project continues to advance as slow pace, its strong momentum from 2009-to-early 2011 having been severely affected by the prolonged election-related slowdown in
                         government activity, resulting in delayed execution of most activities requiring strong policy leadership and decisiveness. The impact was hardest on core activities such as on reform
                         of public enterprises, investment climate (particularly the legal reforms, including the continued freeze on adhesion to OHADA) and, to a lesser extent, the financial sector, all of which
                         prompts a downgrading of the project to Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

                         However, notable achievements during the past period include successful completion of the SNCC social/retirement plan, which helped to prevent the railways enterprise from
                         financial and operational collapse in late 2011 and paved the way for large capital investments injected by the transport sector’s Multimodal Transport Project, as well as the
                         government’s fulfillment of IDA condition for financial support to the Microfinance Promotion Fund (FPM), and the agreement on implementation support to modernization of national
                         payments system (SNP) at the central bank.

                         Following the installation of a new government in May 2012, there is now renewed hope that implementation and impact of this project are recovering, given enough time to restart
                         and deliver outcomes. Key actions required to improve performance during the remaining period will need to include implementation of resolutions for completion of restructuring of
                         public enterprises, adhesion to OHADA, and advancement in the financial sector components of the project. Moreover, the investment climate agenda is back on track and needs
                         sustained support to capitalize on the strong leadership in place and the requests from the government for robust Bank support. Much of the reform process can be done before
                         closure of this project, given the strong leadership and commitment to disciplined realization of measures that have for the most part already been formulated. The new government
                         seems to have grasped these priorities in its 100 Day Program, which gives reason to expect improvements in project performance if extension of closing date is approved by 3
                         months to end March 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The government needs to take leadership in deciding on the ownership to a large number of strategic assets currently administered by the PEs (transformed into corporatized
                         commercial enterprises, no longer directly managed by the government) and to enact and implement decisions regarding its treatment of certain categories of debt on the balance
                         sheet of the PEs which originate from the pre-commercializaton period when they were directly managed by the government. The government is also expected to undertake the
                         triggering actions for adhesion to the OHADA legal framework and for adoption of the New York Convention on Commercial Arbitration, both of which are essential to the
                         establishment of good economic governance and competitiveness of the economy. The impasse in appointment of judges to head the new commercial court in Kisangani needs to be
                         resolved. The BCC and COPIREP are to hire consultants to help with acquisition of technical components of the SNP by closure of PSDC and then to hire them to help to manage
                         the implementation of the SNP by end 2013 under the Congo Growth Pole project. The Bank is to restructure the project to transfer unfinished activities in progress to other projects
                         and reallocate remaining surplus funds.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
