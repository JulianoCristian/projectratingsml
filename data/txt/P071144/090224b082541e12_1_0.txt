                         The project will close on June 30, 2014. This is the final ISR before the project closes and therefore weill report on the overall achievements achieved under this project and
                         arrangements made for remaining activities. This ISR is based on supervision reports obtained in May 2014 and subsequent mission in June 2014.

                         Overall achievements of the PDO as well as Implementation performance are rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The rating is moderated due to the fact the project is an overage

                         project. If the project ratings were solely based on achievements of the indicators, it would have been rated as Satisfactory. All measurable performance indicators have been
                         achieved, as the project nears closure on June 30, 2014. Of the total loan $180 million, 94.5% has been disbursed, through award of 895 service contracts, 206 contracts for goods,
                         and 68 contracts for works, while registering satisfactory procurement and FMS performance.

                         The project has broadly achieved virtually every single outcome indicator, with the exception of one (Return on Assets), which cannot be measured on same basis as the baseline,
                         due to changes in the balance sheets and accounting methods, as result of the transformation of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The full result of the project will be known
                         when the Impact Assessment studies which is in progress is completed. However, some of the indicators demonstrate the achievements made: for example, annual Foreign Direct
                         Investment (FDI) volumes across key industry sectors (in 2012 was US$3.3 billion vs target of US$1 billion), growth in total domestic credit to private sector rose to 18.11% of GDP
                         (vs target of 4.8% by 2011), and increase in total savings (M3) in financial sector reached 33.92% of GDP in 2012 (vs target of 10.4% by 2011). Supporting these outcomes are
                         achievements in reduction of cost of doing business, as reflected in 70% (and possibly 98%, once validated in practice by the Doing Business Report 2015) reduction in number of
                         days to register a business, in the application of specialized courts and arbitration centers to enforce business contracts, by the explosive growth of microfinance industry (over 1
                         million accounts vs target 300,000, and 149 institutions created vs target of at least 5), improved compliance with prudential framework by commercial banks due to better supervision
                         capacity and privatization, and irreversible transformation of the large SOEs into viable corporate entities.

                         DETAILS:

                         Implementation of reforms to improve the investment climate is progressing well. In 2013, the time to register a company was reduced to 31 days, from 58 the previous year, and now
                         it may be as low as 3 days with the introduction of a one-stop-shop. Access to credit has improved substantially due to introduction of regulations for secured transactions
                         (specifically, providing legal definition of movable collateral) that was funded by the Project. The establishment of a movable pledge registry is currently in process as well. Labor law
                         was amended to give more rights to employers and allow women to work late hours. Progress was also made on the Family Law to allow women to register business, open bank
                         account, etc. This bill is awaiting approval in the second house of National Assembly.

                         Good progress continues (albeit unevenly) toward completion of financial and operational restructuring of the entire SOE portfolio of 20 enterprises and 21 public establishments (6 of
                         which were placed in liquidation). Of the 7 strategic SOEs, all steps of transformation have been completed for 3 (Gecamines, SNCC and SCPT), including debt restructuring, asset
                         ownership confirmation, new balance sheets, etc. The other 4 are all in different stages due to their specific sector structure and circumstances, some aided by other Bank or donor
                         operations, and still face a lengthy process, including preconditional government policy guidance on sector-level strategies. All of the SOEs face the heavy burden of resolving their
                         employment-related debts, which is a subject being addressed at wholesale level by the Ministry of Labor and the Steering Committee for Reform of the State Portfolio (COPIREP).
                         The remaining 4 SOEs are in different stage of transformation, for example: (1) SNEL (under management contract) is mostly done with asset and debt revaluation; (2) OCPT
                         (complicated by not having yet spun off the postal network and the need to register a new corporation for the telecom business); (3) REGIDESO (under management contract, on
                         track, resolved social debts, still needs unbundling), and (6) RVA (no progress achieved, until government decides on division of company and separation of regulatory functions).
                         The issues of common concern to all SOEs, and to the authorities, are that (a) all of these SOEs will need to be re-registered again under OHADA corporate statutes to SA by the

                         deadline of September 2014 (unless exempted by special law), which require them to finalize valuations of capital and prepare new balance sheets, as well as implement governance
                         structures, taking into consideration that the President's powers to appoint the government's delegates to the Board of Directors will be supplanted by the OHADA regime, and (b)
                         after having been transformed into commercial enterprises in 2011, which terminated their access to direct and regular government subsidies and transfers, and after having had
                         much of their debts taken over by the government as part of their overall transformation to commercial corporations (SARL), these SOEs now face considerable tax liabilities that will
                         need to be addressed.

                         RELEVANCE

                         The Project was approved in 2004 during ongoing conflict and fragile government to set the economy on recovery track toward private sector led growth through improved investment
                         climate, reforms of public enterprises in key sectors, and improved mining competitiveness in the mining-intens ive province of Katanga. These were highly relevant objectives to a
                         country whose social and economic fabric had unraveled after decades of infighting and invasions, genocide and pillage, leading to precipitous decline of its economic institutions and

                         public services, amidst antiquated laws and weak governance.

                         Following years of consolidation of governance, dealing with global economic cycles and competing priorities of the government, the Project was extended three times (2010, 2012,
                         and 2013), to allow for passage of requisite laws, the creation of legal and regulatory institutions, and commitment by policymakers to undertake difficult reforms, particularly in the

                         SOE sector and business regulatory environment. Additional financing was provided to the Project in 2008 to boost these efforts, including in the financial sector, to increase banking
                         support to the private sector and access to finance to the vastly poor population, as well as to fund a successful labor retrenchment program at the railways company which supported
                         another investment operation to rehabilitate the company.

                         Implementation was boosted by key laws enacted in 2008 to propel SOE reforms across the sectors, and in 2010 by new institutions focused on improving the investment climate,
                         and on supporting the the expansion of the banking and microfinance industry. This momentum resulted in creating conditions for high economic growth (currently at 8.5% compared
                         with 2.9% in 2008-9) and rates of investment that are currently being experienced. It also created the space and authorizing environment for the launch of new Bank sector-specific
                         operations directed at each of the utility industries assisted by the Project, and of recently approved new Bank operations in areas of private sector development (e.g. Growth Poles
                         project) and SME finance (Financial Infrastructure and Markets project). As such, and throughout its lengthy life, the Project has maintained its firm, highly relevant flagship position
                         in the Bank portfolio as the driver of key institutional and legal reforms for an enabling business environment across all key sectors, which has led to high rates of economic growth of
                         DRC in recent years, made the economy more resilient to external shocks, and, through creation of requisite regulatory bodies and laws across the key utility industries (e.g. the
                         Mining Law, the Electricity Law, and others), has cleared the way for continuously expanding Bank engagement in DRC.

                         EFFICACY

                         The Project succeeded in all targets that measure increased competitiveness of the economy and of a growing private sector. Aside from a couple indicators that became
                         unmeasurable or irrelevant over time, other benchmarks of SOE reform indicate that these economic drivers are better positioned to serve the private sector and population, after
                         having been transformed into public corporations with modern statutory and governance structures conducive to private sector investment and greater capacity to deliver higher
                         quality public services. With their indebtedness reduced by measures taken under the Project, and with clearer demarcation between commercial activities and government-led
                         regulatory functions, the SOEs are better positioned to complete their restructuring in a new legal environment of OHADA, which will enforce tighter fiscal, fiduciary, and social
                         accountability going forward. The SOEs are contributing to the government’s Treasury, now being taxpayers like other private companies, and providing services to private sector that
                         contribute to further economic growth. Improved investment climate, particularly in business registration, construction, taxation, trade facilitation, etc, and most importantly in
                         protection of investors (OHADA and New York Convention) and of creditors (new insolvency regime, credit registry, collateral registry, etc) continues to expand access to finance and
                         to markets, fueling economic growth as well as regional trade. Improved legal enforcement of commercial laws and contracts is boosting confidence of entrepreneurs, as are recent
                         reforms in gender laws allowing women to enter the work force, register bank accounts and companies, without restriction by male-dominated society laws and customs.

                         Slow progress with modernization of the National Payments System (NPS), a new component introduced by Additional Financing in 2008, reflects the lengthy process of consensus-
                         building among the public and private stakeholders after decades of mistrust, in absence of strategy for conduct of financial sector and monetary policy, in an environment dominated
                         by use of foreign currency rather than local, and from a dead start as far as vision for financial integration across the country, as well as regionally, is concerned. The Project
                         nevertheless produced a universally agreed, comprehensive design of long term strategy and detailed specifications of the technical hardware/software/physical facilities architecture
                         for the NPS, all the more challenging to have it completed during a period of rapid technological change in the particular industry dominated by only two providers of the technology,

                         though its implementation will be transferred to a new Bank operation which was approved during the Project, with this in mind. Finally, the Project created a long list of vital
                         institutions which will provide continued sustainability of transformation for economic competitiveness and private sector led growth, including the executing agency, COPIREP, which
                         will continue to serve as the main unit of government for leading economic reforms across the public enterprise sector, CPCAI as the Steering Committee for Improvement of
                         Investment Climate, ANAPI as the national agency for investment promotion, CENACOM as the privately-run center for commercial arbitration, the National OHADA Commission, and
                         others.

                         EFFICIENCY

                         The Project has been implemented during a period of changing political and economic governance of the country, starting with a fragile government at Project approval that held little
                         control over the country and its decrepit economic institutions, then was reconstituted amidst post-election violence in 2007, followed by severe economic crisis with high inflation due

                         “vulture funds” and other creditors, until debt relief was achieved through HIPC negotiations in 2010. Periods of policymaker inertia continued during the run up and immediately after
                         the 2011 elections, as well as from October 2013 until June 2014, while the government continues to be officially in a state of resignation, awaiting reshuffle and new mandate.

                         Despite these turbulent times and policymaker paralysis, the Project continued to grind out its reforms agenda, and achieving strong results, reflected in current relative
                         macroeconomic stability and enviable pace of economic growth, one of the highest in the world since 2013 at 8.5% projected for 2014, compared with negative rates at outset of
                         Project and average of 3-5% during most of the mid-to-late 2000s. Moreover, the Project also underwent major fiduciary reorganization, such as the transfer of government’s
                         executing responsibility for the Project from BCECO to COPIREP, requiring the Project to provide sustained investment in COPIREP’s capacity and resources which today make it
                         the pre-eminent reform leading institution in the country. The Project has completed over 895 service contracts and conventions; 206 contracts for goods; and 68 contracts for works,
                         while maintaining fiduciary performance.

                         The reforms supported by the Project required creation of new institutions (listed above and elsewhere) or rehabilitation of existing ones, eg Supreme Council of Magistrates, courts,
                         etc. Over $40 million of the $70 million disbursed on SOE reform went for severance payments to retrenched workers. Finally, complaints from about 18,000 workers who lost their
                         employment as result of some of the institutional reforms vital to economic recovery in the mining (Gecamines), telecoms (OCPT), and banking (three liquidated state-owned banks
                         that had been non-performing for years) sectors precipitated additional mitigation measures (implementation of a Management Action Plan to address requests from the Inspection
                         Panel) which diverted almost $10 million IDA allocation from the Project and prolonged its duration.
