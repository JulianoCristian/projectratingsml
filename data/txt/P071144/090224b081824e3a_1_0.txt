                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To increase the competitiveness of the economy, and thereby contribute to economic growth. The project will achieve these objectives by assisting with improving the
                         investment climate; by supporting reform of public enterprises in the mining, telecoms, financial, transport, and energy sectors; by stimulating economic diversification
                         and development in the Katanga region through community-driven development approaches and by facilitating the reintegration of retrenched workers in the local
                         economy through support for training, business development services and finance.

                         Strong implementation achievements by the new government since June have significantly improved the performance and outlook of this project, whose implementation is now
                         galloping across all components, in start contrast with lack of forward movement during the political elections period. Major breakthroughs occurred that unblocked core reforms
                         across the SOE agenda, investment climate, and financial sector, after months of wait in state of preparedness. (Highlights are listed in the 2 bullet points below.) Impressive
                         implementation progress during the latest supervision period warrants an improved rating to Moderately Satisfactory, which is the Project's PDO rating, given that most of the

                         measurable indicators have been achieved. Institutional reforms are significant and irreversible. The closing of the Project will be postponed by 6 months to allow smooth closure
                         and transfer of selected unfinished activities to other projects.

                         1. On the SOE agenda, the long-stalled Decree for Resolution of Non-Secured SOE Liabilities was finally implemented and facilitated the completion of restructuring of the first
                         strategic SOEs, i.e. Gecamines, among others; other SOEs (e.g. SNEL and REGIDESO) instituted management performance contracts supported by private consultants, and a
                         private operator was sought for airport authority RVA, while a new PPP strategy was prepared to complete the restructuring of ONATRA/SCTP; a new regulatory framework was
                         completed for the telecommunications industry and for the restructuring of OCPT; settlement of social debts and revision of collective union agreements has started with success at
                         the SOEs after unions accepted massive debt write-down of labor claims at the national airline LAC, thereby setting an important precedent applicable across the sector.

                         2. On investment climate and the financial sector, a series of high-impact reforms were realized, including OHADA adhesion and new legal framework becoming effective in
                         September, while government is actively preparing to sign the NY Convention on Arbitration; CPCAI is vigorously implementing a pilot One Stop Shop for business registration with
                         Prime Minister calling for 3 day target registration time; the PM personally intervened to unblock the customs/trade facilitation single window and speed up the processing of trade
                         transactions at borders; the CPCAI Roadmap is moving swiftly forward across all fronts, including the drafting of new laws on labor, land use, consumer protection, etc., though
                         facing funding shortage at Project closure. IDA funding of the Microfinance fund was successfully processed disbursed to servicing beneficiaries; procurement hurdles were overcome
                         for Payment Systems TA; and a number of regulatory improvements made in the financial sector, including training of inspectors, and new laws for regulation of credit cooperatives.
                         Project disbursement improved dramatically, with $8.7 million disbursed since June bringing total disbursements to $164.2 million (91% of project proceeds). The FMS was upgraded
                         to satisfactory, while the executing agency COPIREP has been delivering consistently good performance despite a tighter budget constraint and higher workloads.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following adoption of laws for resolution of Non-secured SOE liabilities, there are still pending government policies to decide on the ownership of strategic assets at SOEs in order to
                         complete the restructuring of public utility companies, though it should be noted that the pace of this work has improved on a sector-by-sector basis (energy, water, transport, etc) due
                         to policy-level support from Bank’s other sector projects. Currently in process is legislative approval of adhesion to the New York Convention on Commercial Arbitration. Agreement
                         was reached to extend the Project to June 2013 to facilitate smooth transfer of continuing activities (e.g. the Gecamines IP action plan and Payments System) to other Bank projects.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
