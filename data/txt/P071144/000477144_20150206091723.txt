F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from the PAD)

The project's development objective is to increase the competitiveness of the economy, and
thereby contribute to economic growth. The project will achieve these objectives by assisting
with improving the investment climate; by supporting reform of public enterprises in the mining,
telecoms, financial, transport, and energy sectors; by stimulating economic diversification and
development in the Katanga region through community-driven development approaches and by
facilitating the reintegration of retrenched workers in the local economy through support for
training, business development services and finance.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

No revisions to the PDO throughout the project’s implementation.

               `   Baseline Value         Original Target Values         Formally          Actual Value
                                             (from approval               Revised           Achieved at
                                               documents)                 Target          Completion or
                                                                          Values           Target Years
  Indicator (1):   Annual Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the mining, transport, energy, telecomm,
                   and financial sectors reaches US$1 billion per year by 2009 (from US$200 million in
                   2002)
       Value:         $200 million                $1 billion                                 $3.3 billion
        Date:         31-Dec-2002                31-Dec-2009                               31-Dec-2012
    Comments:      FDI data varies across sources (the Central Bank, the National Investment Promotion
                   Agency). However, all data sources point to strong FDI growth over the past 6 years,
                   especially in services and industry sectors.

  Indicator (2):   Return on Assets for each of the targeted state-owned enterprises (National Electricity
                   Company – SNEL; National Railways Company – SNCC; National Airports Agency –
                   RVA; Congolese Post and Telecommunications Company – OCPT (renamed SCPT);
                   City Bus Company – City Train; Quarries and Mines Company -- GECAMINES;
                   Congolese Airlines – LAC) increases from the average of -21 percent to an average of
                   +2 percent by the end of project implementation
       Value:             -21%                        2%                                       -3.1%
        Date:          31-Dec-2002                31-Dec-2009                               31-Dec-2012
    Comments:      Data for 2013 was not available at time of ICR. There was a gain of 18 percentage points,
                   although not enough to bring the target SOE’s to profitability, except SNEL which turned
                   a (small) profit 0.88 percent.

  Indicator (3):   Net fiscal contribution from state-owned enterprises increased by $10 million annually
         Value:              0                  US$ 10 million                                  US$300
          Date:        31-Dec-2002               31-Dec-2009                                  31-Dec-2012
    Comments:      Data for2013 was not available at time of ICR. This data needs careful interpretation.
                   Fiscal contribution largely came from one source, GECAMINES (84%), and mostly from

There have been a series of restructurings to the Project as follows: (1) On August 16 2004, to,
among other things, clarify funding arrangements for DRC’s participation in the African Trade
Insurance (ATI) agency (also the project closing date was moved from March 31, 2010 to April
30, 2010). (2) On March 26, 2008, to add an Additional Financing to support a new microfinance
activity, a national payments system, and extend the voluntary retirement program to SNCC,
among others. (3) In April 2010, to extend the closing date of the original credit from April 30,
2010 to December 31, 2012. (4) On December 12, 2012, to extend the closing dates of both the
original credit and the additional financing from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013. (5) On
June 30, 2013, to extend the project’s closing date to June 30, 2014 in order to allow completion
of the Management Action Plan of the Inspection Panel case, as well as ensure uninterrupted
support to the modernization of the National Payments System.

                  Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.    At project appraisal, the economy of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had
severely deteriorated. This was the result of three decades of economic neglect exacerbated by
the military conflicts of the late 1990s. However, by 2002, the DRC Government was actively
pursuing measures to end the armed conflict, and had signed peace agreements with the warring
factions. In order for the peace to hold, the Government and its development partners were
acutely aware of the urgency of restoring the economy to rekindle people’s hopes and faith in
their Government. This was critical to forestalling a return to open conflict.

2.     In this context, the Bank, which had reengaged with DRC in 2001 after suspending
programs in 1993, had supported two emergency operations aimed at stabilizing the economy
and undertaking emergency repairs to restore basic services. However, promoting private sector
development, a key to long-term, broad-based growth, required a dedicated project to help the
government implement investment climate reforms and address the problems of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). In addition to water and power utilities and major transport infrastructure
(ports, airports, and railways), the state portfolio consisted of banks and a number of agricultural
enterprises. Several of these SOEs had been acquired in the early 1970s through nationalization,
resulting in a portfolio of approximately 58 major enterprises dominating almost every aspect of
the economy, and accounting for about 80 percent of formal employment.

3.    These SOEs were in a sorry state: poorly managed, loss-making, heavily indebted, and
owing salary arrears dating back several years in some cases. They constituted a major drag on
the DRC economy. The dominance of the financial sector by poorly performing state-owned
banks had undermined confidence in it, and hindered the emergence of a vibrant private banking
industry. This was compounded by onerous and opaque rules and procedures concerning
taxation, business registration, and other bureaucratic constraints to private investment. These
factors created a strong imperative and a sense of urgency to improve the investment climate,
and confront SOE issues, especially in critical areas such as transport, telecommunications,
energy, mining, and banking, in order to restore economic growth.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Original development objective (from the PAD)

4.     The project's development objective was to increase the competitiveness of the economy,
and thereby contribute to economic growth. The project would achieve these objectives by
assisting with improving the investment climate; by supporting reform of public enterprises in
the mining, telecoms, financial, transport, and energy sectors; by stimulating economic
diversification and development in the Katanga region through community-driven development



                                                 1
approaches and by facilitating the reintegration of retrenched workers in the local economy
through support for training, business development services and finance.

Original key performance indicators

5.       The original key outcome indicators from the Results Matrix were 1:

(i)      Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the mining, transport, energy, telecom, and financial
         sectors reaches US$1 billion per year by 2009 (from US$200 million in 2002);

(ii)     Return on Assets for each of the targeted state-owned enterprises (National Electricity
         Company – SNEL; National Railways Company – SNCC; State Air Transportation
         Company – RVA; Congo Post and Telecommunications Company – OCPT (renamed
         SCPT); City Train – a local bus company; Quarries and Mines Company – GECAMINES;
         Congolese Airlines – LAC) increases from the average of -21 percent to an average of +2
         percent by the end of project implementation; and

(iii) Net fiscal contribution from parastatals is increased by US$10 million annually.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

Revised PDO

6.       No revisions were made to the PDO.

Revised project outcome indicators and targets

7.    Two additional outcome indicators were added to the original three outcome indicators
during the processing of an additional financing in 2008. These new indicators were meant to
correct for the absence of outcome indicators for the access-to-finance dimensions of the project
as a whole, including for the original credit, which was already financing several activities on
access-to-finance, but with no related outcome indicators. Hence, these are not “outcome
indicators for the additional financing”, but for the whole project. These additional indicators
are:

       (iv)   Total domestic credit to the private sector increased to 4.8 percent of Gross Domestic
              Product (GDP) by 2011; and

       (v)    Total savings in the financial sector increased to 10.4 percent of GDP by 2011.


1
  The principal text of the PAD had two additional PDO indicators which, in the PAD’s Results Matrix in the annex,
were instead mentioned as output indicators, namely: (iv) Average number of days to create a company reduced
from three years to three months by the time of the midterm review; (v) Private sector participation in
GECAMINES, SNEL, SNCC, RVA, LAC, OCPT (renamed SCPT in 2010) achieved by the end of the project,
whether through public/private partnerships, fully private, management contract, or other arrangement.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.     The primary target group of the project included, inter alia: (i) Government ministries and
institutions, including the Justice and Mining ministries, the Congo Central Bank (BCC), the
Investment Promotion Agency (ANAPI), the Steering Committee for Public Enterprise Reforms
(COPIREP), and other agencies deemed critical to improving the investment climate and
championing/coordinating SOE reforms; (ii) selected SOEs with potential for serving as engines
of private sector-led growth which were targeted for reform; (iii) the retiring staff of some of
these SOEs whose departure the project would facilitate; and (v) microfinance institutions
because of their critical role in expanding financial inclusion for broad-based growth.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

9.    Component 1: Improving the Investment Climate. The project would: (i) help put in place
business dispute resolution mechanisms and facilitate the dissemination of legal information; (ii)
promote financial intermediation by strengthening BCC’s capacity, by facilitating the liquidation
of three defunct state-owned banks (Congolese Bank for External Trade – BCCE, African
Continental Bank – BCA, and New Bank of Kinshasa – NBK), and by facilitating DRC’s
membership into the African Trade Insurance (ATI) agency; (iii) build the capacity of the
Ministry of Mines to adequately implement the then new (2002) Mining Code; and (iv) facilitate
dialogue between the Government and the private sector.

10. Component 2: Implementing Parastatal Reform. The project would: (i) help set-up and/or
strengthen regulatory authorities in the telecommunication, transport and energy sectors 2; (ii)
facilitate Government’s divestiture from public enterprises in the telecommunication, transport,
energy, financial and mining sectors; and (iii) facilitate the staff severance process at
GECAMINES, SCPT, and the three defunct state-owned banks.

11. Component 3: Initiatives for Economic Development in Katanga Region. The project
would support: (i) workers departing from GECAMINES to undertake economically viable
activities through matching grants; (ii) technical assistance to help identify investment
opportunities and upgrade skills and capacity of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) around
an emerging private mining industry; and (iii) facilitate GECAMINES’ transfer of social services
to municipalities.

12. Component 4: Project Coordination and Implementation Arrangements. Initially, the
project was to be implemented by the Central Coordination Office (BCECO) and the Ministry of
Mines for mining related issues. However, once ready, the COPIREP would take over from
BCECO.

1.6 Revised Components


2
 The Post and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority had been established in 2002. The Transport Regulatory
Authority and the Electricity Regulatory Authority were yet to be created. The latter was only recently created in
January 2014, but the Transport Regulatory Authority had not been created by the time of the ICR. The Civil
Aviation Authority was established in June 2011.

                                                         3
13. As part of an Additional Financing, which was approved by the Board in 2008, activities
were added to Components 1 and 2 as follows.

   •   Component 1: Improving the Investment Climate. The principal activities added were: (i)
       supporting the growth of microfinance institutions (MFIs), and strengthening their
       oversight by BCC in order to promote SMEs; (ii) developing a National Payments
       System (NPS) to strengthen financial intermediation; and (iii) supporting the process of
       DRC’s adherence to the Organization for Harmonization of Business Laws in Africa
       (OHADA). It also supported some ongoing activities, such as continuing the work on
       simplification of business registration and licensing, and extending commercial courts
       countrywide (Matadi, Goma, Bukavu, Mbuji Mayi, and Kisangani).

   •   Component 2: Implementing SOE Reform. Funding was also provided to: (a) finance the
       SNCC stabilization contract and development of a concession plan; and (b) facilitate the
       SNCC staff severance process.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

14. Extension of Project Closing Date. There were a series of extensions of the project’s
closing date: from March 2010 to December 2012; then to June 2013 and finally to June 2014.
The first extension was to accommodate the scaling up discussed above. The other extensions
were to allow time to complete the implementation of the NPS and the Inspection Panel
Management Action Plan (discussed further under paragraph 24).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

i) Soundness of the background analysis supporting the project, lessons learned
incorporated, and the rationale for the Bank’s intervention

15. Soundness of Background Analysis. Broad-based public consultations on SOEs were held
in December 2000, and further consultations in September 2001. In addition, operational audits
of SOEs were carried out during the first half of 2002. All this served as a good basis for the
project’s formulation. However, to the extent that in-depth analysis of a large number of
enterprises with complex issues in a challenging post-conflict environment would take a
significant amount of financial resources and time, some of the more refined SOE studies and
audits were made part of the project and left to be carried out during implementation. The
downside to this otherwise pragmatic approach was that the team could not gauge adequately the
enormity of the task ahead, which led to unrealistic expectations regarding the time and effort
needed to return these moribund SOEs to profitability.

16. Incorporation of Lessons Learned. The project drew adequately from past experience, such
as: (i) maximizing buy-in through extensive consultations with civil society, trade unions,
government officials, etc.; (ii) coupling reform of pivotal SOEs such as utilities and those in
charge of transportation infrastructure with the broader investment climate reform agenda; and

                                              4
(iii) recognizing the impact of solving the issue of failed/failing state-owned banks on restoring
confidence in the banking sector.

17. Soundness of Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention. There was clearly a strong justification
for the World Bank to intervene, including the need for helping the Government to implement
critical reforms, some of which had been formulated with support from the World Bank through
an Institutional Development Fund grant and two emergency operations. This work had prepared
grounds for more robust private sector development support. In addition, the issue of salary
arrears among SOEs was becoming explosive, especially at GECAMINES, and if left
unattended, was likely to undermine the efforts of consolidating the still very fragile peace
process, and reforming these SOEs.

(ii) Assessment of the project design—objectives, components, and organization —
including its realism and the degree of complexity

18. The project’s objectives and components covered a broad array of areas with a coherent
internal logic, principally: stem the dizzying decline of the principal engines of economic growth
(power, transportation, telecommunication, mining, banking), while creating a business-friendly
environment conducive for private sector led growth, hence the pertinence and complementarity
of the Investment Climate and the SOE Reform components. Promoting economic activity in
Katanga was important for GECAMINES’ retrenchment program, and for preparing the local
communities to benefit from the expected growth in mining through better economic integration
with the mining sector. Regarding implementation, having a dedicated institution (COPIREP) to
champion the reforms and deal with the cross cutting issues such as divesture laws, labor issues,
SOE cross-debts etc. was a good design feature. However, the expectations on how much could
be achieved in restoring the SOEs under the project were set too high given that these enterprises
would require massive investment capital that the project wasn’t providing and whose other
likely sources (e.g. the private sector) were still very uncertain in the fragile political
environment that prevailed at the time.

iii) Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement, and/or participatory
processes

19. Government Commitment. In the lead up to, and during appraisal, the Government was
very engaged and took the lead in the reform process, including organizing the public
consultations referred to earlier, which were held under the aegis of the Presidency. In addition,
Government had passed a series of reforms and needed the Bank’s assistance for their
implementation. 3 It had also established COPIREP (October 2002) to coordinate and champion
SOE reforms and looked upon the project as a critical instrument in implementing these reforms.

20. Other stakeholders. Apart from Government, principal stakeholders included the trade
unions which were critical partners in the reform process and which were heavily consulted

3
 These included: (a) the law establishing commercial tribunals (July 2001); (b) a new Investment Code (February
2002); (c) the law on Savings and Credit Cooperatives to promote financial inclusion (February 2002); (d) a new
Central Bank charter strengthening its independence in setting monetary and foreign exchange policies (May 2002);
and (e) a new mining code in line with International Standards (July 2002), among others.

                                                        5
during the project’s preparation and implementation. Within the World Bank Group, the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) was a key partner, especially on investment climate
issues. This project was an example of a successful collaboration with IFC. Other stakeholders
included development partners, such as the German Credit Agency for Reconstruction (KfW),
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Capital Development Fund
(UNCDF), especially on access-to-finance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
African Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITEC) were critical partners on tax related
issues. There was also strong coordination with the United Nations peace keeping mission as
some parts of the country, especially in the East, were still insecure (and remained so throughout
most of the project’s implementation).

iv) Assessment of risks and mitigation measures

21. The PAD had noted: (i) the likelihood of Government’s reduced commitment to reforms
over time; (ii) potential for corruption and mismanagement with respect to SOE reforms; (iii)
external market risks, and (iv) potential controversy over layoffs at SOEs. The undulating
political climate became a major drag on the project, which the project’s mitigated by focusing
on technical issues during politically unfavorable times, while pushing for reforms whenever
political circumstances were more opportune. Financial mismanagement at the targeted SOEs
with respect to project funds did not occur. There were indeed external market shocks in
2008/2009 arising from the Global Financial Crisis and the mining sector in particular
experienced some setbacks. However, the crisis was short-lived, and economic activity quickly
rebounded. As feared, controversies over the reinsertion program did arise, and as noted in
Paragraph 24 below, significantly disrupted implementation since further compensatory
measures had to be undertaken and the project restructured to accommodate these new
developments.

2.2 Implementation

22. In a post conflict environment with very little capacity, the establishment of COPIREP in
October 2002, and later the establishment of the Steering Committee for Improving the
Investment and Business Climate (CPCAI) in August 2009, with input from IFC, greatly
facilitated project implementation, including serving as a bridge across constant changes in
Government composition. Also, DRC’s attaining of the completion point of the Highly Indebted
and Poor Countries initiative (HIPC) in July 2010, which resulted in cancellation of 83 percent of
its external debt (US$10.8 billion), created fiscal space for the country to stabilize the economy,
and sent a strong signal to investors about DRC’s growing fiscal viability, and hence a promising
investment destination.

23. However, there were also some strong headwinds, especially arising from the country’s
political fragility. The reform momentum of 2001/2002, when major strides had been made,
significantly waned during the era of the 2003-2006 power-sharing Government of former
belligerents, and only resumed in 2007/2008 after the November 2006 elections. Furthermore,
the tense atmosphere and street violence in 2011 triggered by disputes over the presidential
election outcome also negatively affected project implementation. The Bank’s Country Office
even temporarily relocated from Kinshasa to neighboring Brazzaville.

                                                6
24. In addition, some of the beneficiaries of the Voluntary Departure Program carried out at
GECAMINES lodged complaints with the Bank’s Inspection Panel in February and March, 2009
(see Annex 6 for details). Bank Management disputed the claims but agreed to support the
Government in undertaking a set of measures, including extending health care and education
benefits to the complainants. Addressing these issues diverted attention from project
implementation as the project had to be restructured to accommodate these unanticipated
expenditures, and the task team had to focus on the mitigation action plan for an extended period.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

25. M&E Design. The M&E’s broad sector indicators, such as FDI inflows were relevant
measures of improvements in the investment climate, just as SOE profitability was a good proxy
for improved SOEs’ technical and managerial efficiency that was being facilitated by the project.
However, from the Project perspective, it was difficult to determine how much of the changes in
some of these expected PDO outcomes (e.g. FDI) could be ascribed to the Project. In addition,
the project’s expected outcomes did not evolve in tandem with the evolution in the project’s
focus. Over time, the project’s scope shifted from focusing on individual SOE-specific
interventions which were progressively being relegated to the emerging sector-specific
operations, to creating an enabling environment for SOE reforms more generally, such as the
divestiture framework, cross-debt resolution, etc. Hence, the project’s role evolved into one of
stabilizing SOE operations as sector-specific operations drove them to profitability, including
undertaking major rehabilitation. However, the project’s expected outcomes were not
recalibrated in order to circumscribe them to the activities for which the project, in its new
configuration, was responsible.

26. M&E Implementation, Utilization, and Sustainability. After initial difficulties, the
implementing agencies adequately implemented the M&E system although timely SOE data still
remains a challenge. The data generated by the M&E system is relevant to the respective
institutions (CPCAI and COPIREP) which heavily rely on it to gauge progress of the reforms
they are championing. The M&E System is embedded in these permanent institutions whose
functions will continue beyond the project, thus ensuring its sustainability.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance

27. Environment. At appraisal, the project’s environmental status was rated as Category B.
Environmental issues were mostly related to ensuring proper waste disposal in the enterprises
targeted for reforms. An environmental audit was carried out for GECAMINES, which resulted
in recommendations for improving its environmental compliance. A similar study at Somika, a
private mining company, made a number of recommendations including the need for closely
monitoring the quality of underground water which supplies Lubumbashi. More generally, it was




                                                7
determined during the course of the project’s implementation that the emerging sectoral projects
were better placed to deal with the environment issues in their respective sectors 4.

28. Social. The project’s social aspects principally revolved around assisting some of the
enterprises targeted for reform in paying terminal benefits for departing employees. The project
facilitated this process at GECAMINES (10,654 individuals), SNCC (3,886 individuals), SCPT
(4,950 individuals), and at the three defunct state-owned banks, BCA, BCCE, and NBK (3,480
individuals). This program was accompanied by training for the departing staff in different
livelihoods to facilitate their smooth transition into their new life. As indicated earlier, some
retirees petitioned the Inspection Panel, and while Bank Management disputed the grounds of the
petition, the Bank financed Government’s provision of health benefits to 22,155 individuals and
education benefits to 11,500 children (see Annex 6).

Fiduciary Compliance

29. Financial Management. The migration of the project’s financial management function
from BCECO to COPIREP was completed in 2006. Transition issues were largely related to the
initial absence of an internal audit manual at COPIREP, inadequate utilization of the TOMPRO
accounting software, delays in payment of invoices, and weaknesses in the analysis of the
variances between budgeted and actual expenditures. For a time, the accounting system was not
properly organized and financial information not readily available. There was also one case of
ineligible expenditures, which was resolved. By project’s end, the system was running smoothly
and financial management was consistently rated as satisfactory.

30. Procurement. Procurement performance was generally satisfactory. There were occasional
instances of procurement delays and stale transactions in Procys which were resolved by
strengthening COPIREP’s procurement unit. A challenge in December 2013 by one of the two
bidders for the NPS led to this task not being completed under the project. It will be completed
under another project to which it has been transferred.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31. Investment climate reforms will continue to be championed and coordinated by CPCAI,
ANAPI, and the proposed Special Economic Zones Regulatory Authority which is their
institutional mandate. Similarly, SOE reforms will continue to be championed and coordinated
by COPIREP. Policy dialogue and accompanying investments, as applicable, will be carried out
in the context of the relevant sectoral projects in the World Bank’s portfolio in DRC. This
includes: (i) The Financial Infrastructure and Markets Project (business climate/access-to-finance
issues, completing the NPS); (ii) The Growth with Governance in the Mining Sector Project
(mining sector issues); (iii) The Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development Project,
and The Southern African Power Market Project (energy sector issues); (iv) The Multi-Modal
Transport Project (transport sector issues), and (v) The Central African Backbone Project
(telecommunications issues). In addition, Special Economic Zone support will be implemented

4
 These Bank-funded projects include: The Growth with Governance in the Mining Sector Project, The Regional and
Domestic Power Markets Development Project, The Southern African Power Market Project, and The Multi-Modal
Transport Project.

will be undertaken under the proposed DRC Investment Climate Program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Overall Rating: High

32. Relevance of Objective. This is rated high. The project’s development objective (both for
the original credit and the additional financing), namely: “to increase the competitiveness of the
economy, thereby contribute to economic growth” remains relevant. It is consistent with the
Bank’s FY13-FY16 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), especially Strategic Objective Two,
which seeks to “boost competitiveness to accelerate private-sector-led growth and job creation”,
and to the Government’s 2011 Poverty Reduction Strategy which, among other things,
emphasizes “private-sector-led growth”.

33. Relevance of the Design. This is rated high. The choice of the three components remains
valid. Improving the investment climate (including the activities added under the additional
financing) and enhancing the performance of critical transport infrastructure, utilities, and
telecommunications was critical for attaining the project’s objectives. In addition, stimulating
economic development in the Katanga Region was needed for successful integration of the staff
expected to be laid off at GECAMINES into gainful employment. Equally importantly, it was
critical that the regional economy increasingly integrate with, and be prepared to tap into, the
expected growth in the mining sector. This is considered good practice in extractive industries.

34. Relevance of Implementation. This is rated Substantial. The project’s approach, especially
as it evolved during implementation is particularly pertinent, namely focussing on cross cutting
issues such as the divesture framework, debt resolution, and the question of overstaffing/salary
arrears, while the emerging sectoral programs dealt with sector policy issues and capital
investments. However, the project should have been restructured to reflect this new focus,
especially with respect to the M&E framework to strengthen attribution. Implementation through
dedicated institutions (COPIREP and CPCAI) was particularly suitable for a post-conflict/in-
conflict country like DRC at the time. This allowed for better handling of cross-cutting issues
and ensuring continuity amidst frequent changes in Government.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

35. Improving the Investment Climate. Progress towards improving the investment climate
is rated Satisfactory. Major accomplishments were realized in creating a more business friendly
environment, and increasing access to finance.

36. Contributing to a more secure and business friendly environment. Several measures were
facilitated, including: (i) rendering seven commercial courts operational, which now handle an

                                                9
average of 460 cases per year; (ii) supporting DRC’s adherence to the New York Convention on
International Arbitration for added reassurance, especially to foreign investors; (iii) supporting
DRC’s membership in ATI, where insurance coverage for DRC investors now stands at US$361
million and growing; (iv) supporting DRC’s membership in OHADA which ensures a secure
commercial environment
through harmonized and
modern business laws
among the seventeen
regional members; (v)
installing a computerized
system         for        the
management of mining
titles (SIGTIM), and carrying out an organizational and financial audit of the Mining Cadaster as
part of its restructuring and strengthening; and (vi) cutting down bureaucratic delays, such as
reducing the time for business registration from 155 days in 2009 to 3 days by 2014 5. Together
with the growing peace in the country, these measures were expected to contribute to easing
investor concerns, including foreign investors. Even though the degree of attribution cannot be
ascertained with precision, these measures are presumed to have contributed to the recent growth
in FDI. Initially, most of the DFI was for the service sector, such as telecoms, construction and
hotels, financial institutions, transportation, and others. However, industry, which includes the
mining sector, is increasingly becoming a major component.

37. Contributing to increasing access to finance. The liquidation of three defunct state-owned
banks, which were deemed to be undermining confidence in the banking sector, was completed
as planned. Similarly, the planned activities for strengthening BCC’s oversight capability were
duly implemented. In addition, support was provided for setting up an electronic credit reference
bureau,         and
strengthening the
registry         for
movable collateral.
The      expectation
was      that   this
process       would
trigger          the
emergence of a more vibrant private financial sector that is better supervised by BCC. The
financial sector has indeed grown as hoped, with the percentage of commercial bank assets
growing from 5.1 percent in 2003, to 19 percent as of end June 2013. Credit has been growing
fast, having more than tripled between 2006 and 2013. Unfortunately, installing the NPS could
not be completed. The project supported the creation of a comprehensive design, long-term
strategy and detailed specifications of the system’s hardware and software, as well as the
architectural designs for the physical facilities to house the system. Installation will be completed
by another project.


5
 DRC is rated by Doing Business 2015 among the 10 economies in the world that improved the most across 3 or
more areas measured in 2013/14. DRC was particularly recognized for significant improvements in ease of starting a
business, getting credit, protecting minority interests, getting electricity, and paying taxes.

                                                       10
38. Regarding MFIs, the project strengthened BCC’s supervisory capability through training
and logistical support. The Accounting Plan for Savings and Loan Cooperatives and
Microfinance Institutions deployed in 2012 further helped strengthen the industry. As hoped, the
Central Bank is beginning to enforce actively discipline in the industry. For instance, by end-
March 2013, 37 largely inactive institutions were put under involuntary liquidation status (34
COOPECs and 3 MFIs) and, by end August 2013, 63 licenses had been withdrawn. While the
industry is still weak, with only two institutions being operationally self-sufficient by June 2013,
its growing discipline is contributing to its popularity. From 100,000 clients in 2006, the
clientele has now surpassed 1 million. The project also directly supported training of selected
MFIs through the Fund for the Promotion of Microfinance (FPM). In addition, US$ 3.5 million
was passed on to the FPM to on-lend to qualifying MFIs reaching approximately 7,000 clients
per cycle, with an average loan size of US$ 500. This is a typical loan size in the DRC
microfinance industry.

39. Implementing SOE Reforms. Progress on improving the performance of SOEs in the
mining, telecoms, financial, transport, and energy sectors is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
Significant progress was made on several measures, with varying degrees of success. The major
SOEs targeted for reforms were overstaffed, poorly managed, and hemorrhaging cash (average
ROA of -21 percent). The project’s immediate focus was, therefore, to stabilize their operations
with the expectation that over time, and with the support of the emerging sector projects, they
would become investment-grade companies able to attract private capital. In this regard, a series
of measures to stabilize their finances was undertaken including: (i) staff reductions; (ii) partial
debt-resolution; (iii) executing management contracts; and (iv) promulgating a new divestiture
framework to permit private sector involvement.

40. Reducing Staff at Some of the SOEs. Regarding GECAMINES, its staff was reduced from
22,994 in 2003/2004 (133 percent of turnover) to 12,340 (71 percent of turnover) saving the
company from bankruptcy. This gave it breathing space to regroup, and although it still has some
financial difficulties, it has reduced its salary arrears from 31 months to 3 months, and its staff
costs are now down to 30 percent of turnover (2012). With respect to SNCC, 3,886 were retired,
bringing the percentage of the labor-force relative to turnover from 115 percent to 91 percent.
This was the first phase, with the second phase later financed by the Multi-Modal Transport
Project. However, as indicated further below, SNCC remains in a precarious condition because
of repeated strikes and loss of mining clients.

41. SCPT’s staff was reduced from 4,496 (140 percent of turnover) to 1,672 (51 percent of
turnover). However it did not take advantage of this break to restructure its operations due to a
prolonged debate over splitting postal from telecommunications activities. In addition, the
telecommunication industry was undergoing a profound transformation with the advent of
mobile telephony. SCPT’s telephone business was based on fixed-lines, a service that had
virtually collapsed, whereas market penetration of private mobile operators, now around 44
percent, was rapidly filling the void. SCPT now relies on expedited mail service for 94% of its
revenue, which is not enough to pay its employees. Salary arrears date back several years.
Managing the Government’s newly laid fibre optic cables seems to be giving SCPT a reprieve
(albeit inadequate for solving its immense financial difficulties), until the Government decides
who should manage them.

                                                11
42. Executing Management Contracts. Management contracts were executed at GECAMINES,
RVA, SCTP/ONATRA, and SNCC. The specific activities carried out varied from enterprise to
enterprise, ranging from greater financial controls, to better stock management, to human
resource management. These SOEs had long lost a results-oriented culture.

•   GECAMINES: The company had hit bottom by 2002, and its turnover was experiencing
    modest recovery, although its deficits were still on the
    rise, thus hampering sustained recovery. The
    intervention focused primarily on financial control
    and management of partnerships with other mining
    companies, which brought some stability to its
    finances. To accelerate the recovery, however, the
    company still needs to retire about 6,000 workers, for
    which it needs US$121 million (according to its own estimates), and is actively seeking
    private capital. It remains unresolved what to do about the company’s non-core activities. 6

•   RVA: Like GECAMINES, the fall in its business
    turnover was bottoming-out, but poor financial
    and human resource management were
    undercutting prospects for profitability. The
    intervention focused on tighter financial control
    and increasing revenue. RVA is almost breaking
    even (ROA of -1.1 percent in 2012).

•   SCTP/ONATRA: Profitability had been severely hampered by poor port operations and
    financial management which were the areas of focus for the stabilization intervention. SCTP
    is also almost breaking even (2012 ROA of -0.9 percent).

•   SNCC: In the period preceding the stabilization intervention, SNCC business turnover was
    declining at about 6.5 percent per year. With the
    stabilization contract, the decline was halted through
    financial controls and improving maintenance to attract
    business. However, a series of labor strikes and slow
    rehabilitation of infrastructure have led to the loss of
    SNCC’s mining clients to road transporters, leading to stagnation in business turnover and
    severe cash-flow constraints.

43. Promulgating Divestiture Laws. One of the project’s principal accomplishments was
assisting Government in the preparation and eventual adoption of the laws allowing the state to
divest from its enterprises and ensure that those that stay in its portfolio behave as commercial
businesses. Promulgating divesture laws in July 2008 paved the way for reconstituting SOEs as

6
 GECAMINES operates six hospitals (1,320 beds), 6 clinics, 26 health centers, and 17 health service outlets. It also
operates 111 schools (953 class rooms) with about 41,000 students. These facilities also service the general public. It
also operates 7,600 ha of agricultural activities, and processes 700 tons of flour per day and other products (cooking
oil, etc.).

                                                          12
commercial entities, operating on the basis of modern commercial principals, and not as
Government departments. All steps for transformation have been completed for GECAMINES,
SNCC, and ONATRA including debt restructuring, asset ownership confirmation, and new
balance sheets. The process is ongoing for REGIDESO, SNEL, and RVA. The process at SCPT
will be supported under a sector project.

44. Partial Debt Resolution. By Decree Number 12/031 of October 2012, the Government
provided a framework for resolving SOE financial obligations (as audited for the year ending on
December 31, 2011) that were deemed to be beyond SOEs’ capacity to meet. These obligations,
which amounted to about US$ 3.5 billion as at December 31, 201, included commercial debts,
salary arrears (about US$ 800 million), tax obligations, enterprise-to-enterprise debts, and others.
Some of these obligations will be cancelled outright and others converted into equity. This major
exercise was another important milestone in the SOE restructuring process. However, there are
still residual obligations, especially salary arears, that will still need to be worked out.

45. A combination of the above measures has significantly reduced the losses at the targeted
SOEs by 18 percent, from -21 percent at appraisal to -3 percent by end 2012, against a target of
+2 percent at appraisal 7. Only SNEL registered a modest profit. Considering the continued
weakness in most of the portfolio, and in view of the ongoing restructuring exercise referred to
above, most of the companies are not yet in a position to pay taxes or dividends to Government.
In 2012, for instance, total contributions to the Government budget by SOEs, which amounted to
about US$ 300 million, was largely from GECAMINES (84%) in the form of joint-venture
signing bonuses and other related charges.

46. Finally, the project supported important studies which provided the analytical foundation
for sector policy dialogue and capital investments that followed under sector programs at SNEL,
SNCC, REGIDESO, GECAMINES, RVA, and SCTP/ONATRA. 8 These sector programs will
continue the SOEs reforms.

47. Improving Economic Competiveness in Katanga Region. This objective was partially
achieved. The project’s duo objective was to assist GECAMINES voluntary retirees with
economically viable projects through matching grants on the one hand, while carrying out
activities to stimulate economy-wide business activity in the region on the other. However, only
reinsertion activities were fully executed, including supporting 231 micro-projects involving
3,289 individuals. Seventy-nine associations of voluntary departures involved in agricultural
projects in the Lubumbashi, Likasi, and Kolwezi basin benefited from training by agricultural
consultants. In addition, studies on the restructuring of GECAMINES’ medical network and

7
  According to 2012 figures, the most recent available, ROAs were are follows: GECAMINES -5.0%; REGIDESO -
3.1%; RVA -1.1%; SNEL 0.9%; SNCC -6.9%; SCTP/ONATRA -0.9%; and SCPT -5.4%. City Train and LAC are
defunct, nor was much done about them during the project.

  Energy Sector: (1) The World Bank, through two projects – Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development
Project, and the Southern African Power Market Project, has committed US$ 1.1 billion; (ii) The European
Investment Bank has committed US$151.8 million; (iii) The African Development Bank has committed
US$156.put8 million; and (iv) Private companies have committed US$535 million. (2) Water Sector: The World
Bank, through the Urban Water Supply Project as committed US$ 190 million; (3) Airport Infrastructure: The World
Bank has committed US$ 9.3 million; the African Development Bank US$ 159.7 million; EXIM Bank of China
US$ 60 million.

                                                      13
schools were carried out. Given the care needed in handling such a transfer, it was decided that
this would be handled in another phase of GECAMINES restructuring. Support to local SMEs
was not carried out as virtually funds were used on the first objective.

3.3 Efficiency

Overall Rating: Substantial

48. On the whole, the project was implemented efficiently. The project management costs
were only 7.4 percent of the total project cost, which is comparable to similar projects, especially
given its level of complexity, and were lower than appraisal estimates (84 percent). The project
management team had highly competent members who often times carried out the required
analysis in-house, at a time when foreign expertise attached a high risk premium to their services
because of DRC’s prevailing political fragility. The local team had the added advantage of local
knowledge in a highly complex environment. On the World Bank side, project performance
improved significantly after 2007 when task team leaders were field-based. This made daily
trouble-shooting possible, further amplifying project implementation effectiveness and project
efficiency.

49. Several services have become faster and cheaper, as processes became more efficient, such
as: (i) obtaining a construction permit, which used to take 117 days, at a cost of US$ 3,149 now
takes 30 days at a cost of US$ 1,602; (ii) creating a business which needed 11 procedures and
took 155 days at a cost of US$ 440 minimum, is now down to 3 procedures, 3 days with a cost of
US$ 170; (iii) the export process that took 44 days and cost US$ 3,155 per container, now takes
13 days and US$ 1,930. There are also signs that service delivery at some SOEs is beginning to
improve. The time for getting electricity service connected has been reduced by 17 percent, and
the cost has been reduced by 31 percent.

50. As discussed in Paragraph 25, some of the project impact is more difficult to isolate with a
reasonable degree of certainty as the project’s monitoring and evaluation system did not allow
for the precise attribution of the various sector outcomes to project activities. This is particularly
the case with certain investment climate outcomes such as growth in FDI, where the project’s
contribution was significant, and where the mildest of assumptions point to the project’s
potentially high economic impact. For instance, assuming a 5 percent project attribution for the
growth in the copper industry translates into an incremental gross value of US$ 350 million of
the copper produced in 2013 alone. However, in the absence of a credible methodology to
ascribe cause and effect, a more accurate economic analysis cannot be carried out. Regarding the
initiatives for increasing competitiveness in Katanga region, the activities were of very limited
scope relative to the overall project (3.7 percent of final project costs), and no reliable data was
available to assess their economic impact.

51. Rather, the economic analysis focused on the impact of the project’s stabilization efforts in
selected SOEs, which could be reasonably assessed. Economic benefits principally derived from
losses prevented by the project. Specifically, the rate of financial hemorrhage was decelerated, or
even halted due to improvements in financial management and control at a number of SOEs. As
a result, average ROA increased by 18 percentage points, from -21 percent to -3 percent. On the

                                                 14
basis of loss prevented, the ERR for the SOE reform component (which constituted 53 percent of
project costs) was re-estimated at 22 percent, which was comparable to the 19 percent computed
at appraisal (see Annex 3 for details).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52. The project’s objectives, design, and implementation remain highly relevant. In addition,
the difficulties of discerning attribution notwithstanding, the project’s unrelenting efforts in a
very tough and fragile environment have contributed to appreciable improvements in the
business climate with growing investor security. Access to credit, including within the
microfinance market segment, also improved as a result of the additional financing.
Unfortunately, installing the NPS under the additional financing could not be completed.
Regarding SOEs, the project laid a strong legal foundation for their reform, and the financial
position of several of them – while still mostly in the red – has registered appreciable
improvement. Their successful turnaround will require continued strengthening of management,
resolving residual financial obligations, and accelerating ongoing capital investment programs.
Katanga region activities, which ultimately focussed almost exclusively on resettling
GECAMINES workers, was generally successful, despite issues associated with the Inspection
Panel requests. The efficiency of implementing both the original credit and the additional
financing was substantial. The overall rating is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

53. Poverty Impact. Tracking the project’s impact on poverty was not part of the M&E design.
However, several project activities had an impact on poverty reduction. For instance, the project
contributed to the growth in the microfinance industry from 100,000 clients in 2007 to over
1,000,000 clients in 2013. Similarly, it facilitated the reinsertion of over 20,000 SOE retirees,
including meeting medical needs for 22,155 individuals and meeting education expenses for
11,500 children.

54. Gender. At its conception, the project did not have specific gender targets. However, some
of the project activities did have a gender impact. For instance, approximately 38% of the
microfinance sector clients are women. In addition, progress was made on amending the Family
Law to make it easier for women to register businesses, and open bank accounts. This bill is
awaiting approval in the second house of the National Assembly.



                                                                15
55. Social Development. As indicated above, the project met the cost of terminal benefits and
facilitated the reinsertion of several thousand individuals, including meeting their health and
education needs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

56. The project supported various institutional strengthening activities including: BCC to
reinforce its oversight capabilities; a number of MFIs to expand financial inclusion; ANAPI and
CPCAI which champion and coordinate improvements in the country’s investment climate; and
the judiciary, particularly regarding arbitration institutions and commercial courts. With respect
to SOE reforms, the project strengthened COPIREP’s capacity to champion public enterprise
reforms, and stabilized the operations of various institutions including GECAMINES, SNCC,
RVA, SCTP (former ONATRA). It also strengthened the capacity of the Post and
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

57. One of the unintended outcomes from the project is the increased experience gained from
the Inspection Panel case on how to conduct retrenchment programs. Drawing from this
experience, some of the key elements to consider in designing Bank-financed retrenchment
programs include: (i) ensuring that the reinsertion activities are ready to be launched at the time
of starting the retrenchment process; (ii) the use of rapid surveys to track poverty patterns and
social impact immediately after retrenchment and up to five years after if possible; (iii) ensuring
that these rapid surveys also help identifying alternative reinsertion mechanisms during the life
of the project; (iv) considering the provision of payments in tranches, creating partnerships with
financial institutions, providing training on money management, etc.; and (v) allowing flexibility
in the design of reinsertion activities to adapt to rapid changes in the economic environment.
Subsequent programs, one REGIDESO and another at SNCC drew heavily from this experience
and went smoothly.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58. A stakeholder workshop was held in Kinshasa in June 2014 to discuss the pertinence of the
project’s objectives, implementation performance, project outcomes, and lessons learned. It was
attended by Government officials (including a number of Government ministers), representatives
from SOEs, the private sector, and civil society. There was great appreciation for the project’s
outcomes, especially the significant improvements in the investment climate. The project’s role
in stabilizing the SOEs and preparing them for further transformation was greatly commended.
Participants called upon Government authorities to capitalize on these achievements by
completing the remaining reforms including social debt resolution, and completing the ongoing
capital investment programs, especially in critical areas such as power and transportation
infrastructure.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

                                                16
59. On the investment climate, the Government is determined to continue simplifying
regulations and processes. Although Government was slow to implement investment climate
reforms because of the fragile political environment that characterized most of the project
implementation period, it has been consistently on the reform path since 2001/2002 when most
of the enabling legislation was passed as indicated in Paragraph 19. Over a decade later, there
have been no debates on, or attempts at, policy reversal. Similarly, on the SOE reforms, the legal
framework for their transformation into commercial entities is firmly in place. However, the
transformation process, like previous other reforms, has been slow, partly because of the
complexity of the issues (debt resolution) and partly because of the country’s frequent ebb-and-
flow political tides, which undermine the sustenance of a reform momentum. As a result, major
policy decisions remain outstanding for extended periods of time, hence the moderate rating.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60. On the positive side, the Bank carried out significant preparatory work, and held extensive
consultations with various stakeholders, which informed the architecture of the project, and
strengthened the buy-in from the various stakeholders. The Bank also clearly tapped into lessons
from past experience. The project, which was prepared over a period of 11 months, had a broad
range of expertise that adequately reflected the project’s diverse set of activities. However, the
Bank could have been more selective by restricting its SOE-specific interventions to a few truly
transformative SOEs while focusing on the broader cross-cutting issues. On the SOE reforms, it
was overly optimistic about turning their performance around in such a short time, especially
given their immense capital investment needs, the non-commercial habits that prevailed among
these SOEs, the weak capacity, and a politically fragile environment.

Quality of supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

61. The team’s satisfactory performance derives from, among other things: (i) demonstrating
flexibility and resilience in a very fragile environment by constantly searching for opportunities
where success was possible, including focussing on technical work during politically low
moments, and pushing for major legislation at opportune moments; (ii) forging exemplary
strategic partnerships with other development partners, IFC, and other World Bank project teams
(especially mining, telecommunications, energy, transport, water); and (iii) undertaking regular
implementation support missions with a broad range of expertise (in joint or separate missions)
with clear action plans in the aide-memoires; and (iv) Task Team Leaders taking up residence in
Kinshasa to offer day-to-day implementation support. Dialogue with the authorities was also
bolstered by the Country Director’s residence in Kinshasa starting in early 2008. As indicated

                                               17
earlier, one area where the team could have done more would have been to restructure the project
to reflect its evolving focus over time, including circumscribing the project’s scope on SOE
reforms and the expected outcomes to better reflect its new focus.

5.2 Recipient Performance

Government performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62. In multiple instances, Government exhibited strong performance in ensuring that the
project met its objectives. For instance, in the lead up to project appraisal, the Government
undertook a series of major reforms aimed at improving the investment climate and promoting
financial inclusion. In addition, during project implementation, a number of measures were
undertaken with profound implications for DRC’s investment climate, ranging from significantly
cutting red tape for businesses, to joining OHADA, to adhering to the New York Convention, to
passing sweeping SOE divestiture laws, etc. Often times, Government had to overcome strong
headwinds from some segments of society who saw joining OHADA or adhering to the New
York Convention as a major infringement on their national sovereignty. A blemish on this strong
record is the amount of time it took to carry out these measures. While at times the pace was
dictated by the imperatives to build the needed consensus, at other times in was a result of the
undulating episodes of political fragility that characterized the project’s long implementation
period: a weak transitional coalition government in 2003-2006, the election time interruptions of
2010/2011, and a Government that was only in an “acting capacity” for the project’s last six
months of implementation.

Implementing agency or agencies performance

Rating: Satisfactory

63. COPIREP and CPCAI worked hard to carry out the needed analytical work, draft the
needed legislation, and diligently follow-up on their passage in Parliament, all of this in a
politically fragile environment with weak governments. They had to overcome vested interests
among those whose powers and privileges were threatened by the reforms. They worked hard to
get the best technical assistance possible, at a time when a significant number of external service
providers were leery about DRC’s security situation. COPIREP handled a large volume of
transactions: 895 service contracts, 206 contracts for goods, and 68 contracts for works. CPCAI’s
diligent work has earned DRC the recognition of being one of the leading investment climate
reformers in the 2015 Doing Business Report.

Justification of rating for overall recipient performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64. The implementing agencies did a phenomenal job just as Government made major strides
on investment climate reforms and in laying the legal framework for SOE transformation.

                                                18
However, the reform process was slow, and there is still a significant amount of work to do on
SOE transformation, hence the overall “Moderately Satisfactory” rating.

6. Lessons Learned

65. Monitoring and Evaluation Systems should be constantly revisited for continued
pertinence. The project’s M&E was too broad, making it difficult to attribute the expected
outcomes to project activities. Corrective action could have been undertaken during project
implementation. In addition, it is important to build into the project other forms of data
gathering, such as surveys to provide information that cannot be obtained through routine
monitoring and reporting processes.

66. In a fragile environment, it is important to moderate expectations in project design. Post-
conflict environments are characterized by weak implementation capacity, political inertia, and
powerful vested interests, hence the need to moderate expectations and aim for simplicity, with
possibilities for scaling up as opportunities arise.

67. Flexibility at project and country program level is critical in post-conflict situations.
Because of many unknown factors in a post-conflict setting, it is important to allow for greater
flexibility within the project and across the Country Program as a whole to more effectively take
advantage of opportunities as they arise.

68. It is important to pair SOE reforms with pension reforms as part of the Country Program,
especially where staff reductions are a significant element. The absence of a functional pension
system seems to have, in part, motivated the Inspection Panel case lodged by some retirees. More
detail of the important lessons derived from this experience are in Annex 6.

69. Credible permanent institutions in a volatile environment are critical in championing
reforms. Fragile states emerging out of conflict are often characterized by weak governments
and/or frequent changes in Government composition. Having credible institutions (such as
COPIREP, BECECO, CPCAI) as islands of stability and continuity allows for championing
reforms among various administrations.

70. Field Team Leadership is important in fragile environments. Because of weak capacity in
fragile settings, there is need for an interactive, day-today approach to project implementation
support. Project implementation improved significantly when task team leaders became field-
based, starting in September 2007

71. IFC offered good guidance on how to do justice in the ICR write-up to the exemplary
partnership that prevailed during the project’s implementation, which have been integrated into
the document. They related to collaboration on OHADA, HIPC, Special Economic Zones, and
Doing Business reforms among others.

1.      Due to delays in execution, about $8 million from the IDA Grant will be canceled and
transferred to the new Bank financed project (Financial Infrastructure and Markets Project),
which will take-over the implementation of the National Payments System. An undisbursed
amount of US$ 2.85 million from the Special Account relating to the IDA Credit has been
reimbursed to the World Bank (the transaction is complete). However, COPIREP is still working
with the World Bank on the resolution of Bank service charges of approximately US$20,000.
This issue was still outstanding by the time of the ICR. Government’s contribution mostly
related to the management contract for SCTP in the amount of US$ 6.15 million, and the
management contract for RVA in the amount of US$ 4.30 million.

                                Annex 2: Outputs by Component

1.      The Project had four components: (i) Improving the Investment Climate; (ii)
Implementing Parastatal Reform; (iii) Initiatives for Economic Development in Katanga Region;
and (iv) Project Coordination and Implementation Arrangements.

Component 1: Improving the Investment Climate

2.      Under this component, the project implemented a series of measures aimed at improving
the investment climate, especially measures pertaining to: (1) strengthening the judicial system
and improving the legal and fiscal framework; (2) facilitating financial intermediation; (3)
contributing to improving the capacity of the Ministry of Mines; and (4) facilitating Public-
Private Sector dialogue.

Subcomponent 1: Strengthening the Judicial System and Improving the Legal and Fiscal
Framework.

3.      The project successfully implemented the activities envisaged under this sub-component,
namely: (i) rehabilitating, equipping (including setting up archiving systems), and training the
staff of, the General Inspection of Judiciary Services, the Kinshasa/Gombe Appeals Court, and
the High Court; (ii) rehabilitating and facilitating the operations of two private arbitration centers
(CAC and CENACOM); and (iii) rehabilitating and equipping 7 commercial tribunals. With
support both the World Bank and IFC, DRC promulgated on June 26, 2013 the Law No. 13/023
to join the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards signed
in New York, on June 10th, 1958.

4.      In July 2012, after advocacy efforts from both the World Bank and IFC, the Government
formally joined OHADA, an organization of 17 member states, whose goal is to facilitate and
encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states and ensure a secure
commercial environment through harmonized and modern business laws. OHADA members
agree to adopt a common set of commercial laws – including contract, company and bankruptcy
laws – and to submit interpretation of those laws to the final jurisdiction of the OHADA court,
which sits in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. Apart from assisting with drafting the OHADA
adhesion laws and facilitating the establishment of the OHADA National Commission, the
project also supported related training for lawyers, clerks, and bailiffs, and the distribution of
documents on harmonizing DRC’s laws with OHADA.

5.      Payment of taxes was greatly facilitated by, among other things: the unification of the
filing deadlines; simplification of the tax form; and reducing the corporate tax rate. The project
also supported staff training for the Ministry of Mines and the Ministry of finance on procedures
for collecting fiscal revenue under the new mining code. In addition, it supported the General
Directorate for Customs and Excise (DGDA) in setting up the Single Window at Matadi.




                                                 22
Subcomponent 2: Facilitating Financial Intermediation

6.       Capacity Building for BCC. The project supported strengthening financial sector
oversight regulations, and the introduction of regulations for secured transactions (specifically,
providing legal definition of movable collateral). The Project strengthened BCC’s capacity to
oversee the microfinance industry including the provision of equipment (vehicles, computers),
staff training, and dissemination of Charts of Accounts and legal texts for Savings and Credit
organizations and other microfinance institutions.

7.     Technical assistance for liquidating failed state-owned banks. The project supported
technical assistance for the liquidation of three defunct state-owned banks, including verifying
those who were eligible, and the amounts due. All concerned were identified and paid.

8.     Facilitating DRC’s membership in ATI. The project provided funds ($100,000) for
DRC’s participation in the ATI arrangement. So far, insurance coverage of DRC investors under
ATI is US$361 million and growing.

9.      National Payments Systems (NPS). The NPS was added to the project as part of the
Additional Financing in 2008. The project supported the production of a comprehensive design
of a long term strategy and detailed specifications of the system’s hardware and software, as well
as the architectural designs for the physical facilities to house the system. However, progress was
slow due to the lengthy process of consensus-building among the public and the private
stakeholders after decades of mistrust. This was compounded by the absence of a strategy for the
conduct of monetary policy in an environment dominated by the use of foreign currency rather
than local, and starting from scratch as far as a vision for financial integration across the country,
as well as regionally, was concerned. Furthermore, a challenge by one of the bidders added to the
delays, and the task could, therefore, not be completed under the project. It will be completed
under the new Financial Infrastructure and Markets Project, which was approved in March 2014.

10.     Microfinance. The project supported microfinance institutions through FPM. FPM was
originally created as an activity within a UNDP-financed project in 2007 but has since evolved
into an autonomous wholesale lender to MFIs. The project provided funds for on-lending to
MFIs. It also supported capacity building for selected MFIs. Other participating development
partners included KfW, Swiss Cooperation, German Cooperation, UNCDF, and Belgian
Cooperation.

Subcomponent 3: Building the Capacity of the Ministry of Mines

11.     The Project implemented a series of activities, including: (i) disseminating the new
mining code and its regulations; (ii) putting in place and financing the activities of the
Commission for Validating Rights to Mines and Quarries; and (iii) providing logistical support
to the provincial mining administrations (Maniema, Sud-Kivu, Equateur, Province Orientale, and
Kasai-Oriental). The project supported the installation of a computerized system for the
management of mining titles (SIGTIM), and carried out an organizational and financial audit of
the Mining Cadaster as part of its restructuring and strengthening



                                                 23
Subcomponent 4: Facilitating the dialogue between the Government and the Private Sector

12.     The Project supported a number of activities including: (i) the National Economic Forum
held in December 2004; (ii) a study on administrative barriers to investments (carried out by
IFC); (iii) simplification of regulations for zoning, granting construction permits, and property
transfer; and (iv) the creation of special economic zones, including financing the operating costs
(for three years) of that project’s steering committee.

13.     The project facilitated the operations of the National Agency for Investment Promotion
(ANAPI) and the Steering Committee for Improving the Business and Investment Climate
(CPCAI) by providing operating costs. CPCAI was set up by the Government in August 2009,
after advocacy efforts from both the World Bank and IFC, to identify constraints to investors,
propose the needed reforms, and accelerate and monitor their implementation. In parallel, IFC
delivered an assessment of ANAPI’s performance.

14.     In November 2012, the Government created a One-Stop-Shop (“Guichet Unique”) for the
creation of enterprises. It was formally launched in April of 2013. Since its launch, there has
been significant improvement in the business climate including: (a) a reduction in the number of
procedures to create an enterprise from 11 to 3; and (b) a reduction in the number days to register
an enterprise from 31 to 3, at a cost of US$170 (77% of GDP) instead of US$ 440 (200% of
GDP) previously.

Component 2: Implementing the Parastatal Reform

15.     Principal activities supported under this component consisted of: (i) creating a regulatory
framework; (ii) facilitating divestiture from public enterprises; and (iii) supporting the social cost
of the reforms.

Subcomponent 1: Creating a regulatory framework

16.     Creating/Strengthening Regulatory Institutions. The project supported: (i) the Ministry of
Posts, Telephones, and Telecommunications and the Authority for Regulation of Posts and
Telecommunications in elaborating a sector policy document for telecommunications; (ii) the
Ministry Energy in elaborating an electricity sector policy document and a draft Electricity Code
(the Authority for Regulating the Electricity sector was passed by Parliament in January 2014),
and in elaborating a draft Water Code; (iii) the Transport Ministry in preparing a draft law for the
creation of the Authority for Transport Regulation (this hasn’t been created, but the Authority for
Civil Aviation was created in June 2011).

17.     The Authority for Regulation of Posts and Telecommunications continues to face
financial difficulties and suffer from insufficient technical know-how. Meanwhile, there has
been significant growth in the wireless market segment. This has been achieved thanks to a
relatively buoyant competitive market with six main active operational wireless network
operators in 2014: Africell (7.7%), Airtel (37.5%), Oasis (12.9%), Vodacom (34.0%) and
Orange (7.9%). The telecommunications industry has become the most dynamic sector in the
economy of the DRC. More than $500 million was invested by the sector in the DRC between

                                                 24
1998 and 2006. Since 2006, Tigo alone has invested more than $300 million. The sector is
generating annual revenues of more than $850 million, second only to the mining sector. In
2008, it contributed more than $160 million to the government budget – one-third of the total
government receipts. . However, mobile taxation (as a proportion of the cost of mobile phone
ownership) is higher (29.14%) than the global average in African countries (18.14%). Such high
taxes could undermine the adoption and use of broadband, mobile and other advanced ICT sector
tools that are major drivers of development and growth.

18.     Promulgating New Divestiture Laws. New privatization laws were promulgated aimed at
divesting from state-owned enterprises and transforming them into commercial entities. These
laws are: (i) Law No. 08/007 of 7 July 2008 laying down general provisions on the
transformation of public enterprises; (ii) Law No. 08/008 of 7 July 2008 laying down general
provisions on the divestiture from the State Enterprise Portfolio; (iii) Law No. 08/009 of 7 July
2008 laying down general provisions applicable to public institutions; and (iv) Law No. 08/010
of 7 July 2008 laying down rules on the organization and management of the State Portfolio.

19.     A series of implementation decrees were also issued, namely: (i) Decree No. 09/11 of 24
April 2009 laying down transitional measures for the transformation of public enterprises; (ii)
Decree No. 09/12 of 24 April 2009 establishing the list of public enterprises transformed into
commercial companies, public institutions, and public service agencies; (iii) Decree No. 09/13 of
24 April 2009 on the dissolution of some public enterprises; (iv) Decree No. 09/14 of 24 April
2009 on the establishment, organization and operation of a public institution called "Special
Fund for the Portfolio"; and (v) Decree No. 09/15 of 24 April 2009 on the establishment (as a
public institution), as well as the organization and operation of COPIREP.

20.     The state-owned enterprises were split into three categories: 20 commercial companies;
20 public establishments (6 of which were placed in liquidation); and 4 public service agencies.
The project provided support for their re-registration under their new legal statuses, and the
publication of their new articles of association in the Official Gazette (December 2010). It should
be noted that all these SOE’s will need to be re-registered again under OHADA corporate
statutes to Société Anonyme (SA). In this regard, they need finalize valuations of their capital
and prepare new balance sheets, as well as implement corporate governance structures. The
project supported SOE governance and management training in OHADA accounting and
corporate structures.

Subcomponent 2: Facilitating Divestiture from public enterprises

21.     Support to, and transformation of, SOEs proceeded in two phases: (i) stabilization and
recovery of selected enterprises (carried out under this project); and (ii) their detailed
restructuring (ongoing under sectoral projects). The project supported stabilization contracts for
GECAMINES (Sofreco), SNEL (Vecturis), RVA (ADPI/KPMG), and ONATRA (Progosa) 9.

22.    Regarding financial and operational restructuring, progress continues to be registered,
albeit unevenly. Of the 7 strategic SOE’s (GECAMINES, SNCC, SCTP/ONATRA, SNEL,
SCPT, REGIDESO, and RVA), all steps for transformation have been completed at 3 of them

9
    The RVA and ONATRA contracts were funded by Government as part of its contribution to the project.

                                                        25
(GECAMINES, SNCC, and SCTP/ONATRA), including debt restructuring, asset ownership
confirmation, and new balance sheets. SNEL is mostly done with the asset and debt revaluation
part of the process.

23.     However, progress has been slower at SCPT, REGIDESO, and RVA due to their sector-
specific circumstances. SCPT’s transformation remains constrained by the unresolved debate
over splitting the postal from the telecomm business. REGIDESO has resolved is social debts,
but key strategic decisions such as whether to keep it as one company or split it into autonomous
regional companies are yet to be made. Issues at RVA relate to splitting assets and personnel
between RVA and the Civil Aviation Authority that was created in June 2011.

24.    All of the SOEs face the heavy burden of resolving their employee-related debts, which is
a subject that is being collectively addressed for all the enterprises by the Ministry of Labor and
COPIREP.

Subcomponent 3: Supporting the social cost of the reform

25.     The project facilitated Voluntary Departure Programs at GECAMINES (10,654
individuals), SNCC (3,886 individuals), OCPT (4,950 individuals), and at the three defunct state-
owned banks, namely BCA, BCCE, and NBK (3,480 individuals). The SNCC staff separation
program was co-financed by the Multi-Modal Transport Project, whereas the REGIDESO
departures were entirely financed by the Urban Water Supply Project. These programs were
accompanied by training for the departing staff in different livelihoods to facilitate their smooth
transition into their new life. Support was particularly concentrated in Katanga (third component
of the project) given the large numbers of the concerned people in that province.

26.    Some retirees petitioned the Inspection Panel, and while Bank Management disputed the
grounds of the petition, additional health benefits were extended to 22,155 individuals and
education benefits to 11,500 children. The project also supported audits for the INSS (Institut
National de la Sécurité Sociale).

Component 3: Initiative for Economic Development in the Katanga Region

27.   The component aimed at creating new economic opportunities for the workers retrenched
from GECAMINES and other public enterprises present in Katanga and at fostering regional
economic development.

Subcomponent 1: Small grants program to finance local economic development activities
(US$2.40 million at appraisal)

28.    These were small grants program to finance local economic development activities (such
as worker training, seminar attendance, purchase of necessary equipment and improvement of
production and marketing techniques). Linkages had been envisaged between this program and
microfinance institutions active in Katanga. US$3.76 million was disbursed (the higher amounts
disbursed are due to changes in the exchange rate during project implementation). This small
grant program focused on partants volontaires. The Project supported several micro-projects for

                                                26
1,569 individuals. In addition, 79 associations of voluntary departures involved in agricultural
projects in the Lubumbashi, Likasi, and Kolwezi basin benefited from training from agricultural
consultants. The linkages with microfinance institutions did not take place as expected, due to
the weakness of the microfinance sector in Katanga.

Subcomponent 2: Improvement of competitiveness in the region (US$0.94 million at appraisal)

29.    This was aimed at activities to improve the competitiveness of the region by supporting
technical assistance to help identify investment opportunities and upgrade skills and capacity of
small and medium size enterprises around an emerging private mining industry. Linkages were
to be created with local community development and business partners, namely mining
companies, NGOs, microfinance institutions, business associations. Linkages would also be
created with the economy of Zambia’s copper belt. No activity was financed by the
subcomponent. The IFC undertook an assessment of the copper belt mining supply chain in the
Katanga province.

Subcomponent 3: Transfer of social services to municipalities (US$1.04 million at appraisal)

30.     This activity was to support the transfer of social services from Gecamines by
transferring housing and social infrastructure assets that are on the balance sheet of
GECAMINES to local private or non-profit institutions or to the Central Government. US$1.31
million was disbursed. In the context of GECAMINES’ restructuring, two in-depth analyses of
the reorganization options for education and health activities were undertaken. It was recognized
that for GECAMINES to recover and to become again a profitable mining enterprise, it could not
continue to operate such a broad network of schools, health centers and hospitals. The important
role of these schools and health services in the Katanga region was also recognized. However, it
was determined that a gradual and careful transfer of GECAMINES’ schools and health services
would be undertaken in the context of the next phase of GECAMINES restructuring. Transition
support to GECAMINES schools and health services was funded under this subcomponent.

Subcomponent 4: Set up of regional development frameworks (US$2.51 million)

31.     Activities envisaged under this subcomponent included: (i) financing of local economic
development activities and capacity building of local communities; (ii) assessment of
infrastructure required to make private investment viable; (iii) analysis of the respective role and
capacity of central and local governments to deliver essential services and to implement and
maintain public infrastructure; and (iii) formulation of regional and local development
frameworks. This would include the preparation of local (urban and rural) development plans
and investment programs using participatory approaches. Help to design appropriate tools and
methodologies for urban and rural communities to better manage local infrastructure
maintenance and basic services delivery to their population.

32.    US$70,000 was disbursed. COPIREP organized two workshops in Katanga on regional
development frameworks. A number of these activities are undertaken in the context of other
World Bank operations. In the context of the preparation of the forthcoming mining operation, an
analysis of the infrastructure need of the mining sector is on-going (with participation from the

                                                27
IFC). The recently approved decentralization operation intends to provide support to the
Government of Katanga on regional and local development.

Subcomponent 5: monitoring and evaluation (US$0.51 million)

33.     Establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system for the program. US$ 160,000 was
disbursed. Two studies from the University of Lubumbashi (base line survey and technical
assistance to GECAMINES’ restructuring) were undertaken within this subcomponent. The
impact study under the CRETES evaluation report was also undertaken within this
subcomponent.


Component 4: Project Coordination and Implementation Arrangements

34.     The project strengthened the capacity of COPIREP turning it into a preeminent institution
for leading SOE reforms. By Project’s end, it had completed over 895 service contracts and
conventions, 206 contracts for goods, and 68 Contracts for works.

Introduction

1.     The project's development objective was to increase the competitiveness of the economy,
and thereby contribute to economic growth. The project was to achieve these objectives by
assisting with improving the investment climate; supporting reform of public enterprises in the
mining, telecoms, financial, transport, and energy sectors; stimulating economic diversification
and development in the Katanga region through community-driven development approaches and
facilitating the reintegration of retrenched workers in the local economy through support for
training, business development services and finance.

Restatement of Economic Analysis Estimates at Project Appraisal

2.    In order to contextualize the team’s analysis, the PAD had noted that the “… cost-benefit
analysis of this type of private sector development and competitiveness project is delicate and
presents the limits encountered in all similar projects”, because of the “…difficulty in quantifying
the economic benefits resulting mainly from the indirect relationship between the project’s
interventions and the stream of benefits..”.

3.    With that caveat, the overall ERR at appraisal was estimated at 18.4 percent, with the
corresponding NPV at US$ 31.5 million (for a 12 percent discount rate). Cost-benefit analysis
was done for each of the principal elements of the project as follows:

               Improving       Matching Grant      Pioneering     Retrenchment    Divestiture from
                   the         in the Katanga        Mining         Program          the public
               Investment          province      competitive in                     enterprises

ERR                19.9             31.9              19.2            15.8              19.0

ICR Update of the Project’s Economic Analysis

4.     Improving the Investment Climate. As stated above by the project appraisal team, linking
changes in general economic activity to a specific project’s interventions is always tenuous at
best. In the case of the “Improving the Investment Climate” component under this project, the
situation is compounded by lack of data in the project’s M&E framework to facilitate such an
analysis. Therefore, in the absence of a credible methodology to ascribe cause and effect, and
due to the lack of necessary data in the M&E system, economic analysis linking changes in the
country’s general economic activity to improvements in the investment climate spurred by this
project’s interventions could not be updated, although it is widely acknowledged that project
activities greatly contributed to significant improvements in the investment climate.

5.    Matching Grants and Katanga Region Development. With respect to the matching grant,
there were ultimately very few such activities carried out under the project. Only a small number
of associations of retirees were given some funds, and this never became a significant activity of

                                                29
the project. Same thing with the “pioneering mining competitiveness in the Katanga province”.
No broad scale economic development program was undertaken by this small component: only a
few activities to integrate retirees into their new life. Therefore, the economic analysis associated
with these two activities is no longer applicable.

6.     SOE Staff Retrenchment and Divestiture. The goal of the staff retrenchment program was
to relieve companies of excess staff (a large number of whom were way over past retirement age,
and not expected to be great entrepreneurs after leaving the SOEs). The economic value of the
retrenchment activity was mainly in the improved financial performance of the SOEs. Therefore,
the economic benefits of retrenchment are captured in the economic analysis of the SOE reform
component.

7.    Under the SOE Reform program, economic benefits would primarily derive from reduced
SOE losses. Indeed, losses were reduced at the SOEs targeted for reform, although not enough to
bring them to full profitability. The return on assets for the enterprises targeted by the project
(GECAMINES, SNCC, RVA, ONATRA, SCPT, LAC, City Train, SNEL, and REGIDESO) was
estimated at an average of -21 percent in 2002. By 2012, the average rate of return on assets for
this group of enterprises had improved to -3 percent, a net gain of 18 percentage points. This was
in part due to stabilization programs carried out at some of the SOEs (see Table 3.1 below)
aimed at decelerating, halting, or otherwise reversing financial hemorrhage. 10

8.    The specific activities carried out varied from enterprise to enterprise, ranging from greater
financial controls, to better stock management, to human resource management. These SOEs had
long lost a results-oriented culture.

SNCC                   In the period preceding the stabilization intervention, SNCC business
                       turnover was declining at about 6.5 percent per year (with variation across
                       years). With the stabilization contract, the decline was halted through
                       financial controls, improving maintenance, etc., thus attracting business.

RVA                    RVA’s business turnover was growing prior to the stabilization contract, by
                       about 14 percent annually, but poor financial and human resource
                       management were undercutting prospects for profitability. The intervention
                       particularly focused on tighter financial control and increasing revenue.
                       Overall, the stabilization’s value-addition has been estimated at about 2
                       percent of business turnover.

SCTP/ONATRA Similarly, ONATRA’s turnover was growing at about 15 percent annually,
10
 Stabilization at the utilities is part of the ongoing sector programs. The Urban Water Supply Project for
REGIDESO, and several energy sector projects for SNEL.

                  but profitability was severely hampered by (among other things) poor port
                  operations and financial management which were the areas of focus for the
                  stabilization intervention. Its value-added was estimated at about 3 percent
                  of business turnover.

GECAMINES         GECAMINES’ intervention was the most difficult. The company’s
                  turnover was growing, and so were the deficits. The intervention focused
                  primarily on financial control and management of partnerships with other
                  companies. Its contribution to stabilizing GECAMINES’ finances was
                  estimated at 3 percent of current turnover.

9.    The above information was used to construct a “with” and a “without” project scenario.
The economic analysis is computed solely on the basis of the SOE reform component, which
constituted 53 percent of project costs. The ERR is estimated at 22 percent.

                strategy envisages its transformation into a State-owned company with in
                operational activities run through a PPP.

       (vii)    SCPT: The strategic options under consideration include splitting the company
                into two distinct branches: (i) the Post on the one hand, and Telecommunications
                on the other; or (ii) creating a single company for the Post and two
                telecommunications companies, namely: a) Congo Telecomm, a retail

                         Annex 6. Summary of Inspection Panel Case


1.      As the first operation of the Bank’s re-engagement in conflict-ridden DRC to tackle
reform of the industrial and financial sector, the Project has pursued an ambitiously challenging
agenda in an environment of limited absorption capacity, with weak political and economic
governance, amidst military conflict and security concerns, and compounded by an outdated
legal framework and political culture that was unprepared for rapid modernization of the
economy.

2.      The first Project-supported reforms of the large SOEs included labor retrenchment
programs, including the Voluntary Departure Program carried out at Gecamines in 2004-2005 to
reduce surplus employment and allow room for debt reduction, improved governance, and
modern legal and organizational structures that would be conducive and attractive to private
sector-provided investment capital and management know-how. While initially welcomed by all
stakeholders, on the back of the Government’s legislative and executive leadership of the
implementation process, this restructuring scheme backfired in 2009 when aggrieved ex-workers
who initially had supported the reforms, reneged on prior agreements with the Government and
demanded entitlement to additional monetary compensation from the Government, from the
Bank, and from the enterprise, eventually appealing to the Bank’s Inspection Panel.

3.     In March 2009, the Inspection Panel received and registered two Requests for Inspection
concerning the Project. The two Requests for Inspection concern the Voluntary Departures
Program undertaken at Gecamines, which resulted in the retrenchment of over 10,600
employees. In January 2010, the Inspection Panel registered a third Request for Inspection, from
former employees of liquidated public banks (NBK, BCA, and BCCE).

4.     Following the first two requests for Inspection, the World Bank developed a Management
Action Plan (MAP) to address issues raised by the former employees of Gecamines, and then
updated the MAP after receiving the third Request.

5.      The MAP, as approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in April 2010,
and revised in May 2011 (as part of the Second Progress Report on the Implementation of the
MAP), included actions to: (i) address the critical issues raised by the requestors in their three
requests to the Inspection Panel; and (ii) further improve the quality of the overall Bank’s
portfolio in DRC in connection with social and other aspects of public sector reform including
SOEs and public administration. The case-specific critical issues raised by the requestors to the
Inspection Panel were to be addressed by a customized action plan for the Gecamines ex-workers
who seceded to apply under the Voluntary Departure Program (VDP), and an action plan for the
former workers of the three liquidated banks (BCA, BCCE, and NBK) and of OCPT (whose
request to the Inspection Panel, for claims of similar nature to those of the Gecamines VDP, was
included in the MAP without being treated separately by the Inspection Panel). Substantively,
the MAP consisted of the following activities:

   •   Provision of education support to eligible children of Gecamines VDP up to the end of
       secondary education or age of cutoff to be agreed, along with free access to health care

                                               41
       (through an NGO) for eligible family members of the Gecamines VDPs, for up to two
       years, accompanied by participatory monitoring and evaluation of the education and
       health programs;
   •   Support to the Gecamines VDPs and former employees of the three liquidated banks to
       reinstate their rights to the pension system, including the calculation of contributions to
       and entitlements from the social insurance agency (INSS).

6.      Furthermore, the overall portfolio issues were to be addressed by the application of
lessons learned to forthcoming retrenchment and other social plans to be applied to SOEs or civil
service and public administration, and by support to the Government to develop a comprehensive
strategy to settle social debts of SOEs, which would be undertaken in collaboration with the
Ministry of Labor with support from COPIREP. Specific activities entailed reinforcement of a
unit at the Ministry of Labor which would coordinate the administration of the social dimension
of public enterprise reform, assistance to the INSS pension agency via actuarial, organizational
and financial audits/studies, plus application of lessons learned to future retrenchment and
reinsertion programs (e.g. as was done for REGIDESO and SNCC), and communications
support.

7.      Following the Board’s approval of the MAP, the Inspection Panel, in its “Third and Final
Report and Recommendation” dated August 25, 2011, declared that it would not proceed with
further investigation.

8.      The largest and most substantive actions implemented under the MAP consisted of the
two-year program of free health care and education benefits extended to families of the 10,600
ex-workers of Gecamines. This program officially started only after the arrival of the new
Government in June 2012, after an exhaustive process that was completed during 2011 to
finalize the census and demographic data/eligibility verification involving a population of over
60,000 people, as well as the census and audit/accreditation of over 100 health clinics throughout
the country and over 100 educational institutions with whom covenants had to be signed and
financial settlements system agreed. This process was instituted in a period of political
transition, compounded by security concerns on the ground during the DRC election period in
the second half of 2011, which particularly affected movement across the Katanga province
where the majority of Gecamines ex-workers are located.

9.      As of June 2014, as above activities were being completed, additional assistance to INSS
reforms (organizational and financial audits) was pending results of a IMF-Bank FSAP
(Financial Sector Assessment Program) which was launched in parallel to inform on future
reforms in pension administration, affecting the future of INSS, for implementation outside and
independently of the Project. Similarly, the collaboration between the Ministry of Labor and
COPIREP on resolving the social costs of SOE reforms across the entire economy, and including
any residual claims from aggrieved workers from past retrenchment programs, will be continuing
beyond the limits of the Project, and possibly subject to additional support from a future IDA
operation.

10.   A number of lessons were yielded from above experience, which were applied in
implementing subsequent labor retrenchment programs in DRC in the restructuring of the

                                               42
railways company SNCC and the water utility REGIDESO. These included the requirement for
individualized payment calculations to be duly audited and certified, approved by labor unions,
endorsed by the Labor Inspectorate and officially mandated by the government through formal
legal opinions. Additional importance was given to the implementation of economic impact
surveys to benchmark progress and closely monitor reinsertion activities. Moreover, the process
was refined as follows:
       • To limit IDA financing only to the departing indemnities of eligible retirees whose
           retirement account and salary arrears sums have been certified by an independent
           auditor; IDA will not finance salary arrears or pension fund contributions.
       • The financing of departing indemnities should be conditional upon: (i) the issuance of
           a legal opinion from the Ministry of Justice and another opinion from the Ministry of
           Labor, certifying that the agreement signed between management and unions is
           conforming with DRC’s labor laws, and (ii) government co-financing, particularly of
           salary arrears.
       • Disbursement should be through a commercial agent (commercial bank) which will
           be recruited transparently to pay out the retirement indemnities of each voluntary
           retiree covered in key locations. The disbursement of these funds would be done in
           compliance with processes defined in an operation manual which will be subjected,
           like the selection of the commercial agent, to the Bank’s non-objection.

11.    More broadly, the experience has served to reinforce the necessity of clear government
ownership of the reform program and its responsibility for implementation, including for
providing grievance resolution mechanisms through its legal system, all of which would be
underpinned by appropriate attention to the importance of ensuring:

   •   Collaborative dialogue and agreement between company management and unions,
       supported by a Project-funded consultant.
          o Management and unions must agree to form an internal retrenchment committee
              (the Committee) to work on a strategy to define the proposed retrenchment
              program.
          o This work should be reviewed by an independent consultant recruited by the
              Project, who would pay particular attention to the following key principles of the
              Bank’s OP/BP 6.00 for financing severance programs: (i) avoid adverse selection
              (i.e., ensuring that well-performing staff do not leave while mediocre staff stay);
              (ii) avoid overpayments (ensuring possibilities for disciplinary staff reductions
              and the elimination of payroll fraud arising from ghost workers and improper
              hiring); (iii) avoid moral hazard (ensuring workers who receive severance
              packages are not rehired by the same enterprise); (iv) follow appropriate legal
              processes and collective bargaining arrangements; (v) consider social impact; and
              (vi) appropriately determine severance payments.
          o The final retrenchment program must be submitted to the Bank for review and
              non-objection.

   •   Technical support through engagement of: (i) a specialized negotiator to agree on the
       criteria for retrenchment and to calculate the severance package for the retrenched
       employees (such negotiations to be undertaken in partnership with the trade unions, be

                                              43
    compliant with domestic laws and regulations as well as with ILO policies and
    guidelines, and take into account the Collective Bargaining Agreements and salary
    arrears); (ii) an auditor to certify the amount of the severance package to be paid to the
    retrenched employees; (iii) a commercial bank to make the payments; (iv) an auditor to
    check whether the payment operation was undertaken according to the defined
    procedures.

•   Participatory process of communication and Monitoring & Evaluation, ideally involving
    NGO/civil society, to ensure full understanding by civil society and the principal
    stakeholders of the objectives and improvements targeted by the reform, and to provide
    impartial, independent assessment of its execution, as well as to support the government’s
    recourse mechanism for any grievances.
