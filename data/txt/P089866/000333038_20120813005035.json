The closing\n            date for the Project will be extended from December 31, 2012\n            until June 30, 2013. The Project Management, development\n            objectives and implementation progress are rated\n            satisfactory through July 2, 2012. To date, 69 percent of\n            the Loan has been disbursed and the three main procurement\n            contracts, for a total of US$37 million are being\n            implemented. The three contracts were approved by the CDEEE\n            (Corporacion Dominicana de Empresas Electricas Estatales)\n            Board of Director on September 28, 2010, and project\n            originally had an implementation period of 20 to 23 months.\n            The changes of implantation unit will not affect the\n            development objective, activities, indicators, or any other\n            aspect of the three components that comprise the Project:\n            (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of medium and low voltage\n            circuits (US$37 million), (ii) outreach to consumer\n            communities (US$3 million), and (iii) technical assistance\n            (US$2 million). The extension is necessary to ensure timely\n            progression in the implementation, providing a time buffer\n            for contractors to complete their work and the implementing\n            agency to complete necessary administrative paperwork. This\n            will be the first extension of the closing date for the project."}, "docdt": "2012-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
