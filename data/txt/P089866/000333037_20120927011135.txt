SUMMARY

1. This restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for a Level Two
   restructuring for the Dominican Republic Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation Project
   (P089866). The proposed restructuring would change the Project Closing Date from
   December 31, 2012 to September 30, 2013, extending the closing date for nine (9) months.
   As documented by previous project ISRs, the extended deadline will allow a time buffer for
   contractors to complete their work and the implementing agency to complete necessary
   administrative paperwork.

BACKGROUND

2. The Project was approved on May 20, 2008 and became effective on June 18, 2009. The
   Project comprises three components: (i) rehabilitation of medium and low voltage circuits
   managed by Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE) in
   selected areas of EDENORTE, EDEESTE, and EDESUR (US$37 million); (ii) outreach to
   consumer communities receiving Project investments (US$3 million); and (iii) technical
   assistance to support overall Project administration, customer satisfaction surveys, and
   monitoring and evaluation (US$2 million). CDEEE is also implementing a component on
   strengthening electricity infrastructure and increase its risk management capacity included in
   the Dominican Republic Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project (IBRD
   Loan-75460).

3. The Project's development objectives remain the same, namely to (i) increase the Cash
   Recovery Index of the three electricity distribution companies in selected areas, and
   (ii) improve the quality of electricity service. The proposed changes would not affect the
   development objectives, activities, indicators, or any other aspect of the three components.

4. On May 30, 2012, Minister of Hacienda, Lic. Daniel Toribio, requested an extension of the
   Closing Date for a period of six (6) months, from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 (see
   letter attached).

PROJECT STATUS

5. The Project development objectives and implementation progress are rated satisfactory
   through July 24, 2012. The Project is fulfilling its original objectives and after facing initial
   delays, due to among other the standardization of the distribution electric equipment,1 is now
   disbursing satisfactorily; 69 percent of the Loan has been disbursed and the three main
   procurement contracts are being implemented. The rehabilitation contracts were signed in

1
 It is important to note that now the Dominican Republic has a national standard for electricity distribution which
has greatly supported the bidding processes under the first phase of the distribution rehabilitation initiative.

     early 2011 and contractors are advancing satisfactorily. Two of the three network
     rehabilitation contracts will be executed by July 2012, while the last one (EDEESTE) will be
     completed by December 2012. The project deadline extension will ensure both the
     contractors and the implementing agency are able to finish the necessary works while
     ensuring the administrative paperwork is fully completed.

 6. Bank Fiduciary Specialists, based on the last supervision implementation support missions
    and their working knowledge with the Project, have concluded that the capacity of the
    Corporate Unit of CDEEE continues to meet the Bank’s requirements. This is confirmed by
    Project audit for the fiscal year 2011, which was timely submitted and auditor's opinion on
    the financial statement, compliance with Loan Agreement, and country's laws and regulation
    was unqualified (clean). The auditors observed certain matters for improvement related to the
    internal control environment, incorporated in a separate management letter mainly having to
    do with some reporting limitations of the country system (UEPEX). Resolution to this issue
    is outside the span of control of the Project. The Ministry of Hacienda will enhance its
    system reporting features and is completing some country system design features to
    strengthen the internal control environment by further enhancing Project reporting
    capabilities. While it does so, the Project fiduciary team will continue to prepare
    supplementary reports and, jointly with the Bank, will follow-up until this is resolved and
    closed for stronger Project internal controls. There are no other outstanding financial
    management or procurement issues associated with the Project.

 7. Neither the Loan, or the entity in particular, or the country in general is subject to an ongoing
    suspension of disbursements. This closing date extension does not require changes on the FM
    and disbursement arrangements, including the opening of another Designated Account for the
    Project.

 8. Regional self-clearance procedures apply to the proposed extension of closing date.

Recommendation

9.   On the basis of the review of the supporting documentation and recent developments, the
     team recommends a nine (9) month closing date (Type II) extension for P089866. This will
     ensure timely progression in the implementation, while providing somewhat of a buffer for
     the potential Additional Financing the project will receive.

1. The closing date for the Dominican Republic, Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation Project,
   IBRD LOAN NO. 7560-DO, P089866 will be extended from December 31, 2012 until
   September 30, 2013.

2. The Project Management, development objectives and implementation progress are rated
   satisfactory through July 24, 2012. To date, 69 percent of the Loan has been disbursed
   and the three main procurement contracts, for a total of US$37 million are being
   implemented. The three contracts were approved by the CDEEE Board of Director on
   September 28, 2010, and project originally had an implementation period of 20 to
   23 months.
                                                                        three components
   that comprise the Project: (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of medium and low voltage
   circuits (US$37 million), (ii) outreach to consumer communities (US$3 million), and
   (iii) technical assistance (US$2 million).

3. The proposed extension is necessary to ensure timely progression in the implementation,
   providing a time buffer for contractors to complete their work and the implementing
   agency to complete necessary administrative paperwork

4. This will be the first extension of the closing date for the project.
