                                              I.INTRODUCTION

1.       A large segment o fthe Bangladeshi population, mostly the poor and low-income groups, has been
suffering from the ongoing food crisis. While the overall economy continues to perform well,' the spike
infood priceinflation over the past one year, compoundedbyrisingpricesofoil andfertilizer, has eroded
their purchasing power and caused them enormous hardship. With GDP growing at around 6 percent
annually during 2005-08, the poverty rate would have been expected to decline by around 5 percentage
points during the same period. However, the food price shock i s estimated to have raised Bangladesh's
poverty rate by around 3 percentage points-from           the baseline poverty rate o f 35 percent in 2008-
thereby pushing over four million people back into poverty.'          A recent survey done by the Bank found
that in response to higher food prices nearly 8 percent o f the 2,000 households surveyed pulled their
children out o f schools, who, inturn, took upjobs to assist their families cope with the crisis. Moreover,
many households among the vulnerable groups were compelled to cut their food intakes. The likely loss
o f human capital because o f these adverse health and education impacts could have negative effects on
the country's development.

2.       The food crisis started in Bangladesh late last year. The crisis has two main components: food
(mainly rice) shortage and rising prices. The shortage o f rice was a serious problem in MarcWApril
earlier this year, when the country was in between crops and its main rice crop Boro had not been
harvested. The problem o f food availability was further compounded with export restrictions on rice
imposed by India. At the moment there i s no shortage o f rice in the country. The food crisis, however,
continues due to highprice o f coarse rice, which i s roughly 40 percent higher than the price in September
2007. It i s the poor and low-income groups that continue to face the burden o f highprice.

3.       The Government o f Bangladesh (GOB)has sought to reduce the impact on the most vulnerable
groups: (i)food grain, particularly rice, is being made available to the poor at subsidized prices; (ii)
existing safety net programs are being scaled up; (iii)new safety net program, an employment guarantee
                                                           a
scheme, has been initiated to help people in distressed areas-such          as those that periodically suffer from
extreme food shortages, known in the local dialect as Monga-abtain employment during lean
agricultural periods; and (iv) ensuring the adequate and timely availability o f farm inputsincluding seeds,
fertilizer and diesel to farmers. The FY09 budget has significantly increased allocations to assist the poor
deal with the food crisis. GOBhas requested all stakeholders including the development partners to assist
inthis effort. The Bank has been requested to provide budget-support under its Global Food Response
Program (GFW) to assist GOB'Smeasures to maintain macroeconomic stability, ensure food security in


1   Despite a number o f recent external shocks, GDP grew by an estimated 6.2 percent in FY08, which i s only
     slightly lower than 6.4 percent growth inFY07. The average growth rate during the last five years has been 6.1
    percent. Poverty has fallen !?om 57 percent o f the population in 1990 to 40 percent in2005, with a 2 percentage
    point annual decline between 2000 and 2005. This rapid poverty reduction i s attributable mainly to strong and
*    stable economic growthbased on supportive public policies. For more information, see Section 111.
    According to the last Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data o f 2005, 40 percent o f the
    population lived below the poverty line in 2005. On the basis of GDP growth during 2005-2008, the poverty
    rate is projectedto have beenreduced to 35 percent in2008.

the immediate short-run, and help those affected by rising food prices. The proposed operation is in
response to that request.

4.       The past one year or so has seen Bangladesh's economy being hit hard by a quick succession o f
shocks. The first shock came inthe form o f severe floods duringJuly-September 2007, which lulled over
a thousand people and caused major economic loss. The second shock was the devastating cyclone Sidr
that struck the country in November 2007, causing an even higher loss o f life and inflicting enormous
social and economic costs. These two natural disasters led to a loss o f over 2 million tons o f rice
production. Ifthis was not enough, rising international prices of food and oil have dealt a further blow to
the economy.

5.       Faced with this unusually difficult situation, GOBhas sought support from the international
community.     The Bank, together with other development partners, earlier responded to that call and
provided assistance inthe aftermath o f the two natural disaster^.^

6.       The proposed operation-a         US$ 130 million budget support credit being processed under the
Bank's fast-track GFRP facility-will          further help GOBcushion the fiscal pressure arising from the
additional safety net support that i s being provided to protect the basic consumptionneeds of the poor. In
the absence o f concessionary financing resources, GOBwould need to curtail development spending
andor resort to higher domestic bank borrowing to sustain its increased social spending, which could put
the country's macro economic stability at risk and disrupt its reform m ~ m e n t u m . ~The proposed
operation, together with assistance from other development partners, most notably the Asian
Development Bank, i s being designed to help mitigate this risk. Being a fast-track emergency operation,
this project is not designed to address the structural issues related to enhancing food security in the
medium- to long-term. Similarly it i s not suited to address the structural issues o f increasing rice yields.
These medium- to long-term issues will have to be addressed together with the government and other
development partners through other projects.


                                           11.THE2008FOOD          CRISIS

7.       The genesis o f Bangladesh's current food crisis can be traced back to a couple o f adverse shocks
starting with the twin floods in July-September 2007 and later the November cyclone. Duringthese two
disasters, the country's second most important rice cropAman, was badly damaged. With about 2 million


    The Bank provided immediate financial assistance to Bangladesh in the form o f two Supplemental Financing
    operations to the Fourth Development Support Credit. The first operation-a      US$ 75 million quick disbursing
    budget support-was    processed in October 2007 after the twin floods; the second operation-another     budget
    support in the amount o f US$ 100 million-was      completed in January 2008 following the November cyclone.
    Both these operations provided fiscal resources to GOBto undertake emergency spending without foregoing
    planned critical development expenditures. Moreover, the Bank reallocated about US$ 25 million from its
    ongoing projects for immediate recovery after the cyclone. Following a disaster and needs assessment-done in
    conjunction with the Government and other development partners after the cyclone-the      Bank provided US$ 50
    million for restoration o f livelihoods through additional financing for the ongoing Social Investment Program
    Project (SIPP). The Bank has prepared and is getting ready to negotiate an emergency credit (US$ 109 million)
    to (i)help rebuild some o f the infrastructure that was lost during the cyclone, (ii) agriculture in cyclone
                                                                                         revive
    affected areas, and (iii)
                            prepare projects for implementation o f a long term disaster riskreductionprogram.
4   The Bank has supported the government's policy and institutional reform program through a series o f multi-
    sectoral budget-support operations-Development      Support Credits (DSCs). A total o f US$900millionhas been
    provided to GOBinthe form o f four budget-support operations. The first DSC was processed in 2003 and the
    last-a  US$200 million IDA credit-was        approved by the Board in May 2007. Moreover, a one-off budget
    support inthe form o f a Transitional Support Credit (TSC) was processed inJune 2008 to support the country's
    ongoing reforms during the transition period.

worsened in Bangladesh inthe last quarter o f 2007 as the international price o f rice rose to US$ 375 per

8.       Rice i s the staple food in Bangladesh. While the country meets most o f its annual rice demand
from domestic production, a small proportion o f it-less         than 7 percent in FY08-is       imported, mainly
from India.'     One reason for the latter i s relatively low transport costs o f procuring rice from India.
Wheat i s also consumed inBangladesh, but it i s a secondary food grain. Per capita consumption o frice is
roughly 160 lulogram per year, compared with wheat consumption o f only about 20 lulogram. Imports
from India have served Bangladesh well in the past, particularly since the early 1990s. This has helped
stabilize rice prices at import parity levels. The private sector has done the bulk o f rice import with the
government playing the role o f a facilitator (see Table 1 for details).

9.        As food prices started increasing globally, India-the          second largest producer o f rice after
China-set     minimumprices for exports o f its rice. Facing its own food grain problems, India raised its
minimumrice export price from US$ 425 per ton in October 2007 to US$ 505 in December 2007. In
March 2008, the Indian government placed new restrictions on rice export, allowing shipments o f coarse
varieties o f rice at or above US$ 650 per ton later raised to US$ 1,000 per ton. InApril, India banned all
non-basmati rice exports. With a thinly trading international rice market and no possibility o f procuring
rice from elsewhere, domestic rice prices in Bangladesh shot up. The prices of coarse rice in Dhaka
peaked at Tk. 36 per kg in April 2008-about          50 percent higher relative to October 2007 (see Figure 1
below for details).

 10.      With low rice availability world-wide, surplus countries puttingexport bans and price spiraling
upwards, Bangladesh faced a major food crisis in MarcWApril 2008. Rice supplies in the domestic
market were short and prices were continuously rising. Reacting to the global rice situation, GOB
encouraged the farmers to plan a bumper Boro crop, the main rice crop o f Bangladesh planted in

'
    In2007-08,nearly 88 percent ofall rice imports-public andprivate-were        from neighboringIndia; roughly 10
    percentwas from Myanmar.

Decembermebruary each year. It provided timely farm inputs including seeds, subsidized diesel, power
and fertilizer. The result o f this effort was outstanding: harvested inAprilNay, the country got a bumper
rice crop o f 17.8 million tons, comfortably exceeding the projected increase. With the arrival o f the Boro
rice inthe domestic market, the retail price o f coarse rice started to decline-from           a higho f Tk. 36/ kg in
Aprilto Tk. 3l k ginmid-June.

11.      Rice supply in Bangladesh i s currently plentiful and a major food shortage has been averted. To
ensure enough domestic supply, GOBhas put a six-month ban on export o f coarse rice inM a y 2008.6 The
price o f rice, however, has remained high. It rebounded and reached Tk. 3 5 k g in mid-July. The
continuation o f the export ban by India was an important contributor to the price increase. Inthe absence
o fthe import channel, farmers and intermediaries continuedto hold a significant portion o f their Boro rice
produce in anticipation o f a lean future period and expectation o f even higher prices. However, o f late
prices have started to decline; currently the price o f coarse rice i s Tk. 32kg. Likely reasons for this
movement are: (i) decline o f rice prices in the international market, (ii) prospect o f achieving
                    recent                                                                good
the Aman crop target in the next few months given that there have hitherto not been major floods this
year, and (iii) need to procure fertilizers for Aman cultivation has induced farmers and intermediaries
               the
to gradually release their Boro stock. GOB'SOpen Market Sales (OMS), which involve selling rice at
subsidized prices, has restarted on August 20 and i s likely to have a further cooling effect on the market
price ofrice (more on the food safety net programs below).

Impactonthe Poor

12.      Food price inflation has caused enormous hardship in Bangladesh by eroding purchasingpower,
particularly o f the poor and low-income groups. In the rural Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, the
weight for food i s 60.5 percent; within the food basket, rice accounts for a 40 percent share. The
corresponding numbers for the urban CPI are 44.5 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Food inflation in
the country has been indouble digits since the beginning of 2008, due mainly to rising rice prices. Given
that rice accounts for about a quarter o f household expenditures and a third for poor households, this has
resulted in a significant negative wealth effect on a large section o f the population.'             The most recent



6   The export ban i s scheduled to expire on October 6,2008.
7   While high rice prices have caused problems for a large section o f the population, they have significantly
    contributed to the bumper Boro harvest as farmers took this as a big incentive and increased their production.

Poverty Assessment by the Bank in Bangladesh suggests that strong GDP growth (over 6 percent on
average) would have been expected to reduce poverty by around 5 percentage points between 2005 and
2O0fL8 However, the food price shock is estimated to have erased around 3 percentagepoints o fthat gain.
Put another way, instead o f falling from 40 percent in2005 to around 35 percent in2008, as would have
happened under normal conditions, the poverty rate likely only fell to about 38 percent because o f the
higher food prices.'

13.     The impact o f rice price increase i s also likely to be unevenly distributed among different groups:
larger for urban than rural households and for the extremely poor households." Analysis shows that
households that are more likely to have suffered include those headed by daily wage workers and the
landless, while the groups that likely benefited are households headed by f m e r s owning more than 1.5
acres o f cultivable land. Potential beneficiaries are estimated to be no more than 17 percent o f all
households.

Findings of the Food Price Impact Survey,2008

14.      Inorder to gauge how Bangladeshi households are coping withthe higher food prices, the World
Bank conducted a survey o f 2000 households inJuly, 2008."             There are three main themes o f the survey:
First, a set of questions were asked to decipher the pattern o f household food consumption from
December 2007 (when the food price inflation started accelerating) to June 2008 (the most recent period
for which information could be collected). A second theme o f the survey was to analyze the strategies


    The Government, on its part had announced a much higher procurement price o f rice at the beginning o f the
    Boro planting season-Tk.      2 8 k g as compared to Tk. 18kg last year.
    Based on 38.8 percent increase in rice prices in rural areas and 36.8 percent increase in urban areas during
    April, 2007 -Mach, 2008.
    Itis important to note that this poverty estimate is basedon projections and a simulated shock. Actual poverty
    numbers can only be calculated using a nationally representative household survey, which will be only available
    after the next round of HouseholdIncome and Expenditure Survey of 2009.
    This is due to the fact that the ultra poor and urbanhouseholds are predominantly net buyerso frice.
    The survey data comprise 2,000 households, of which 1,200 were selected from rural and 800 from urban areas.
    The sample was designed to ensure that the survey responses captured a wide spectrum o f the Bangladeshi
    society (including some o f the poorest rural areas) and allowed disaggregated analysis o f certain groups o f
    special interest (e.g., daily wage labor, and salaried workers in the manufacturing and garments sectors). The
    survey's geographical coverage is quite extensive. The rural survey was conducted in all six divisions in the
    country, and included 12 out o f country's 64 districts. The urban survey included six districts in four divisions
    of the country.

households have adopted to cope with the food crisis. Finally, the survey looked at the extent to which
beneficiaries have utilized the food safety net programs initiated by the Government. Results relating to
the first two themes are summarized inthe next few paragraphs, while the reported use o f food safety net
programs i s summarized in Section IV.

15.       Food consumption patterns of householdsover time. Table 2 provides information on self-
reported consumption patterns o f households across months. More specifically, it provides information
on the percent share o f surveyed households who are eating less and/or slupping meals at least once a
month-a       rough indicator for capturing consumption decline due to higher food prices. Loolung at
household consumption by groups who ate less or slupped an entire meal rarely (1 time in a month),
sometimes (2-5 times a month), often (6-9 times a month), mostly (10 or more times a month), the
findings indicate that an increasing number o f households were slupping meals sometimes or more
between December 2007 and March 2008. The situation remained virtually unchanged between March
2008 and June 2008. The number o f households who skip a meal or eat less in meal sometimes or even
more frequently in a month rose from 43 percent to 58 percent between December 2007 and March 2008,
an increase of 15 percentage points or 34 percent." Among urban households this increase was from 35.3
percent to 50.3 percent, an increase o f 15 percentage points or 42.5 percent; among rural households the
increase was from 48.5 to 63.1 percent, an increase of 14.6 percentage points or 30 percent. While the
levels o f hardship are higher in rural than in urban areas, the change in levels of consumption appears
starker inurban areas.

16.       Table 3 provides information on self-reported consumptionpatterns o f households across months
classified by occupation. Daily laborers (rural and urban), the poorest occupational group, already had
been facing food shortages in December 2007. The food price surge fbrther worsened their situation.
Another group hit hard by rising food inflation was the urban private sector salaried households. With
salaries hardly adjusting between December 2007 and June 2008 (as confirmed by the survey data), this
group suffered a large decline in real income. InDecember 2007, 42 percent o f the urban private sector

57.5 percent in March-April 2008 (an increase o f 15.5 percentage points or 37 percent) and to 60.8

     mostly.

percent inJune 2008. On average, the situation o f farmers improved only marginally between March and
June 2008; as a group, however, they were still not as well o f f in June 2008 as they were in December
2007. This finding is consistent with the earlier findings from the HIES2005 data that suggest that only
farmers with largerland holdings are expected to benefit from food price increases.

17.        Coping with the food crisis. Over 95 percent of households surveyed reported that in dealing
with the adverse food price shock they have adopted some coping mechanism. As reported in Table 4
below, a majority o f households reduced their non-food and food intake as well as switched to lower
quality food. Slightly over 40 percent drew on their savings to meet the higher prices and an even larger
number took out loans. A portion o f households with school-going children-roughly                    7.9 percent-
pulled their children out o f schools inresponse to higher food prices and most o f these children took up
jobs.     Finally, almost 40 percent o f all households reduced education-related expenses during this

 18.       As noted in Table 4 below, in dealing with food crisis, rural households seem to react more
strongly than urban households, a clear indication that the food crisis i s not just an urban phenomenon
and confirming that the majority o f rural population does not necessarily benefit from food price
 increase^.'^ This also reflects the higher incidence and depth o f poverty inrural areas.

 l3  The impact on school dropout needs to be examined further before designing appropriate measures o f
     mitigation. In this context, the Government's primary stipends program could be looked into to ensure
     improved targeting. GOBhasjust started the next phase of the primary stipends program which currently serves
     4.8 millionprimary school children.

19.     The oil price inthe internationalmarket has risen considerably inthe past few months. However,
the international oil prices have declined significantly since mid-July from about US$ 147harrel to
around US$ lOOhan-el in the second week o f September, but the sustainability of this decline remains
uncertain. With the recent adjustment in the administered prices o f fertilizer and petroleum products in
Bangladesh, the overall inflation in the country may continue to rise (more on this below). This would
further exacerbate the difficult situation facedbythe poor andthe low-income groups.

PoliticalDevelopments

21.     The country i s moving towards national elections, which are scheduled to take place on
December 18, 2008.15 The first polls since the present Caretaker Government (CTG) took office on
January 11, 2007 were held on August 4, 2008 to elect governing bodies o f four city corporations and
nine municipalities. Although limited to 1.5 percent o f country's total voters, over 80 percent o f whom
came to vote, the process was deemed fair and credible by observers.16 The creation o f a voter list
concluded on July 9, 2008, the process having registered over 80.5 million voters. This new electoral roll
has around 12.7 million fewer voters than that prepared for the aborted election of January 2007. The
Election Commissionpurged duplicate, deceased or bogus names from the earlier roll. Publication o f the
fullvoter list withphotographs is expectedto be completed by early October 2008.

22.     The CTG has also announced that the Upazila (sub-district) elections will be held in two phases
on December 24 and 28.          The political parties, including the Awami League and the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, have started to prepare for the national as well as the Upazilla elections, although they
have expressed some reservations about the Election Commission's ability to deliver on the announced
timing o f the latter.   The CTG and the political parties still need to agree on one key issue: the
continuation o f the state o f emergency until after the national elections. The CTG continues to insist that
the elections need to be held under the state o f emergency to ensure peace and orderliness. It plans to
relax the restrictions on political activities prior to the elections in order to enable election campaigning,
as it did in the recent city corporation and municipality elections. Meanwhile, discussions continue with
the main political parties, at formal and informal levels, with the objective o f ensuring participation o f all
major political parties inthe national and local elections.

Economic Developments

23.     Economic growth. Bangladesh's overall economic performance in FY08 demonstrates the
resilience o f its economy. Despite the external shocks, GDP grew by an estimated 6.2 percent in FYO8,
only slightly lower than 6.4 percent growth in FY07,reflecting a strong pick up in domestic activity and
export inthe second half o fthe year. The growth decomposition was as follows:

o Agricultural production rebounded with a record 19percent increase inBoro crop harvest relative to
    last year. This impressively offset damages to earlier crop harvests due to floods, cyclone and
    livestock losses resulting from outbreak o f avian flu to keep agricultural growth at 3.6 percent in
    FY08,which is above historicaltrend.

l5  This announcement in a nationally televised sppech by the Chief Adviser on September 20 has been well
    received by the major political parties, civil society organizations and the business community.

                                                       8

o Industrial growth slowed from 8.4 percent in FY07 to 6.9 percent in FY08 due to slower growth in
    construction and manufacturing.          Sharply increased prices o f construction materials and weak
    business confidence reduced the pace o f growth in private construction activities while public
    construction was adversely affected by the inability to fully implement the government's Annual
    Development Program. Manufacturing growth in the first half suffered from labor unrest, loss o f
    export orders in late 2006 because o f political turmoil, and weak business confidence, but then
    recovered strongly inthe second halfas export demand picked up.

o Service sector growth declined from 6.9 percent in FY07 to 6.7 percent in FY08, reflecting the
    unfavorable impact o f decreased real incomes due to increases inthe price o f essential commodities.

24.     Inflation. Notwithstanding the good growth performance, life for large segments o f rural and
urban people has remained difficult because o f the continuedhighprices o f food, particularly rice. After
declining from 11.6 percent inDecember 2007 to 7.4 percent inM a y 2008, overall year-on-year inflation
climbed back to 10.8 percent in July, 2008, driven by rise in food inflation to 13.9percent (see Figure 2
below). Non-food inflation, which has been declining since August, 2007 reaching 3.5 percent in June,
rose to 5.9 percent in July, 2008. As discussed in Section IIabove, the rice price increase has been the
main source o f the rise in inflation, particularly in rural areas. Until very recently, rice prices have
remained downwardly rigid despite the bumper Boro harvest. The government raised significantly the
administered prices o f CNG in April, fertilizer in June and petroleum products in July. Until then
domestic consumers had been shielded from the sharply rising international prices o f fuel and fertilizer.
These adjustments are likely to have pushed non-food inflation up inJuly. There also remains the risk o f
continued trade restrictions in food exporting countries (for example, rice export restrictions in India
remain inplace) which have implications for near-term food inflation prospects inBangladesh.

25.      External sector management. Continuedrobust growth o f remittances and the strong recovery
in      )rts have helped maintain sound external balances. Despite a 25.6 percent growth~inimport
payments in FY08, the current account recorded a US$ 672 million surplus (equivalent to 0.9 percent of
GDP). Notwithstanding a 5.4 percent decline inthe first quarter, the overall export growth in FY08 rose
to 15.7 percent, nearly the same as 15.8 percent in FY07.17 The increase was driven by 21.5 percent
growth in knitwear and 10.9 percent growth in woven garment exports. Export o f knitwear and woven
garments increased in both U S and EUmarkets. However, stronger merchandize import growth resulted
in a widening o f trade deficit by nearly US$ 2.1 billion over its US$ 3.5 billion level in FY07, largely
reflecting the impact o f increased international prices o f food, fertilizer and fuel on import payments.

                                                      9

Yet, the current account recorded a significant surplus because o f remittance growth which rose to 32.4
percent in FY08, compared with 24.5 percent growth in FY07. Strong inflows have continued inFY09,
with remittances in July 2008 growing by 46.3 percent relative to July 2007. The total number o f
Bangladeshi workers abroad increased from four million at end-June 2007 to five million at end-June
2008. Saudi Arabia was the largest source o fremittances, followed by the USA and UAE. Another one
million workers are expected to find jobs abroad in FY09, o f which 0.5 million have already obtained
clearance from the authorities concerned.

26.      Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves have increased and the exchange rate continues to be
stable. Foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 1.1 billion in FY08 and stood at nearly US$ 5.3
billion in early September, 2008 (equivalent to 2.7 months o f imports o f goods and services) after an
A C U payment o f about US$ 580 million. The nominal exchange rate remained stable in dollar terms in
FY08, with taka appreciating only 0.4 percent against the U S dollar.            The Bangladesh Bank (BB)
remained active inthe foreign exchange market and made a net sale o f US$ 533 million inthe inter-bank
market inFY08 to stabilize the exchange rate. The IMF's recent analysis indicatedthat Bangladesh's real
effective exchange rate i s inline with its equilibrium rate based on economic fundamentals.'*

27.      Fiscal Management. Aggregate fiscal discipline continues to be an important pillar o f
Bangladesh's macro economic management. A 25.9 percent growth inrevenue collections and 30 percent
underutilization o f the Annual Development Program (ADP) were instrumental in keeping the FY08
budget deficit below the revised budget target. The FY08 budget deficit outtum was 3.7 percent of GDP
compared with the revised target o f 4.7 percent, despite spending on post-disaster mitigation and
improved budget coverage o f escalating fuel and fertilizer sub~idies'~.Implementation problems resulted
inmuchreducedADP expenditure o fTk. 185billion, comparedwiththe originalbudgettarget o fTk. 265
billion and the revised target o f Tk. 225 billion. Together with increased foreign financing from 1.2
percent o f GDP in FY07 to 2.2 percent in FY08, domestic financing was reduced from 1.9 percent o f
GDPto 1.5 percent.

28.      Improved taxpayer compliance, reduced leakage, and collection o f arrears contributed to 26.4
percent growth inNational Board of Revenue (NBR) tax collections in FY08 relative to FY07, resulting
inan increase inoverall tax-GDPratio from 8.3 to 9.1 percent. Nearly 42 percent ofthe increaseinNBR
tax collection came from import-based taxes, reflecting the impact o f intensive monitoring o f the
functioning o f Chittagong port. Another 28.6 percent o f the tax revenue increase came from income tax,
made possible through registration o f new taxpayers with the introduction o f a universal self assessment
system and a special drive for income tax collection. The contribution o f the domestic Value Added Tax
(VAT) to the increase intax revenue was 16.2percent.

29.      The FY09 budget i s understandably expansionary, given the need to address the social impact o f
high food prices and natural disasters while further improving budget coverage o f the losses o f State-
owned Enterprises (SOEs). Under these circumstances budget targets o f an overall deficit o f 5 percent o f
GDP and domestic financing o f 2.8 percent appear reasonable, though not sustainable over the medium-
term. Continued gains intax compliance and the improvement in the base achieved in FY08 should help
achieve the revenue target. Growth in NBR tax collection in July-August 2008 was 18.9 percent, well
above the 15.5 percent growth target for FY09. Prior to FY08 NBR revenue growth in July varied
between 9 to 11percent.

30.     The projected increase in expenditure i s mainly due to the widening and deepening o f social
safety net programs, a substantial increase in subsidies on account o f fuel, food and fertilizer, and the
introduction o fnew income generation initiatives for the poor and disadvantaged households. Despite the
bold adjustments in fuel prices with effect from July 1, 2008, and earlier doubling o f fertilizer price in
June, the burden o f fuel and fertilizer subsidies are unlikely to abate in FY09.20The FY09 budget
provisions for fuel subsidies relate to a US$ 110harrel oil price. Current projections of an average price
o f around US$ 125harrel would imply a further Tk. 30 billion in subsidies to the Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation (BPC). Escalation in international fertilizer prices could add more transfers to Bangladesh
Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC).2' Ifmore subsidy resources were required in FY09, the plan is
to cover them from within the existing expenditure envelope-block              allocations, potential overlaps
between safety net allocations, and potential savings from any ADP implementation shortfall.

31.      Fiscal Sustainability. The main source o f risk to medium- to long-term fiscal sustainability is
the financial losses o f SOEs, especially those inthe energy sector, althoughrecent measures by GOBhave
sought to contain these losses. Government debt indicators are still within a benign range and fiscal risks
over the medium-tern are unlikely to manifest in the form o f debt default. Rather, the risk would be to
preserving the fiscal space necessary for needed social and investment expenditures, including
accommodation o f the higher levels o f social protection measures being put in place. The low level o f
revenue collection further restricts the fiscal space. The losses o f the energy sector SOEs for FY08 were
estimated at about Tk. 105 billion (US$ 1.5 billion), or 1.9 percent o f GDP, and are projectedto increase
to Tk. 116 billion inFY09.22 The Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the public sector
chemicals corporation, i s another major loss-maker in the public sector, registering Tk. 43.7 billion o f
losses in FY08. The challenge to preserve fiscal sustainability, therefore, calls for continuedprogress on
two fronts. First, ensuring over time cost-reflective pricing o f energy products and fertilizers to curtail
SOE losses. Inthis regard, the sharp increases inthese prices earlier in 2008 were bold steps inthe right
direction. Second, revenue collection, which, despite the sharp turnaround since last year, remains among
the lowest in the world, requires sustained policy attention. Continuation o f ongoing measures to
streamline tax codes, improve taxpayer compliance, modernize tax administration, and control leakages at
customs would be neededinthis regard.

32.      Bangladesh's external debt indicators improved significantly duringFY02 to FY08. The recently
completed debt sustainability analysisz3shows that the risk associated with the level and composition o f
its external debt i s low. All external debt indicators-present    value o f debt in percent o f GDP, exports,
and revenues; debt service in percent o f exports and revenues-are          below the policy-dependent debt
burden thresholds under the baseline scenario and the standard stress tests do not reveal any serious
vulnerability. According to the baseline scenario, the net present value o f public debt to GDP ratio will
gradually decline, with both external and domestic debt declining relative to nominal GDP. However, the
analysis reveals a more elevated risk o f debt distress on total public debt, especially coming from the
possible recognition o f contingent liabilities.

33.      The public debt position i s vulnerable to growth slowdown and to one-off debt creating flows.
The probable fiscal cost in future emanating from guarantees given by the Government on borrowing by
the SOEs i s of particular concern. Strengthening the management o f contingent liabilities in order to
minimize such risks i s thus a high priority. The Government has started to pay more attention to


     The government administered prices of fertilizer and petroleum products (particularly diesel) continue to be
     muchlower than the cost at which these commodities are procured from the market.

monitoring and restraining the accumulation o f contingent liabilities. Currently, the Government has at
least Tk. 168.9 billion (3.1 percent o f GDP) as contingent liabilities, o f which guarantees and counter-
guarantees provided to Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) against fuel imports constitute 86.2
percent and the rest are bankmg system bail out and liabilities of privatized SOEs. Contingent liabilities
are projected at 3.2 percent o f GDP in FY09.24 The Government is committed to consolidate and record
all guarantees, provide a fuller list o f contingent liabilities in the budget documents, and gwe priority to
taking decision on issuing new guarantees on the basis o f an assessment o f risk and associated future
impact on fiscal accounts.

34.      Monetary Management: BB's monetary policy stance was generally appropriate in FY08.
Double digit inflation for a large part o f the year was mainly driven by supply shocks, particularly food
and oil. Policy rates have been constant over the last 18 months and monetary policy leaned in favor o f
accommodating private demand for credit in key growth dnving sectors. This stance reflected BB's
assessment that inflation in Bangladesh has been mainly driven by external and domestic supply side
forces, which cannot be adequately addressed by monetarypolicy actions.

35.      Broad money grew by 17.6 percent in FY08, driven by a strong pick up in private demand for
credit, resulting in 25.2 percent growth in credit to the private sector, compared with only 15.1 percent
growth in FY07. Growth o f credit to the public sector declined from 14.4 percent in FY07 to 10percent
inFY08. Credit to SOEs declined by 33.6 percent inFY08 compared to 15.6 percent increase inFY07.
Bank advances by economic purposes show that a significant share o f credit to the private sector went to
transport and communication (39.9 percent) followed by workmg capital financing (28.5 percent),
industry (25.6 percent) and trade (19.7 percent). Excess liquidity in the banking system has declined
significantly from Tk. 142.8 billion at endJune, 2007 to Tk. 130.8 billion at end-June 2008. The decline
in excess liquidity reflects faster growth of domestic credit (21.1 percent) relative to growth of bank
deposits (16.9 percent).

Economic Outlook

36.      Recent policy actions taken by the government demonstrate its commitment to leaving a
sustainable macroeconomic position to the next elected government.              The CTG has taken credible
measures to ensure that the next government inherits a workable fiscal position, more comfortable public
food stocks, and adequate foreign exchange reserves. The government i s bankmg on the continuation o f
the recent economic rebound and return o f inflation to single digits as supply shocks dissipate. BB i s
closely monitoring the monetary aggregates in order to ensure its twin objectives o f low inflation and
robust economic growth.

37.      GOB'S6.5 percent growth target for FY09 appears feasible, although achieving it will require
continuation o f the reform momentum.          Indeed, the good FY08 performance in the face o f strong
countervailing pressures indicates resilience o f the Bangladeshi economy and stronger growth potential.
Continuedimprovements inagriculture, expansion indomestic services and construction, and capitalizing
on high regional momentum are likely to be the key drivers o f growth. The near term challenge i s to
sustain the recent turnaround o f the economic activities to lead the economy to a higher growth trajectory
for which financial, trade, FDI policy instruments and business hendly regulatory reform would be
required. Inview o f the continued export restrictions on rice inIndia, adequate emphasis in the near term
policy agenda on agriculture to ensure a goodAman harvest i s needed.

38.      Power supply constraint is unlikely to ease inthe near-term. Investors are not likely to risk their
money in new productive activities if this situation i s not addressed. For the short-term the government

needs to find ways o f getting more power from existing generation capacity through expeditious repair,
rehabilitation and maintenance works. Precious time has been lost in finalizing the coal policy and it i s
still not done. Bangladesh has about 7.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of proven (Pl) gas left, whereas there are
estimated coal reserves o f the equivalent o f 37 tcf o f gas. Mediumand long-term energy needs have to be
met by exploiting this sizable coal reserve.

39.       Double digit inflation i s likely to remain in the near-term. With stronger domestic demand and
increasing wage pressures, the first round effects o f the July fuel price increase on CPIinflation are likely
to be accompanied by second round effects that may increase the risk o f entrenched inflation. The
Government therefore needs to take an appropriate fiscal and monetary policy stance to bring inflation
back to tolerable levels.          Accordingly, the Government's medium-term macro framework (MTMF)



                                                      13

indicates that the fiscal expansion in FY09 in response to the food crisis would not be sustained. The
expenditure to GDP ratio i s projected to decline to 15.9 percent in FYI1 from 16.3 percent in FY09.
Together with increase inthe revenue to GDP ratio, the fiscal deficit i s projectedto decline to 4 percent o f
GDP inFY11. BB's Monetary Policy Statement for the first half o f FY09 aims at ensuring price stability
and supporting output growth. It commits to give priority to unhindered flow o f credit to the private
sector in agriculture, small & medium enterprises, and the rural economy. It also commits to pay special
attention to channeling credit to supply augmenting uses while discouraging credit to speculative uses in
order to avoid build up o f excess demand pressure. After a gap o f nearly over three years, BB has
increased the interest rate on repurchase auction from 8.5 percent to 8.75 percent on September 17, 2008
to discourage borrowing by banks and non-bank financial institutions from BB. The overall success of
the policy requires better fiscal and monetary coordination, particularly maintaining fiscal discipline and
limiting the dependence on bank financing o f fiscal deficit.                   The Government's medium-term
macroeconomic framework projectsbank financing o f fiscal deficit to decline from 2.2 percent o f GDP in
FY09 to 1.7percent inFY11(see Table 5).

40.       The external sector outlook i s positive, given continuation o f policies supporting increased
international competitiveness o f the Bangladesh economy.               The external current account surplus i s
expected to remain broadly stable at less than one percent o f GDP, with export and remittances growth
offsetting growth in imports arising from price increases and higher investment. External assistance and
gradually increasing capital inflows should help in a steady increase in international reserve coverage.
However, a sustained highlevel o f food and oil prices can put the balance o f payments and fiscal position
under significant stress andreduce near-term growth prospects.

41.       It is important to recognize that the near term outlook hinges critically on macroeconomic
policies supportive o f growth and stability; effective measures to ameliorate power and other
infrastructure constraints; and confidence among key stakeholders regardingthe continuity o f institutional
and policy reforms beyond the national elections as well as political stability in the runup to the national
elections.

                          Iv.THEGOVERNMENT'S               RESPONSETO FOOD            CRISIS

42.       Responding quickly to the dire food situation in MarcWApril, the Government took a number o f
relief measures:

0   First, it expanded its Public Food Distribution System which includes both rice and wheat, though
    quantity-wise rice dominates. Buildingits buffer stock o frice and wheat, the Government announced
    that it will maintain a strategic food reserve stock o f 1.5 million tons, which i s roughly equal to 5.6
    percent o f annual consumption. To this end, it plans to directly import 800,000 tons o f food grains
    (450 thousand tons o f rice and 350 thousand tons o f wheat) in addition to 500,000 tons o f rice from
    India that was sold at relatively lower price as a good-will gesture after the November cyclone. In
    terms o f domestic procurement o f Boro paddy and rice, the target has been set at 1.5 million tons.25
    At the beginning o fBoro plantation, the procurement price for rice was fixed at Tk. 28kg compared
    to an average cost o fproductiono f Tk. 21kg. This procurement price i s significantly higher from the
    last year's price o f Tk. 1 8 k g (relative to an average production cost o f Tk. 15kg). This increase in
    the procurement price has given the farmers a strong incentive to increase rice production. As o f


25  Public stocks are supposed to serve three objectives: (i)    adequate operation o f existing food-based safety net
    interventions to protect the poor, (ii)  market price stabilization, and (iii)   emergency relief in times o f food
    shortages (security stock). The Ministry o f Food and Disaster Management estimates o f the required quantities
    o f rice needed to meet each o f these goals are 1.9,0.5, and 1.O million tons, respectively. As analyzed inAnnex
    4, the public grain stock target appears to be consistent with the requirement for the three key objectives.



                                                      14

  August 31, the Government's food reserve is estimated at 1.2 milliontons o fwhich 1.1million tons is
  rice and the remainder wheat.

   Second, it reactivated its Open Market Sales (OMS) program in urban areas. Essentially a self-
   targeted food subsidy program, it involved the sale o f a maximum of five hlogram per purchase o f
  relatively low-quality rice to any urban and pen-urban consumer at Tk. 2 5 k g via 6,700 outlets
   throughout the country and 75 Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) outlets in Dhaka.26 In rural areas, the
   Government expanded the coverage o f several food-based safety net programs. During FYO8, the
   Government spent an additionalUS$250 million on food and food related safety net activities.

   Third, the Government removed the five percent custom duty on the import of rice and wheat with
   effect from March 8, 2007 in an attempt to contain their prices. The zero custom duty on imports
   remains inplace. Revenue foregone due to removal o f the duty i s estimated at about US$ 74 million
   on the basis o f imports o f these items in FY08. Barring a new shock to domestic production, food
   grain imports are likely be a lot less inFY09. Thus, the revenues loss i s also likely to be lower than
   the estimated loss inFY08.

   Finally, the Government took several measures to improve timely delivery o f crucial inputs such as
   seeds, electricity and diesel. A minimumavailability o f urea was also assured by introducing a card
   system given to farmers by DAE Block Supervisors whose job was to determine the amount o f
   fertilizer needed by farm households through field visits and then issue the cards. The fertilizer was
   to be distributed through BCIC registered private fertilizer dealers."               The Government also
   implementeda targeted diesel and electricity subsidy scheme for farmers duringthe Boro season.

   Union has 3 to 4 Blocks).    Notwithstanding these reforms, the fertilizer distribution system in Bangladesh
   continues to be problematic and requires a systemic evaluation. A study o n the fertilizer distribution and the
   card payment system is muchneeded.

43.      Inthe current fiscal year that started on July 1, GOBhas increasedboththe budgetary allocation
and the coverage o f its food-based safety net programs. The projected spending increase from FYO8 to
FY09 i s nearly 25 percent (see Table 6 for details). The OMS scheme was started again on August 20,
which allowed urban consumers to buy three lulogram o f rice per person for a fixed price o f Tk. 2 8 k g
until September 1when the quantity was raised to five lulogram per person. In addition, GOBis also
initiating a 100-Day Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to help and assist those rural poor who
continue to suffer from the food price inflation, among other hardship.

Food Safety Net Programs

44.      Bangladesh has an established record with respect to its social protection programs, which
provides a useful platform for responding to the poverty and social impact o f such shocks.28 The
following paragraphs provide a brief description o f the food safety net programs (reported inTable 6) that
are being used to assist the poor andlow-income groups:29

         OpenMarketSales (OMS). Essentially a self-targeted food subsidy scheme inurban areas, when
         operational, it allows any person queuing up for a fixed amount o f food grain per day at a fixed
         price, which i s lower than the prevailing market price. The plan in FY09 is to provide subsidized
         rice to 3.15 million persons at a cost o fTk. 26.8 billion (US$ 390 million).

         Test Relief (TR) Food. Test Relief i s administered by the Ministry o f Food and Disaster
         Management. It operates much like the Government's Food for Work program. Participants are
         largely self-selecting, with wages and labor requirements set to discourage the non-poor from
         participating. Workers are paid approximately 3.5 kilograms o f rice or wheat for every day o f
         work.    With a Taka 6.3 billion allocation this program has a 33 percent projected increase
         compared to last year. The program i s activated as needed following large-scale or localized
         disasters.

         Gratuitous Relief (GR)for Food. Administered by Union Parishads (the lowest unit o f local
         Government) together with central Government officials based at the Upazila (sub-district), this
         scheme provides immediate food grants to households following disasters. The projected amount
         for FY09 i s Tk. 2 billion (US$29 million), which would be good for 6.4 million-man work.

         Food Assistance in CTG-Hill Tracts Area. This program operates in three districts of the
         ChittagongHillTracts area. The program i s targeted to ultra poor women who get 3.5 kilograms
         o frice or wheat on a daily basis for 30 days for doing public work. The FY09 projected spending
         i s 714,000 man-monthwork for a total cost o f Tk. 2.4 billion (US$ 35 million).

         Foodfor Works (FFW). FFW operates inrural areas. This fiscal year the program will provide
         employment at a cost o f Taka 5.84 billion for food. The beneficiaries are generally women
         selectedby UnionParishad who mustbe fit and willing to participate inthe training provided and

28   Bangladesh's food and cash programs have been evaluated inseveral international studies and have been found
     to be reasonably effective. See Dorosh, Paul, Carlo del Ninno and Quazi Shahabuddin Eds, 2004, "The 1998
     Floods and Beyond: Towards Comprehensive Food Security in Bangladesh," The University Press Limited,
     Dhaka and IFPRI, Washington, DC. Also, see the annex on safety net programs inBangladesh.
29   Food-based transfers are generally not regarded as eficient as cash transfer programs are. In most food-based
     transfer cases, there are a lot o f leakages associated with procurement, storage and distribution o f grains.
     Bangladesh has been gradually shifting from food-based to cash-based systems for t h s reason and the new
     employment guarantee program is an example o f this shift. The Bank is supporting this shift through its
     engagement through a variety o f instruments including dialog, technical assistance and lending.

        in the infrastructure projects in the area. The work includes planting trees, digging canals,
        buildingembankments, developingponds, roadbuildingandroadmaintenance.

     o Vulnerable Group Development (VGD). This program assists about 750,000 women with a
        provision o f 30 l l o g r a m o f rice or wheat. These women are enrolled in two-year cycle. In
        collaboration with NGOs, it provides food for the poor as well as training for life-skills and for
        developingthe skills needed to undertake income generation activities. The projected spending i s
        Taka 8.4 billion for this program.

     o Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF). Untilrecently the largest safety net program inthe country,
        VGF is a means-tested program designed to provide food resources to a selected number o f
        women in a period of distress. Usually, the women selected by the Chairman o f the Union
        Parishad receive a card that entitles them to a given amount o f grain a month for a period o f two
        months. Each VGF card holder is entitled to 10 kilograms o f rice per month. A total o f 7.5
        million man-month o f VGF i s planned for the current fiscal year at a cost o f Taka 7.1 billion.

45.     OMS program. Set up in direct response to the food crisis, the self-targeted subsidy program
OMS, by design i s concentrated in urban areas. According to the survey, the OMS operations appear to
have been successful in reaching the relatively poorer and more severely affected segments o f the
population, particularly in urban areas. For example, compared to other occupational groups, a larger
fraction o f urban households with income coming mainly from daily labor, purchased food from OMS
outlets.  While effective in reaching the poor households through its self-selection mechanism, the
coverage o f OMS appears to be inadequate. Only 16 percent o f rural households who ate less or slupped
at least one meal a month had used the OMS outlets in MarcWApril 2008, while only 32 percent o f
similar urban households did so. One possible reason for the reported low usage could be that many o f
these households did not have enough money to purchase even the subsidized rice from OMS outlets.
Another reason could be that since the rice prices in OMS outlets was about 30 percent lower than the
free market price-Tk.    25 k g as opposed to Tk. 35kg-many        households may have found this subsidy
on a fixed quantity purchase to be lower than the opportunity cost o f queuing for long hours at the OMS
outlets. Finally, there were clear limits on the amount o f rice that was made available at these distribution
centers and hence, even if all poor households had been willing to stand in line and purchase at the
prevailingprice, there would not have been enough to go around.

46.     Other food safety net programs. According to the survey, about 11percent o f all households
appear to benefit from at least one government safety net program. While OMS outlets have broader
coverage inurban areas, traditional safety nets programs are more popular inrural areas: 16percent o f all
rural households are covered by these programs. These programs appear to be reasonably well targeted to
the poor. However, as seems to be the case with OMS, the coverage appears to be limited. For example,
o f households who had to skip a meal or eat less at least once a month during June 2008, only 18 percent
had access to some Government safety nets program. The coverage o f the new SVGF (Special VGF)
program i s very thin as only 2 percent o f all rural households have been able to access it. While
households with access to safety nets appear to suffer the brunt o f the price increase the most, in the
absence o f these programs, the adverse impact would have likely been much higher.

47.     The survey result o f low coverage o f safety net programs i s consistent with the more nationally
representative data from HIES 2005. The HIES 2005 data show that about 13 percent o f all households
benefit from at least one government safety net program, and that around 15 percent o f all rural
households participate in some safety net programs. The HIES 2005 data also indicate that only about 22
percent o f households in the lowest consumption quintile are able to access safety nets programs, thus



                                                    17

confirming the low coverage o f safety net programs. On the other hand, in urban areas only about 5
percent o fthe population had access to any safety net program, excluding OMS. Though limited, existing
evidence suggests that households that do participate in food-based safety net programs appear to have a
statistically significant increase in their per capita food expenditure as well as their per capita calorie
intake than non-participant household^.^^         Thus, while the safety net programs work well on some
indicators, there is scope to improve the coverage o f safety net program^.^'

EnsuringFoodSecurityintheMedium-Term

48.      Since the availability o f rice for trade in the international market can no longer be taken for
granted and with Indian rice export restrictions continuing, the talk in Dhaka has moved from imports to
complete self-reliance. While the rationale for self-sufficiency and declining faith in international trade
remains an issue o f debate, increasing rice production inthe face o f a declining amount o f arable land and
rising population will be difficult.        A major focus needs to be on improving rice yield, which i s
significantly lower than other Asian countries.32

49.      Even though rice supplies in the country are plentiful at the moment, there i s no room for
complacency. About 2 million people are being added to the country's population every year. Based on
population and income growth, rice demand i s projected to grow at a rate o f 2 to 2.5 percent per year,
implyinga need for an annual increase inrice production by at least 330,000 tons. k c e production can
be increasedeither by expanding the cropped area or by an increase inyield, or a combination o f both. In
Bangladesh, the potential for expansion o f cropped area i s limited, with less than four percent o f total
arable landunsown while about 1percent o f currently cultivated area i s lost every year to non-agncultural
uses. Given the geo-climatic nature o f the country, therefore it i s not possible to significantly increase the
cropping intensity from its current level o f 1.75.33

50.      Given the limitations for expansion o f cropped area, food security could be enhanced primarily
through technology-driven yield increase.          With appropriate measures, average yield o f rice can be
increased to about 4.5 ton per hectare from the current level o f 2.5. A number o f other complementary
measures need to be taken as well in order to increase agricultural productivity. Research-extension-
market linkages need to be strengthened. Delivery mechanisms and extension o f agricultural services
needto be made more responsive and farmer-friendly.

5 1.     GOB'Scommitment to agncultural sector is reflected inits adoption o f the National Food Policy
(NFP) and the related action plans. Public expenditure on agncultural research has been stable at 0.3
percent o f agncultural GDP during FY00-FY03. It increased to 1 percent in FY06 and further to 1.3
percent in FY08. GOBrecently established an Agricultural Research Trust Fund-the                KnshiGobeshana
Endowment Trust (BKGETGaimed at mobilizing and generating funds for agriculture research. The
Government has transferred about US$ 50 million o f public funds to BKGET and has also created an
Agriculture Research Foundation-the          Knshi Gobeshona Foundation-to          award grants for agncultural

    suggests that the marginal propensity to consume calories out of income transfers in food (or even cash and
    food-cash combinations) could range between 0.23 and 0.66.
31  GOBis planning to develop a national social protection strategy, which would help better implement policies
    and programs in the social protection areas. The Bank is assisting GOBthrough the proposed National Social
    Protection Project in developing an effective cash-based safety net program. For more details, see annex on
    safety net programs.

    zones, waterlogged regions, Monga affected areas and near water bodies.

research to both public and private sector. The National Seed Policy o f 1993 was updated in 2004
recognizing the increased role o f the private sector in seed production, processing, storage and
distribution. These seedpolicy recommendations needto be implemented on a priority basis. Institutional
reforms o f seed wing o f the Bangladesh Apculture Development Corporation (BADC)34have also been
initiated.

                          v.BANK'SSUPPORTTO           THE GOVERNMENT'S         PROGRAM

52.      The Government's response to the food (and oil) price rise i s partly responsible for the
expansionary FY09 budget. As noted inTable 5, the projected spending increase i s Tk. 11.6 billion (over
US$165 million) for food related subsidy programs inFY09 as compared to FY08. The new 100-Day
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme will cost yet another US$ 300 million in FY09. GOBhas also
raised the strategic food reserve target from 1to 1.5 million tons at an additional cost o f roughly Tk. 13.8
billion (US$ 200 million). Inthe absence o f any additional external support, the overall budget deficit is
expected to rise from 3.7 percent o f GDP inFY08 to 5 percent inFY09, and a large part o fthis increase i s
expected to be financed from domestic bank borrowing (see Table 5 in Section 111). Alternatively, if the
pressure to contain budget deficit rises, the Government may feel constrained to reduce planned capital
spending, or significantly scale down support to recurrent expenditure activities. Therefore, grants or
concessionary financing from development partners would be critical to meeting the country's social
protection plans to help mitigate the food crisis while continuing to support the country's development
agenda.

53.      The World Bank's proposed budget support operation would be an efficient and timely
instrument in response to GoB's most pressing spending needs arising from the food crisis. It would
complement the recently approved (July 2008) Asian Development Bank's US$ 170 million quick
disbursingproject that will help meet the GoB's financing requirement for food security. To prevent
deterioration in international reserves resulting largely from increased food imports, IMF in April 2008
provided a balance o f payments support o f US$ 217 million to Bangladesh under its Emergency Natural
Disaster Assistance (ENDA)program.

Linkto Country AssistanceStrategy

54.      The World Bank Group's most recent Country Assistance Strategy (2006 - 2009)' discussed by
the Board in April 2006, i s aligned with the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy that was adopted in
November 2005.35 Inthe CAS, the Bank Group has attempted to buildon Bangladesh's many strengths o f
which maintenance o f macroeconomic stability and impressive social gains are two important ones. The
ongoing food crisis poses a risk to macroeconomic stability by creating pressure on the Government
budget in the form o f a significant increase in spending on food subsidy. It comes at the cost o f a
combination o f (a) substitution for investments that are needed for buildinga healthy investment climate,
and (b) increased domestic borrowing to finance the higher expected budget deficit. At the same time, the
food crisis threatens to erode the gains in empowerment o f the poor by malung them food and nutrition
insecure. As the food crisis shock was not anticipated, the proposed operation was not included in the
CAS.

heavy emphasis on a sustainable macro economy; deepening and widening the social safety net to help

     been able to produce more than 5 percent o f total annual seed requirements of quality seeds since its creation
     due to a lack o f serious capacity and manpower to carry out its mandate.
35   The second Poverty ReductionStrategy is currently under preparation.

the poor and low-income groups cope with the adverse impact o f high food prices; and enhancing food
security by ensuring adequate availability o f food at stable prices, i s consistent with the CAS'S core
objectives.

The ProposedOperation

56.     The proposed operation i s a single tranche Credit o f SDR 82.7 million (US$ 130 million
equivalent) that would be made available to GOBupon credit effectiveness, anticipated inearly November
2008. Resources from the proposed operation will provide the Government with needed fiscal space to
absorb the pressure from the expansion o f food-based safety nets and buildingup o f food stocks. It would
help mitigate the impact o f food price increases, and would contribute to maintaining core service
delivery to vulnerable groups.

57.     In support of the Government's program of tackling the food crisis, prior actions under three
thematic areas: (i)    macro and fiscal policy reforms, (ii)expansion o f safety net programs, and (iii)
enhancing food security-have        been agreed with GOBas part o f the proposed operation. The prior
actions under these three areas andtheir status are described inthe following paragraphs.

58.     (i) Macro and Fiscal Policy Reforms. GOBhas made significant progress towards achieving
sustainable public sector finances through a mix o f policy actions that include efforts to improve revenue
mobilization; adjustment inadministered prices o f fertilizer and petroleumproducts.

    Prior Action I:The Government has taken steps to bolster revenue mobilization.

59.     The Government has taken a number o f actions to improve its revenue mobilization.                       For
example, it has introduced universal self-assessment inincome tax with the objective o fboosting revenue,
reducing direct contacts between tax official and tax payer, and improving transparency. To improve
efficiency in customs, it has introduced direct trader input in import cargo clearance.                The Central
Intelligence Cell o f the National Board o f Revenue W R ) has been intensely monitoring the activities o f
both taxpayers and tax officials. Together these measures have improved taxpayer compliance, leakage
has been reduced and collection o f arrears has increased. These reform efforts together with a special
time bound opportunity to disclose undeclared income inthe early part o fFYO8, led to an unprecedented
26.8 percent growth in NBR tax collections in FY08 relative to FY07, resulting in increase in tax-GDP
ratio from 8.3 to 9.1 percent-a         100 billion Taka (US$1.46 billion) increase. Growth in NBR tax
collection in July and August, 2008-the         first two months o f FY09-was      18.9 percent, well above the
15.5 percent growth target for FY09.

    Prior Action 2: Theadministeredprices of compressed natural gas (CNG),fertilizer andpetroleum
    products have been increased

60.     Administered prices o f petroleum products, fertilizer and compressed natural gas (CNG) have
been significantly increased: (a) prices o f CNG and fertilizers were increasedby 100 percent on April 24
and June 11,2008, respectively; (b) on July 1,2008, prices o fpetroleumproducts were increasedby 34 to
67 percent.    The rationale behind increasing energy and fertilizer prices by such magnitudes was
manifold: first was a judgment based on the political economy o f price increase. An important second
consideration was the size o f the impact on SOE finances. Finally, there was a need to eliminate the gap
between domestic and border prices to discourage smuggling o f fertilizer and diesel to India.36 These


36  The diesel price gap between India and Bangladesh was Tk. 18.9Aiter before adjustment. After adjustment this
    was narrowed to Tk. 3.9/liter, which reduces the incentive to smuggle across border taking into account
    transport cost and risk o f being caught at the border. The same applies to fertilizer-pre-adjustment    price of
    urea was half o f Indianprices. After adjustment, the price was doubled to make it at par with Indian prices.


                                                     20

increases have helped to stem the flow o f state-owned enterprise losses-stimated         to be about US$ 950
million or about 1.2 percent o f GDP. Inturn, this has reduced the burden o f subsidies on the Government
budget.

61.      (ii) Expansion of Safety Net Programs. Responding to the ongoing crisis, the Government has
expanded its safety net programs (direct food transfers and subsidies) to help the poor and low-income
groups. In addition, it has also created a 100-day employment guarantee scheme to provide gainful
employment to the rural poor in economically vulnerable areas (such as Monga) duringthe lean periods
o f inbetween cropping seasons.

     Prior Action 3: I n its FY09 budget, the Government has increased resourcesfor food-crisis related
     safety netprograms by over Xk. 31 billion; this includes expansion of the existing safety netprograms
     and introduction of a new scheme-the IO0 Days Employment Guarantee Program.

62.      As noted in Table 6 above, GOBhas scaled up its safety net programs to support direct food
transfershbsidies and made a significant commitment for a cash transfer program in FY 09. Resources
for seven such programs have been increased from Tk. 47.2 billion (US$ 688 million) in FY08 to Tk.
58.7 billion (US$ 854 million)--an     overall increase o fnearly 25 percent. Moreover, the Government also
announced a new cash-based transfer scheme in the FY09 budget. Designed in response to the food
crisis, the scheme i s the largest single safety net program inthe country with an initial allocationo f Tk. 20
billion (roughly US$ 300 million).        Managed by the Ministry o f Food and Disaster Management in
partnership with local Governments, the scheme's main objective i s to assist ultra poor retain purchasing
power in facing high food inflation. The program i s means-tested and wages are set at Tk. 100 (US$
 1.45) per day-just    below the market wage rate duringthe inbetween crop period. Those requesting help
from the program are entitled to 100 days o f work. Ifthe local agency i s unable to give them a suitable
job, then they are entitled to benefits at the rate of Tk. 40 per day for the first 30 days and then Tk. 50 per
day for the remaining days on which work cannot be provided. This scheme has started operating on
September 15,2008.

63.       (iii) Enhancing Food Security. The Government has taken steps to ensure adequate availability
o f food grains at prices that balance producers' and consumers' interests.

         Prior Action 4: The Government has made provisions to improvefarmers' access tofertilizers
         through expansion of dealers at the Union level and reflecting higher cost of production raised
          theprocurement price of rice to encourage a good supply response.

64.      Actions taken to ensure adequate availability o f food grains in the country include: efforts to
improve farmers' access to fertilizers through expansion o f the fertilizer distribution network. Earlier the
dealers appointed by the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) used to be located at the
Upazilla level but have now been moved one step closer to the farmers at the Union level. Moreover, at
the beginning o f the Boro planting season, the Government announced a higher procurement price o f
rice-Tk.    2 8 k g as compared to Tk. 18kg last year reflecting inpart, the higher cost o f production. The
higher procurement price contributed significantly to the bumper Boro harvest as farmers took this as a
big incentive and increasedtheir production. Finally, the Government upwardly revisedthe targeted size
o fpublic food stock to 1.5 milliontons from its previous year's target o f 1million tons. These actions, at
least in the short-run, are critical to ensure that (a) there i s enough food in the country to feed the
population in a crisis when import channels may be temporarily blocked; (b) the food stock i s large
enough to influence, if necessary, the open market price and be able to sell food to the poor and low-
income group at subsidized prices.




                                                   21

Other Bank Projects

65.      The Bank is supporting the Government to provide medium-to-long term support to enhance food
security and production through several other means. An Emergency Cyclone Recovery and Restoration
(approximately US$lO9 million) project, which includes support for agriculture recovery and sustainable
crop, livestock and fisheries production and productivity enhancement in the cyclone affected areas, i s
currently under preparation. The Bank, with co-financing from IFAD, (IDA US$ 62.6 million and IFAD
US$ 19.4 million), i s supporting the Government in the implementation o f National Agnculture
Technology Project (NATP), which was launched inM a y this year. The NATPi s the first five year phase
o f a 15 year Adaptable Program Loan Program to support the generation, dissemination and adoption of
agriculture technology incrop, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors.


                                    VI. IMPLEMENTATION             ARRANGEMENTS


A. Poverty and SocialImpact

66.      The policies taken and institutional arrangements made by GOBin addressing the ongoing food
crisis have been designed to help the poor and other low-income people. More specifically, increased
resources for maintaining a larger food reserve and for existing and new safety net programs are primarily
targeted to benefit the poor by providing food security. Higher food stocks will assist in: (a) the operation
o f existing and new food-based safety net programs to protect the poor, (b) ensuring market price
stability, and (c) emergency relief in times o f food shortages. Maintaining overall macro economic
stability will help avoid talung harsher measures-such             as a higher level o f expensive domestic bank and
non-bank financing. In doing so, the Government needs to monitor its monetary aggregates carehlly or
else once inflationary expectation get entrenched, the requiredresponse could be much more difficult.

67.      While the administered prices o f fertilizer and diesel have been increased recently, the
government continues to work on measures to provide targeted support to the poor.                            Reforms in
administered prices are needed to improve the financial viability o f energy and fertilizer SOEs-which
account for more than two thirds o f total SOE losses-and                  to improve the provision o f energy and
fertilizer inthe country. Energy and fertilizer subsidies are projected to be in excess o f 3 percent o f GDP
inFY09. Moreover, being largely non-targeted, there is substantial leakage ofthe subsidies to wealthier
households, as shown by a World Bank study in 2006 and further corroborated by a later study by the
IMF. Reduction ofthese subsidies would generate significant fiscal space for expanding social programs.
The World Bank and IMF studies have argued that targeted transfers using the budgetary savings to
compensate the poor would be a much more efficient way o f protecting them from higher prices.37 Even
withreasonable allowances for leakages, the transfer amounts inquestion are likely to be relatively small:
only 2 percent o f the household expenditure o f the bottom two quintiles (in terms o f per-capita
consumption) i s on petroleum products, gas, and e l e ~ t r i c i t y .The~ ~ direct effect o f higher fertilizer prices
on the poor households i s also likely to be small. Fertilizer expenditure accounts for 1.2 percent o f total
household expenditure o f the bottom quintile.




37   For further details and analyses, refer to "Impact of Fuel Prices on Bangladeshi Households: Evidence from Household
     Data" (World Bank, February2006), and "Bangladesh: The Distributional Impactof Energy Sector Price Reforms," (IMF,
     undated).
38   Evenkerosene, the most widely usedfuel by the poor-with over 90 percent of the bottomtwo quintilesreporting some use
     inthe 2000 HIES--accountsforjust 1.3 percentofthe householdexpenditureofthebottomtwo quintiles.



                                                        22

68.      These conclusions remain broadly valid even if the indirect effects of fuel price increases are
taken into consideration. There i s widespread concern, for instance, that higher diesel prices would hurt
agriculturalproductionby making irrigation more expensive. Buthousehold expenditure o f the rural poor
on irrigation-inclusive   o f diesel-is  no more than 3 percent. Similarly, public transport, another indirect
channel o f transmitting higher fuel prices, accounts for only 1.9 percent o f the average household budget
o f the poor. There may also be transmission o f some indirect distributional effects o f higher diesel and
fertilizer prices through their impact on food (particularly rice) prices.       Although hard to quantify
accurately because o f limited information, the impact on food prices i s likely to be small. Fertilizer
comprises about 10 percent o f production cost o f rice while irrigation costs are about 20 percent o f
production cost o f rice inthe dry Rabi season; moreover, the price o f rice has been increasing rapidly to
the benefit o fthe farmers.

69.      Nonetheless, any adverse impact, however small, i s bound to be painful for the poor, with
attached political and social sensitivities. Recognizing this, the FY09 budgetary provisionsTk. 5.4 billion
for targeted cash support to poor farmers for diesel, compared with Tk. 2.5 billion in FY08. The cash
subsidy i s being offered to marginal and poor rice farmers with 1.5 acres or less farmland and to those
that grow rice on the same amount o f leased land. Future increases in energy and fertilizer prices would
also promote more efficient use o f these products, discourage smuggling to India and Myanmar, and,
above all, generate significant budgetary savings than can be usedto expand social safety programs.

70.      Increased tax collection would be managed largely by improving compliance with existing tax
policy and collectingpast arrears and as such should not have any direct or indirect adverse impact on the
poor. Infact, by generating additional fiscal space, this would help finance judicious expansion o f social
programs while maintaining emphasis on macro stability.


B. EnvironmentalAspects
71.      Policies supported by the proposed operation are not expected to have any significant negative
effects on the environment, natural resources, or forests. While fuel efficiency i s expected to result from
the recent increase inthe administered prices, improving access to fertilizers at the Unionlevel may result
inincreasedusagethat couldleadto some negative impactonthe environment.

72.      The extent o f environmental degradation in Bangladesh poses a substantial social and economic
concern.    Analysis in the most recent Bangladesh Country Environmental Assessment suggests that
policy initiatives to reduce environmental health risks associated with poor water quality and urban and
indoor air pollution could result in economic savings o f as much as 3.5 percent o f GDP. A number o f
critical issues regarding environmental health, natural resource productivity, and urban and industrial
pollution have been at the center o f Bank's policy dialogue with the Government and will remain a
strategic challenge o futmost importance.


C. MonitoringandEvaluation
73.      The existing monitoring system with the household surveys-the              Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES) series4onducted roughly every five years by the Bangladesh Bureau o f
Statistics (BBS) appears to be adequate for trackmg changes in key poverty and social indicators. The
next round o f HIES, scheduled to be done in 2009-will         also help to assess the medium-term welfare
consequences o f the food price shock. The HIES also provides data to assess household level coverage
and utilization o f the existing government safety net programs. Other sources o f data like Demographic
and Health Surveys, Child Nutrition Surveys, and Labor Force Surveys complement the HIES to provide
additional welfare indicators.       Data on short term input and output indicators are obtained from
administrative data collected by the concerned ministries. The institutional arrangements for monitoring



                                                  23

and providing feedback to policy makers were outlined inBangladesh's first Poverty Reduction Strategy.
A National Poverty Focal Point (NPFP) was set up to coordinate M&Eefforts, with responsibilities that
include collating official data, developing or clarifying indicators and methodologies and facilitating
feedback from monitoring into policymalung.

74.     Repeated rounds of HIES provide a solid basis for regular monitoring o f poverty, household
consumption and inequality. The last round o f HIES in2005 was also used to simulate the impact o f the
rice price increase on household consumption and poverty.39 Since information from HIES (2005) could
only be used to "project" welfare impacts o f the food price inflation that started in 2007, a rapid survey
was conducted by the Bank in July 2008 (see Section I1above) to complement the simulation results and
to provide a snapshot o f the direct and indirect impacts o f the food price shock and o f government
programs introduced to mitigate the impact. This survey would be repeated in June 2009 to monitor the
continued impact o f the price shock and track coveragehe o f government safety net programs.
Moreover, the upcoming HIES, due to start in mid-2009, will provide a rich set o f indicators that reflect
the medium-term impact o f the food price shock on poverty and other social indicators as well as the
targeting efficiency and level o f assistance o f the safety net programs put inplace by the government.


D. FiduciaryAspects:Disbursement,Procurement,andAuditing
75.     Fiduciary arrangements for this operation are the same as those used for managing the
Government's own foreign exchange reserves at the Bangladesh Bank and budgetary resources through
the treasury system. More specifically,


  0   Disbursement. Credit proceeds will be disbursed in a single tranche and will be deposited into a
       specific deposit account o f the Ministryo f Finance and Planning established at BB for this purpose;
      the deposit account i s part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves.         An amount
      equivalent to the Credit proceeds will then be credited to an account o f the Government to finance
      budgeted expenditures.        Transactions and balances o f the Government account will be fully
      incorporated into the Government's accounting records and financial statements.


  0   Procurement. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement
      requirements will be needed. If, however, any portion o f the Credit proceeds i s used for ineligible
      purposes as defined by the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower either to return
      that amount to the deposit account or refund the amount directly to IDA. The closing date o f the
      Credit will be March 31,2009.


  0   Auditing. Starting from FY03, the Bangladesh Bank has its financial statements audited by
      internationallyaffiliated audit firm in full compliance with international standards on auditing. The
      entries o f the Deposit account will, upon request from the Association, be audited by independent
      auditors acceptable to IDA under terms o f reference in accordance with international standards on
      auditing.

76.     While recent assessments o f the fiduciary arrangements continue to highlight a weak
environment, inrecent years GOBhas made efforts to improve-the systems, which has yielded significant
results. These improvements are highlightedbelow:

      A comprehensive reformeffort to improvethe country's public financial management institutionsis
      ongoing. This effort includes reforms to improve budget planning (including by extending the

    various think-tanks inBangladesh.

       computerized which i s improving the accuracy and timeliness o f public financial information.
       Reconciliation o f budget accounts and corresponding bank accounts has also been improving and
       computerization is being extended to capture these transactions.

  0    Over the last few years Bangladesh has made good progress in improving the transparency and
       competitiveness in public procurement, an area typically rife with corruption. GOBhas made the
       Public Procurement Act 2006 effective fi-om January 31,2008 and issuedPublic Procurement Rules
       2008. With greater awareness, all public procuring entities have started following this law with
       varying degrees including the complaint redress mechanism by independent review panels,
       publication o f bid notices and contract award in websites with procurement performance data o f
       two leading agencies (Rural ElectrificationBoard and Local Government EngineeringDepartment).

       Procurement reforms in Bangladesh have made good progress. Still, there remain a number o f
       cross-cutting governance issues including inadequate enforcement o f regulations, delays in award,
       allegations o f fi-aud and corruption, and political interference. To sustain the reform, GOB, with
       Bank's assistance, has started the implementation o f a second public procurement reform project,
       largely focusing on the implementation and monitoring challenges including e-procurement and
       social accountability inthe key sectors.

  0    Onthe foreign exchange side, the recent IMF safeguard assessment confirms that progress has been
       made on strengthening BB's safeguards framework in a number o f areas, including through the
       publication o f BBs financial accounts (according to International Financial Reporting Standards),
       reconciliation of monetary data reported to the Fundwiththe audited accounts and improvements in
       foreign exchange management.

77.      A review o f the institutional arrangements for public expenditure, financial management and
procurement-including       the Government o f Bangladesh's ongoing efforts to further improve the existing
fiduciary environment-provides        assurance that the country system in place can be relied upon for
government financial management practices and local procurement o f goods, works, and services. In
turn, this gives us a reasonable level ofcomfort regardinggovernment financial accountabilitythat funds
are used for the purposes intended.

E. RisksandRiskMitigation

78.      Major risks to the proposed operation and associated risk mitigation strategies are characterized
as follows:

  o Future commodity price increases. Bangladesh remains vulnerable to international commodity
       price increases. A further increase in food and energy prices could undermine the Government's
       developmental efforts and programs for the poor. Continued highfood and fuel prices will mount
       pressure on the Government for policy responses that may be sub-optimal but politically


40  Details o f GoB's financial management program are provided in the Program Document o f the Transitional
    Support Credit (Report No. 43403-BD) that was approved by the Board in June 2008. More recently, GoB's
    vision for the second generation reform program inthis area has been articulated in "GOBVision and Medium-
    term Rolling Action Plan."     In order to assist GOBimplement these reforms, five development partners
    including the Bank have put together a multi-donor trust fund in support o f a project Strengthening Public
    Expenditure Management (SPEM).        This SPEM project supports financial management reforms in three
    government agencies: the Ministry o f Finance and Planning, Office o f the Comptroller and Auditor General,
    and the Parliament Secretariat. More information i s detailed inthe ProgramDocument o f the project.

     e~pedient.~'The objective o f redirecting resources to cope with high food prices could become
    more difficult inthe event that revenues and concessional foreign financing fall short o f the budget
    targets or if substantial new and unavoidable spending needs arise; the key actions supported by the
    proposed operation roughly cost US$ 800 million. These risks are mitigated through intensive
    monitoring by GOB and dialogue with civil society and development partners.                    GOB is also
     committed to the already established principle o f protecting priority expenditures by adjusting low
    priority spending. Meanwhile, the Bank will continue to engage with the Government, in
     coordination with other development partners, on the medium-term development issues on
     agriculture, safety nets and price risk management strategies. Finally, concessionary resources that
     would be available from projects such as the proposed one (as well as resources made available by
     the Asian Development Bank) will help mitigate the financial risk.

  o Risk to macro economic stability. Further increases in international commodity prices may put
     pressure on country's balance-of-payment if import payments continue to rise. Production for
     exports could also suffer because o f the apparently increasing fragility of power supply. In turn,
     this could affect the country's macroeconomic stability with pressure on external balances. Inthe
     past, Bangladesh's exports (mainly, garments) have been remarkably resilient: after a 5.4 percent
     decline in the first quarter o f FY08, the overall growth for the year was close to 16 percent.
     Exports, together with a rising growth o f remittances, have nullified the pressure o f the recent
     growth in import payments. Nevertheless, there remains a risk which could reduce Bangladesh's
     foreign exchange reserves. The proposed operation, along with the recent assistance from ADB on
     food crisis, i s expectedto mitigate this risk.

  o Sustainability of Reforms: There are concerns that the next elected government may dismantle or
     undermine many o f the reforms taken by the Caretaker Government. The main assurance on the
     longer-term sustainability o f the reforms comes from the past record, as successive governments in
     the past have tended not to role back policy actions o f their predecessors. More specifically, the
     social protection programs that have been scaled up and are being supported under this operation,
     have not been subject to major revamping following changes in government. Moreover, in light o f
     the crunch situation faced by the budget, financing provided by this operation would help preserve
     the government's broader reformprogram without having to cut social expenditure or fuel inflation.

  o Fiduciary Risks:Fungibilityo f funds impliesthat budgetary resources can always be diverted or
     misused. As discussed above, Bangladesh has a good record of allocating public spending to key
     development sectors and emergency relief and rehabilitation activities, as seen in the context o f
     earlier natural disasters.      Moreover, auditing arrangements, financial management within
     government ministries, and external oversight by the Comptroller & Auditor General's office are
     being strengthened. To enhance the safeguard framework, Bangladesh Bank i s strengthening its
     financial management.       A s discussed in the previous sub-section, efforts are also underway to
     improve monitoring o f performance in PFM. The Government has already developed baseline
     ratings o f the core PFM functions. The newly implemented procurement law i s expected to further
     reduce the scope for misuse o fbudgetary funds incontracting.



4' Rice prices have started to decline since April 2008. During April-July 2008 period, rice recorded a large
   decline, falling 19.3 percent on favorable prospects for new crops for most major producers. Despite the
   decline, rice prices inJuly 2008 were still almost double its price inJanuary 2008 (US$732 per ton inJuly 2008
   compared to US$375 per ton inJanuary 2008). Wheat prices have fallen by over 45 percent inJuly 2008 from
   recent peak in February 2008. However, real prices o f most food commodities are projected to reach their
   peaks only in2010 and return to their 2008 level or below only in 2015 (see RisingFood Prices: Policy Options
   and World Bank Response, April 2008 paper preparedby PREM, ARD and DEC).

Public Information Notices (PINs) formpart o fthe IMF's efforts to promote transparency o fthe IMF's views and
analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent o f the country (or countries) concerned, PINs
are issued after Executive Board discussions o fArticle IV consultations with member countries, o f its surveillance
o f developments at the regional level, o f post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments o f member
countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions o f
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided bythe Executive Boardina particular case.



On September 19, 2008, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article N consultation with Bangladesh.'

Background

Bangladesh's macroeconomic performance has been remarkably resilient in a year o f multiple natural
disasters. Real GDP growth in FY08 (July-June) remained strong at above 6percent, supported by a
strong pickup in domestic economic activity in the second half o f the year and rapid growth in garments
exports and remittances. However, inflation has picked up to average 10percent over the year, mainly
driven by escalating international food and fuel prices and inflationary pressures are expected to remain
highwith the increase in administered fuel prices implementedon July 1 and signs o f emerging demand
pressures.

The nominal exchange rate remained stable in dollar terms in FY08, but depreciated by 6% percent in
effective terms as the dollar's value decreased in international markets. Strong remittance growth, a
pickup in garment exports and external assistance kept the current account in surplus despite an increase
in the trade deficit and allowed international reserves to grow moderately (2Xmonths o f prospective
imports) ina year o f increasedimport demand and highinternational commodity prices.

The overall fiscal balance for FY08 i s estimated to have been below the budget target. Government
revenue collection improved impressively and exceeded the budget target for the first time in recent
history. Revenue was mainly h v e n by improved taxpayer compliance and collection of tax arrears. This
allowed the overall fiscal deficit to be 3.3 percent o f GDP compared with the budget,target of 4.5 percent

'
     UnderArticle IV of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMFholds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.
     A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
     economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
     discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman o f the Board,
     summarizes the views o f Executive Directors, and this summary i s transmitted to the country's authorities.

o f GDP (excluding historical losses o f the petroleum company), despite increased social spending arising
from disaster reliefoperations and better coverage o f state-owned enterprise losses related to administered
fuel and fertilizer prices. Increased external assistance allowed domestic financing to remain below
2 percent o f GDP.

Revenue administration improved markedly in FY08. The institutional framework for separating tax
policy from administration has been established and a new unit will begin work by the end o f the year.
The two Large Taxpayer Units have been placed under the control o f a single member at the National
Board o f Revenue, which should further improve enforcement. Revenue gains in FY08 reflected
improvement intaxpayer compliance arising inpart from the authorities' new universal self-assessment.

Growth inmonetary aggregates moderated inthe first half of FY08 but picked up rapidly in the last part
o f the year. Broad money growth stood at 17Xpercent at end-June. Reflecting the need to finance
increased food imports and Bangladesh Bank's (BB's) selectively accommodative monetary policy
focusing on growth-driving sectors, private sector credit growth picked up during the year and reached
25 percent inJune.

Several actions have been taken to further develop the financial sector such as strengthening the
regulatory and prudential framework o f BB, corporatizing and improving the management o f the state-
owned commercial banks (SCBs), automating stock trading, and establishing a government securities
market. However, SCBs, which still account for over 30percent o f total banlung sector assets, remain
moribund and undermine the efficiency o f the financial system. Inflexibility with regard to interest rates
inthe auctionprocess ofgovernment securitieshas limitedthe operation o ftheprimary dealer systemand
the development o f an active secondary market.

Bangladesh's medium-term economic outlook i s favorable. Though growth could slow in the near term
while inflationary pressures and other current challenges are addressed, it is projected to increase to
around 7 percent over the mediumterm, mainly driven by improvements in agriculture and expansion in
domestic services and construction, supported by strong regional growth momentum. The external current
account i s projected to remain broadly inbalance, with export and remittance growth offsetting growth in
imports arising from higher investment. External assistance and gradually increasing capital inflows are
expected to underpin a steady increase ininternational reserve coverage.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability in a
year o f multiple natural disasters and elevated food and fuel prices, which have put severe pressure on
incomes, particularly o f the urban and landless rural poor. Despite the long-term challenge o f climate
change, the medium-term outlook i s favorable. Economic growth i s expected to increase as key structural
reforms take root and the country capitalizes on accelerating growth across the region.

Directors considered that preventing an increase in inflation i s the immediate priority, as the poor and
vulnerable are hit hardest by inflation. With fiscal policy focusing on addressing the social impact o f
higher commodity prices, most Directors saw the need to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation
expectations incheck, and welcomed the recent action by the central bank inthis regard.

Directors agreed that macroeconomic policies are consistent with external stability. The external current
account i s expected to stay broadly in balance as continued growth in exports and remittances offset
growth in imports. The current exchange rate policy has allowed the real exchange rate o f the taka to
remain in line with medium-term fundamentals. Directors broadly agreed, however, that more flexibility




                                                 39

inthe rate would support monetary policy objectives and encourage deepening of the foreign exchange
market. They urged the authorities to adopt a timetable to remove the remainingexchange restriction.

Directors congratulated the authorities on the recent progress in fiscal stability. A significant
improvement inrevenue collections has helped offset increasing energy and fertilizer subsidies and larger
outlays on social safety nets. The July increase in administered prices was a bold step, which has
prevented a deterioration in state-owned enterprise finances. However, more remains to be done to place
state-owned enterprises on a secure footing and to increase poverty-reducing spending.

Directors stressed that keeping to the macroeconomic targets o f the FY09 budget will be important in
controlling inflation. Directors supported the budget's mildly expansionary stance, particularly inthe light
o f recent fiscal prudence and the need to address the social impact o f higher food prices. Given current
inflationary pressures, Directors encouraged the authorities to use any excess revenue collections to
reduce domestic financing.

Directors stressed that increasing revenue will be crucial to allow fiscal policy to return to a lower deficit
path in the medium term, while at the same time increasing essential public expenditures. They
encouraged the authorities to move forward to revise income tax and value-added tax legislation, and to
maintain recent progress instrengthening revenue administration and enforcement. Replacingopen-ended
price subsidies with more affordable and better-targeted social safety nets will help provide fiscal space
for increases in public investment and the provision o f social services. Directors urged the authorities to
address constraints inimplementing the Annual Development Program so that priority spending increases
inline withdevelopment needs.

Directors noted that further deepening o f the financial sector will help Bangladesh to achieve its growth
potential. They encouraged the authorities to give priority to strengthening the financial positions o f the
SCBs and to developing a secondary market for government securities.

Directors called on the authorities to accelerate the implementation o f structural reforms and to strengthen
institutions, in order to attract investment and prevent a slowdown in growth that could jeopardize debt
sustainability. In the same vein, it will also be important to improve infrastructure, particularly in the
electric power sector.

1. AgricultureinBangladesh:A BriefDescription

1.       The agncultural sector plays a critical role in food security and overall economic development in
Bangladesh (BD). It i s one o f the main sources o f livelihood for about 73 percent o f the total rural
population. Besides, it contributes about 18 percent o f GDP and employs about 63 percent o f the total
labor force.

2.       Out o f the total land area o f 14 million hectares (mha) o f the country, about 8 mha is arable.
Total annual cropped area, cumulative o f three growing seasons: aman, boro, and aus', i s about 14 mha.
Rice, the main crop and staple food o f the country, i s produced in about 70 percent o f total cropped area.
About one percent o f total agncultural landi s lost every year to non- apcultural use.

3.       About 60 percent o f total cropped area has access to irrigation o f which ground and surface water
account for 83 percent and 17 percent respectively. Monsoon i s the main source o f irrigation for aman
rice requiring a very limited amount o f supplementary irrigation. Boro rice i s grown exclusively with
ground water by using shallow (STWs) as well as deep tube wells (DTWs), operated by diesel and
electricity.   Thus availability and prices o f electricity and diesel are the major determinants o f rice
production in the country. Interlinked with boro harvest, subsidies on diesel and electricity significantly
influencethe price of rice.

4.       BD agriculture has been subject to significant technologcal change following the green
revolution and liberalization o f agricultural inputmarkets. This has led to an increase incropped area and
yield o f rice and thus total production. The yield o f aus rice increased from 1.1 metric tons per hectare
(mtha) in 1980-81 to 1.67 m t h a by 2007-2008. Duringthe same period aman rice yield increased from

     The main monsoon season crop, aman, is typically transplanted in June/July during monsoon rains and
     harvestedinNovember/ December. Boro is the winter season rice crop grown between Dec/Jan and MayiJune,
     mostly under irrigated conditions. The Aus rice crop i s grown during MadApril to July/Aug but its area has
     been greatly reduced with the expansion o f boro rice.

1.26 mtha to 1.86 mtha. The highest increase in yield i s observed in case o f boro crop. It increased
from 2.25 m t h a in 1980-81 to 3.96 mtha in 2007/08 (see Fig.1, 2 & 3). HYVs are estimated to occupy
about 90 percent o f rice area sown, compared to about 13 percent in the mid-1970s and 60 percent in the
late 1990s. As a result o f these increases in yields and expansion o f cropped area, total rice production
has increasedby about 150percent to levels ofnear-self sufficiency over the past 30 years.

6.       After the 1998 flood, rice production in BD increased significantly, again reducing domestic
prices below import parity levels. However, severe floods during July to September 2007 and a cyclone
in November resulted in severe damage to the aman crop, limiting the harvest to only 9.7 MMT, 1.1
MMT below the harvest of the previous year. Consequently, domestic prices exceeded import parity
levels from mid-2007. Despite India's ban on export of rice inOctober 2007, private sector imports inthe
period between the onset o f floods inJuly 2007 and the boro harvest in April 2008 were about 1.8 MMT,
1.3 MMTmore than the corresponding period in2006-07.

The 2008RicePrice CrisisinBangladesh

7.       Food prices, including rice prices, have been increasing rapidly in Bangladesh since last year.
Significant loss o f aman and aus crops due to the floods (one in July 2007 and another in September
2007) and cyclone Sidr (in November 2007) followed by India's ban on export o f rice in October 2007
led to a panic reactioninthe domestic rice market. This was compounded also by increase inrice price in
international market and banplacedon rice export by a number o f other countries.

8.       The domestic price o f rice (innominal terms) has increased by about 50 percent during the past
year (Fig. 5). As o f August 14, 2008, the retail price o f rice in Dhaka i s Tk. 3 4 k g or about 21 percent
above the procurement price o f Tk. 28kg. Average wholesale prices in 2006-07 and 2007-08 were about
Tk. 19 and Tk. 31kg respectively. Indeed as o f early July 2008 only about 20 percent o f the total boro
crop had arrived inthe market compared to about 40 percent inprevious years.

9.       Current (July, 2008) inflation i s about 10.8 percent and it shows an upward trend. There i s
anecdotal evidence o f an increase innominal wages for unskilled agricultural labor by 40 percent to 50
percent but only during the harvesting season. Thus real incomes o f the poor are likely to decline with
rising inflation. Based on data from the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), rice
(coarse, medium and fine varieties taken together) accounts for 24 percent o f total household expenditure
and 39 percent o f total food expenditure. For poor households (the bottom 2 quintiles) rice accounts for
about 33 percent o f total expenditure (and 46 percent for the bottom quintile). In the medium term rice

prices are expected to remain well above the past levels because o f increased cost o f production (which
has substantially increased in the past year) and elevated levels o f world market prices. This will
negatively affect the real income o f the poor.

Government'sinterventioninthe rice market

10.      The government has introduceda series o fprudent measures to stabilize the domestic rice market,
including the following:

    (i)ExpansionofthePublicFoodProcurementSystem(PFDS)3whichisthepublicsector's main
    mechanism for addressing household level food shortfalls. This involved the reactivation o f the Open
    Market Sales (OMS) program to sell up to 3 kg (per purchase) o f relatively low-quality rice to any
    urban and peri-urban consumer (self-targeted) at Tk. 28 (previous year Tk.25kg) through about 6,700
    outlets throughout the country and 75 BDRifles (BDR) outlets inDhaka. It also involves distribution
    o f procured rice and wheat through a wide range o f food based safety nets4(the 2008-09 estimate i s
    about 1.8 MMT o f which more than 1.4MMT is rice).

    (ii) Arrangements were made with India to import 500,000 tons o f rice (of which about 260,000 tons
    have been imported as o f August 13th).

    (iii)theoutsetoftheboroseason,thegovernmentsetanambitiousprocurementtargetof1.5MMT
         At
    out o f an estimated boro harvest o f 17.5 MMT'. In order to achieve this goals, an increase in rice
    procurement price from Tk.18kg (when production costs were Tk. 1 5 k g in last year) to Tk.28kg
    (for this year when cost o fproduction i s Tk. 21kg) was announced well before cultivation o frice.

    (iv) Government took several measures to ensure the timely delivery o f crucial inputs such as seeds,
    electricity and diesel. A card system was introduced with the help o f DAE Block Supervisors to
    make urea available to the farmers. The fertilizer i s distributed through BCIC registered private
    dealers.6Government also implemented a well targeted diesel and electricity subsidy scheme for boro
    farmers.

11.      However, there remain a number o f concerns regarding production, distribution and pricing
policies o f agricultural inputs that need to be addressed by Government in the medium- and long-run.
One o f the most important issues i s the high level o f fertilizer subsidies that creates constrains the fiscal
space. Inthis context, the recent increase in the price o f imported urea by almost 100 percent for the first
time inthe last 11years i s an appropriate right policy move.




    The PFDS involves both rice and wheat even though rice dominates.
4   Food based safety net programs are: Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program which has a development
    objective; (iii)
                   Food for Work (FFW) programs; (iv) and a wide range of smaller operations such as the Test
    Relief (TR) program (a form o f FFW). ,
5   Corresponding wheat harvest is 0.84 MMT.
    BCIC dealers used to be located at the Upazilla level but have been moved to the Union level. There are 4,850
    BCIC registered dealers currently. A union may have more than one such dealer depending on the number o f
    Wards. Dealers have been allowed to appoint 3/4 sales representatives at the Block level (each Union has 3-4
    Blocks).

111. FutureOutlook

12.      Even though current rice availability at the national level is satisfactory, there is no room yet for
complacency. Population growth in Bangladesh i s 1.5 percent per annum, adding about 2 million new
people to the population every year. Based on population and income growth, rice demand is projectedto
grow at a rate o f 2-2.5 percent per year, implyinga need for an annual increase inrice production by at
least 330,000 MT.

13.      Given the high likelihood o f an upward trend in prices o f agncultural products, Bangladesh
should focus on medium and longer-tern actions for improving the supply response in agnculture to
achieve the long-term food security. On one hand, producers need adequate price incentive to increase
their production. On the other hand, Government has to ensure that the price o f rice remains within an
acceptable limit to protect consumers' interests.

14.      Rice production can increase as a result o f either an expansion o f cropped area or an increase in
yield, or a combination o fboth. The potential for expansion o f cropped area i s limited as only less than 4
percent o f total arable land remains unsown and about 1percent o f currently cultivated area is lost every
year to non-agncultural use. Given the geo-climatic nature o f the country, it i s not possible to
significantly increase the cropping intensity from its current level o f 1.75. The only scope to increase the
cropped area i s to identify potentially arable but currently unused land in coastal zones, waterlogged
regions, monga affected areas andnear water bodies.

15.      Given the limitations for expansion o f cropped area, food security must be enhanced primarily
through technology-driven yield increase. With appropriate measures, average yield o f rice can be
increased to about 4.5 mt/ha from the current level o f 2.5 mt/ha. It i s evident from field experiments o f
BRRI and the Department o f Agriculture Extension (DAE) during 2004-06 (in 30 locations) that rice
productivity can be increased by 30 percent to 60 percent by using hybrid seed, rationalizing input
utilization and improving other crop management practices7.

16.      A number o f other complementary measures need to be taken as well in order to increase
agncultural productivity. Research-extension-market linkages need to be strengthened. Delivery
mechanisms and extension o f agricultural services must be made more responsive and farmer-fkendly.

17.      Balanced use o f fertilizer i s essential to improve the agncultural productivity. The same also
holds for seed. Seeds from a previous harvest, which have a very low yield rate, currently constitute about
90 percent' o ftotal seeds. Agnculture production can be increasedby about 10 percent through the use o f
good quality seeds alone.       Extension services should play a significant role to ensure availability,
accessibility to promote the use o f good quality seeds. Besides seed and fertilizer, increased irrigation
along with efficient land and drainage management are crucial to sustain and further increase rice
production. Access to electricity by farmers would lead to further increases inboro rice. Agriculture in
coastal areas i s not sustainable without preventing saline inundation into lands during normal weather.
Therefore, maintenance and construction o f coastal embankments, irrigation and drainage infrastructure
are crucially important.




     The DAE, in collaboration with the BFUU, has initiated and i s currently conducting a similar demonstration
     pilot (Rice Technology Demonstration and Dissemination), building on the lessons of the previous experiment,
*    underthe ongoing IDA financed National Agriculture Technology Project (NATP).
     The other sources of seed supply are BADC andprivate sector (about 5 percent each).

18.      The commitment o f the Government o f Bangladesh to agncultural sector i s reflected in her
adoption o f National Food Policy (NFP) and its Plan o f Action (POA). While public expenditure on
agncultural research has steadily declined from about 0.3 percent o f agncultural GDP during 1999-2002
to less than 0.2 percent during 2002-2005, Government recently established an Agricultural Research
TrustFundmshiGobeshana Endowment Trust (BKGET)] aimed at mobilizing and generating funds for
agriculture research.     The Government has transferred about US$ 50 million o f public funds to the
BKGET and has also created an Agriculture Research Foundation mshi Gobeshona Foundation] to
award grants for agncultural research to both public and private sector. Amendments to the Bangladesh
Agncultural Research Council Act (BARC)' are being finalized for Cabinet consideration in the next
month. The National Seed Policy o f 1993 was updated in 2004 recognizing the increased role o f the
private sector in seed production, processing,                storage and distribution.       These seed policy
recommendations need to be implemented on a priority basis. Institutional reforms o f seed wing o f the
Bangladesh Agnculture Development Council (BADC)'' were also initiated.

19.      With IDA assistance, Government is implementing two major national programs to increase
agricultural yield. The NATP, the first five year phase o f a 15 year long program, supports Government's
initiatives to improve agncultural technology.         The overall objective o f the NATP i s to support the
Government's strategy to improve agricultural productivity and farm income by revitalizing the national
agricultural technology. The National Water Management Improvement Program (WMIP) supports the
initiatives o f capacity building for flood control, drainage and irrigation through physical rehabilitation
and institutional refoms o fthe two main national water resource agencies.

20.      At Government's request, the World Bank is now preparing an Emergency Cyclone Recovery
and Restoration Project (ECRRP) which would include provisions for improving sustainable agnculture
production in cyclone affected areas. The ECRRP, which i s expected to be implemented in four years
starting in2009, would help the farmers in cyclone prone areas to adopt new varieties o f crop and better
agronomic practices, while preventing saline inundation o f agncultural lands through restoration o f
coastal embankments damaged by cyclone Sidr with improved designs for s t o m surge and cyclone
damage resilience. Inaddition the ECRRP would complete feasibility studies for two national programs
for potential public investments: one on Coastal Embankment Improvement and the other on Rwer Bank
Improvement.

             BACKGROUND      NOTE:SAFETY NETIMPLICATIONS           FORBANGLADESH



1. Context

1.       The recent food price shock has added a new dimensionto the vulnerabilities faced
by the poor. The sheer size of the population living around the poverty line' implies that a small
shock can push a large number of individuals into poverty, and many who are already poor, into
extreme poverty. High food inflation erodes the real income o f the poor much faster because o f
the higher share o f food in their consumption basket. Consequently, it i s likely that inequality
may also have increased in both absolute and relative terms due to the recent increase in food,
particularly rice, prices.

2.       The rise in food prices is likely to have adverse effects on human development
outcomes as well. A recent World Bank survey suggests that a majority o f households reduced
their food and non-food intakes as well as switched to inferior quality food. Roughly eight
percent o f households with school going children took their children out o f school: most o f these
children took up jobs.     Further, the number o f households who slupped a meal or ate less
sometimes or even more frequently in a month rose from 43 percent to 58 percent between
December 2007 and March 2008. This shows that rising food prices also risk derailing the
improvements innutrition and education outcomes.

3.       In many parts of the country which endured the main brunt of the floods of July-
September 2007 and the cyclone Sidr inNovember 2007, the hike infood and fuel prices meant a
further exacerbation o f the adverse impact o f such natural shocks on their lives and incomes.
Even though rice availability has been adequate since the "bumper" boro rice harvest; it i s
unlikely that rice price will return to their Tk. 20-22kg levels prior to the shock because o f the
seemingly permanent increase inthe cost o f producing rice. Thus, the adverse welfare impacts are
likely to persist in the near future.       Global food price projections conducted by major
organizations also suggest that high food prices are likely to remain inthe medium term. A large
part o f the extent to which welfare impacts o f high food prices on the poor i s minimized will
depend on how the Government o f Bangladesh i s able to manage interventions to ensure food
security for its vulnerable populationvia targeted safety nets.

2. The State of Public Safety NetPrograms:Coverage,Efficiency,and Targeting

4.       The Bangladesh government currently implements a wide range of safety net
programstargeted to the poor including bothcashand in kind (or food) programs.* This is
reflected in the broad categories o f safety net programs: (i)infrastructure-buildingprograms that
are essentially self-targeted workfare programs; (ii)   training programs on income generating
activities and awareness building regarding health, nutrition and legal rights; (iii)education
programs that deliver food conditional on children's education at both primary and secondary
levels; (iv) relief programs that are designed to mitigate the consequences o f disasters; and (v)
programs for disadvantaged groups like the elderly, the widowed, disabled, and freedom fighters.

    There are numerous non-government safety net programs as well. See Bangladesh 2008 Poverty
    Assessment for a detailed discussion.

The larger programs include the Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) program which has the highest
coverage, followed by Old Age Pension, Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) and Test Relief
(TR) programs.

5.       The ability to reform safety net programs represents a dynamic aspect of social
protection policy in Bangladesh.           The administrative structure and the implementation
mechanisms o f safety net programs have gone through substantive changes over the last thirty
years  -from being mostly relief oriented to ones with a much more focus on poverty reduction
and employment generation. For example, food price subsidies were replacedby targeted
food distribution. Partnerships with NGOs were forged to implement various training and
microfinance programs. The government has shown remarkable willingness to evaluate program
effectiveness, confront shortcomings and cancel or modify programs to improve performance.
For example, the highcosts and levels o f leakage found inthe Palli rationingprogram influenced
the government to abolish andreplace it with an innovative Food for Education(FFE) program in
1993. Moreover, there has also been a gradual shift from food to cash based programs, given the
high leakage associated with the former. For example, the Food-for-Education program was
transformed into a cash-based stipend program, and Cash-For-Work i s gradually replacing
the Food-For-Work(FFW) program.

6.       Nevertheless,     the   number      of     Table 1: Households participating in at least one

only 5 percent among urban households.

7.       While the overall coverage i s pro-poor, a sizeable number of non-poor also receive
benefits. Table 2 shows that the percent o f households who benefit from targeted programs
decline progressively for higher quintiles. While such progressive incidence o f coverage o f
benefits i s a positive feature, a strong area o f concern i s the considerable level o f inclusion errors
across programs. For example, 48 percent o fbeneficiaries of old age pensions are inthe top three
quintiles compared with 39 percent o f TR, VGF and VGD beneficiaries. Further, 41 percent o f
the beneficiaries o f all targeted programs are in the top three quintiles. Among the beneficiaries
o f all non-targeted programs, 45 percent are among the top three quintiles. This suggests that
targeted safety net programs do not achieve much efficiency gains over untargeted programs
(Table 2).

8.       There is therefore scope for increasing coverage and reducing inclusion errors. The
low coverage o f the target group and relatively highleakage rates o f certain programs appear to
be inpart due to wealmesses intargeting mechanisms. First, program allocations do not take into

account the geographic variation in poverty rates across the country3. Instead, the general
targeting strategy involves an initial guideline prepared by the implementing ministry, which sets
the targeting criteria, the total number o f beneficiaries, the type o f beneficiaries (including caps
on male and female beneficiaries) per union, and the amount o f transfer per beneficiary. Second,
similar programs use different criteria for targeting benefits, and these are not applieduniversally.
Further, programs such as VGD, VGF and Old Age Allowance target similar low income groups
but use different sets of criteria. Surveys show that selected individuals rarely fulfill all the
criteria for a specific p r ~ g r a m .A number o f indicators used are difficult if not impossible to
                                        ~
observe and verify.5 For example, means testing i s widely known to be problematic since income
i s difficult to measure and verify as i s the indicator "members consume less than two full meals a
day" (a VGD criterion). An alternate targeting mechanism that uses observable and verifiable
household characteristics as proxies for income, otherwise known as proxy means tests (PMT) i s
a possible option that could improve the beneficiary selection process.                    Simulations using
householdlevel data suggest that a PMT, ifimplemented properly on the ground, can identify the
poor fairly well and outperformthe current targeting methodsa6

9.        Weak administrative capacity also constrains the effective performance of
programs. For instance, the lack o f an overall coordinating authority constrains the development
o f a coherent approach to the implementation of targeted programs and the efficient allocation o f
public re-distributive expenditures.         Programs are often fragmented, administered by multiple
ministries, and have considerable overlap. Multiple and ineffective targeting systems, combined
with the large number o f intermediaries in the system, increase leakage. According to IFFU
estimates, the leakage o f transfers at the beneficiary level can range between 2 and 13.6percent'.

      For example, Sylhet has a poverty rate much lower than the national rate but nevertheless has the
      highest coverage o f safety nets among all divisions. Incontrast Khulna, which has the second-highest
      poverty rate in the country, has the least coverage o f safety nets. L o w coverage among the total
      population o f the relatively poorer districts also translates to low coverage among the poorest. Around
      41 and 28 percent o f households from the poorest decile participate in safety net programs in Sylhet
      and Chittagong respectively, compared to 15 percent inBarisal and Khulna (Ahmed, 2007).

poor.'

10.     Participation in food and cash based programs can significantly increase household
per capita food expenditure?          Although limited in scope, existing evidence suggests that
participation in safety net programs such as VGD (Vulnerable Group Feeding) and RMP (Rural
Maintenance Program) not only has a positive impact on household food consumption, but also
on calorie intake. The margmal propensity to consume calories out o f income transfers in food
(or even cash and food-cash combinations) can range between 0.23 and 0.66, and i s consistent if
not higher than the findings from safety net programs in other countries."     These results suggest
increasing the coverage o f safety nets i s likely to be an important part o f a national response to
the current food crisis.

3. Government's on-going response to the food price crisis

11.     The recent scaling up o f existing safety nets and the addition o f new programs i s a clear
indication that the Government understands the important role o f safety nets in minimizing the
adversities o f shocks. For example, some o f the steps already undertaken by GOBto respond to
the food crisis include:

12.     Expanding coverageof food-based safety netprograms in rural areas. The government
significantly expanded the safety net allocations in the new budget which took effect on July 1,
2008. Specifically, benefit levels for all programs were increased by at least 10 percent and the
existing Food-For-Work program was expanded to 1.4 million person-days.              From FY08 to
FY09, the total allocationfor safety net programs as a result increasedby 60 percent.

13.     Continuing Open Market Sales in mostly urban areas. This is a self-targeted subsidy
program which essentially involves persons waiting in queue to buy a fixed amount o f rice at a
subsidized price. The plan for FY09 is to provide 3 h l o o f rice to 3.15 million persons at a cost
o f US$ 390 million.

14.     Introducing a nationwide workfare program. The government launched a new flagship
employment generation program which i s designed to provide 100 days employment for the rural
unemployed poor. During the current fiscal year, the Government expects to target about 2
million people under this initiative, malung it the country's single largest safety net program.
Managed by the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management in partnership with local
governments, the program aims to cushion the poor against the rise in food prices. The program
design draws more on Bangladesh's own successful experience with workfare and i s in effect a
major expansion o f the existing cash-for-work model with some minor adjustments. The program
i s means tested and wages are set at Taka 100 per day -just below the lean season wage rate.
Those requesting help from the program are entitled to 100 days o f work. Ifthe local agency i s
unable to give them a suitable job, then they are entitled to partial benefits at the rate of 40 taka
per day for the first 30 days and then 50 taka per day for the remaining days on which work
cannot be provided. The program i s designed to run only during the lean season and does not

     with an initial allocationo fapproximatelyUS $300million (See Box 1for more details).

      15.    The above responses have resulted in a significant increase in safety nets spending to
     2.8percent o f GDP in FY 09 compared to 0.4percent o f GDP in FY02 (see Table 3). However,
     projected high global food prices in the medium term imply such increased spending on safety
     nets may have to be sustained for some years to come. As a medium term response, the
     Government is in the process o f designing a cash-based safety net (including the development o f
     a transparent targeting system) that is supported by the World Bank through the proposed
     National Social Protection Project. Under the project, cashtransfers will be made conditional on
     beneficiary households sending their children to primary school. The program will be piloted,
     modified as needed, and then rolled out over the next five years. Once established, it i s expected
     that the system will also have the flexibility to respond to shocks, thereby helping to mitigate the
     risk o fpoor households falling further into poverty. The project will be initially limited to urban
      areas. This i s a timely interventionsince apart from the OMS the current public safety net system
     remains primarily rural-focused and i s unable to address emerging urban social protectionneeds.
