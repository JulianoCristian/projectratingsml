(iii) a\n            new safety net program, an employment guarantee scheme, has\n            been initiated to help people in distressed areas-such as\n            those that periodically suffer from extreme food shortages,\n            known in the local dialect as Monga-abtain employment during\n            lean agricultural periods; and (iv) ensuring the adequate\n            and timely availability of farm inputs including seeds,\n            fertilizer and diesel to farmers. The FY09 budget has\n            significantly increased allocations to assist the poor deal\n            with the food crisis. GOB has requested all stakeholders\n            including the development partners to assist in this effort.\n            The Bank has been requested to provide budget-support under\n            its Global Food Response Program (GFW) to assist GOB'S\n            measures to maintain macroeconomic stability, ensure food\n            security in the immediate short-run, and help those affected\n            by rising food prices."}, "docdt": "2008-10-09T00:00:00Z"}
