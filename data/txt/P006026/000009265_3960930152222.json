Public Sector\n            Reform Loan Project is to reduce the chronic macroeconomic\n            instability that has slowed economic growth, stifled the\n            private sector, impeded job creation, and worsened absolute\n            poverty during the last decade.  The Public Sector Reform\n            Loan will reduce the public sector deficit and therefore the\n            need for inflation financing.  This loan, part of a broader\n            Bank program to help restructure and reduce the size of\n            Argentina's public sector, will support fundamental\n            reforms of the Federal Government and Monetary Authority.\n            Specifically, the loan will support major changes in:  (i)\n            revenue mobilization; (ii) expenditure rationalization; and\n            (iii) the Central Bank and its relation to the Treasury."}, "docdt": "1991-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
