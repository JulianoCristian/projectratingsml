is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL) No.\n            3394, to the Argentine Republic. The PSRL Loan to the\n            Government of Argentina, approved on July 30, 1991 was\n            designed as an integral component of an effort to stabilize\n            the Argentine economy and eliminate Argentina's\n            persistent structural deficit through targeting key public\n            sector reforms. The PSRL provided support in the\n            Government's efforts to: (i) increase revenues through\n            reorganization of the Tax and Customs Administrations and\n            reduction of industrial promotion and tax exemptions; (ii)\n            decrease and rationalize expenditures through streamlining\n            the Federal Administration, improving systems of budgeting\n            and accounting, and decreasing earmarked funds; and (iii)\n            reorganize the Central Bank so as to make it an independent\n            institution able to focus upon its core function as monetary\n            authority. The Bank's role was to offer the technical\n            assistance and financing necessary to permit the Government\n            to achieve its objectives for the balance of payments\n            without recourse to inflationary domestic credit creation.\n            The resources from the PSRL permitted the Government to\n            replace domestic borrowing (on onerous terms) with foreign loans."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
