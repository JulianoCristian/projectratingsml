FIFTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1126-CR)
PREFACE
The Project consisted of final expansion of the Rio Macho and Cachi
hydroelectric plants (30 MW and 32 MW, respectively), construction of a 30 MW
diesel plant, installation of a variety of transmission/distribution works
and completion of studies. To support this Project, the Bank made Loan
1126-CR (US$41.0 million) in June 1975 to the Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (ICE). This was the fifth of six Bank loans benefitting the
power sector in Costa Rica. The Central American Bank for Economic
Integration (CABEI) also supported the distribution component of the Project
with a loan amounting to US$13.6 million.
The Bank Loan Agreement became effective in December 1975; the
final closing date was June 1982, three years after the original closing
date. This delay was primarily due to changes in the distribution component
of the Project consequent to changes in the demand pattern of energy
consumption. The Bank agreed to these changes. However, the major project
component, i.e. the power generation units and some transmission facilities,
were completed close to the original project completion date, December 1978.
The Latin American and Caribbean Region/Energy 1 prepared the
Project Completion Report (PCR), based on the Appraisal and President's
Reports, supervision and consultant's reports, other documents in the Bank's
files, a final project report prepared by I',E, and conversations with ICE and
Bank staff. The PCR sets forth main points with respect to the preparation,
appraisal, and implementation of the Project, which was completed
successfully, notwithstanding certain delavs.
In accordance with the revised procedures for prolect performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report
to the Government, ICE, and CABEI for comments. ICE and the Ministry of
Industry, Energy and Mines sent comments which have been taken into acocunt
and which have been appended as attachments to the final report.

COSTA RICA
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
LOAN 1126-CR
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1126-CR (USS41.0 million) helped to finance installation of:
62 MW of hydro power generating capacity at two existing plants (Rio Macho
and Cachi), 30 MW of diesel generating capacity (Moin), a load dispatch
center, studies, and a variety of transmission/distribution works. The
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) also helped to
co-finance certain of the Project distribution works with a loan of US$13.6
million.
Because the Project helped to meet forecast demand increases, its
achievements can be rated an overall success. Completion of this Project,
however, required more financing and time requirements than originally
expected. The Bank-financed generation component, studies, and certain
transmission lines were completed close to the original time and cost
estimates; but because of changes in the demand pattern of energy
consumption, the borrower, Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE),
modified (with Bank agreement) the distribution component of this Project
through the addition of new substations. Because of these modifications, the
final cost and completion date were, respectively, US$70.0 million and
August 1982 as compared with appraisal estimates of US$60.0 million and
December 1978 (PCR paras. 3.1.1 - 3.1.7)
Between 1975 and 1977, the financial performance of ICE was
satisfactory as measured by sales levels, return on net fixed assets, and the
ratio of self-financing. While the rate of return remained satisfactory
through 1980, the self-financing ratio began to deteriorate because of
cash-generation shortfalls. The main cause for the deterioration was that,
due to completion delays on the Arenal and other projects, assets were placed
in service later than expected and the revenues required to produce an
acceptable rate of return were based on a lower rate base (PCR, para. 5.2.2).
In 1981 and 1982, faced with serious balance-of-payments problems,
the Government suspended debt-service payments to most foreign commercial
banks and did not authorize tariff increases sufficient to meet ICE's
covenanted rate of return (9%) or to cover its debt-service requirement.
Because of tariff increases in late 1982 and 1983 and a successful
Government-led effort to renegotiate the foreign commercial debt of the
country (including that of ICE), ICE expects to earn its covenanted rate of
return and to cover its debt- service requirement in 1983. Based on actual
costs and existing tariff levels, the internal rate of return on the Project
is calculated at 142 as compared with the forecast appraisal level of 11.82
(PCR, para. 4.3.1).
As expected at appraisal, the institutional performance of ICE
improved, except for over-staffing. To improve this situation, ICE has
instituted a hiring freeze and a policy of staff reduction through attrition
(PCR, para. 6.1.1).



COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENCE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
LOAN 1126-CR
I. Background
1.1       Bank Lending to the Electric Power Sector
1.1.1     Since 1961, the Bank has provided six loans to the electric power
sector of Costa Rica, amounting to US$114.8 million equi' ilent (Annex 1).
The primary beneficiary of these loans has been the power section of ICE.
The last two loans included some financing for sub-transmission and
distribution works of ICE's subsidiary, Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz
(CNFL). The Bank has made five loans to the telecommunications section of
ICE, amounting to US$67.7 million.
1.1.2     The fifth loan to the power section of ICE helped to finance the
Fifth Power Project, which is the subject of this report. The Bank and ICE
signed the Fifth Power Loan Agreement in June 1975. Under the Fifth Power
Project, ICE completed the third and final extension of the Rio Macho and
Cachi hydro electric power stations, which were part of a longer-term scheme
for utilizing the hydro power potential of the Reventazon River and its
tributaries which drain the eastern slopes of the central plateau. The
Bank's first three power loans to ICE helped to finance construction of the
first and second stages of development of the Rio Macho and Cachi power
stations. Mainly because of unforseeable adverse geological conditions which
were beyond the control of ICE, substantial time and cost c erruns attended
the construction of the civil works of these power stations (Annex 2).
1.1.3     The fourth loan (1972) helped to finance installation of the San
Antonio gas turbines (2 x 18.9 MW), which were required because of the
construction delays associated with second-stage extensions of the Cachi and
Rio Macho hydro power stations. The sixth loan (1979) is helping to finance
the Sixth Power Project, which ICE expects to complete in 1986, about 30
months behind schedule and with a cost underrun of about US$6.7 million. The
time overrun reflects the deferral of investment because of low market growth
which reflects the recession affecting the economy; the cost underrun reflects
the reduced cost in US dollars of the local-currency component of the project
- a reduction due to currency adjustments. ICE staff were primarily
responsible for the planning, design, and construction of the six projects
benefiting from Bank financing. All works completed under Bank-financed
projects are operating satisfactorily.
1.2       Organization of the Electric Power Sector
1.2.1     The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines (MIEM) is responsible
for overall policy direction and co-ordination of the sector. The Servicio
Nacional de Electricidad (SNE) regulates tariffs, grants concessions, and
sets technical standards. Power sector legislation confers a monopoly on the



-2-
Government for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity
but also empowers the Government to authorize private and/or municipal
entities to engage in these operations. The Government exercises its
monopoly through ICE, an autonomous agency of the Government, and a handful
of independent municipal companies and co-operatives, which together form the
National Interconnected System (NIS). Since the early 1970's, there has been
a successful consolidation of numerous small producers into fewer and larger
entities.
1.2.2     The NIS is responsible for the generation, transmission, and
distribution of virtually all of the publicly available electricity consumed
in Costa Rica. The power section of ICE and its subsidiary, CNFL, dominate
the NIS. In 1982, ICE/CNFL accounted for 97X of electricity generation of
the NIS and served 812 of its customers. ICE is responsible for electric
power sector planning and for the expansion plans of the NIS. ICE's Board is
appointed by the Government on a political basis - four members represent the
party in power; the remaining three members, the opposition party. The Board
appoints a general manager, four deputy general managers, the treasurer, and
an internal auditor and confirms appointments by the general manager.
1.3       ICE's Investment Plans
i.3.1     Since December 1980, Costa Rica has been suffering severe economic
problems, the result of high rates of inflation and devaluation, recession,
and balance-of-payments deficits. Faced with a lagging economy, ICE reduced
its investment expenditures in 1981 and 1982. Its current plans call for
completion of the Sixth Power Project; construction of the Ventanas-Garita
hydro plant and an interconnection with the power system of Panama; and
continuation of its normal distribution and rural electrification plan.

II. Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.1       Origin and Preparation of the Fifth Power Project in Costa Rica
2.1.1     While supervising (August -September 1973) the Third and Fourth
Power Projects in Costa Rica (Loans 631-CR and 800-CR), Bank staff examined
a feasibility study prepared by ICE for its proposed 1973-197B expansion
plan. The central elements of the proposed expansion plan were: extension of
the Rio Macho hydro plant (1 x 30 MW); construction of the first stage of the
Arenal hydro plant (2 x 45 MW); installation of gas turbines at Moin (2 x 18
MW);and construction of various transmission lines and substations. The
mission found the justification for the proposed expansion plan to be
inadequate and advised ICE to employ engineering consultants who would carry
out further investigations, with particular emphasis on the geology, cost
estimates, constructis timetables, and justification for the Arenal
project. ICE advised the mission of its intention to request future
financing from the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB)
amounting to, respectively, US$30.5 million and US$36.8 million.
2.1.2     In December 1973, after reviewing ICE's revised cost estimates and
construction timetables for the proposed expansion program (para. 2.1.1),
a preparation mission advised ICE to study the alternative of diesel units as
a more economical alternative to gas units at Moin. Subsequently, ICE
employed consultants to help to prepare the Arenal project as advised by Bank
staff; and in April 1974, ICE presented the Bank with a newly revised
expansion program consisting of the Arenal project and the Fifth Power
Project - namely the diesel plant at Moin, extensions of the Rio Macho and
Cachi hydro plants, and various other works (mostly transmission and
distribution works). After another review of ICE's justification, cost
estimates, and construction timetables for its proposed expansion program, a
second preparation mission (October 1974) recommended that an appraisal be
carried out in December 1974. During 1974, parallel with the preparation for
the proposed loan from the World Bank, ICE made arrangements with IDB and the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) for loans to help
finance, respectively, the Arenal project and transmission - distribution
components of the Fifth Power Project. The mission encouraged ICE to explore
fully the possibility of an interconnection with the power company of
Nicaragua as a substitute for the diesel plant at Moin. ZCE indicated that
i: foresaw a period of lengthy negotiations before an agreemenLt would be
reached with the power company of Nicaragua.
2.1.3     After visiting Costa Rica in December 1974, the appraisal mission
agreed with ICE on the following construction program for 1975-1978:
(i)  completion of projects already underway (the Fourth Power
Project - Loan 800-CR - and other projects financed by IDB and
CABEI such as the Cachi-Moin transmission line);
(ii)  construction of the first stage of the Arenal project (135 MW
rather than 90 MW);

(iii)  construction of the first stage (156 MW) of the Santa Rosa hydro
plant (later relocated at Corobici), downstream from Arenal;
(iv) installation of miscellaneous transmission, distribution and
isolated generating works and a rural electrification program; and
(v) implementation of the Fifth Power Project.
2.1.4     The mission and ICE also agreed on the following definition of the
Fifth Power Project:
(vi)  addition of one 30 MW unit and one 32 MW unit at the Rio Macho and
Cachi hydroelectric plants, respectively;
(vii)  construction of either (a) a diesel plant with 30 MW capacity at
Moin on the Caribbean coast, including the installation of a fuel
tank and substation, or (b) the Costa Rican portion of an
interconnecting transmission line with Nicaragua, and related
substation equipment, the choice between (a) and (b) above to be
made by the Bank not later than October 1, 1975 after consultation
with the Government and ICE, on the progress of contractual
arrangements for interconnection with the power company of
Nicaragua (para. 2.1.2). Because contractual difficulties were
fcreseen, the Bank indicated to ICE that it would select the Moin
plant if ICE and the Government submitted satisfactory evidence
that, despite their reasonable efforts to finalize arrangements,
completion of the transmission line by January 1, 1977 was
unlikely.
(viii) installation of a fuel tank at the San Antonio generating plant;
(ix) installation of transmission lines and substations for the Arenal
hydroelectric power plant;
(x) additions to existing transmission lines and substations for the
Rio Macho and Cachi hydroelectric plants;
(xi) completion of the transmission distribution ring around the
metropolitian area of San Jose, and related distribution equipment;
(xii)  installation of new transmission facilities to serve new or
increased loads outside San Jose;
(xiii)  installation of a load dispatching systr;                                        -
(xiv)  studies of the electricity tariff structure and the stability cf
the electric system in Costa Rica; and
(xv) a study of the engineering aspects of the load dispatch facility.
2.1.5     The appraisal mission estimated the foreign cost of the Project at
US$48.8 million (including US$8.6 million of interest during constructiou)
and the local cost at US$19.8 million (including US$3.4 million of interest



during construction). The Project financing plan called for the Bank and
CABEI to finance the foreign cost; ICE would finance the local cost with
internal cash generation, sales of bonds locally, and loans from foreign
commercial banks.
2.1.6     During Project prep ration and appraisal, Bank staff observed that
ICE's financial capabilities needed reinforcement. To limit ICE's need to
seek high-cost foreign commercial loans, the mission made the following
recommendations which the Bank accepted:
(a)  increasing the Bank loan to US$39.0 million;
(b)  conditioning negotiations to ICE's securing commitments from other
development institutions (such as CABEI for about US$9.8 million)
and to ICE's revaluing its power and telecommunications assets up
to December 31, 1974;
(c)  conditioning loan presentation to CNFL's revaluing its assets; and
(d)  conditioning effectiveness of the Loan Agreement to ICE's
implementing tariff increases sufficient to permit its power and
telecommunication sections to earn their covenanted returns on
revalued assets, respectively, 9% and 12%.
2.1.7     Later, based on new inflation estimates, the mission estimated the
foreign costs of the Project at US$52.0 million and the local cost at US$18.4
million. The Bank agreed to increase its loan to US$41.0 million. CABEI
accepted the need for increased financing on its part -- US$11.0 million for
foreign costs and US$2.5 million for local costs - but expressed doubts as
to its ability to provide financing. The Bank relaxed the earlier
requirement for negotiations - namely, that ICE secure additional financing
from CABEI - in favor of a less restrictive requirement -- namely, that ICE
secure suitable financing from CABEI or elsewhere as a coLlition of
effectiveness. As required, ICE revalued its telecommunications and power
assets.
2.2       Negotiations, Presentation, and Effectiveness
2.2.1     No major problems delayed negotiations or Board presentation.  ICE
agreed that the revaluation of the assets of CNFL would be a condition of
effectiveness.
2.2.2     On June 9, 1975, the Executive Directors of the Bank approved a
loan of US$41.0 million in support of the Fifth Power Project. The loan had
a term of 25 years, including 4 years of grace. The interest rate was
8-1/2%; the commitment fee was 3/4 of 1%. The Loan Agreement was signed on
June 16, 1975.
2.2.3     The Loan Agreement became effective on December 16, 1975 about
three montiL  1-to   The primary reason of the delay was slow action on the
part of the Government is. aporoving the revaluation of CNFL's assets. On
November 13, 1975 CABEI and ICE btgned a loan agreement providing US$13.6
million to finance the foreign costs of ICE's transmission system
(term: 15 years; interest rate: 8%; commitment fee: 3/4 of 1X).

2.3       MaJor Covenants of the Fifth Power Loan and Guarantee Agreement.
2.3.1     Annex 3 sets forth major covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements for the Fifth Power Project. The compliance of ICE and the
Government was satisfactory during the period 1975-1980. ICE did not earn
its covenated rate of return, 92, in 1981 and 1982. Its return in those
years was, respectively, 8.92 and 6.2%. The Bank accepted the lower rates for
reasons and In circumstances which are described at length in Chapter 5.
Annex 3 takes into account the borrower's comments on compliance (see para. 2
of Attachment 1).



III. Project Execution and Cost
3.1       Timetable, Changes and Costs
3.1.1     Implementation of the Project began in late 1975 and ended in
August 1982, more than three years after the original completion date,
December 1978. The Bank-financed generation works at Rio Macho, Cachi, and
Moin, related transmission works, studies and transmission works related to
the Arenal project were completed before or close to the original project
completion date. The CABEI-financed transmission works for the Arenal hydro
project were completed from 12 to 16 months behind the construction schedule
because of delayed preparation of tender documents and late equipmert
deliveries.
3.1.2     Late preparation of tender documents and/or late equipment delivery
also delayed by about eight to thirty-six months construction and/or
extension of substations associated with the San Jose ring and the existing
transmission system. The construction of certain transmission lines
associated with the San Jose ring was rescheduled by seven to fifty-four
months because of changes in load growth patterns plus delayed deliveries of
equipment. Some of the delays in preparing tender documents resulted from
the different procurement regulations of the World Bank and CABEI.
3.1.3     Partially contributing to the delayed completion of the Project
were additions carried out by ICE with Bank agreement. These additions
included the extension of the substation of Siquirres (completed in January
1981) and the redesign of the central dispatch center (completed in May
1982). A disputed contract award and slow equipment deliveries adversely
affected completion of the dispatch center.
3.1.4     The delays and additions to the Project described above required
Bank agreement for the postponement of the closing date of the loan. The
final closing date was June 30, 1982 (as compared with the original and
revised closing dates of June 30, 1979 and December 31, 1981).
3.1.5     Other changes to the Project included the following deletions: the
fuel tanks at San Antonio; construction of the substation at Alajuelita;
extensions of the substations at Ouezada, Carmen, Cocal, and Turrialba; and
certain elements of the dispatch center as originally designed. The
appraisal cost forecast of the deleted Project elements amounted to US$2.38
million. The Bank agreed to all of these changes. ICE deleted the storage
tanks because it found that existing facilities were adequate due to
lower-than-expected thermal generation; and it deleted work on the
substations because of lower-than-expected local load growths.
3.1.6     Including all changes, the final cost of the Project was about
US$70.03 million (in current prices) as compared with the appraisal forecast
of US$60.32 million (excluding interest during construction). Actual and
forecast sources of financing were:

-8-
3.1.7     Because of changes to the project, the only meaningful comparison
is between actual and forecast costs of components defined at appraisal and
subsequently completed -- that is, extensions of the Rio Macho and Cachi
hydro plants and related transmission facilities and construction of the
Moin diesel plant, the load dispatch center, various transmission works and
studies. As shown in the table below, the actual and forecast costs in
current prices of these elements were, respectively, US$64.78 million and
US$57.94 million -  a difference of only 11.8%.  In constant 1975 prices, the
actual direct cost (US$50.91 million) was only 6.4% greater than the
appraisal forecast (US$47.83 million). Most of the actual and forecast costs
of the individual Project components were close -  the result of
lower-than-expected foreign costs partially offsetting local costs, which
were underestimated. More than half of the total cost increase (US$3.08
million) is concentrated in the cost increase (US$1.80 million) of the load
dispatch center which was completed using a design concept more sophisticated
and expensive than that which was expected at appraisal. The Bank accepted
the design change for the dispatch center. Prices contingencies were
underestimated: US$13.87 million as compared with US$10.11 million.

3.2       Studies
3.2.1     ICE and the Bank were satisfied with the consultancy services for
three studies which were part of the Project: a system stability study, the
specifications for the load dispatch center, and a tariff study based on the
marginal cost of supply. The studies were completed respectively in October
1976, February 1977, and December 1977. The stability study recommended
certain design parameters for the generators of the Arenal hydroelectric
power plant which were incorporated in the final engineering design by the
manufacturers. The study for the load dispatch led to the adoption of a more
sophisticated and expensive design concept than that which was expected at
appraisal and delayed completion of the Project (para. 3.1.3) because of the
long delivery time associated with the equipment. ICE accepted the results
of the marginal cost tariff study but implemented no changes in its tariff
structure, pending further studies of the load characteristics of different
market segments.  ICE expects to complete this study in late   1984, after
which it will 'ipcuss -ronosals for a new tariff structure with the Bank.
3.3       Operation of Moin Diesel Plant
3.3.1     The operation of the diesel engines has been adversely affected by
the burn out of exhaust values, cooling-water failures, and cylinder gasket
damage. The manufacturer agreed to supply and to install a water treatment
plant and replace (free of charge) about one half of the damaged exhaust
values. The manufacturer recommended a blended fuel (Bunker C - Diesel) in
order to avoid the corrosion problems caused by the high vanadium content of
Bunker C fuel available in Costa Rica.
3.4       Bank - ICE Co-operation/Collaboration
3.4       Collaboration between Bank and ICE staff during implementation of
the Project was close and cordial. ICE's performance was professional and
satisfactory.

IV. Project Justification
4.1       NIS Load Growth
4.1.1     The main objective of the investment program, of which the Project
formed a part (para. 2.1.3), was to provide ICE with the most economic
solution to meet the load growth of the NIS during the late 1970s. The
program was successful in meeting this objective.
4.1.2     On the basis of an ICE-prepared load forecast, the appraisal report
showed summary sales of the NIS during the period 1975-1978 amounting to a
level of 5,693 GWh. Actual sales for the period amounted to 5,621 GWh, only
1.3% below the appraisal forecast. Actual and forecast summary sales
continued to be very close for the period 1979-1982 (Annex 9).
4.2       Least-cost Solution
4.2.1     The appraisal report stated that the generation component of the
Project (para. 2.1.4) was least-cost as compared with two thermal
alternatives for discount rates up to 21% - a steam power plant of 50 MW and
a gas turbine of 20 MW to be installed in 1977 and 1981, respectively; or a
gas turbine plant of 2 x 25 MW and an additional gas turbine of 20 MW to be
installed in 1977 and 1981 respectively. The expected fuel cost was US$9/per
barrel. As the actual and forecast costs (in constant 1975 prices) of the
generation components were close -- respectively, US$22.69 million as
compared with US$20.60 million - and as the per barrel price of fuel oil (in
constant 1975 prices) in Central America ranges between US$15.00 and
US$17.00, the hydro extensions remain the least-cost solution.
4.2.2     The appraisal report also stated that in analyzing transmission
works included in the Project, it was found that, where alternatives existed,
those selected were the least-cost solution for all discount rates. There is
no evidence which contradicted this judgment.
4.3.      Rate of Return or Inves.ament
4.3.1     The appraisal report included an estimated rate of return (11.8%)
based on ICE's total investment program - that is, the Project plus the
Arenal hydro project. The actual rate was 14.0%. This improved rate of
return reflects the effect of sector-wide tariff increases implemented in
1982 and 1983 (Annex 10; also, see Attachment 1, para.1 for borrower's
comments)'.

V. Financial Performance
5.1       Actual and Appraisal Forecast Financial Data, 1975-1982
5.1.1     Annexes 11 to 14 compare actual and appraisal forecast data for
the years 1975 to 1982 in the areas of: key financial ratios, income
statements, sources a-d applications of funds statements, and balance
sheets. Forecast data for the years 1975-1979 are taken from the appraisal
report for the Fift:- Power Project; forecast data for 1980-1982 are taken
from the appraisal report for the Sixth Power Project.
5.1.2     At the end of 1980, because of a steadily worsening
balance-of-payments problem, the Government replaced the former fixed rate of
exchange (USS1.00:C8.60) with a complex three-tier regime permitting
progressive devaluation. This event marked a decisive break with the
previous financial Performance of ICE. The following paragraphs describe the
financial performance of ICE before and after the devaluation.
5.2       ICE's Financial Performance
5.2.1     Before the devaluation, during the period 1975-1980, as measured by
the return on net fixed assets and sales levels, the financial performance of
ICE was satisfactory. However, the summary table below shows that ICE's net
internal cash generation was 25% less than anticipated.

5.2.2     During the years 1975-1977, ICE's summary net internal cash
generation (C320.9 million) exceeded the expected level (C289.2 million) and
funded about 22% of total financing requirements (C1,461.0 million) which
were 9.0% lower than expected; but during the years 1978-1980, this ratio
declined to 16.3%, as the actual level of net internal cash generation
(C423.6 million) was 39.5% below the expected level (C700.2 million) and
actual financing requirements (C2,586.0 million) was 6.1% higher than
expected investment. The most important reason for the shortfall of net
internal cash generation was that assets were placed in service much later
than expected - there were completion delays in connection with both the
Arenal and Fifth Power Projects (paras. 3.1.1 to 3.1.3) - and the revenues
required to produce an acceptable rate of return were based on a lower rate
base.
'Reflects adjustment in 1980 of recently capitalized operating assets and
work-in-progress to reflect revaluation of long-term debt repayable in
foreign currencies.



- 13 -
5.2.3     During the period 1978-1980, ICE covered its shortfall of
internally generated funds with long-term borrowing from development
institutions, foreign commercial bankers, and local institutions. Summary
borrowings during this period amounted to C2,071.9 million, of which
C1,254.0 million originated with foreign commercial bankers. The
corresponding forecast data were, respectively, C1,718.7 million and C721.0
million. If the local cost component of ICE's investment program for
construction and      studies amounted to 50% (or C1,254.8 million) of the
total, and if one assumes that ICE applied the proceeds of local bond sales
and local loans (C140.2 million) and all other internally generated resources
(C438.0 million) to funding local costs, it appears that ICE financed about
54Z of the local currency costs of its investment program with foreign
commercial borrow-Ings (2bout C676.6 million).
5.2.4     After the devaluation, in mid 1981, the Government ordered the
Central Bank to discontinue most debt-service payments to foreign commercial
bankers, who then withdrew from the financial markets of Costa Rica.  A
dramatic worsening of the economy accompanied the devaluation, adversely
affecting the financial performance of ICE in 1981 and 1982.  Because
Government did not grant ICE adequate tariff increases in 1981 and in the
first half of 1982, ICE earned returns of, respectively, 8.9% and 6.2%
- less than the covenanted return of 9% - and could not cover a major
portion of its debt-service obligation which had increased substantially as a
result of the devaluation of the colon.
5.2.5     Beginning in the second half of 1982, the Government instituted a
series of measures to restore the financial position of ICE within the
context of a much larger program to restore the economic equilibrium of the
country. For ICE, these measures included a series of tariff increases and
discussions with creditors, leading to a global settlement and renegotiation
of long-term debt due foreign commercial bankers.
5.2.6     By comparing actual and forecast data for 1981 and 1982 converted
into current US dollars, the summary table below highlights the impact of
devaluation, inadequate tariff increases, and suspended debt service payments
on ICE's finances. Actual and forecast summary sales were close; but
revenues and actual net operating income were about 50% below their expected
levels. ICE financed its shortfalls of net internal cash generation (US$52.2
million), long-term borrowing (US$62.4 million), contributions and other
(US$0.6 million), and modest increase of investment expenditures (US$1.6
million) with a negative change in net working capital (US$114.7 million) and
miscellaneous items (US$2.1 million). The large negative change in net
working capital reflected primarily the suspension of debt service payments
to foreign commercial bankers. The future financing of this negative net
change will represent a heavy burden for ICE. The summary table overstates
actual investment expenditures by including adjustments for cu-rency
revaluations    interest during construction.  On a cash basis, and excluding
studies and capitalized interest, construction expenditures amounted to

5.3       Asset Revaluation
5.3.1     Section 5.08 of the Fifth Power Loan AgreemPnt required ICE to
revalue its assets annually in accordance with a methodology acceptable to
the Bank and to register such revaluation on its books annually. ICE
registered its first revaluation in 1975 (para. 2.1.6); but did not register
further revaluation uatil 1978. ICE has since carried out annual revaluation
of its assets based on an acceptable methodology. The failure not to set
tariffs on annually revalued assets in 1976 and 1977 did not adversely affect
ICE's cash flow which in those years exceeded expected levels (para. 5.2.2).

VI. Organization Performance
6.1       Performance of ICE
6.1.1     As indicated by Annex 15, ICE performed well in the area of market
penetration and reduced system losses; but has not conformed to employment
target ratios. ICE has informed Bank staff that staff reduction is being
carried out through: (i) hiring freeze on staff; and (ii) staff reduction
through attrition.
6.1.2     Inspite of delays, ICE executed the project well, and reasonably
close to the original cost estimate.
6.2       Performance of Bank Staff
6.2.1     Bank staff performed well during the preparation and implementa-
tion of the Project.
VII. Lessons to be Learned
7.1       Well-Executed Project
7.1.1     As this Project was well-executed, in spite of various delays, it
illustrates no major lessons for improving project implementation.

COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
FIFTH POWER PROJECT (1126-CR)
Major Ccvenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
for The Fifth Power Project 1/
1.        Performance by the power section of ICE under the following major
covenants to the Fifth Power Project Loan Agreement was satisfactory:
(i) Sections 3.01 and 4.01 required ICE to carry out the Project with
due diligence and efficiency and to manage its affairs in
conformity with appropriate administrative, financial, engineering,
and public utility practices and under the supervision of
experienced and competent management;
(ii) Section 5.04 required Bank agreement prior to ICE's incurring
long-term debt unless ICE could cover maximum future debt service
by 1.5 times with its own internally generated financial resources.
2.        In general, ICE's performance under Sections 5.05, 5.06 and 5.08
was satisfactory, but as noted below, there were some departures from
established norms:
(i)  Sections 5.95 and 5.06 required ICE and Compania Nacional de Fuerza
y Luz (CNFL), ICE's distribution subsidiary, to earn, respectively,
9% and 5-10% as provided by Article 16 of CNFL's Concession
Agreement. Between 1975 and 1980, ICE's financial performance was
excellent, with annual returns averaging about 12%. In 1981, ICE's
return, 8.9%, was just below the covenanted return, 9.0%; and in
1982, the return was 6.2%, reflecting a six-month delay on the part
of the Government in the authorization of requested tariff
increases and the early capitalization of the Corobici Project;
(ii) Section 5.08 required ICE and CNFL to revalue annually their assets
based on a revaluation methodology acceptable to the Bank. In
1975, ICE revalued its assets for inflation experienced since 1967;
and in 1979, ICE inaugurated the practice of annual revaluations.
During the years 1976-1978, ICE did not revalue its assets because
of the low level of inflation during those years. Bank staff never
cited ICE for non-compliance; and ICE's financial rerformance
during this period was generally satisfactory (see para. 5.2.1).
3.        Except in 1981 and 1982, when tariff levels were not adequate to
permit ICE and CNFL to earn their covenanted rates of return, performance by
the Govenment was satisfactory - that is, as required by Section 3.02 of the
Guarantee Agreement, the Government took all such action as was required to
enable ICE and CNFL to fulfill their obligation under sections 5.05, 5.06 and
5.08 of the Loan Agreement. In the second half of 1982 and the first four
months of 1983, the Government authorized substantial tariff increases which
are expected to permit ICE and CNFL to earn their covenanted returns.

Sir:
We are writing with reference to your letter of November 28, 1983,
enclosing the Project Completion Report, Fifth Power Project (Loan 1126-CR),
Bank       on which you invited our commints.

whole, but we would like you to clarify the following points:

amended     Annex I. We should be grateful if you would check your calculation procedure.

Annex 3     the performance of the Power Section has been satisfactory, vith the exception
was re-

RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMNT
The Appraisal Report on the Fifth Energy Project states in Annex 12,
page 1, point c that: "The incremental benefits were calculated using the
average retail unit price of electric energy paid by the ultimate consumer...."
In the Project Completion Report the unit price used for the calculation of
the rate of return is ICE's total average retail price, taken from Annex 12
and adjusted to 19T5 prices, and including block sales to intermediate con-
sumers, such as electric energy distribution companies. Nor would it be right
to use the average retail price to ultimate ICE consumers, because the energy
generated by the plants included in the analysis benefits all consumers served
by the National Interconnected System (NIS). The average price to be used
should therefore by the one paid by the ultimate consumers of the entire
system. Table 1 attached shows these prices at current levels for each year
and deflated to 19T5 levels by the same indices as those used by the Bank.
For a more realistic measurement of the economic benefits of the
project and the impact of the tariff adjustements made since 1983, the
average actual price for that particular year should be used, deflated to
1975 prices.
Table 2 attached shows Annex 10 with the changes indicated, which
give a rate of return of 14%, i.e. higher than the 11.8% estimated in the
Appraisal Report.

ANNEX 2
COMMENTS ON AD1EX 3 OF THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Point l(i)
This refers to the undertsking to carry out the project with due
diligence and efficiency and in conformity with appropriate practices.
Since this subparagraph is included as an exception to satisfactory
performance, it would seem to imply that none of the requirements mentioned
were met by ICE, which is not the case.
We would be grateful if you would specify the exact nature of the
concern so that we can then promptly comment on it or else omit this sub-
paragraph altogether.
Point l(ii)
Reference is made to Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement concerning
ICE's coverage of debt service at the rate of 1.5 times the net income of the
Power Section.
We wish to explain here that the requirement that ICE refrain from
incurring long-term debt without the Bank's prior agreement was essentially
met. In each event of additional debts being incurred adequate Justification
was submitted and the Bank gave its approval. This area should therefore be
omitted from the exceptions to satisfactory performance by the Power Section.
Point lCiii)
It should be pointed out here that, thanks to the efforts made by
ICE to improve its financial position, the rate of return achieved in 1981
came very close to the minimum required.



Attachment 1
- 36 -
With regard to 1982, it is important to recall that ICE adopted
a series of measures aimed at achieving the minimrn rate of return, including
plans for an increase in pover service tariffs to take effect in January;
these changes were not approved until the middle of the year, however. Another
point to remember is that the financial analyses conducted at that time were
based on capitalization of the Corobici Project up to 1983; this actually took
place in December 1982, however, which affected the calculation of the rate
of return.
It must also be kept in mind that the rate of return for the period
1975-80 was very satisfactory, averaging more than 12%.
We feel that this fact and the reasons given above are important
aspects that the Bank should take into account in its comments with reference
to Sections 5.05 and 5.06 of the Loan Agreement.
Point l(iv)
Here we should explain that in 1975 ICE, conscious of the need to
reflect the value of its assets more realistically, revalued its assets on
the basis of price increases since 1967.
Then in 1976 and 1977, in keeping with its policy of not conducting
periodic revaluations unless there are any significant increases in price
levels, ICE decided not to revalue its assets, since it considered that the
inflation rate for those years was relatively low. In 1978, however, the
assets were revalued for the entire period, using the methodology specially
developed for this purpose and which has been used every year since then.
