INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECOSTPUCTCT ON A3N DLE'vEhO'ELSiZXT
REPORT AND RECuNMWENDATION UF THE PRESIDENT
Tu THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LUAN TO INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Costa Rica for the equivalent of US$410. million for a fifth power
project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including a grace period
of four years, with interest at 8½ percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Report of Costa Rica" (No. 360-CR)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 15, 1974 (R74-lOO). In
December 1974 an updating economic mission visited Costa Rica, and a memorandum
on current economic prospects is scheduled for distribution shortly to the
Executive Directors. The principal findings of the latter mission are suummarized
in the following paragraphs. Annex I summarizes the main economic and social
indicators.
3.        Costa Rica provides a rare example among developing countries of how
high per capita income growth may be achieved without an undue concentration of
development benefits in the upper income groups. A high level of investment
and rapid export growth allowed real output to grow at about 6.3 percent yearly
between 1966 and 1974, while family planning efforts and rising educational
and income levels contributed to a sharp decline in the population growth
rate from 4.0 percent in 1960 to 2.6 percent at present. Consequently, real
output per capita grew at 3i   percent per year during 1966-74 and per capita
GNP in 1973 reached US$68o.-'
4.        Agriculture continues to be the most important sector of the economy,
generating about two-thirds of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Agri-
cultural output has increased fairly rapidly in recent years, especially as a
result of Government policies to diversify and increase exports principally
of bananas and beef. Still, four products (coffee, bananas, beef and sugar)
made up about 64 percent of merchandise export earnings in 1974. Rapid
industrial growth was made possible as a result of the creation of the Central
1/   Calculated according to World Bank Atlas methodology.



- 2 -
American Common Market (CACM) and the favorable economic conditions resulting
from the growth of agricultural exports. Recently, especially in 1974,
industrial exports to the CACM and Panama have grown at a very high rate.
Industrial production, however, is highly dependent on imported inputs.
5.        The public sector has continually played a vital role in Costa
Rica's development process. The Government has given substantial attention
in recent years to improving the country's basic infrastructure such as
highways, feeder roads and the development of the hydroelectric potential
of the country. Substantial emphasis is placed on the opening up of new
areas for settlement and cultivation. At the same time, the Government has
provided a wide range of public services. About half of the expenditures
of the Central Government have traditionally been in educaticn, health,
nutrition and other social sectors. Health and nutrition programs have
been an important factor in reducing mortality rates from 22 per thousand
in the early 1960's to the present 12 per thousand. On the other hand, by
spending almost a third of its budget on education, the Central Government
has been able to improve coverage and quality of primary and secondary schools,
reduce illiteracy to a minimum and provide a good quality university education.
6.        Since 1972, when the current expenditures of the Central Government
exceeded current revenues, the public financial situation has improved sub-
stantially. The Government has increased tax revenues through comprehensive
fiscal reforms, including changes in the income tax law, increases in sales
and consumption taxes, introduction of ad valorem export taxes and administrative
improvements in tax collections. Therefore, with moderate increases in Govern-
ment expenditures, public savings increased and the Central Government overall
deficit was reduced from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1972 to 2.3 percent in 1974.
7.        The balance of payments and inflation problems, however, deteriorated
substantially during 1974. The rapid increases in petroleum and other import
prices and the drop in export prices during the second half of the year led
to a severe deterioration of Costa Rica's international terms of trade. The
efforts to maintain a high level of aggregate demand and to prevent a drastic
fall in output and employment were successful onlr through heavy foreign
borrowing, a substantial part of it on commercial terms. The country s financial
difficulties in 1974 were reflected in a deficit on current account of the
balance of payments of 15 percent of GDP. At the same time, the rate of infla-
tion (measured by the consumer price index), which averaged 4 percent per year
during 1966-72, reached 17.5 percent in 1973 and exceeded 30 percent in 1974.
Part of the explanation for the change in internal price trends has been the
recent rise in import prices, but monetary expansion must bear part of the
responsibility.



- 3 -
8.        The Government's basic development objectives include emphasis
on diversification of production and exports, employment creation, further
improvements in income distribution and higher levels ot efficiency in the
public sector. Especially urgent is the need to diversify and increase the
volume of exports in view of the recent deterioration in the terms of trade.
Although Costa Rica's income distribution p-rofile compares favorably with
other Latin American countries, the relative position of the very poorest
segments of the population has improved little in recent years and large
urban-rural disparities remain. During the 1960's considerable incomie re-
distribution appears to have taken place from the top 5 percent group to
the middle classes. The main emphasis o1 the Government's recently enacted
"Family Assistance" program is to increase the living standards of the
poorest rural families representing aoout one fourth of the population.  The
program includes, among others, rural health, sanitation, housing ana education
projects, as well as nutrition programs for school-age children and will be
financed through a recently passed payroll tax and an increase in the sales tax
rate.
9.        The Government's most immediate problems are the high inflation
rate and the deteriorating balance of payinents situation. IHeasures taken
by the authorities during late 1974 and early 1975 to help check import
growth include increases in consumption and sales taxes, restrictions on
installment credit facilities, as well as higher support prices for basic
grains which should lead to import substitution of foodstuffs. The above
measures, together with the existence of large inventories of raw materials
imported during 1974, should lead to a small decline in import volumes during
1975 while still allowing for a moderate growth in output.  Some success in
curbing imports was already evident during early 1975.  At the same time,
export promotion policies such as reduced export taxes for most traditional exT,ort
products and tax rebates for non-traditional exports were introduced and
additional measures are being considered, including the creation of an export
developiment fund and marketing outlets in the countries of the Caribbean.
On the other hand, exports of coffee and beef will be facing a difficult
year owing to world market conditions. Host basic to the success of the
countryts price and balance of payments stabilization policies is the Govern-
ment's decision to limit the rate of domestic credit expansion during 1975
and to establish controls on short- and medium-term foreign borrowing.
10.       If the various economic policy measures introduced by the Govern-
ment during the last few months, and the additional measures being considered
are effectively implemented, Costa Rica will remain creditw;orthy for the large
amounts of foreign borrowing envisaged by the Government to implement its
development program . The public debt service ratio has fluctuated around
10 percent durin7 the last few years.  The high level of co-anercial borrow-ng
during 1974 is expected to lead to a substantial increase in debt service
payments, but if such borrowing is kept under control and export pro-
motion policies are successful, the debt service ratio should remain below
13-l1h percent during the remainder of this decade.



-'-4 -
11.       Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided principally
by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Central Americar
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has been active mainly in
agriculture, road maintenance and construction, and health. IDB has been
financing mainly agricultural and industrial credit, water supply, housing,
feeder roads, power generation and rural electrification, and vocational
and agricultural education.  CABEI is active in financing projects which ha& e a
reglional impact, principally in transport, industry, power and telecoamunica-
tions. The lending of these agencies in recent years is summarized below
(net of cancellations):
IBRD     IDA      AID       I3B       CABLII/
Lending 1966-1974
Transport                          17.1                7.1     23.5       62.0

/ ,    As of June 30, 1974.
While the three major lenders -- IBRD, IDB and CABEI --have loaned comparable
amounts to date, this results from sharply increased lending by IDB and CABET
during the last few years. During the 1960s Bank lending substantially
exceeded the levels of IDB and CABEI lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       Costa Rica has received to date seventeen Bank loans and one IDA
credit, totalling US$154.6 million, net of cancellations.  The last operation,
a loan for a telecommunications project amounting to US$23.5 million,was
signed on June 14, 1974. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments, as of April 30, 1975, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.



13.       As of December 31, 1974, the Bank Group held 22.  zercent of the
US8454 million external public debt outstanding - including undisbursea -
repayable in foreign currency.  This share is likely to decrease by 198'
because of an expected increase in the a, Livity of other external lenders.
The Bank Group share of total public debt service in 197,d is estimated at
14.9 percent.
14.       In the past, Bank operations in Costa Rica have given emphasis
primarily to the development of infrastructure -- poTwer, telecommunications
and highways, which so far have received about 80 percent of total Bank lending.
During the last few years the Bank has begun increasing its assistance to
agriculture and has made a loan for education. The Bank's current five-
year plan is designed to respond to the Costa Rican development strategy in
several different ways. Through proposed loans in rural development and
agriculture and components of projects in infrastructure development, we woould
help strengthen the infrastructural base required to support the Governnentls
efforts to raise the productivity and employment capacity of the farming
sector and to support Government efforts to reduce the income and welfare
disparities between urban and rural areas. In our activities in the rural
sector, we will seek to coordinate closely with IDB and USAID not only with
a view of improving the effectiveness of lending by major external agencies
at the national level, but also to help assure that Government programs are
developed in a manner consistent with Central American priorities. In pursuit
of these objectives, a joint IBRD, IDB and USAID agricultural and rural secto-r
review is in progress in all five Central American countries; the field
survey for Costa Rica took place in May.
15.       Given the vulnerability of Costa Rica's balance-of-payments, a
second major objective of our lending would be to assist in the Government's
program for increasing and diversifying exports of both industrial and farming
origin. This approach will involve further emphasis in the selection of
projects for financing on export-oriented agriculture and agroindustries. in
addition, in order to help expand exports, particularly those in which the
products will have a substantial component of local value added, the Bank is
considering the possibility of assisting in financing of, and in mobilizing
additional external resources for, the large Boruca hydro-electric project
-which is designed primarily to supply the power requirements of a proposed
major aluminum complex. (See paragraph 1° below.) A third major thrust of
the Bank lending plan, exemplified by proposed lending in power and telecommluni-
cations, s to assist in Government efforts to improve the efficiency and
savings capacity of public sector institutions.  Aside from the electric power
project, the project whose preparation is most advanced is a highway project
designed to complete a major new highway which will not only link the capital
(San Jose) with the main port on the Atlantic Coast but will also contribute to
opening up new, potentially rich agricultural areas.



-6-
16.       IFC has made only one investment in Costa Rica ($0.6 million in 1' 6 to
Productos de Concreto, S.A.) -hich has been fully repaid.  At present, IFC is
exploring the possibility of participating in the financing of the proposed
aluminum project.
PART III - THE PCWER SECTOR IN COSTA RICA
Develooment of the Sector
17.       The sector consists of:
(i)   The National Interconnected System (NIS), dominated by the publiclyi-
owned  Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) and its
92 percento-oned subsidiary, Oompainia Nacional de Fuerza
y Luz (CNFL), but also including 10 other indepenient
enterprises. By the end of 1973, NIS served aLmost
200,000 customers, while sales reached 1,046 GWh. ICE/
CNFL served directly 71 per-cent of NIS custor,lers and
distributed 84 percent or energy sold by NIS.
(ii)  Isolated systems, the largest of which are owned by ICE, serving
(in 1973) 16,000 customers with sales of 62.8 GWh.
T.r-n  `-h1 NTS and 4he isolht,ed sys'ems  ovsether, ICE/CMFL  rnerated
of electricity sold in 1973. By that year, about 90 percent of urban an,,
50 percent of rural households in Costa Rica were receiving electricity supply;
average per capita consumption was 658 KWh. In the past 10 years power
con3umotion grew at an average rate of 10.3 percent p.a., while from 1975-81
the growth of energ consumption is projected at 9.1 percent p.a.
18.       In 1973 the country's installed generating capacity (including
39 PNlW in captive plants) reached 363.4 MW, of which ICE/CNFL operated 304LSW.
Of the latter, the Bank provided financing for 142 MW  through four
loans, beginning in 1961 and totalling US$39.8 million. The last operation,
a US$6.5 million loan of February 1972 (800-CR), provided financing for
38 MW of thermal generating capacity, transmission works and consultants'
studies.  Except for some minor components whose completion will be delayed
by 'about a year, the project is proceeding on schedule with negligible cost over-
runs. During the last ten years, the power sector absorbed about 17 percent of total
public sector investment. It is estimated that this share will need to remain
-t approximately the same (or slightly higher) level over the next several
years i. the Government is to accomplish its principal objectives in the sector,



- 7 -
which are (1) to meet the 1emand projected for the late 1970s and early
1980s, (2) to offset the effects of the energy crisis by substituting
hydro for thermal power for normal generating requirements, an objective
wh>ich is of particular importance given that Costa Rica has no known
deposits of commercially exploitabie mineral fuels and has abundant hydro-
electric resources,(3) to further consolidate the country's power sector,
and (a) to go fozward with a stepped-up rural electrification program.
19.       The principal elements of ICE's power construction  programi for the
next several years are the first stage (135 MW) of the Arenal hydro development,
for which IDB is providing foreign cost financing, and the proposed Bank
project. Based cn preser.tly available information , the next major
step after Arenal would be the first stage (l56 MW) of the Santa Rosa hydro
development, down-stream from Arenal and to be put into service in 1982. ICE
tentatively plans to have in operation by l985 the i40 MW Angostura hydro
development, a run-of-river scheme near Turrialba, which was expected to be
the next development at the time of the appraisal of the Fourth Power Project
but subsequently was found to be a higher-cost alternative than Arenal, which
also has the advantage of inter-annual storage capability. Favorable results,
however, ot studies or negotiations currently in progress or soon to be carried
out could alter ICE's expansion plans for the early 1980's.Costa Rica is
believed to have considerable sources of geothermal energy, which will be
explored in the near future with the help of,a US$1.0 million loan from IDB.
In line with Gosta Rica's efforts to promote Central American economic inte-
gration, a power-cum-navigation project is being studied  jointly with   Nicaragua
(Rio San Juan hydro development) as is the preliminary engineering of a Nicaragua-
vosta .ica interconnection which could eventually become a part of a Central Ameri-
can interconnected system. Finally, preliminary negotiations have begun with the
Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) on a 4 x 190 MW Boruca hydro development,
whose capacity would serve primarily for generating power for an aluminum
project, but which might also provide some firm capacity for NIS. In the event
of a favorable outcome oi the negotiations between ALCOA, ICE and the Government,
it is likely that the Bank and IFC will be requested to participate in
financing the power and aluminum complex.
20.       Greater sector consolidation is to be achieved through ICE's gradual
take-over on independent entities as well as through expansion of NIS to
include the small systems which are now isolated -- all of which should enable
ICE and the Government to improve considerably the quality of service available
to the public and to stimulate the growth of industries in new areas where
adequate supplies of energy have been lacking. Furthermore, sector consolidation
will facilitate ICE's embarking upon a country-wide rural electrification program,
which has been declared as one of the Government's high priorities. Basically,
ICE's strategy will be to electrify new regions in a systematic and comprehensive
manner, according to an order of priorities to be approved by the Government.
The Bank is likely to be requested to provide advice in the development of the
program.



b~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
21.       In Costa Xica each power distributing entity has its own tar.i:
structure; also a number of practices are followed in tariff-setting, which
mav not be consistent with energy conservation. At- present, for example,
all major utilities' residential block-rates decline with higher levels of
consumption.  ICE has agreed to engage consultants to study the existirg
tariff structures in the sector, with a view to proposing a simpler
and standardized tariff structure, which would at the same time sticzulate
more economic use of power. (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement.)
Sector Regulation
22.       The sector is regulated by Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (S`NI,,
an autonomous agency founded in 1941, whose decisions are not subject to
Government review, except in regard to power. and telecommunications tar-iffs.
WThile its powers are much broader, SNE has since its inception confined it-s
activity to regulation primarily of tariffs, technical standards, and
financial matters such as investment plans. In recent years, SNE has on
occasions been extremely slow in responding to utilities' proposals for tariff
increases. Particularly in the early 1970's, the lack of timely action by
ST  contributed to a deterioration in ICE's finances.  Subsequent efforts by
the Government and SNE's owin management to improve this situation have begun
to yield positive results. Durirg the past year and a half, the administrative
efficiency of SMi has shown considerable improvement.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Fifth Power Project - Costa Eicall
(No. 719a-CR, dated May 21, 1975) is being distributed separately. T'ne main
features of the loan are summarized in Annex III.  Following the review acf
the feasibility studies of ICE's expansion program through 1982, the prc`ect
was appraised in December 197h.  Negotiations were held in T7ashington from.
May 14 to 16, 1975.  The ICE delegation consisted 0o  7ng. A. .Iurray, Executive
President, as well as Ing. T. de la Torre, Ing. J. N[aroto, Ing. J. Rivel and
Lic. J. C. Mora. The Government was represented by- Ing. R. Silva, Ambassad--
to Washington and SNE was represented by Ing. R. Varfgas, Assistant Director.



_9-
The Borrower
24.       ICE was established in 1949 as an autonomous agency of the Government,
to plan and carry out a coordinated program of electrification of the country.
In 1958 it was given by decree the additional responsibility of providing
telecommunications services in Costa Rica, but it was only in 1963 that ICE
was given a permanent concession and actually began carrying out its new
responsibilities. In 1968 ICE acquired 92 percent of the shares of CNFL, which
until then, as a private comoany, operated the principal power distribution
system in the country. ICE has a seven-member board of directors, witF four
members nominated by Lhe Government and three by the opposition political
parties. Under a 1974 law the full-time position of executive president was
created for all autonomous institutions, including ICE. The executive president
is appointed by the President of the Republic and holds a rank comparable to
that of a Cabinet member. He serves as both Chairman of the Board of Directors
and chief executive officer of the entity. The day-to-day management is entrusted
to the general manager, and, since 1973, three deputy managers: for power, tele-
communications and administration/finance. The establishment of power and tele-
communications sections under deputy managers was in line with Bank recommendations for
a separation of ICEts principal operational functions, and the Bank has
obtained assurances from ICE that this organizational separation will be
maintained (Section 5.01 of draft Loan Agreement).
ICE's Expansion Program for 1975-78
25.       ICE's power construction program through 1978 includes:
(a)   Completion of on-going projects:  transmission works included
in the Bank-financed Fourth Power Project (800-CR), distribution
works financed by IDB and other projects financed by CABEI
(mainly the Cachi-Moin transmission line);
(b)  The first (135 MW) stage of the IDB-financed Arenal hydro
development;
(c)  The Fifth Power Project, described below;
(d)  the rural electrification program to be carried out and financed
by IDB's Fund for Special Operations and ICE;
(e)  miscellaneous transmission, subtransmission, and isolated
generating works to be carried out and financed by ICE; and
(f)  probably in 1977 or 1978, the initial construction of the first
(156 MW) stage of the Santa Rosa hydro plant, downstream from
Arenal.
Of the total 1975-78 ICE construction program, which is estimated to cost about
US$?10 million, the proposed Bank loan will finance 19 percent, the US$50.5 mil-
lion IDB loan for Arenal would finance 24 percent, CABEI would finance 6 percent
and ICE's own funds about 22 percent. The balance of program costs would be fi-
nanced with other borrowing, primarily long-term loans from the Venezuelan Tnvest-
ment Fund which is expected to finance local expenditures equal to about 12 per-
cent of the program costs.

Descrjipion of the Project
26.        The project represents about one third of ICE's 1975-78 construction
program and includes:
(i)   extension of the Rio Macho hydro power plant by one 30 f4W
unit;
(ii)   extension of the Cachi power plant by one 32 MW unit;
(iii)   construction of a Diesel plant of 30 MW to be located at
Moin on the Caribbean coast, including the construction of
a fuel tank and a substation or, alternatively, construction
of the Costa Rican portion of a 220 kV interconnection line
with Nicaragua 'see para. 27 below);
(iv)   construction of a fuel tank at the San Antonio gene sting
plant;
(v)   transmission lines and substations related to the Arenal
hydro power plant;
(vi)   additions to existing transmission lines and substations
related to the Rio Macho and Cachi extensions;
(vii) completion of the transmission-distribution ring around the
metropolitan area of San Jose, and related distribution
equipment (ICE would acquire certain of the distribution
items and subsequently transfer them to CNFL);
(viii)   new transmission facilities to serve new or increased loads
outside San Jose; and
(ix)   a load dispatching system.
In addition, the project will include studies of: (i) Costa Rica's electric
tariff structure, (ii) the electric system's stability, and (iii) the speci-
fications for the proposed load-dispatching system.
27.       The two hydro extensions will replace thermal generation and provide
peaking capacity. The diesel power plant is intended initially to meet the
increasing loads during the dry season (January to May) fran 1977 until the
commissioning of the Arenal hydro power plant. After Arenal is in operation
the Moin diesel plant is intended to be the main thermal generation reserve
for the dry season, replacing a 20 MW Diesel plant and a 10 MW steam power plant,
which will have reached the end of their useful lif'e.   As mentioned in para.19,
the engineering study of an interconnection line between Costa Rica and Nicaragua
is now under way. In the event that the contractual arrangements between
ICE and ENALUF (Nicaragua's power company), as well as the agreements between
the two countries, could be completed soon enough to have the interconnection
line in service by January 1, 1977 the Bank would finance the interconnection
line rather than the diesel plant, as the former would be a lesser cost alternative
for meeting ICE's generating needs. A decision as between the two alternatives
needs to be made by October 1 of this year. After that, it will be too late
to construct the Moin diesel plant in time for the 1977 dry season. It
has been agreed, therefore, that the decision to finance either the Moin thermal



p.l ui   or the 'nterconnection line would be made by the Bark no later than
Oc4ober 1, l975, after consultation with T.F, and the  ,v-r-rmntnent.  The iro-
rosed transmission and distribution w'orks are needed to transoort the eloc-
,ricity f rom the new generating sources to the load centers and to mini-
.mize losses, while at the same tine generally improving the quality of se..r-
vice and facilitatilng sector consolidation and rural electrification.  The
load dispatching system  is intended to provride a more economical operation
and  to obtain a faster response to  art> 2  or complete system outages.
28s.           The total cost of the project is es-timated at US$60.3 miillion
%wi %.h a uS$14.43 million foreign exchange component, excluding interest during
constr.,ction.  Tne -Droposed Bank loan of US$41.0 million equivalent would

Power Section
T1he operating results oIL I'E's power activities have been generally
satisfactory: since 1968 its nominal rates of return on power assets have
rang;ed from about 10 to 13 percent. Revaluation of the rate base to reflect
local price inflation, which has accelerated since 1972 and reached the annual
rtas of about 18 percent by the end of 1973, would have decreased the rate
of return in 1973 some-what below the 9 percent rate included in previous Bank
lca  agreements0  However, despite the generalliy adequate earning levels, ICE
e--rerienced severe cash problems in 1973 and early 1974, mostly because of cost
0,7runars arising froro unforeseeable adverse geological conditions encountered
-.n tie Tapanti tunnel, wfhich formed part of an earlier Bank-f'inanced project
(31-op).  The 2,overmmentls reluctance to allow an increase in power tariffs
f-rced ICE to resort to medium-term commercial borrowing.  Ne-veruheless, by
March Q97h substantial remedial ac;,.Ions were taken:  (i) power tariffs were
increased to raise the revenues of ICE's power section on average by 41 per-
cent: by the end of 197h these tariffs were further increased by an additional
22 re-rccnt to compensate for the MIarch 19T4 exchange rate urification; and
'1i ) ahout US$30 million short-to-r-ediurm term  debt was refinanced by lower-
COst, lon2gr-torm loans.  With the above actions, and despite a rate of



- 12 -
internal inflation during 1974 of over 30 percent. the nower sectioGn
achieved a rate of return for last year of over 9 percent on a
revalued rate base, and its internal cash generation was equivalent +t, aboci u
1l4 times debt service.
30.       The financial situation of ICE's power secticn is expected to stlCW
further improvement during the project implementation period. In order to
provide a sounder basis for determining the need for further tariff action,
ICE has revalued its power assets; the revaluation of CFNYL assets,
which is currently under study, has been made a condition of effectiveness
of the Loan Agreement. (Section 7.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement )
In addition, ICE has agreed to revalue its power assets anually, and I0L
and the Government have agreed that ICE's power tariff should be maintainced
at levels sufficient to generate a 9 percent return on properly valued
assets. (Section 5.05, 5.08 and 7.01 (a) of draft Loan Agreement and
Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement.)  During project implemaila-LDn,
the annual debt service coverage of ICE's power section is expected to vary
from 1.7 times in 1975 up to 2.0 times in 1978.  ICE's debt/equity ra to
is projected to improve from 56/44 in 1974 to 49/51 in 1979.  The existing
loan agreements require that ICE and CNFL obtain Bank approval for any lon,g-
term borrowing proposed at a time when net revenues of the power set-tion are
iess than 1.5 times maximum long-term debt service requirements of zhat sectio-r
for any succeeding year. The same provision is contained in the proposed loan
agreement.(Section 5.0) (a) and (b) of draft Loan Agreement.)  The exiStuin
-oan agreements also Drovide that the amount of ICE and NEL bonds reneosrooe
before their maturity date should not exceed 30 percent of the total a-OUr-n
of their bonds outstanding. This covenant is repeated in the Proposec doa
agreement. (Section 5.04 (c) of draft Loan Agreement.)
Telecommunications Section
31.        Financial performance of ICE's telecomnunications section haS al ovs
been   satisfactory, with returns ranging from 12-15 percent p.a  -- 
considerably higher than the minimum return agreed upon with the Bank. I
conjuncticn with the last loan for telecommunications (Tocan 1006-CR           X
undertook to revalue its telecommunications assets while iNE and tee             mor_
agreed that a tarnf increase would be granted by October 31,  747  tC securre
the 12 percent return on revalued telecommunications assets. ICE La-le.
to ccmplete the revaluation by that date because of a number c-f tech- ^o5
and legal difficulties, and only a 30 percent tariflof increase was approved,
in December 1974. ICE fully  revalued its telecommunications assets in
1^75 and has  applied to SNE for a 20 percent additional increase in -eele



- 13 -
communications tariffs, which would allow ICE to earn a 12 percent return
on its revalued rate base. Implementation of this increase is a
condition to effectiveness of the loan. (Section 7.01 (a) of draft Loan
Agreement.) ICE has also agreed to have its telecommunications assets revalued
annually.  (Section 5.08 of draft Loan Agreement.)
CNFL
32.       CNFL had satisfactory operating results until 1974.  However,
as in the case of ICE's power section, the returns have been calculated
on an undervalued rate base.  During 1974, CNFL was permitted to put
into effect tariff increases sufficiently high to pass on the increased
cost of electricity purchased from ICE,but not high enough to offset the
impact of inflation on its own expenses. Further tariff adjustments have
been aoproved for 1975. With these adjustments and forthcoming asset reva-
luation, CNFLts financial situation should be satisfactory for the immediate
future. To assure that the financial situation of CNFL, which is responsible
for the distribution of about 70 percent of ICE's power output, remains
sound during project implementation, the following covenants have been agreed
upon:
(i) CNFL assets will be revalued annually to account for local
inflation; and
(ii) CNFL's tariffs will be adjusted to generate revenues
sufficient to enable ICE to service the debt incurred for
CNFL's acquisition and to carry out necessary investments
in CNFL's distribution networks (Section 5.o6 and 5.08 of
draft Loan Agreement).
With the implementation of the above covenants, CNFL should be able to pay
for over half of its construction program in 1975-78 from internal cash
generation. The provision in sub-paragraph (ii) above repeats covenants
of existing loan agreements and is based on the requirements of CNFL1s
concession agreement.
33.       In view of the possibility of delays in the completion of the
Arenal hydro project and to provide against the failure of any thermal
unit during the dry season in a critical hydrological year, ICE has agreed
to prepare by the end of 1976 an energy conservation program satisfactory
to the Bank. (Section 5.09 of draft Loan Agreement.)

Project Execution
34.        ICE is considered capable of satisfaztorily executing the pro-
posed project which will be carried out as follows: (a) ICE intends to
award contracts for the diesel plant, fuel tanks and transmission lines
on either a furnish-and-install basis or, when it proves more economic,
to use its own forces to construct these works, using materials and equipment
financed by the loan; (b) ICE's own staff under the supervision of the
suppliers will erect the generating and substation equipment; and (c)
ICE's construction crew will be in charge of the civil works involved in
both hydro extensions and the power house of the Moin diesel plant, which
is acceptable because the works involved are minor and ICE has adequate
experience in this type of construction. The estimated project completion
date is December 1978.
35.      ICE has agreed to employ consultants for studying the electric tariff
structure and electric system stability and to prepare specifications for the
proposed load-dispatching system. (Section 3.02 (b) of draft Loan Agreement.)
Procurement
36.       All contracts for Bank-financed works, plant and equipment would
be awarded following international competive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
37.       Up to an estimated US$3.6 million equivalent of goods to be
financed by the Bank loan, principally conductors for the transmission lines
and construction materials, might be obtained from manufacturers in the
Central American Common Market (CACM), including Costa Rica. As in past
operations, and in accordance with the CACM Agreement, such manufacturers
would be granted a preference of i5 percent of the CIF price or the CACM
preferential tariff (which is 50 percent of the applicable external tariff),
whichever is lower.
Disbursement
38.       Disbursements from the Loan account would be made for: (i) the
CIF cost of imported equipment and materials including foreign currency costs
of erection supervision; (ii) the foreign exchange costs of contracts awarded
for major transmission lines and fuel tanks; (iii) the foreign exchange
costs of consultant studies; (iv) 95 percent of the ex-factory cost of contracts
awarded to Costa Rica manufacturers (to exclude the estimated 5 percent of
local taxes); and (v) financial charges on the Bank loan through September 1976.

39.       Because of the long lead tiLme for the delivery of hydro generating unitWs
and ICE' s need to have the Cachi and alo isPacho unita in operation at the earliest
possible moment to replace thermal generation, the Bank has approved ICE's
signing contracts for these units prior to the signing of the proposed Bank
loan. Retroactive finanlcing, therefore, of up to US$1.5 million for the down payments
'made after January 1,1575, on the Cachi and Rio Macho units is proposed.
Economic Justificiation
.         IEThe Rio Macho and Cachi extensions are the least cost solutions
for discount rates of 16.5 percent and 20.5 percent respectively when
compared to thermal generation supplied by existing units using a crude oil
price of US$9/barrel CIF. No other hydro units could be installed as
quickldly as these units. For the proposed 30 MW thermal power plant, it was
found that medium speed diesel engines were the least cost solution for
discount rates up to above 18 percent (provided, as discussed in para. 27
above, it is not feasible for an inter-connection line with Nicaragua to be
completed by the 1977 dry season).   Finally, it was found that the total
grene"ation facilities of the project are the least cost solution for discoulnt
rates up to 21 percent when compared with an all-thermal alternative.
LO.       In analyzing the transmission works included in the project, it
was found tnat, where alternatives existed, those selected were the least
cost solutions for all discount rates.
42.       Two calculations of the rate of return were carried out: (i) taking
i-nto account the generation components of the project and assuming construction
of the Moin diesel plant and the associated transmission and distribution works,
t-Ce rate of return on the project investment is 15.3 percent; and (ii) taking
into account ICEfs total investment program through project completion, including
the Arenal hydro project, the rate of return is 11.8 percent.  The sensitivity
analysis shows that the rates of return would be 14 percent and 10.7 percent,
respectively, if investment and operating costs were assumed to rise by 10 percent.
Te econlomic rate of return is indoubtedly higher because the benefits to the
<rial consumer are not measured adequately by the electricity rates which were
used to calculate the benefit streams.

C, PROJECTS IN EXECUTION a
6,64      Siquirres-Limon Highway Project:  US$15.7 Million Loan of April 2,1970-
Closing Date: December 31., 1975.
The project has been proceeding satisfactorily, with the exception
of one bridge, which will delay project completion until May 1975 -
five months behind the original schedule. The construction contract,
as awarded, was about 30 percent higher than the engineering estimate.
The Government has financed the additional costs out of its own
resources. So far there have been no cost overruns during construction.
800       Fourth Power Project:  US$6.5 Million Loan of February 24. 1972:
Closing Date: June 30' 1976.
The status of this project is described in para.18 of the main text.
801       Third Telecommunications Project:  US$17.5 Million Loan of February 24,1972:
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
After some delays attributable to revisions of the project scope and
late deliveries, the project is now progressing satisfactorily and is
expected to be completed by December 1976, which is the original
completion date.  All procurement arrangements have been finalized.
An estimated 18 percent overrun in the project total costs is expected,
mainly due to increases in local cost elements.
827       Second Agricultural Credit Project: US$9.0 Million Loan of June 5, 1972:
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is proceeding on schedule and full disbursement is expected
by the original closing date, December 31, 1976. As in the case of the
first loan for agricultural credit, lending for livestock has surpassed
appraisal estimates.  So far about 67 percent of all funds committed
have gone to livestock and about 5 percent to crops, compared with an
expected distribution of 43.7 and 41.9 percent respectively. Loans for
agro-industry have amounted to almost 30 percent of funds committed,
compared with 6.2 percent estimated at appraisal.
1/  These notes are desigred to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particu'lar to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. This should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

872       Highwa  Studies Project:  US$l.4 Million Loan of December 26, 1912:
Clon  Date: December 31,1975.
The project, which consists of detailed engineering studies for the
proposed San Jose-Siquirres and Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo Highways,
was substantially completed in March of this year, about three months
behind schedule. The delay occurred mainly because more time was
needed to explore alternative designs for a. number of bridges (using
post-tensioned concrete instead of structural steel), with a view
to reducing the estimated construction costs. The original closing
date (December 31, 1974) has been postponed by one year to permit final
payments to consultants. The total cost of the project, as implemented,
is approximately the same as the appraisal estimate.
915       Education Project:  US$6.2 IMillion Loan of June 25, 1973:
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
T1he project is over a year behind schedule -- partly because of the
delay in Congressional ratification of the Loan Agreement and partly
because of difficulties encountered in the organization and function-
ing of the Project Unit.  These problems have now been solved and a
revised and accelerated implementation schedule developed.  There may
be, however, some reductions in project scope. resulting primarily
from rapidly increasing construction costs.
1006      Fourth Telecommunications Project: US$23.5 Million Loan of June 14,l9 4:
Closing Date:  December 31L 197 .
The project is progressing satisfactorily and about US$10.0 million
has already been committed. No cost overruas or delays in implementation
are envisaged at this time. However, the asset revaluation wfhich ICE
agreed to carry out by end-October 1974 was completed only : in, `Iy 1.9l5.
ICE has now applied for a rate increase which should enable it
to earn the minimum 12 percent rate of return on revalued assets
which was agreed with the Bank.
