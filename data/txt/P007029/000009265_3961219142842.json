the institutional capacity and overall\n            policy and legal framework for adequate management of the\n            National System of Protected Areas (NSPA). Special emphasis\n            will be made in ensuring financial sustainability of the\n            NSPA throughout the establishment of an efficient fees and\n            tariffs system. While most of the project activities will\n            benefit the entire system, proposed investments will be made\n            in the Galapagos National Park (GNP) and seven of the most\n            biologically rich conservation units on continental Ecuador\n            selected for their contribution to protection of globally\n            important biodiversity (Machalilla, Podocarpus, Sangay,\n            Yasuni National Parks,and Cotacachi-Cayapas, Cayambe-Coca\n            and Antisana Ecological Reserves). Action are designed to\n            complement on-going Government and nongovernmental\n            organization (NGO) activities on the NSPA. The project will\n            seek to develop further and strengthen an innovative model\n            for strategic planning and management of biodiversity, as\n            initiated in the Galapagos National Park. The project\n            consists of the following four components: 1) Institutional\n            strengthening; 2) review and restructuring of the legal and\n            regulatory framework; 3) outreach activities inclusive of\n            community participation and raising of public awareness; and\n            4) investment activities which will provide financing for\n            civil works and infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1994-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
