System of Protected Areas (NSPA).\n            Nonetheless, it may be considered to have been satisfactory\n            from the perspective of having contributed experience in\n            defining an institutional and financial framework for\n            biodiversity protection and a research base from which to\n            develop a follow-on program. The lessons drawn from this\n            project include: 1) The project was designed to improve an\n            organization that had been given a role and a legal\n            structure without having had experience on the ground. A\n            project coordination unit was mandated to perform this task\n            form within Ecuadorean Institute of Agrarian Reform\n            Institute, of Forestry, Natural Areas and Wildlife (INEFAN).\n            This was the root of poor ownership of the project by\n            INEFAN. 2) The involvement of communities in the planning\n            and implementation of sustainable resource management and\n            biodiversity protection was shown to be important. 3) The\n            collaboration between public authorities and the NGOs and\n            bilateral communities is important. However, the project\n            failed to bring these interests together at the central\n            level. An explicit process should be included in the\n            project's basic design, with resources identified as\n            needed to make this effective at all levels. 4) The\n            monitoring and evaluation system should have been functioned\n            before the project began."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
