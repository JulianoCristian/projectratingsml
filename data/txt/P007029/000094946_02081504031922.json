      moderately unsatisfactory because although its objectives\n            were relevant and fit well with the environmental priorities\n            of the country, the project had only modest success in\n            changing the most important institutional, legal, and social\n            impediments to sound biodiversity management in Ecuador.\n            Sustainability is rated unlikely because the project largely\n            failed to build the institutional support, stakeholder\n            ownership, and social support needed to ensure\n            sustainability of project accomplishments. Institutional\n            development impact is rated modest. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated unsatisfactory. Three\n            lessons learned were: 1) The promotion of biodiversity\n            protection needs to take the political dimension into\n            account and plan and provide for building alliances in\n            support of needed reforms of the system. Lacking internal\n            and external support, many of the studies, recommendations,\n            and proposals produced by the project did not result in\n            action by the implementing agency. 2) Realistic objectives,\n            clear benchmarks, and sound monitoring are crucial to ensure\n            that project activities contribute to strategic goals. 3)\n            Excessive complexity was one of the project's major\n            flaws. To make it manageable, projects should address a few\n            crucial factors and seek to gradually build capacity."}, "docdt": "2002-07-24T00:00:00Z"}
