Most non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use\n            social mobilization techniques to encourage human\n            immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing. In 2008, Senegal\u0092s\n            national HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n            agency planned to replace social mobilization with peer\n            education strategies, having shown the latter to be more\n            effective in some contexts. In the peer-mentoring approach,\n            the information will be transmitted to only a third of\n            beneficiaries and request them to mentor at least two other\n            individuals in the community. It is hoped that transmitting\n            the information to two-thirds of the target individuals\n            through the mentors will allow the mentors to be trained in\n            a more intensive manner, and ensure that the recipients\n            absorb the material in a more user-friendly manner. Peer\n            mentoring proved to be more effective for HIV positive\n            individuals, while social mobilization proved to be more\n            effective in increasing the number of partners of HIV\n            positive individuals who come and get tested."}, "docdt": "2010-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
