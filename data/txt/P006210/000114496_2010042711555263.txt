Dear Minister Palocci: 
 
BRAZIL: GEF National Biodiversity Project (TF028309) 
 
Second Amendment to the Grant Agreement and Extension of Closing Date 
 
Please refer to the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund Grant Agreement (the 
Grant Agreement), dated June 5, 1996, between the Federative Republic of Brazil (the 
Recipient) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), acting 
as an Implementing Agency of the Global Environment Facility (the GEF), as amended on 
December 20, 2000. 
 
Pursuant to the MMA’s requests dated July 31, 2002 and June 12, 2003, and the 
approval by COFIEX dated September 3, 2002 and May 29, 2003, the Bank agrees to 
postpone to December 31, 2005 the Closing Date set forth in Section 2.03 of the Grant 
Agreement, if the Recipient agrees to amend the Grant Agreement as follows: 
 
1.  A new Section 3.07
is inserted in Article III to read as follows: 
“Section 3.07.  Without limitation to any other remedy available to the Bank under 
this Agreement, if the Recipient has not committed at least 90% of the amount of 
the GEF Trust Fund Grant by December 31, 2004, the Bank may, by notice to the 
Recipient, cancel the amount of the GEF Trust Fund Grant below that percentage 
which has not been committed by that date.  For the purpose of this Section, 
commitment of GEF Trust Fund Grant funds means the signing of contracts for 
goods and services eligible to be financed by the GEF Trust Fund Grant.” 
2. The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Grant Agreement is amended to 
reflect a reallocation of proceeds of the GEF Trust Fund Grant and an increase in
