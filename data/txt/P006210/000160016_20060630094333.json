The performances of the Borrower and the\n            Bank are rated satisfactory. PROBIO is already serving as a\n            model for numerous other biodiversity projects in Brazil.\n            Among the key lessons which have been learned through the\n            successful implementation of the PROBIO project they are:\n            1)Strategic, and include building consensus around problems,\n            priorities, and strategies for action; incorporating\n            biodiversity into other productive sectors needs to be\n            promoted to achieve the greatest impact; partnering for\n            biodiversity conservation established between diverse actors\n            can multiply potential impact and increase sustainability;\n            mobilizing the academic community to make key contributions\n            by thinking outside the conventional, disciplines,\n            addressing challenges, and helping resolve them in\n            practical, multi-sectoral ways. 2) Informational, and\n            include carefully targeting information towards key\n            stakeholders; packaging information for all target audiences\n            - scientists, policy makers, local communities, etc. - in a\n            way that is relevant, accessible, and appealing to each;\n            disseminating targeted, applied research to stimulate policy\n            debate and generation; and bringing people involved in an\n            initiative together for information exchange, as happened\n            with subproject coordinators and in the biome workshops, to\n            generate a high degree of knowledge sharing, network\n            creation, and activity stimulations; 3) Operational,\n            including involving all relevant relevant stakeholders from\n            an early stage; being creative in developing ways to\n            leverage funds (through joint calls for proposals, etc.);\n            removing 1 to 1 cofinancing requirements for each\n            transaction to increase flexibility under difficult fiscal\n            constraints; including a high level of attention to\n            methodologies and procedures; matching the calendar year of\n            the project to the fiscal year of the country; and never\n            assuming promises which depend on third parties; and\n            4)Concern subprojects, including systematic management of\n            subprojects, providing implementing teams with a kit\n            containing manuals, procedures, and key documents; knowledge\n            exchange among subproject coordinators, and reducing bureaucracy."}, "docdt": "2006-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
