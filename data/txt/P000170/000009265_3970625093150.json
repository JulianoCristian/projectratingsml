The actual credit closing date was\n            May 17, 1983, almost a year later than envisaged at\n            appraisal, and the undisbursed balance was cancelled. The\n            main objectives of the project were to raise the standard of\n            living of artisanal fishermen along Burundi' L e\n            Tanyika shore by increasing their fish production, and to\n            market fish throughout the country, thus raising protein\n            intakes and thereby improving the nutrition of rural\n            consumers. In addition, the project aimed to produce a\n            regional development plan for the lakeshore area and to\n            initiate pilot development activities. The generally poor\n            performance of the project can be attributed to a number of\n            factors, pointing to important lessons for the future: 1)\n            project preparation was defective in terms of both time and\n            technical expertise and failed to take full account of the\n            inadequacy of local managerial and technical skills and\n            there was a need for a simple and phased development\n            program; 2) the project received insufficient technical\n            assistance to offset the adverse impact of poor management.\n            Sufficient funds were available, but only about one-third\n            were utilized, partly because of recruitment difficulties,\n            but mainly because of Government/ Societe -Usine de Poissons\n            de Burundi (SUPOBU) procrastination and disinclination to\n            use the services of expatriates; 3) initial disbursement\n            delays could have been avoided had a staff member from the\n            loan administration department accompanied an early\n            supervision mission to explain Bank procedures to the local\n            staff concerned; and 4) the impact on the project of other\n            Bank sponsored developments, in particular the\n            reconstruction of the lakeside highway from Bujumbura to Nyanzalac."}, "docdt": "1985-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
