Re:

Amendment to the Loan Agreement  
Your Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Sahara Regional Development Project) between the 
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria (the Borrower) and the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated November 6, 1992. We also refer 
to the request of the Borrower to amend the Loan Agreement so as to permit the proper 
implementation of certain covenants, postponed as a consequence of the delay to 
declare the Loan effective, contained in a telex from Mr. A. Bouakane, Director of 
Cabinet, Ministry of Agriculture, dated May 12, 1993.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration, has agreed 
to the above request.  Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to read as 
follows:
1.
In Section 4.03 (b) (ii), the date December 31, 1992, is changed to the date 
March 31, 1994.
2.
In Schedule 6 (Implementation Program), paragraph 1, the date June 30, 1993, is 
changed to the date February 28, 1994.
All the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, as amended hereby, shall 
remain in full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
