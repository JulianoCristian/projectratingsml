MEMOANDUM 1AND  fCO      AO   OF THEl PRIDENT
OF THE IBID TO TME EXCUTIVE DIRECTOS
CI A  ROPO     LOAN TO THE DMOCATIC AND POPUUA REPLIC OF
FOR A SAHARA REGIONAL DLO T POJ
1.   I submit for your approval the following meorandum and recommndation on
a proposed loan to Algeria for the equivalent of US$57.0 million to help finance
a project for regional development in the Algerian Sahara. The loan would be
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years,
including 5 years of grace.
2.   BaMkgrsmnd. Since 1987, the Government of Algeria has undertaken a series
of major reforms, touching most areas of the economy. These reforms alm at
moving Algeria from a ceintrally-planned economy, to a more open, market-based
economy. Notable recent reforms include public enterprise reform and a recent
liberalization of imports and access to foreign exchange. One of the earliest
and most far-reaching reforms was the break-up of state farms into privatized
groups of farmers. Other reforms have followed, aimed at increasing production
and self-sufficiency levels; these include a renewed emphasis on development of
the nation's irrigation potential. In parallel with these production-oriented
objectives, Government continues to give priority to the promotion of balanced
regional development, especially the development of the agriculture potential
of the Sahara region. Though the region Ls home only to about 8 percent of the
Algerian population, it contributes more than proportionately to the country's
national identity and economy due to its large hydrocarbon and mineral resources.
There has been a recent trend of internal migratlon into the region. To preserve
the historic heritage and natural environment of the region, it is critical to
stabilize the local population as well as the recent migrants to the area.
Traditional agriculture needs to be supported and the means provided to maintain
adequate living standards.
3.   While considerable potential does exist for development in the region,
there are also risks, mainly related to natural resource management.  The
Government has yet to put in place comprehensive planning for the development
of this ecologically fragile zone to prevent, for example, uncontrolled
exploitation of renewable and non-renewable groundwater resources and destruction
of the delicate desert environment. The Project is designed to help Algeria meet
its objectives of lncreased production and balanced regional growth by supporting
a prudent program of rehabilitation of existing oases in the region while
addressing the institutional and resource management constraints that need to
be overcome to ensure an environmentally sound development into the future.
4.   gtionale for Bank Involvement. Further development of irrigation in the
Sahara Region has to be managed with great care to avoid upsettIng the delicate
ecological situation of the region and to ensure sustainability through careful
exploitation of the water resources. Given the Bank's successful experience ln
neighboring countries with similar development issues in a virtually identical
environment, the Bank is in a unique posltion to play a catalytic role in helping
the Government achieve objectives of economically viable growth in a difficult
are, establishing the required supporting institutions, putting in place long-
term planning for development In the area, and monitoring of the impact of this
development on the quality and quantity of water and on the quality of soil.



-2-
S.    l io=t  Objectives.    The  proposed  Project  would  (a)  support  an
.nvironrgntally sound development program for the Northern Sahara; (b) assist
Govornmet in the definition of a strategy for agricultural development within
the constraints determined by that program; (c) strengthen institutions dealing
with anangement, monitoring, and control of water resources; (d) test the
technical, organizational and managerial aspects of rehabilitated irrigation in
a first phase of renovation of oases. The proposed operation is conceived as
a pilot project. Its successful execution is expected to build up the necessary
experience for the development and implementation of a comprehensive program
which could be extended to the entire Sahara in the future.
6.    PrQgect Desgcrition.  The Project comprises the following components: (a)
Insr,tuional Develg=nt:  Strengthening institutions dealing with planning,
impleenting, and monitoring of the agricultura' development in the region,
including the establishment of monitoring systems for water use and water and
&o.l Quality, development of apf-lied research, training and extension; creation
of an agency for operation and maintenance of the common main .drainage
infrastructure; and development of a Project Management Unit to coordinate
Project execution; (b) Rehabilitation of Oases: Drilling of new and replacement
wells, provision of pumping equipment and construction of irrigation and drainage
networks over an area of about 3,550 ha; (c) On-farm Development: Improvement
of agricultural production through provision of farm implements to develop
mechanization of agricultural practices; and (d) Studies Technical Assistance
and TAiLUg:   Preparation of development plans,  feasibility studies and
environmental assessments for future investments in the sector, provision of
technical assistance and training of staff.
7.     to1iect Costs and Financl&n.  The total cost of the project ia estimated
at US$94.4 million with a foreign exchange component of US$57.3 million (61
percent).   This cost estimate includes taxes and duties, totalling US$17.5
million. The loan would cover 100 percent of the foreign exchange component of
the Project, and 60 percent of Project costs (74.1 percent of Project costs net
of taxes). Government will finance the remaining 401 of Project costs.;/ A
breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the Status
of Bank Group Operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
A map is also attached, as is the Staff Appraisal Report No. 8952-AL, dated
September   , 1991.
8.    Actions agree4.  Government agreement has been obtained on the following
actions/issues:  (a) a system to monitor water quality in the main drainage
collectors would be set up by June 30, 1993; (b) further development in the
region would be undertaken in accordance with the development plans of the region
to be prepared by December 31, 1994 and on the basis of the results obtained from
the monitoring system for wvter resources to be set up by December 31, 1993; (c)
before such plans and monitoring system are established, (i) irrigation
development would be limited to areas already distributed and (ii) distribution
of new land for irrigation would comply with the recommendations of the Water
Resource Study carried out by the UNDP in 1983 (ERESS); (d) to implement a
II is ezeotd to cover pat of tbhee co  wader a w oparate loan.

j1ropWM to clas8 eol deteriorated and non-operational wells in the 0ued R'hir
Valley and complete this by December 31, 1996; (e) to provide OPIOR, a Project
Area Agency, with funds to operate and maintain the common drainage collectors,
prior to sufficient cost ree-very from users to finance its operations; (f) to
establish formal agreements with farmers or farmers' groups to define and
allocate responsibilities Zor the operation and maintenance of the irrigation
and drainage systems financed under the Project, before awarding of the works;
(g) to establish by December 31, 1992 principles satisfactory to the Bank of cost
recovery for the operation and maintenance of the common drainage networks gad
to make these principles effective by December 31, 1996; and (h) to apply cost
recovery levels in the Project area to ensure recovery of full operation and
maintenance costs, and some reanonable portion of investment costs.
4
9.    h ne. The proposed Project has been reviewed in accordance with
the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A, "8nvironmental
Assessment" and placed in environmental screening category B.  It does not
require preparation of an environmental assessment and will support improved
environmntal managemt in the Project area through: (a) a program of studies
to promote an environmentally sound development program for the Sahara Region,
and (b) a series of specific interventions in the Oued R'hir to improve
environment and natural resources management.
10.  The proposed Project would support the preparation of an environmentally
sound agriculture development plan for the Sahara Region to be complemented by
regional agriculture development plans. The Project would support preparation
of environmental assessments, consistent with the requirements of the Goverrnmnt
of Algeria and the World Bank, as integral components of both the master plan
and wilaya development plans. Algeria supports water resource development based
on allocations of groundwater resources consistent with the ERMSS study of
regional groundwater management.  The Project would support training  in
environmental assessment to improve institutional capabilities and to maximise
the participation of Algerian experts in the preparation of the environmental
analyses for studies.
11.  Ibneft.  The directly quantifiable Project benefits will result from
incremental date production and the improvement in date quality, as well as from
increased production of fodder and vegetable crops. The improvements in supply
of water will alleviate the water shortage now experienced on all the farms that
will benefit from the infrastructure. The improved drainage system will reduce
salinity on the farms and help the quality as well as the yields of dates.
Improvements in extension advice should benefit farmers directly, as should an
increased availability of farm equipment, helping to raise yields on about 6,500
ha of farms. Both exports of dates and reduced imports of vegetables and fodder
crops from the north will result. The Project would directly benefit about
45,000 people In the Project area by raising net farm incomes and generating
200,000 mandays of employment (mostly supplied by family labor). In addition,
secondary benefits would accrue in the short-term from increased employment
opportunities, linked directly to Project activities.  In the longer term,
considerable benefits should accrue to the entire northern Sahara region, from
the strengthening of institutions to plan and oversee developments in the region
and prevent over-exploitation or pollution of water resources, and from the



- 4-
master plans for such development to be financed under the Project. The economic
rate of return of the Project is estimated ac 17 percent.
12.  IJXk..   The main risks relate to:   (a) possible delays in project
implementation and (b) lack of proper maintenance. Delays could occur because
of slow procurement procedures, problems with contractors' performance, or
shortage of construction materials. This risk would be minimized through early
preparation of bidding documents, strong supervision during the initial
implementation period, and wide use of ICB for supply of goods and execution of
works. Farmers could also be unwilling to maintain the on-farm irrigation and
drainage systems to ensure sustainability of the investments. This risk would
be addressed through strengthening the extension services and through the
provision by OPIOR of low cost services to repair and maintain the drains. In
addition, inadequate operations and/or maintenance of the infrastructure could
shorten the life of the investments to less than the originally envisaged 20
years; however, the economic rate of return on investments lasting only 15 years
is still about 15 percent. The above risks could decrease the economic viability
of the Project, but the sensitivity analysis shows that the economic rate of
return remains fairly robust.
13.  Recimuida         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
