SAHARA REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3405-AL)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Sahara Regional
Development Project, for which loan (3405-AL) in the amount of US$ 57 million was approved in
September 1991, signed in November 1992, and made effective in August 1993.
The loan was closed in June 1998, one year behind schedule. A sum of US$ 10.61
million was cancelled in May 1996. Around 64% of the revised loan amount or US$ 29.6 million
was disbursed by the end of November 1998.
The ICR was prepared by the staff of the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program
(FAO/CP) on behalf of the World Bank. Due to the precarious security situation in Algeria, no
field visit was possible and the ICR is therefore based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report,
the legal documents, the supervision reports, the Bank's project files and the contribution of an
Algerian consultant who spent one week in the country collecting relevant data/information and
one week in Rome assisting the FAO/CP in preparing the report.

SAHARA REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3405-AL)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.       The project's objectives were to: i) support an environmentally sound development
program for the Northern Sahara Region, ii) assist the Government in the definition of a strategy
for agricultural development within the constraints of the program, iii) strengthen institutions
dealing with the management, monitoring and control of the water resources in the region, and
iv) test the technical, organisational and managerial aspects of rehabilitated irrigation in a first
phase of renovation of oases. The four project components were: i) Institutional Development; the
strengthening of relevant institutions, ii) Rehabilitation of Oases; drilling of new and replacement
wells, provision of pumping equipment and construction of irrigation/drainage networks,
iii) Studies, Technical Assistance and Training; including the preparation of a development
master-plan for the Northern Sahara region, and iv) On-farm Development; improvement of
agricultural production through the provision of farm implements for mechanisation.
2.        The project costs were estimated at US$ 94.4 million (DA 2,264 million) over five
years; of which 60% (US$ 57 million) to be financed by the World Bank, 37% by the Government
and the remaining by the beneficiaries. A steering committee (Comite National de Suivi et
Contr6le) was to be in charge of the overall coordination of the project, with a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) (Bureau de Coordination du Projet), located in the key implementing
institution (Commissariat au Developpement de l'Agriculture des Regions Sahariennes -
CDARS) acting as the executive body. The quantifiable project benefits were expected to be
derived from increased date production (and improvement in quality) as well as from fodder and
vegetable production, over a total area of 6,500 ha. In the long-term, the benefits would consist of
the strengthening of the institutions involved in the development of the Northem Sahara Region.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.        The World Bank loan became effective in August 1993, 22 months after it was
approved in September 1991. The target date for effectiveness was postponed twice because the
Government had not complied with formal conditions. Apart from closing 90 deteriorated wells,
no physical realisations had been achieved by the time of the June 1994 supervision mission by
the Bank in Paris. The main reasons were the precarious security situation that had emerged and
the related delays in the procurement of goods and services. In May 1996, the Bank cancelled a
sum of US$ 10.61 million on the basis that the component concerning on-farm development could
not be implemented. Reportedly, and for unclear reasons, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) declined
to provide sufficient guarantees to the Agricultural Bank, Banque pour l'Agriculture et le
Developpement Rural (BADR) for granting necessary loans to farmers. In April 1997, the Bank
extended the loan's closing date by one year to 30 June 1998, to give enough time for the
completion of the main ongoing contracts concerning the preparation of the master-plan and the
drilling of deep wells.
ii



4.        As of September 1998, 39 vehicles - out of the 82 allocated in the SAR - had been
provided to the key institutions to be strengthened under the project (mainly CDARS, AGID and
ANRH). Only eight of the 14 computer lots were provided but the two lots of laboratory
equipment were delivered. The shortfalls are reportedly due to the fact that the MOF did not
provide the necessary funds for the procurement of all vehicles/motorcycles'. A total of 41 deep
wells were constructed and are in operation, exceeding the 39 estimated at appraisal. All the 94
lots of pumping equipment were procured, but 62 lots remain to be installed. Although 58 of the
estimated 62 km of the canals distribution systems have been constructed/rehabilitated, only
12 km of the field canals have been completed. The farmers complained that the machinery
damaged their fields and more labor-intensive methods are now being used. The project activities
in technical assistance and most of the training were never carried out, initially because of the
security situation and ultimately because the MOF did not want to provide the necessary funds for
overseas training. In terms of studies, only a first analysis in the context of the preparation of the
development master-plan for the Northern Sahara Region was completed; i.e. the identification of
development indicators. A water tariff study and a monitoring program for water salinity/quality
were also completed.
Outcome, Impact and Future Operations
5.       - Despite the fact that no proper monitoring & evaluation system was set up under the
project, making it difficult to estimate and quantify the project benefits, it can be easily stated that
the project's overall achievements were not satisfactory (only partial rehabilitation of oases and
some institutional development/strengthening) and its sustainability is most probably unlikely. So
far, yields (specially for dates) have improved on around 3,677 ha of irrigated lands. Although
less than the 6,500 ha estimated in the SAR, the irrigated areas under rehabilitation are gradually
increasing - as the rehabilitation of the field canals is being completed - and the farmers' farm
incomes are rising. There are some evidences that the farmers are willing of maintaining most of
the irrigation infrastructures through their own associations, but this remains to be seen. There are
also some evidences that the vehicles/equipment provided to key institutions - coupled with the
availability of the studies completed so far - will help them improve their operations and therefore
increase their efficiency, again, this remains to be proven.
6.        Additional funds will have to be provided by the Algerian Authorities so that the
completion studies or those under preparation can have a lasting impact. For instance, the
preparation of the master-plan should be completed and the water tariff study should be translated
- in collaboration with the irrigation water users - into operational laws and regulations.
7.        As a result of the lack of a M&E system, it was impossible to carry out a proper
financial and economical analysis. However, despite the absence of adequate data, an attempt has
been made at estimating the possible project's benefits mainly in terms of increased agricultural
production and farmers' incomes. According to the assumptions presented in Appendix 1, the
calculations show that incremental farms' incomes of about US$ 7million per year (for 3,677 ha)
might be possible. Nevertheless, the sustainability of such possible incomes is highly uncertain.
In Algeria and till early 1998, the MOF allocated in the relevant budgets all the funds necessary for all
expenditures, even when financed from external sources.
iii



Lessons Learned
8.         Some important lessons can be drawn from the overall experience with this project:
(a)  More realistic project implementation periods (and project activity schedules)
are required in situations where more than one implementing institution is
involved and/or where the public bureaucracy is known to be particularly
cumbersome;
(b)  More analytical work is needed for the treatment of the institutional aspects in
the formulation of irrigation projects, particularly when more than one
implementing agency is involved and/oi when the provision of credit is
envisaged. This is also valid in situations where farmers are being asked to take
an active part in the O&M of the infrastructures rehabilitated/constructed;
(c)  More efficient supervision approaches are required in situations where the
Bank's field supervisions by Bank staff are limited;
(d)  The setting up of a proper M&E system is crucial to an efficient project
implementation and should take place at the very beginning of the project. In
fact, the necessary base data for the "without project" scenario should start to
be collected/analysed at the beginning of the project;
(e)  The use of heavy machinery for civil works in small farms is problematic and
should be considered with great care. More labor-intensive techniques could be
envisaged at the design stage as an alternative; and
(f)  In cases where loans are closed with important project activities remaining to
be carried out, and where most of the benefits stated at appraisal could still be
achieved, the Bank should formulate an action program with the Government
for the purpose of reinforcing the implementation plan set at appraisal.

SAHARA REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3405-AL)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.        The rationale of the Sahara Regional Development Project was that the development
of the Northern Sahara - more specifically irrigation in the region - constituted an important
objective for the Government and that the region's fragile ecology required the introduction of
environmentally and economically sound strategies/approaches. Consequently, the project's
central objective was: "the establishment of the framework and of the criteria (technical,
economical, environmental) for the future development of the Sahara and the strengthening of the
appropriate institutions".
2.        The project's specific objectives were to: i) support an environmentally sound
development program for the Northern Sahara, ii) assist the Government in the definition of a
strategy for agricultural development within the constraints determined by that program,
iii) strengthen institutions dealing with management, monitoring and control of water resources,
and iv) test the technical, organisational and managerial aspects of rehabilitated irrigation in a first
phase of renovation of oases'. The project components were:
(a)  Institutional Development. Strengthening the institutions dealing with
planning, implementing and monitoring agricultural development in the region,
including the establishment of monitoring systems for water use and for
water/soil quality; development of applied research, training and extension;
creation of an agency for the operation & maintenance (O&M) of the common
main drainage infrastructures; and development of a Project Coordination Unit
for project execution,
(b)  Rehabilitation of Oases. Drilling of new and replacement of existing wells,
provision of pumping equipment and construction of irrigation and drainage
networks over an area of about 6,500 ha,
(c)  Studies, Technical Assistance and Training. Preparation of a water tariff
study, a Master Plan for the Northern Sahara Region and a monitoring program
for water quality, provision of technical assistance and training of staff,
(d)  On-farm Development. Improvement of agricultural production through the
provision of farm implements for mechanisation.
See SARNo. 8952-AL, 4 September 1991.



3.        The project costs were estimated at US$ 94.4 million (DA 2,264 million) over five
years; of which 60% (US$ 57 million) to be financed by the World Bank, 37% by the Government
and the remaining by the beneficiaries. A steering committee (Comite National de Suivi et
Contr6le) was to be in charge of the overall coordination of the project, with a Project
Coordination Unit (Bureau de Coordination du Projet, located in the key implementing institution
(Commissariat au Developpement de l 'Agriculture des Regions Sahariennes - CDARS) acting as
the executive body. The quantifiable project benefits were expected to be derived from increased
date production (and improvement in quality) as well as from fodder and vegetable production,
over a total area of 6,500 ha. In the long-term, the benefits would consist of the strengthening of
the institutions involved in the development of the Northern Sahara Region.
4.        With the benefit of hindsight, it can be stated that the project objectives were
potentially achievable but not in the time period envisaged (five years). It was perhaps not
possible to foresee the problems associated with the precarious security situation in the country.
However, the implementation of the project predictably required major efforts in coordination -
several implementing institutions involved (mainly CDARS, AGID and ANRH) - as well as in
organisation. The public bureaucracy was, and still is, cumbersome and slow. It would have been
more cautious to carry out the formulation of the development master-plan of the Northern Sahara
Region (included in component c) separately and preferably before undertaking the other
components (which, in principle, should be derived from it).
5.        The on-farm development component was dropped (luring project implementation.
Given the issues raised later in this text on the matter, it is fair to say that the formulation of the
component - and its objective of farm mechanisation - should have been preceded by much more
analytical work than apparently carried out at project preparation/appraisal. Finally, it could also
be said that the amount of international technical assistance - (more than 70 person/months
according to the SAR) was exaggerated and did not take fully into account the existing human
resources in the Algerian private as well as public sectors. In fact, the nationals managed,
practically by themselves, to carry out a number of the tasks expected to be achieved by (or with)
international assistance (e.g. the preparation of a monitoring program for water salinity/quality).
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.        The project has not achieved its central objective of "the establishment of the
framework and of the criteria (technical, economical, environmental) for the future development
of the Sahara". It nevertheless has made marked contributions in terms of rehabilitation of oases
and institutional development.
7.        Marked results have been obtained with the construction of 41 new deep wells and
the construction/rehabilitation of irrigation/drainage infrastructures (see para. 16). Because of
these physical realisations, yields (mainly for dates) have improved on around 3,677 ha of
irrigated lands so far. Although less than the 6,500 ha estimated in the SAR, the aggregated size
of the rehabilitated areas is progressing - as the rehabilitation of the remaining field canals is still
underway - and the farmers' incomes are gradually raising (see Appendix 1). There are some
evidences that the vehicles/equipment provided to various key institutions (mainly CDARS,
AGID, ANRH and to the field services) will help them improve their operations and, therefore,
increase their efficiency.
8.        The three studies prepared in the context of the project (see para. 17) should help the
various public institutions involved in the development of the Northern Sahara Region achieve
some of their respective goals, in particular setting criteria/indicators for the agricultural
development of the region, setting up a cost-recovery system for irrigation water users, and
monitoring water salinity/quality over the region. However, more analytical and preparatory work
2



needs to be carried out for the full benefits of these studies to materialise. For example, several
other studies will be necessary for completing the master-plan of the Northern Sahara Region.
Until then, the practical usefulness of the master-plan studies already accomplished will be
limited.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
9.        The World Bank loan became effective in August 1993, 22 months after the Board's
approval in September 1991 (see Table 3 of Part II). The target date for effectiveness was
postponed twice because the Government had not complied with formal conditions (mainly legal
opinion, loan approval and loan official publication). The presidential decree ratifying the loan in
July 1993 also established two steering committees: a Comite National de Suivi et Contr6le and a
Comite Local de Coordination. The Bureau de Coordination du Projet (Project Coordination Unit
- PCU) held two meetings with all the implementing institutions involved (mainly CDARS, AGID
and ANRH) in the second part of 1993 to prepare a five-year action plan for the project as well as
a work program for 1994. AGID had taken advantage of the time lag between the loan signature
and effectiveness to prepare the bidding documents for the drainage and irrigation civil works but
the PCU was still behind schedule with the preparation of the bidding documents for the
formulation of the master-plan.
10.       The first supervision mission by the Bank (September 1993, in Algeria) found that the
low operational capacity of the PCU, as well as the often lengthy bureaucratic procedures in
Algeria, were the main causes for the numerous delays in preparing the various bidding
documents. It recommended to strengthen the PCU by adding an accountant and an agronomist to
the newly appointed chief. It also encouraged the two steering committees to improve their overall
coordination of the project's activities. In December 1993, the required project special account
was set up at the Central Bank in Algiers and a contract between the Government and FAO, for
the provision of technical assistance and training, was signed l. The Ministry of Planning also
allocated the agreed counterpart funds to the 1994 budget of the CDARS, the key implementing
institution.
11.       Apart from closing 90 deteriorated wells out of the 480 in the project area, no
physical realisations had been achieved by the time of the June 1994 supervision mission by the
Bank in Paris. The main reasons were the security situation and the related delays in the
procurement of the goods (mainly vehicles/equipment) and services (mainly international
technical assistance). No consulting firm made a credible bid for the formulation of the master-
plan and most foreign experts were reluctant to work in Algeria. In addition, the FAO indicated
that for security reasons, it could not carry out the technical assistance and training activities
under its contract. The 1994 supervision mission indicated that: "it does not seem judicious to
allow the rehabilitation works to start before the completion of the master-plan and of a water
tariff study". The water tariff study was meant to pave the way for a formal agreement between
the irrigators and the Government on their respective financial participation in the investment and
O&M costs of the irrigation/drainage infrastructures. A specific covenant in the loan agreement
specified that the master-plan should be prepared by December 1994 and that a proposal for the
schedule of application of water tariffs should have been sent to the Bank by March 1994.
Subsequently to the 1994 mission, an Algerian public consulting firm, Bureau National d 'Etudes
pour le Developpement Rural - BNEDER, was contracted to carry out the water tariff study. A
preliminary report, with a model-agreement for cost recovery to be signed between irrigators and
In August 1993, the Bank sent a no-objection telex for the establishment of a Trust-Fund managed by the
FAO to carry out the technical assistance and training under the project.
3



the Government 1, was sent to the Bank in July 1994. A second report, including the Bank's
previous comments, was re-submitted in November 1994 and approved by the Bank.
12.       Already in August 1994, the Bank had envisaged the cancellation of the loan if no
significant progress could be shown before the end of the year. A July 1995 supervision mission,
held in Tunis, expressed concern about the slow progress achieved so far and suggested to
reconsider the technical assistance and training under the project. These two types of intervention
could be separated and alternatives found for their implementation - ex: use of national experts
and training abroad. The mission also requested that the PCU, in collaboration with all the
implementing institutions, set up a monitoring & evaluation (M&E) system 2. In November 1995,
the Bank suggested officially to the Government that the loan be closed since no disbursements
had yet been made, apart from the initial US$ 2 million in the special account. In May 1996, the
Bank at the Government request cancelled a sum of US$ 10.61 million on the basis that the on-
farm development component could not be implemented. In April 1997, the Bank extended the
closing date of the loan by one year to 30 June 1998, to give enough time for the completion of
the main ongoing contracts concerning the preparation of the master-plan and the drilling of deep
wells.
13.       The May 1997 supervision mission, held in Nimes, France, found that the situation
concerning the procurement of goods and services had improved markedly. Almost all civil works
contracts had started as well as the importation of vehicles and equipment. The European
Investment Bank had agreed to finance part of the drainage works (not envisaged at project
appraisal) and the Organisation Arabe du Deve1oppement Agricole (OADA) signed a contract for
the provision of technical assistance. Concerning the master-plan, a three-phase study carried out
by a joint venture between BRL Ingenierie and BNEDER, started in February 1997. However,
the O&M cost-recovery issue with the farmers was not concluded despite the fact that a model-
agreement was available and that several reminders were sent by the Bank. At the beginning of
1998, the Government requested a second extension of the closing date. This was refused by the
Bank because of the general lack of progress on several key issues such as cost recovery, training,
and  technical  assistance  despite  the  positive  outlook  seen  in  1997.  As  of
September 1998, the overall situation was as presented in Table 5 of Part II.
Institutional Development
14.       A total of 39, out of the 82 vehicles and motorcycles estimated in the SAR, had been
provided to the various institutions to be strengthened (mainly CDARS, AGID, ANRH, ITDAS
and the Office des Perimntres Irrigues de l 'Oued R 'Hir, OPIOR). The shortfall in the number of
vehicles is reportedly due to the fact that the Ministry of Finance did not include the necessary
funds for the provision of all vehicles/motorcycles in the budget of the institutions 3. For a similar
reason, only eight of the 14 computer lots were provided but, on the other hand, all laboratory
equipment were procured. For reasons not entirely clear, the Government reversed its position
concerning the inclusion of additional personnel under the project. The PCU is now staffed by
only two persons (one engineer and one agronomist 4). The 16 additional field agents foreseen at
appraisal (mainly for extension work) were not recruited as CDARS did not take the necessary
steps despite Bank's insistence.
More specifically with the Office des Perimetres Irrigues de l 'Oued R 'Hir (OPIOR).
2 Already in August 1995, the Bank had requested to the PCU the setting up of performance indicators.
3 In Algeria, the MOF must allocate in the relevant budgets all the funds necessary for all expenditures, even
when financed from external sources.
4 It was decided to use the CDARS' accountant for project accounting.
4



15.       One of the institutions strengthened under this component was the OPIOR (also
restructured in accordance with a loan covenant). The office was meant to be responsible for
carrying out the O&M of the main irrigation/drainage infrastructures rehabilitated or constructed
under the project. However, it was clear during the project that the farmers (through their existing
associations) are willing to maintain the irrigation network. As far as the operation of the
irrigation and drainage networks as well as the maintenance of the drainage network is concerned,
the situation is still not clear. The Government reportedly intends to sub-contract private
entrepreneurs for this purpose. Consideration is also being given to dissolving the OPIOR.
Rehabilitation of Oases
16.       A total of 41 deep wells (range from 150 - 900 meters) were constructed and are in
operation, more than the 39 estimated at appraisal and with no substantial total cost overruns.
Some 32 lots of the pumping equipment - out of 94 estimated for new and existing wells - have
been procured and installed l. The rest will be installed as soon as the agreement concerning
O&M is signed between the farmers and CDARS. Similarly, the ten cooling towers are still under
construction. The main reasons reported for the delays are that the bidding documents were
prepared late because of the slowness in providing the necessary funds (see footnote 3 in para. 14)
and also due to scarcity of cement for some time. Although 58 of the estimated 62 km of
distribution canals systems are constructed or rehabilitated, only 12 km of the field canals (or only
15% of appraisal estimates) have been completed. The farmers complained that the machinery
utilised for carrying out the works, damaged their fields and therefore, it was decided at a later
date to use manual labor instead. However, the manual-intensive method takes much more time
and the problem was exacerbated by the scarcity of cement. A total of 261 km of the estimated
265 km of drainage networks have been constructed or rehabilitated, but only 122 km of the
estimated 275 km of forest roads/tracks have been completed. The reason for the delay is similar
to that of the field canals.
Studies, Technical Assistance and Training
17.       Table 7 of Part II sums up the studies prepared under the project. Only the first part of
the first phase of the preparation of the master-plan (Indicateurs de Developpement) has been
completed. The water tariff study has been completed, but it remains to be discussed with the
farmers and ultimately to be translated into laws/regulations for irrigation water users. A
monitoring program for water salinity/quality has been prepared by the ANRH and it reportedly
has improved its overall monitoring efficiency.
18.       Technical assistance and most of the training were never carried out as planned under
the project, initially because of the difficult security situation and then - when the OADA agreed
to undertake part of the work - because the MOF refused to allocate the necessary funds for
overseas training. However, some local training was organised over the years. In 1994, training
of 10 trainers took place in two extension training centres (Centres de Formation et de
Vulgarisation Agricole) - mainly in extension work, communication/diagnosis and evaluation.
Subsequently, a total of 19 Extension Agents (Agents Communaux de Vulgarisation) were given
training sessions in 1996 and 1997.
Some lots must be kept as back-ups but a large number of them were supposed to be installed on existing
wells.

On-farm Development
19.       This component was meant to finance farm machinery/equipment to be used by
farmers; mainly tractors, mini-tractors and backpack sprayers. This would have been provided to
them essentially through credit by the Banque pour l'Agriculture et le D&veloppement Rural -
BADR). For unknown reasons the MOF declined to provide sufficient guarantees to the BADR
for the credit, so loans were never granted. As indicated earlier, the amount of loan allocated for
this component was cancelled in May 1996.
Major Factors affecting the project
20.        Factors not subject to government control. The principal external factor was the
precarious security situation that began to spread across the country, almost from the start of the
project. This had serious negative effects on the provision of the technical assistance and training
under the project (see para. 11) as well as on the supervision of the project by the Bank (see
para. 25)1. Furthermore, the preparation of the master-plan was complicated by the fact that it
required data from Libya and Tunisia (mainly the results of drillings for monitoring the ground
water table). These data could not be obtained and the scope of the sampling for the preparation
work had to be reduced accordingly.
21.        Factors subject to government control. The MOF was slow in allocating' the
necessary funds for the execution of some project components - ex: the preparation of the master-
plan and the construction of cooling towers. Moreover, it apparently reversed its position at
appraisal by refusing to allocate funds for some other activities - ex: the provision of additional
staff and of part of the vehicles (see para. 14), and the technical assistance (see para. 18). More
fundamentally, the two steering committees never really played their role of coordinating the
activities of all the implementing institutions (see para. 3). The CDARS never gave the PCU
sufficient authority/power to efficiently coordinate the project activities on a daily basis. In fact,
the Government has not followed the Bank's advice, given at the 1993 supervision, to provide an
accountant and an agronomist to the PCU (see para. 10).
22.        Factors subject to implementing agency control. The PCU never kept separate
accounts - from the CDARS - for the project. Neither did it set up a M&E system as requested by
the 1995 supervision mission (see para. 12) 2 As a result, it was practically impossible to closely
monitor the progress of all project activities, as well as their impact. It was also certainly more
difficult to propose and adopt adequate corrective measures when necessary - ex: the water tariff
study that has not yet been translated into laws/regulations for irrigation water users.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
23.        The project's overall achievements are unsatisfactory (mainly the rehabilitation of
oases and institutional development) and its sustainability is uncertain. As indicated in para. 7,
the irrigated areas rehabilitated so far are bound to increase in size as the rehabilitation of the field
canals is being progressively completed and the farmers' incomes are gradually rising (see
Appendix 1). There are some evidences that the farmers are willing and capable of maintaining
(but perhaps not operating) most of the irrigation infrastructures through their own associations
(see para. 15), but this remains to be seen. Concerning institutional dlevelopment, there is evidence
that the various institutions benefiting from the vehicles/equipment provided under the project
might be capable of maintaining them through their regular budgets (see para. 14).
Obviously, it also had a negative impact on the performance of the Algerian personnel involved in project
implementation.
2 Of course, it could not benefit from any technical assistance to help in this task.
6



24.        Complementary investments will have to be made for the main studies prepared under
the project (see Table 7 of Part II) to have any lasting impact. Particularly in the case of the
preparation of the master-plan, it will be necessary to finance the carrying out of the remaining of
the first phase (complementary studies) as well as of the two other phases (essentially the
processing of the infornation/data and the formulation of the overall agricultural development
plan).
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
25.        Bank performance at identification and preparation was satisfactory, although as
suggested in para. 4 the institutional aspects were not sufficiently analysed at appraisal. The
Bank's overall supervision of the project was not satisfactory due essentially to the security
situation. Already in August 1994, the Bank envisaged the cancellation of the loan. After a first
supervision mission carried out in 1993 inside Algeria - and because of the security situation - the
subsequent missions were set up on an ad hoc basis and outside of the country apart from a
supervision mission in 1998 carried out by two Algerian consultants (see Table 13 of Part II). The
difficulties encountered in properly supervising the project raised several times the question of
whether to close the loan or not and the decision was not easy to take. For instance, the 1997
supervision mission found that the situation concerning the procurement of goods and services
had improved markedly (see para. 13), hence there was a good reason not to close the loan.
However, one year later, the preparation of the master-plan had barely progressed and practically
no technical assistance and training were provided.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
26.        The borrower's performance was satisfactory during project identification through
appraisal, but the performance during project implementation was not satisfactory. Although the
main technical agencies involved made visible efforts to implement the project efficiently, the
MOF has been slow in allocating the necessary funds and even reversed its position concerning
some types of expenditures (additional staff, technical assistance, training - see para. 21). It is
quite possible that the worsening overall economic situation at that time in Algeria was partly
responsible for this shortcomings. In addition, the PCU - mainly because of a lack of technical
assistance but also of a clear mandate - could not coordinate/monitor efficiently the various
project activities carried out by the different agencies (see para. 22). On the positive side, more
deep wells than planned were constructed by AGID (see para. 16) and the farmers' associations
revealed to be more progressive/capable than estimated at appraisal.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
27.        The project has only partially met its objectives and should therefore be rated as
unsatisfactory. However, although there is no comprehensive M&E system to properly evaluate
the project's outcome, it still can be stated that the rehabilitation of oases and the institutional
strengthening have definitely yielded satisfactory results. Table 9 of Part II indicates that financial
and economic benefits could be generated by the rehabilitation of the irrigated areas in the oases,
starting from around Year 20001. Furthermore, the strengthening provided to key institutions,
would allow them to better plan their operations. Useful data are now available for developing
improved methodologies and strategies - ex: the water tariff study and the monitoring program
for water salinity/quality. Finally, the carrying out of several contracts in civil works has also
generated a good number of individual jobs and incomes. Similarly, carrying out of the O&M on
the irrigation/drainage infrastructures will generate additional jobs and incomes.
The lack of relevant data/information did not allow for the proper calculation of an ERR.
7



H. FUTURE OPF RATIONS
28.       As a result of the lack of a M&E system, it was impossible to carry out a proper
financial and economical analysis. However, despite the absence of adequate data, an attempt has
been made at estimating the possible project's benefits mainly in terms of increased agricultural
production and farmers' income. According to the assumptions presented in Appendix 1, the
calculations show that incremental farms' incomes of about US$ 7 million per year (for 3,677 ha)
might be possible. Nevertheless, the sustainability of such possible incomes is highly uncertain.
29.       There is presently no official plan for the project's future operations. Certainly, the
first priority is to complete the preparation of the master-plan already started. In addition, it would
still be worthwhile setting up an M&E system since the project main quantifiable benefits, in
terms of (field) crop production, are only starting to materialise.
I. LESSONS LEARNED
30.        Some important lessons can be drawn from the overall experience with this project:
(a)  More realistic project implementation periods are required in situations where
more than one implementing institution is involved and/or where the public
bureaucracy is known to be particularly cumbersome;
(b)  More analytical work is needed for the treatment of the institutional aspects in
the formulation of irrigation projects, particularly when more than one
implementing agency is involved and/or when the provision of credit is
envisaged. This is also valid in situations where farmers are being asked to take
an active part in the O&M of the infrastructures rehabilitated/constructed;
(c)  More efficient supervision approaches are required in situations where the
Bank's field supervisions by Bank staff are limited;
(d)  The setting up of a proper M&E system is crucial to an efficient project
implementation and should take place at the very beginning of the project. In
fact, the necessary base data for the "without project" scenario should start to
be collected/analysed at the beginning of the project;
(e)  The use of heavy machinery for civil works in small farms is problematic and
should be considered with great care. More labor-intensive techniques could be
envisaged at the design stage as an alternative '; and
(f)  In cases where loans are closed with important project activities remaining to
be carried out, and where most of the benefits stated at appraisal could still be
achieved, the Bank should formulate an action program with the Government
for the purpose of reinforcing the implementation plan set at appraisal.
Providing that the cost-effectiveness of the alternative techniques can be demonstrated.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
As indicated in Part I, no M&E system was set up under the project and it was therefore
impossible to carry out a proper financial and economical analysis. However, despite the absence
of adequate data, an attempt has been made at estimating the possible project's benefits mainly in
terms of increased agricultural production and farmers' incomes. Appendix 1 (Quelques aspects
financiers du project) attempts to illustrate the possible benefits for the coming years.
The SAR indicates that: "the directly quantifiable benefits will come from incremental date
production and the improvement in date quality, as well as from increased production of fodder
and vegetable crops". The combined effects of the improved water supply and drainage, plus
better extension advice and the provision of farm equipment, were expected to result in increased
cropping intensities, yields and farm incomes over about 6,500 ha.
Appendix 1 indicates that 3,677 ha have been rehabilitated so far in two of the three zones
envisaged at appraisal (Djamaa and Mgaier). Using some conservative assumptions, illustrative
crop budgets were prepared for date as well as for fodder and vegetable production. The
calculations show that the incremental benefits per ha in the "with project' situation are high.
Taking the totality of the 3,677 ha, incremental farm incomes of an aggregated total of more than
US$ 7 million per year could be achieved, starting from Year 2000. The calculations do not
include the annual amortization costs related to the irrigation and drainage infrastructures
(probably modest since the infrastructures' life period is around 30-40 years). Still, the results
could be considered as conservative since they do not reflect any likely increase in the overall size
of the rehabilitated areas over the coming years. Not included as well are any increases in
livestock production (milk/meat), following better fodder availability.
In the SAR, the project's internal economic rate of return was calculated at 17%. On the basis of
the evidence presented in Appendix 1, it can be stated that some concrete financial benefits will
be generated from the project. An estimate of these benefits can only be estimated from data
obtained through the setting up of an M&E system in the project area. As long as these benefits
do not materialise over at least one completed harvesting season (not yet the case) and that the
benefits are not duly monitored - at least in terms of average yield improvements and cropping
intensities as well as farm gate prices realised - it is impossible to recalculate the project's ERR
with any reasonable degree of accuracy/confidence.

SAHARA REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
APPENDIX 1
QUELQUES ASPECTS FINANCIERS DU PROJET



Appendix 1
Quelques aspects financiers du projet
Introduction
1.        En l'absence d'un systeme de suivi et evaluation, il est impossible de calculer les taux
de rentabilite financier et economique du projet. Cependant, suite aux informations obtenues en
juillet 1998, il a ete possible d'avoir quelques indications sur les benefices possibles du projet.
Ceux-ci sont presentes ci-dessous.
Aspects financiers
2.        Des budgets ont e  etablis pour deux varietes de dattes (Deglet Nour et Ghars), une
culture fourragere (luzerne) et une culture maraichere (carottes). Par souci de simplification, le
but etant de seulement illustrer l'importance des benefices procures par le Projet, il n'a e  pris en
compte, dans un premier temps, que les budgets des palmiers dattiers.
3.        L'observation sur le terrain et les entretiens avec le personnel local travaillant sur le
Projet, au cours de la mission de septembre 1998, montrent que:
-    les travaux de rehabilitation ne concement que 3 677 ha (au lieu de 6 458 ha
initialement prevus) dont 1917 ha sur la zone de Djamaa (au lieu de 2 624
initialement prevus) et 1 760 ha sur la zone de Mgaier (au lieu de 2 336 ha
initialement prevus);
-    les 3 677 ha sont integralement couverts par la culture du palmier dattier (avec
parfois des cultures sous palmiers, principalement de la luzerne et du
maraichage);
-    les 3 677 ha couverts par le Projet supportent 90 % de palmiers Deglet Nour et
10 % de palmiers d'autres varietes (generalement palmiers (< ghars >>);
-    les rendements par hectare sont de 6 Tonnes pour le palmier Deglet Nour
(50 Kg par palmier et 120 palmiers par ha) et de 5 Tonnes pour le palmier
<< ghars >> (41,6 kg par palmier et 120 palmiers par ha);
-    que les charges annuelles par hectare (couts de production) sont identiques pour
les differentes varietes de palmier et se decomposent de la fa9on suivantes (en
DA 1998, tous les travaux sur la parcelle s'effectuant manuellement):

4.          On notera que les cofits des travaux ont e   comptabilises comme s'ils etaient
totalement effectues par une main-d'ceuvre salariee. Les exploitants agricoles qui utilisent le
travail familial auront donc des revenus plus importants que ceux mentionnes dans les calculs. Les
travaux sont faits generalement a la tache (1'equivalent par jour et par ouvrier est mentionne entre
parentheses dans le tableau ci-dessus).
5.          Pour le calcul des benefices du Projet, ont e   faites les hypotheses suivantes,
hypotheses fondees sur les entretiens avec les techniciens et les phoeniciculteurs au cours de la
mission:
(a)   Les cofuts de production augmenteront de 10 % avec le Projet;
(b)   Les rendements peuvent aisement passer, au minimum, de 6 T/ha a 8 T/ha et de
5 T/ha a 7 T/ha respectivement pour la Deglet Nour et les autres vari6tes de
dattes;
(c)   On ne prend pas en compte l'accroissement de production des cultures sous
palmier (cf. ci-dessous); et
(d)   Le cofit de 1'eau, sauf celui de l'electricite  pour le pompage de l'eau
d'irrigation, ne peut pas ere pris en compte du fait qu'il n'y a pas encore de
systeme de recouvrement des couits.
Les cofits qui ne sont pas pris en compte dans les calculs sont:
-     l'amortissement des forages et de leur equipement,
-     I'amortissement du reseau de drainage et du reseau d'irrigation,
-     1'entretien des equipements des forages et celui des reseaux d'irrigation et de
drainage.
6.         II faut cependant noter que les associations d'irriguants ont deja signe avec l'Agence
pour l'lrrigation et le Drainage (AGID) des contrats de prise en charge des forages r6alises et de
leurs equipements, contrats par lesquels elles s'engagent a payer les frais de fonctionnement des
equipements (gardiennage et entretien des pompes, frais d'electricite).

7.          Tous calculs faits, it apparait que le benefice financier annuel de la partie du Projet
ternine se monte a 6,0 millions US $ ainsi que le montre le tableau ci-dessous.

8.          On peut dans un deuxieme temps estimer les revenus procures par les cultures sous
palmier. L'enquete de terrain montre que seulement la moitie des 3 677 ha couverts par le projet
supporte des cultures sous palmier (soit 1838,5 ha), cette superficie etant occupee pour moitie par
de la luzerne et pour moitie par des cultures maraicheres. Les cultures maraicheres occupent le
meme sol deux fois pendant l'annee (intensite culturale). La faiblesse des superficies cultivees
sous palmier avant le projet s'explique principalement par le deficit en eau d'irrigation.
9.          Avec le projet, on peut estimer de facon realiste que les superficies cultivees sous
palmier vont au moins augmenter d'un tiers, I'intensite des cultures maraicheres restant la meme
(deux cultures par an sur la meme parcelle). Les charges pour ces cultures se limitent a l'achat des
semences et des engrais, au frais de semis, de recolte et de transport, les autres frais (labour,
fumier organique, amendement, irrigation) etant supporte par la culture des palmiers.

11.        Le benefice financier du Projet va donc se monter a 7,1 millions de dollars par an (6,0
pour les dattes + 1,1 pour les fourrages et les cultures maraicheres). De ce point de vue, il faut
garder a 1'esprit trois remarques:
*     Ces resultats peuvent etre raisonnablement atteints des l'an 2000. En effet,
I'hypothese prise en matiere de hausse des rendements est modeste: 50 Kg par
arbre (6 T/ha) Deglet Nour alors que l'observation de terrain indique un
rendement de 150 Kg par arbre (18 T/ha) s'il est correctement travaill.
*    D'autres benefices, que ceux qui ont e   comptabilises dans les calculs
precedents, sont facilement previsibles : I'accroissement des fourrages produits
va induire un accroissement du petit betail et donc un accroissement de la
production de lait, de viande et de fumier si necessaire pour les palmiers et les
cultures sous-jacentes. Par ailleurs, les ressources en eau desormais disponibles
peuvent permettre une extension non negligeable des superficies plantees. En
ce sens, on peut estimer que les benefices sont relativement minores.
*    Le benefice financier doit etre diminue des couts d'amortissement et d'entretien
des forages et des reseaux de drainage et d'irrigation. Compte tenu des delais
d'amortissement probables, ces cofits devraient etre relativement modestes.
