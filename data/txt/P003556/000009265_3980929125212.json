Basin Irrigation Project for\n            China is viewed as having a highly satisfactory overall\n            outcome. All objectives of irrigation and drainage\n            development and agricultural/animal husbandry were achieved\n            with a relatively high degree of sustainability. The Bank\n            and borrower performances are both satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned are as follows. Good irrigation and drainage\n            systems as well as improved agricultural services and inputs\n            can be immediately utilized by farmers to generate large\n            increases in crop yields and production. The building of\n            drainage systems has been effective in ensuring\n            desalinization of soils. The project's drainage\n            management stations should be expanded, and funding by\n            district-based fees should be considered. The farmers are\n            becoming increasingly market-oriented and are very receptive\n            to extension services, especially when the technical\n            packages given to them are cost-effective and low-risk.\n            While development of mixed crop/livestock and fodder base\n            components has been successful, technicians and farmers need\n            to be informed about the financial benefits and risks\n            associated with the various production possibilities.\n            Tremendous success was achieved in water savings through the\n            lining of canals, and the project's loss monitoring\n            system should be expanded to include real-time operation of\n            the irrigation system. The project had an innovative\n            component to suppress hail formation and reduce crop loss,\n            but it will require government support to be sustained. With\n            the movement toward a market-oriented economy, seed\n            multiplication, cleaning, testing, and treatment is better\n            left to the private sector. Finally, competitive bidding\n            procedures used for works and goods procurement have\n            achieved considerable savings. More stringent methods of\n            prequalification should be adopted to ensure bidder qualification."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
