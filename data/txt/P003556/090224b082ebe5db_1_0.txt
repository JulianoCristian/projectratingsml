FOREWORD

          As microfinance institutions (MFIs) scale up and commercialize, proper MFI
          governance becomes increasingly important. Current microfinance literature
          and forums do not sufficiently address MFI governance. The topic is not as
          ‘sexy’ as mobile or branchless banking, new product development or credit
          crisis. Yet good MFI governance plays a crucial role in product development,
          technological advancement, and more importantly, crisis management.

INTRODUCTION
Why Should We Be So Concerned about
Corporate Governance in Microfinance?




            The microfinance market today looks much different from 2007. De-
            spite the worldwide financial crisis, the sector has doubled in size,
            transformed from mostly an NGO driven market to one increasingly
            dominated by regulated institutions, experienced a strong expan-
            sion of savings services, and held its first public listings and merg-
            ers. Microfinance is displaying the signs of a maturing industry. It
            has also weathered its first global downturn, lived through several
            major market crises, and is currently living through a crisis of percep-
            tions and confidence on whether microfinance actually helps allevi-
            ate poverty in the first place. None of these issues existed in 2007.1

BACKGROUND: K-Rep was founded in 1984 by a U.S. NGO
and was subsequently funded by USAID that provided
funding to existing NGOs involved in microfinance and
small business development. In 1990, K-Rep established
its own MFI and introduced peer-group lending to micro-
entrepreneurs. By 1994, K-Rep decided to transform into
a microfinance bank and focus on its own operations. This
was the first NGO-to-bank conversion in Africa. It took
K-Rep several years to transform, partly because of the                     ABOUT THE PHOTO A honey producer in Kenya. Photo: © Dana Smillie / World Bank.
