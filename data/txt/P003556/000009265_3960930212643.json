          structures, tubewells and onfarm works for low yielding land\n            and reclaimed areas of desert wasteland; (ii) construct a\n            small hydro-power station on the Yerqiang River and\n            inter-connecting transmission grid to expand the electrical\n            generating and transmission capacities; (iii) finance the\n            improvement and expansion of the
