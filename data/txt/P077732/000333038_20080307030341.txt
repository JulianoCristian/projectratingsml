F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the proposed project was to facilitate private sector-led economic growth
in the Republic of Serbia through: (a) launching the restructuring and privatization
process and, when appropriate, bankruptcy proceedings with respect to some of the most
problematic large socially-owned enterprises in the Republic of Serbia; and (b)
supporting the implementation of a comprehensive banking sector restructuring strategy
aimed at the creation of a more viable financial sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country background. The break-up of the former Yugoslavia in 1991 was followed by
war in the newly independent neighboring states (1991-5) and a conflict in the Serbian
Republic's southern province of Kosovo (1999). In 2002 Serbia and Montenegro, which
subsequently constituted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), were discussing a
new agreement regarding continued co-operation1. Serbia and Montenegro were badly
affected by the social and economic impact of the wars, with high levels of
unemployment.

Macroeconomic background. Serbia began the delayed transition to democracy and a
market economy under very difficult economic and social conditions. These conditions
resulted from nearly four decades of inefficient economic management and a decade of
regional conflicts and international isolation that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia.

By 2002, Serbia had taken impressive steps to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and
to initiate structural reforms aimed at accelerating the long delayed transition. Strong
implementation of these reforms had already brought initial visible improvements to key
economic indicators by 2002, while laying the foundations for a sustained recovery of
output and improved living standards. Nevertheless, the socio-economic legacy of the
previous regime hampered the structural adjustment, especially, in the real sector.

Background on the enterprise sector. The legacy of the past had left Serbia with an
uncompetitive and inefficient enterprise sector, while the crisis of the preceding decade
had brought in its wake loss of markets and isolation from technological advances. The
bulk of the sector consisted of about 6,500 socially-owned enterprises (SOEs) which



1The Borrower was Serbia and Montenegro which on-lent the proceeds to the government of Serbia for
implementing the project. In February 2003 the FRY was reconstituted as a State Union of Serbia and
Montenegro. The new Union allowed for both republics to hold a referendum on independence in early
2006. Subsequently, the union was dissolved in June 2006, when a referendum for independence in
Montenegro resulted in the majority of Montenegrians supporting separation from Serbia and both Serbia
and Montenegro became independent countries.
2The total industrial output at the end of 2002 was only half of 1991 output.


                                                                                                      1

were labor-managed firms developed during the Socialist FRY3. The SOEs lacked
financial discipline and, as a result, were inefficiently organized with large excess
capacity of both physical assets and labor, substantively loss-making, and heavily
indebted with most of it overdue. The burden of keeping these enterprises alive was
borne by the state-owned banks and companies in terms of overdue bank debt,
outstanding trade credit, tax arrears, and other public debt. According to some estimates,
the large insolvent enterprises comprised a total workforce of about 160,000 employees
representing some 20% of total industrial employment, and it was preliminarily estimated
that more than 60,000 of these workers could be in surplus.

To address these problems, the new Serbian government had launched a privatization and
restructuring program based on the new June 2001 Privatization Law and implemented
by the Ministry of Economy and Privatization (MOEP) and the Privatization Agency
(PA) set up in 2001. Incorporating the international best practice and lessons learnt from
other transition countries, the 2001 Privatization Law (and the accompanying by-laws)
set up a model of market-oriented privatization4. The privatization process was driven by
the interest of investors and the viability of the enterprises and based on a competitive
process and strict rules that emphasized the transparency of the entire process. The Law
allowed a multi-track approach to privatization: (i) international tenders to attract
strategic investors to large companies (70% of shares in each enterprise was sold to a
strategic investor), (ii) open auctions for small and medium-sized enterprises, and (iii)
restructuring of large heavily indebted industrial conglomerates with the objective to put
their assets to productive use through subsequent tenders and/or auctions. Based on the
poor financial and operational condition and the associated social implications, the
government had identified 47 SOEs that required restructuring prior to privatization and
intended to initiate restructuring for privatization of large SOEs in the course of 2002.

Addressing the social costs of restructuring privatization was an integral part of the
government's enterprise sector reform since the SOEs were the biggest employers in the
country. In March 2002 the government approved a budget-funded Social Program to
mitigate the social consequences of restructuring and privatization. The privatization or
restructuring program for each enterprise was to include a labor redeployment plan,
outlining severance or other packages for redundant workers. In addition to addressing
the social consequences of restructuring, the government intended to amend some laws to
better facilitate the privatization and bankruptcy process5.

Background on the banking sector. Likewise, the condition of the banking system
carried the legacy of the extreme conditions of state interference and instability under
which it had operated during the preceding decade. Pervasive defaults and widespread


3In 2002 the total of approximately 6,500 included: (i) over 70 large enterprises ready for privatization
through the intermediation of well-established and experienced investment banks; (ii) some 6,000 small
and medium-sized SOEs to be disposed of through public auction; and (iii) almost 50 large insolvent
enterprises identified that needed restructuring before being offered for privatization sale.
4The preceding Privatization Law dated 1997 followed an insider privatization scheme.
5These amendments concerned, for example, the PA's authority over the privatization process and the
efficiency and timeliness of liquidation of un-saleable SOEs.


                                                                                                          2

arrears, aggravated by economic sanctions, had resulted in significant portions of the
banks' assets being either immobile or non-performing. Mismanagement of the largest
banks had served directed credit decisions and was exacerbated by the ownership and
control exercised over these banks by some of the large and troubled SOEs. The size,
level of intermediation, and overall significance of the banking sector had steadily
declined by the end of 1990's (see Table 2).

The new government started a comprehensive assessment of problems in the system in
2001, followed by the launching of an extensive banking sector reform. This began to
restore the confidence to the banking sector (see Table 2). The reform consisted of a far-
reaching banking resolution strategy that attempted to eliminate the insolvency of the
system (90% of the banking sector assets were determined insolvent) by liquidating all
insolvent and undercapitalized banks, to re-establish public confidence and adequate
intermediation, and to attract new capital into what was envisioned to be a privately-
owned modern banking system. These initiatives were accompanied by improvements in
the regulatory and supervisory framework of the banking system and a program of
institution building at the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) that had been designated
the mandatory receiver for bank liquidations in September 2001.

The government took drastic actions to address the insolvency. At the end of 2001 the
government had removed licenses from 24 small and medium sized banks that were
found insolvent, and in early 2002 the government had liquidated the four largest banks
with the BRA appointed as the bankruptcy administrator. All these banks represented
61 % of the total assets and 82 % of the off-balance sheet assets of the banking system. In
mid-2002 the Government acquired substantial stakes in additional 16 banks through
debt-for-equity swaps of Paris and London Club debt, as a first step towards privatization.

Linkages between the enterprise and banking sector reform. The problem of
resolving the excess debts of SOEs was central to achieving successful privatizations as
bank debt constituted 54% of all enterprise debt and 58% of the liabilities of SOEs. The
BRA managed the non-performing loans of the banks it was liquidating. At the same time,
the overdue loans burdened the balance sheets of the enterprises so that their restructuring
and privatization was hindered. In order to deal with the creditor coordination issues, the
BRA and the PA agreed on a memorandum of understanding under which the BRA had
agreed to suspend enforcement of its rights to collect on loans due from enterprises which
were to be privatized through auction or tender in exchange for a proportion of the

Rationale for Bank assistance. The proposed project was consistent with the Transition
Support Strategy (TSS) for the FRY (2001 & 2002). The TSS identified the stimulation
of near-term growth as one of the key challenges facing the FRY authorities on a path to
a market economy. It recognized that growth will be led by private sector and called for
privatization of all viable SOEs and a comprehensive financial sector reform. The project
was also consistent with the private and financial sector strategy for Serbia, as discussed
with the Government, IMF, European Union, EBRD, USAID, and other donors.

The proposed operation built on and expanded the Bank's comprehensive assistance
program started in 2001, to support Serbia's enterprise and financial sector reforms that
fostered private sector growth and job creation, facilitated by a healthier and more
developed financial system. The initial technical assistance for the Government's reform
program was provided by the Private Sector Development Technical Assistance Grant
(P074145) and the Financial Sector Development Technical Assistance Grant (P074127)
(both approved in mid-2001 and closed in the end of 2004, after a six-month extension7).
At the policy level the reforms were supported through the Private and Financial Sector
Adjustment Credit (P074486; approved in May 2002 and closed in June 2003). This
technical assistance project laid the groundwork for the Second Private and Financial
Sector Adjustment Credit (PFSAC II), which focused, inter alia, on restructuring and
subsequent privatization of large SOEs, and privatization and liquidation of the remaining
troubled state-majority owned banks (P074868; approved in June 2003 and closed in
December 2004).

This assistance was designed as the key driver in a broader donor effort to assist with the
preparation and subsequent implementation of the government's private and financial
sector reform program. With regards to the enterprise sector reform, several donors had
indicated a willingness to fund advisors for the preliminary stages of restructuring of
large SOEs; however, none had agreed to assist on all three stages of the process.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The objective of the proposed project was to facilitate private sector-led economic growth
in the Republic of Serbia through the following: (a) launching the restructuring and
privatization process and, when appropriate, bankruptcy proceedings with respect to
some of the most problematic large SOEs in the Republic of Serbia; and (b) supporting
the implementation of a comprehensive banking sector restructuring strategy aimed at the
creation of a more viable financial sector.

Progress in achieving the development objective was assessed on the basis of:

  · the number and value of large enterprises restructured, and business units and assets
       sold, or, if necessary, liquidated8;



7The former project's costs totaled US$10.12 million, including a grant US$6 million; the latter project's
costs totaled US$6.54, including a grant of US$6 million.
8This performance indicator referred to all companies in the restructuring process, either funded under the
proposed project, or by other donors, or by the Government, as it was expected that the impact of the


                                                                                                          4

  · comprehensive qualitative assessment of progress in implementation of
       restructuring programs with respect to SOEs and parts thereof, for which
       privatization, restructuring, or bankruptcy was not completed and reasons for delay,
       if any;
  · improved performance and competence of the PA to undertake complex
       privatization through restructuring program, as measured by the use of best
       practices, the number of restructuring agents hired, and by the number of auctions
       and tenders held;
  · selection of banks for rehabilitation/privatization or liquidation track, the number of
       state-majority owned banks privatized or put in liquidation; and
  · qualitative assessment of progress in implementation of bank liquidation,
       rehabilitation, and privatization.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The Board approved a revision to the objective of Part B (the Bank Restructuring
Program) and a new key performance indicator in December 2005, at the request of the
government, as follows:

 Revised objective for Part B                          Key performance indicator
 (ii) implementation of a comprehensive                "a qualitative assessment of the progress
 banking and insurance sector                          in implementation of liquidation of
 restructuring strategy.....                           insolvent insurers and privatization of
                                                       state-owned insurance companies"

The revised objective for Part B included the insurance sector so as to adapt the project to
the government's evolving reform policies, and to maintain the project's relevance
("adaptive restructuring"). The original expected outcomes of the project remained.

Based on the initial assessments carried out with the Bank and donor assistance since
2002, the government expanded the financial sector reforms to restructuring and
privatizing the insurance sector, and to improving the financial discipline of the insurance
companies. New laws adopted in July 2005 governed the reorganization and
modernization of the insurance sector, including appointment of the BRA ­ now named
as the Agency for Deposit Insurance (DIA) - to be responsible for managing the
privatization of the state and socially owned insurance companies and administering
liquidation of insurance companies. The government intended to launch the privatization
of DDOR and restructuring of Dunav for its eventual sale; these were two largest state-
owned insurers that had long dominated the insurance sector. In addition, as part of the
clean-up effort of the sector, the DIA began liquidation of the 14 insolvent insurance
companies the operating licenses of which had been revoked at the turn of 2004-2005.
The government expected a considerable scope for further consolidation in the sector.




restructuring model and the institutional building supported by this technical assistance credit will cover all
enterprise restructuring done by the Privatization Agency.


                                                                                                             5

The restructuring was in line with the existing 2005-2007 CAS (the objectives of creating
a larger, more dynamic private sector and a smaller, sustainable, more efficient public
sector); as well as with the government's structural reform agenda, as defined by the First
Programmatic Private and Financial Development Policy Credit approved in October
2005 (the objective of strengthening the insurance sector regulation and resolution regime
under the second pillar, building a more efficient and stable financial sector).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary target groups were the private sector at large and the financial system. The
private sector would grow faster and create more jobs. The financial system would
become more well-functioning, transparent, and cost-effective and would allow an
adequate mobilization of resources and better allocation into productive investments.
These improvements would come partly through the following: (i) sale of large loss-
making SOEs or, more likely, their successor parts and/or assets to local and foreign
investors with strong management capacity, (ii) improved financial discipline facilitated
by the segmentation and sale of the companies and more productive use of assets as a
result of more proactive restructuring, and (iii) privatization and liquidation of insolvent
banks, majority state-owned banks, and, after the restructuring (see Sections 1.3 and 1.6),
state-owned insurance companies and insolvent insurers, respectively. As a result of the
improvements in the enterprise and financial sectors, the sustainability of Serbia's
macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal discipline would be reinforced by removing a
long-standing source of budget drain.

The project financed the major part of costs of engaging the financial advisors and
consulting services under both components to carry out the above work, as well as of
building the institutional capacity of the PA.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Part A: Privatization through restructuring
1. Technical assistance to the PA (or other relevant agencies) within the Enterprise
Privatization Framework for the restructuring and subsequent privatization of a number
of large SOEs9 by funding expert "restructuring agents" (i.e., investment banks, workout
companies, consulting companies, and other financial advisors) to implement the
following three stages of restructuring: (i) preparation of a feasibility study and a due
diligence report, (ii) implementation of recommendations from the feasibility stage
regarding organizational and financial restructuring, including segmentation of the
company and incorporation of the new companies created from the parts of the old one;
and (iii) sale of the new companies and of assets remaining after the break-up and put the
unsaleable business units into bankruptcy, when appropriate. This component covered the
retainer fees of the expert restructuring agents, a major part of the transaction costs.




9The government had identified 47 large SOEs that required restructuring before sale due to extremely
poor financial and operational condition and that had the associated social implications. However, this list
was not considered final, as the government was expected to add new enterprises to it over time.


                                                                                                            6

 2. Technical assistance to build up institutional competence and capacity of the PA to
 work with the restructuring agents in the preparation and implementation of the above-
 mentioned restructuring/ privatization plans and to establish a consistent approach and
 methodology based on the best practices for the restructuring and privatization process of
 large SOEs that cannot be sold in their current state. The assistance covered the
 following:

 i.   Advisory services for establishing the Restructuring Unit at the PA capable of
      monitoring the restructuring agents' performance, dealing with the enterprise
      creditors and employees, and negotiating with potential investors;
ii.   Consulting services to enhance institutional capacity of the Restructuring Unit with
      foreign and local expert advice and technical know-how for the restructuring and
      privatization process, including preparation of the company profiles, development
      of TORs, facilitation of contracting and bidding process for restructuring agents,
      organizing the creditors' meetings, and advising on legal issues; and
iii.  Procurement of hardware and software for the operation of the Restructuring Unit.

 3. Provision of support to the PA Project Management Unit (PMU) in the management,
 implementation and monitoring of this component, through the provision of services,
 including the audit of records, accounts and financial statements, goods, and financing of
 incremental operating costs, including the PA's staff salaries.

 Part B: Bank Restructuring Program
 1. Technical assistance through the provision of services to the BRA with respect to
 bank liquidation, rehabilitation, and privatization based on the use of internationally
 accepted best practices, within the Bank Resolution Framework and, as defined in the
 specific policy conditions undertaken by the government in the Private and Financial
 Sector Adjustment Credit II. This sub-component covered the following:

 i.    Consulting services to provide operational support for receiverships for insolvent
       banks currently in the BRA portfolio;
 ii.   Consulting services to undertake the implementation of stabilization, rehabilitation,
       and pre-privatization activities for state-owned banks in BRA portfolio that have
       been selected for privatization; and
 iii.  Services of financial advisors to undertake the marketing and implementation of
       privatization tenders for state-majority owned banks under the control of the BRA.

 2. Provision of support to the BRA PMU in the management, implementation, and
 monitoring of this component, through the provision of services, including the audit of
 records, accounts, and financial statements, and financing of incremental operating costs.




                                                                                          7

1.6 Revised Components
The Board approved a revision to Part B in December 2005 to support the
implementation of the insurance sector restructuring strategy (the Bank and Insurance
Sector Restructuring Program). This reflected developments in the government's reform
policy for the financial sector and was intended to better align the technical assistance
resources with the evolving policy priorities towards the continuation of the financial
sector reforms (see Section 1.3). The new sub-component financed consultants' and
financial advisors' services to the DIA (former BRA) for restructuring state-owned
insurance companies in preparation for privatization and liquidating insolvent insurance
companies. An equivalent of $600K was made available to this work from the available
savings under Part B that had accumulated due to the lower-than-expected retainer fees
for the bank privatization advisors engaged earlier.

1.7 Other significant changes
Changes in the scope of Part A. Upon expiry of the PSD TA Grant at the end of 2004,
the Bank team (with management's confirmation) agreed to the MOEP's request for
financing a number of financial advisors and local consultants (project managers and
assistant project managers) for the Tender and Auction Centers in the PA, under Parts
A.1 and A.2, respectively, in order to continue the ongoing direct privatizations. The
request was found acceptable as the activity supported the project objective and since the
Tender and Auction Centers carried out the sales of the SOEs or parts thereof from the
restructuring list. The project funding enabled seamless continuity of activities, while it
gave an opportunity to increase the project outcome beyond the original expectations.

In addition, the scope of Part A increased following the introduction of a new Law on
Bankruptcy Proceedings which became effective in February 2005. According to the new
legislation, the PA was to serve as the bankruptcy trustee for all SOEs and was required
to establish a specialized Bankruptcy Unit. In view of the complexity of the bankruptcy
process and the insufficient internal capacity of the PA, the Bank team (with
management's approval) agreed to the MOEP's request for financing consultants'
services for the PA under Part A.2 to establish the Bankruptcy Unit and to administer the
first bankruptcy cases. This activity was also well within the original component scope,
while it at the same increased the potential for long-term institutional development and
increasing the project outcome.

Changes in the scope of Part B. The government decided early on not to pursue
rehabilitation of state-owned banks, given the levels of insolvency and major fiscal
constraints. Instead, it decided on a more rigorous liquidation approach for troubled state-
owned banks. This reduced the component costs initially prepared based on their possible
rehabilitations.

In addition, based on the new laws adopted in July 2005, the DIA's (the former BRA)
responsibilities increased as it became responsible for managing privatization of the state-
owned insurance companies and administering liquidation of insolvent insurance
companies (see Sections 1.3 and 1.6). The restructuring approved in December 2005
increased the scope of Part B by extending project financing for these activities. In
addition, based on the amendment to the Privatization Law dated June 2005, the DIA, as


                                                                                           8

a representative of the state, was responsible for the process of claiming debts of SOEs
that were under restructuring and privatization to banks in bankruptcy or liquidation
against the sales proceeds. The amendments to the Law improved the collection rate.

Extension of the closing date. The Board approved extension of the closing date by one
year from April 30, 2006 to April 30, 2007 to complete the implementation of the
contracts that were going on at that time and to allow full implementation of the activities
under Parts A and B of the Project (see Sections 1.3 and 1.6 and the below paragraph on
the January 2006 reallocation).

Reallocation of credit proceeds between disbursement categories. The Bank approved
reallocation of credit proceeds between disbursement categories three times at the request
of the government to meet the evolving technical assistance needs (the first reallocation
was approved by the Board in connection with the restructuring, and the latter two were
approved by the Bank management). The reallocations resulted in a total increase of SDR
1.74 million (equivalent of US$2.7 million) for Part A and a total decrease of SDR 1.04
million (equivalent of US$1.6 million) for Part B (see Table 3).

* There is a small discrepancy between these numbers and the actual disbursed amount (SDR 7.7 million)
due to exchange rate fluctuations.

The reallocations were made for the following technical assistance needs:

The January 2006 reallocation: Part A.1 needed funding for engaging a financial advisor
to undertake the privatization and restructuring of the mining complex of RTB Bor (SDR
897,000) and for other tenders (SDR 1,261,719). RTB Bor was a copper mining and
processing complex, one of the country's largest loss-making enterprises in the
restructuring list, which consistently undermined fiscal discipline. Progress with its
restructuring and privatization was considered to be an essential pre-condition for the
proposed Bor Regional Development Project (approved in June 2007). Part B.2 needed
funding for the operating costs of the DIA PMU (SDR 176,000) until the extended
closing date of April 30, 2007 and for the incremental costs of publishing tender
announcements for privatization of banks and insurance companies. The reallocation was
made possible by the significant undisbursed balance under Part B due to lower-than-




                                                                                                              9

expected retainer fees for the bank privatization advisors engaged and the amount in the
project preparation facility.

The March 2006 reallocation: By December 31, 2005, the PA under Part A.3 had
disbursed all the funds under the incremental operating costs category, including the PA's
staff salaries. At the same time the PA lacked budget and operational funds in sufficient
amounts to maintain the salaries at a level that would have prevented staff from migrating
to the private sector. The Bank considered this reallocation appropriate since the
financing of salaries had been an integral part of the technical assistance program carried
out under the previous projects and since it allowed the PA to attract and retain the cadre
of professional staff, despite the growing competition from the private sector.

The November 2006 reallocation: Likewise, by November 1, 2006, the PA under Part
A.3 had disbursed all the funds under the incremental operating costs. The government
requested funds to finance the PA's core staff to maintain the PA's capacity and
institutional competence to undertake and finalize the privatization program until the
extended closing date of April 30, 2007. The Bank considered this appropriate since the
privatization activities were going to continue until the extended closing date. The
reallocation was made possible by the increase in the available balance under the credit
due to the exchange rate fluctuations and availability of uncommitted funds under the
consultants services category of Part A.

Cancellation of credit proceeds. The Bank management approved a cancellation of
about SDR 0.7 million (equivalent of US$1 million) from SDR 8.4 million (equivalent of
about US$13 million) after the closing of the credit. A total of SDR 7.7 million
(equivalent of over US$11 million) or 92% was disbursed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of the background analysis (including lessons learned incorporated and the
rationale for Bank's intervention). The fact that the project was technically sound,
incorporated lessons learnt elsewhere, and had a strong rationale provided a good basis
for implementation. The technical analysis was based on well-founded and ­ known
benefits of the privatization for the economy. Based on the knowledge of the country
conditions and economic policy environment acquired since the beginning of the reforms
in 2001 and assessment of experience elsewhere, the project considered several
alternative methods for enforcing financial discipline with large loss-making SOEs. It
also assessed different alternatives to bank rehabilitation and designed flexibility into the
project to allow different project support, depending on the preferred method by the
government. Based on these assessments, the lessons reflected in the project included the
following: (i) the extensive experience elsewhere about dealing with large loss-making,
politically sensitive enterprises, (ii) the need and value for an integrated approach to
reforming private and financial sectors (focusing on the debt workout between the
indebted SOEs and state-owned banks), (iii) the importance of adequately funded
institutional arrangements for implementation of such complex privatization programs,



                                                                                           10

preparation of well defined procurement plans, and use of competent restructuring agents,
and (iv) donor coordination to avoid duplication of efforts. There was a strong rationale
for the Bank's continued technical assistance with the reforms supported simultaneously
by the adjustment operations. In addition to the Bank's expertise and ongoing projects,
there was a strong rationale for the Bank taking the role of a technical assistance provider
for helping design and launch the new restructuring for privatization program and a
catalyst for raising additional funds for the program.

Assessment of the project design. The project was well designed, and this helped with
achieving successful project outcomes. The objective with the key performance
indicators were clear, realistic, and important for the country and sector and furthered
the Bank's TSS and CAS. There was an adequate causal linkage between the objective,
as specified, component outputs, and activities, on one hand, and the expected outcome
from the project, on the other hand. Based on the logical framework, the project
documents did not specify targets for the quantitative or qualitative indicators of the
expected outcome (also, they were going to be agreed in the course of the implementation
or were based on the targets agreed for the policy credits). Based on the role of the PA
and the BRA (later, the DIA) in the reform, they were obviously appropriate executors of
the project. Because of the complexity of the issues, the project was appropriately
designed to finance consultants for the entire process of managing and implementing the
technical assistance in addition to ensuring capacity in the PA and PMU (for example,
teaming up restructuring agents with international experience and local project managers
with specific skills). The project preparation (and implementation) was based on
exceptionally wide donor coordination efforts, including UK DFID, US Treasury, and
Sida for the banking sector reform, and the Sida and the Netherlands government for the
enterprise sector reform10. The fact that other donors adopted the restructuring and
privatization model proposed by the project was recognition of a good design.

Adequacy of the government commitment. Despite periods of political instability, the
government displayed consistently strong commitment during the design phase to the
enterprise and banking sector reforms supported under the project and, in broader terms,
under the PFSAC II and the Programmatic Private and Financial Sector Development
Policy Credit I (PPFDPC; P089116), as demonstrated by completion of the program
targets by the government. The policy support was important for effective
implementation of this technical assistance program. The government had also identified
the first 47 large loss-making SOEs for the restructuring for privatization program
supported under the project.

Assessment of risks. The project made a thorough assessment of potential
implementation risks related to changes in the government's commitment, social risks,
and implementation capacity. Since the project was part of a broader reform support
package, the team was able to incorporate appropriate and adequate mitigation measures
to the design of the project (regarding the implementation capacity) and to benefit from



10In addition, the government received a grant from the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) in the
end of 2005.


                                                                                                     11

the support of the related adjustment projects (regarding the government commitment,
legislative changes, social risks, implementation capacity) to help manage the risks11.

2.2 Implementation
The following significant and minor changes to the project contributed to successful
implementation of the project and increased the project outcome (see Section 1.7): (i)
financing of direct privatization of a number of large SOEs from the credit helped
complete the transactions without any disruptions, as the PSD TA Grant closed, and
increased the project outcome above what was anticipated; (ii) project support to a newly
established Bankruptcy Unit in the PA increased the project's impact on institutional
development and facilitated project implementation by creating a mechanism to deal with
unsaleable SOEs; (iii) the December 2005 restructuring broadened the project's scope to
include the insurance sector and advance its restructuring and privatization; and (iv)
reallocations between components and disbursement categories and extension of the
closing date helped finance and complete the evolving technical assistance needs to
ensure better outcomes. The project was never at risk.

Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies

The two periods of general political instability and uncertainty12 slowed down the
implementation of the overall enterprise and bank privatization program although the
government each time maintained the reform course. In 2003-2004, this instability was
reflected, for example, in the delayed passage of important new legislation to support
reforms, such as amendments to the Enterprise Law, Privatization Law, and the
Bankruptcy Law. This instability affected Part A indirectly as the above laws were
related to the implementation of the restructuring and privatization program. The
instability did not affect Part B of this project directly, as the government started
disbursements from this credit only in 2005 after the closure of the FSD TA Grant.
However, the parliamentary elections in January 2007, in turn, affected the DIA's ability
somewhat to proceed with privatization transaction for the insurance company DDOR13.

Factors generally subject to government control

Bottlenecks identified during the enterprise restructuring process caused the government
to prepare a number of legislative amendments. The amendment to the Privatization Law
from February 2003 provided full and exclusive authority to the PA to negotiate and sign
sale and purchase agreements. Earlier, the employees' representatives in SOEs could
refuse to sign the agreements if they did not like the investors. A more important
amendment was made in June 2005 which improved the restructuring, sales and


11In the course of the implementation the policy programs continued to support the project (Section 2.2).
12Following assassination of Prime Minister Djindjic in March 2003, Serbia went through a period of
presidential and parliamentary elections from late 2003 to early 2004 and the eventual formation of a new
government in March 2004. Serbia held a referendum on the proposed draft of the new Serbian constitution
in October 2006 and held parliamentary elections in January 2007, followed by appointment of the
Government in May 2007.
13The Serbian Government is currently preparing to offer DDOR in an open tender.


                                                                                                        12

bankruptcy process for SOEs, as well as collection of debts owed by SOEs to state-
controlled creditors (e.g., banks in the DIA's portfolio). The amendment stipulated the
following: (i) the creditors, including the DIA that administered state-owned banks and
banks in liquidation, could write off debt against the sales proceeds of SOEs undergoing
restructuring or tender privatization and indebted to such banks; (ii) the previous five-
year social program requirements were replaced with maximum one-year social programs
in tender documents; and (iii) the PA became the bankruptcy administrator for SOEs for
which bankruptcy proceedings had been initiated. The amendments to the Restructuring
Decree dated June 2005 re-confirmed the PA's authority to sell assets and shares in
enterprises prior to reaching an agreement with creditors and ensured the transparency of
this restructuring method by describing the mechanism for establishment of the escrow
account and the use of the proceeds out of the escrow for creditors. This improved the
restructuring process.

During the implementation, the government displayed consistently strong commitment to
the enterprise and banking sector reforms supported under the project, despite periods of
political instability, and, in broader terms, under the PFSAC II and PPFDPC I projects, as
demonstrated by completion of the program targets by the government. This policy
support was important for effective implementation of this technical assistance program.

The PA's governance, as well as adequacy and quality of staff were affected by the
periods of political instability and growing private sector opportunities. As a result of the
instability, the PA Director was changed twice in the first half of 2004. The
implementation capacity of the PA deteriorated in mid-2004 because most skilled experts
were leaving the PA and those who came needed a long period of training. The Bank
financed the incremental operating costs of the PA mainly under the PSD TA Grant at
that time and suggested to help the government raise additional donor funds to support
them once the FSD and PSD Grants would be closed in December 2004.

Availability of other financing and the lower- than- expected total amount of retainer fees
for the financial advisors hired under Part B reduced disbursement under this component,
thus freeing funds for other needs. However, these factors did not reduce the achievement
of the desired project outcome. Other financing included the FSD TA Grant that was
available until the extended period of December 2004 and sufficed for the DIA's ongoing
activities. After its closure, the government started disbursements from the credit for Part
B. It also included funds from Sida for liquidation of insolvent insurers.

Factors subject to implementing agency control

Beyond the above governance issues caused by the political instability in 2003-2004,
effective management in both the PA and the DIA helped implement the project
efficiently, despite the complexity of the issues involved.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. The project identified a number of quantitative and qualitative indicators
to monitor the implementation progress that would lead to more private sector led growth.



                                                                                           13

The indicators focused on direct results from project activities (for example, the number
of SOEs and banks restructured, sold, privatized, put into bankruptcy, etc.) rather than on
higher-level outcomes, such as reduction in the amount of subsidies (however, these were
goals of the policy credits supported by this project) or other aspects of restructuring to
show the magnitude of the issues involved, such as number of employees in the
enterprises before restructuring and the value of liabilities taken over by the buyers in
addition to the cash price. The targets were based on the government's strategies and
implementation plans for the enterprise and financial sectors and those agreed in the
Bank's policy credits. The data on most of the selected indicators was available and
maintained as part of monitoring the implementation of the reform programs by the PA
and the DIA.

M&E implementation. The PA and the DIA produced statistical and qualitative data on
the implementation progress based on most of the selected implementation indicators
(and some additional indicators, such as sales proceeds, investment commitments, and
value of social programs). The Restructuring, Tender and Auction Centers maintained
databases on the implementation of their respective programs funded from different
sources.

M&E utilization. The Bank reviewed the implementation progress data adequately
during the supervision missions and monitored its frequency and coverage so as to be up-
to-date on the overall progress of the enterprise and banking sector reform programs
funded by different sources.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The PMUs in both the PA and the DIA operated in compliance with the Bank guidelines
on procurement, disbursement, and financial management. Financial management and
procurement were rated satisfactory throughout the project implementation. The annual
audit reports and the quarterly financial monitoring reports were submitted on time and
deemed satisfactory by the Bank. The agencies produced regular procurement plans that
contained cumulative data on the contracts financed with details on the actual schedule.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Transition arrangements for post-project operations. The PA has secured adequate
funding to continue the restructuring and privatization program for SOEs with adequate
and qualified staffing and management after the project. In addition to improving its own
operational budget based on the retained portion of the privatization revenues, in early
2006 the PA received a EUR 6.5 million grant (US$9.2 million equivalent) from the EAR,
administered by the Bank, to complete the restructuring, privatization, and bankruptcy of
remaining SOEs by end-2008. Further, given the PA's expertise and experience, the
government intends to use the PA's services to undertake privatization of municipally
and state-owned enterprises. The DIA, in its turn, will be able to sustain its permanent
operations from its internal budget, based primarily on fees for the deposit insurance
scheme, and is seeking donor assistance to complete the privatization program.




                                                                                           14

Follow-up by the Bank. The Bank is providing both technical assistance (through the
EAR grant) and policy advice to the government on expediting the implementation of the
remaining reform agenda in the financial and enterprise sectors. In the enterprise sector,
the advice includes the following: (i) completing the privatization of the SOEs, further
developing effective mechanisms of dealing with unsaleable SOEs; (ii) improving the
bankruptcy mechanism, (iii) strengthening fiscal discipline by reducing direct and
indirect subsidies; and (iv) continuous restructuring of public enterprises. In the financial
sector, the discussions have focused on the following: (i) resolving the remaining state-
owned or controlled banks and divesting financial assets; (ii) continuing to strengthen the
insurance sector regulatory regime, and (iii) concluding the sale of DDOR and the
comprehensive restructuring and eventual privatization of the largest public-owned
insurer, Dunav (as intended by the government).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives, design, and implementation of the project continue to be highly relevant
for Serbia's development strategies and the Bank' country assistance strategy. While the
initial components remained relevant throughout the project life, the project responded
flexibly to the government's reforms in the insurance sector through the restructuring
dated December 2005 and expanded its relevance in the financial sector. Therefore, the
project is consistent with the following two goals in the government's SAP and PRSP and,
accordingly, in the FY05-07 CAS: (i) creating a larger, more dynamic private sector and
(ii) creating a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Part A: Privatization through restructuring of socially-owned enterprises

This component achieved its objectives highly satisfactorily and its contribution to
private sector led growth (the PDO) is high, as demonstrated below, even though there
remains work to be done by end-200814.

Overall, significant progress was achieved in restructuring the large SOEs and
transferring their ownership to the private sector, in many cases to strategic investors,
while putting unsaleable SOEs to bankruptcy. This was particularly facilitated by the
amendments to the Privatization Law dated June 2005 that allowed debt write-off against
sales proceeds between large SOEs and bankrupt state-owned banks and made the PA the
bankruptcy administrator of SOEs that failed to be sold (see Sections 2 1.7 and 2.2).
Based on the PA's successful operations, the government met on a timely basis and
exceeded the related targets agreed under the PFSAC II and PPFDPC I and the triggers




14This includes about 20 large SOEs that require restructuring before sale and 98 large SOEs in the Tender
Center's portfolio (including SOEs that went through restructuring).




                                                                                                       15

set for the proposed Programmatic Private and Financial Sector Development Policy
Loan II (P096711).

The project's direct assistance to advancing the restructuring and privatization programs
yielded the following results, with likely high contribution to private sector led growth:

· The sales of 19 large SOEs as going concerns that the project directly supported
    through financing of restructuring agents and financial advisors generated about
    US$119 million sales proceeds, including US$27 million from restructured SOEs and
    US$92 million from direct sales, and US$109 million of investments commitments
    (see Annex 2)15. These amounts will be further increased by the expected sale of other
    SOEs whose privatization was initiated under the project (see Annex 9).

More broadly, the project can take credit for results of the overall privatization program
implemented by the PA during the project life, insofar as it helped build and maintain the
institutional capacity of the PA to administer the complex process:

· As of end of April 2007, the PA had restructured 65 SOEs of 78 SOEs in the
    restructuring list and sold 19 SOEs as going concerns (this does not include tenders
    and auctions of under EUR 1 million). The total value of all sales of large SOEs from
    the restructuring list as of the same date was US$89 million. Based on more recent
    data, 28 large SOEs have been sold from the restructuring list and in other cases some
    subsidiaries/assets have been sold. The other restructured SOEs are in the tender (14)
    or auction process (11) or are undergoing bankruptcy (7) (see Annex 9). The
    remainder (18) is undergoing restructuring.
· In total, the PA has sold 1,512 SOEs out of 2,091 offered between 2002 and August
    2007, representing a success rate of 72% (see Annex 10). From the number of sold,
    85 large SOEs were sold through tender procedure (including both direct sales and
    sales from the restructuring list) and 1,427 SOEs through auction.
· The tender and auction sales have generated US$4.8 billion of revenue for the
    budget16, US$1.7 billion of new investment commitments, and US$392 million for
    social programs as of August 2007.

In addition to the results of the program, the following factors demonstrate the increased
capacity of the PA to implement a complex restructuring and privatization program:

· The PA secured the services of numerous highly qualified international and local
    restructuring and sales agents for the above tenders (the number of tenders carried out
    was 178 between 2002 and August 2007), of which 21 were restructuring agents of
    which nine were funded by the project. The PA adapted the same selection process
    based on international competition and transparency for all donor-funded selections.


15This number excludes proceeds from the sale of individual business units. The latest sale was concluded
on October 30, 2007.
16This amount includes the proceeds from the sale of MobTel in addition to the sales value shown in
Annex 10.


                                                                                                       16

· The PA contributed to finding solutions in the legislative and institutional framework
     that enabled quicker restructuring and bankruptcy process.
· The PA was appointed as the administrator of bankrupt SOEs and, in carrying out this
     role, has expedited the bankruptcy process considerably.

Very importantly, the overall restructuring and privatization program has reduced the
subsidies paid by the government to the SOEs and will reduce any future burden on the
government from losses and arrears that would have originated from the SOEs had they
not gone through the program. To this end, while there is no easily available data on
indirect subsidies, the annual direct subsidies from the MOEP to the enterprise sector
have declined from about US$137 million in 2002 to US$51 million in 2006, as the
privatization program has progressed17.

Part B: Bank and Insurance Restructuring Program

Building on the previous Bank and other donor support, this component achieved its
objectives satisfactorily and its contribution to strengthening the financial sector and
likely increasing private sector led growth is substantial, as demonstrated by the
following: (a) transition to private ownership in the banking sector is almost complete;
(b) albeit the slow bankruptcy process, considerable progress has been made in
liquidating insolvent banks and claiming their receivables, in particular, based on the
amendments to the Privatization Law in mid-2005 that allowed debt write-off from sales
proceeds of SOEs; (c) restructuring of the insurance sector is progressing well; and (d)
the targets under the PPFDPC I for the insurance sector restructuring and selling non-
performing loans of the banks liquidated in 2002 were met thanks to the project
assistance.

More specifically, the DIA achieved the following results based on the project and other
donor support:

Results in bank privatization. The government chose ten majority state-owned banks for
privatization at the end of 2004, offered seven for sale, and privatized six of them,
including the largest state-owned bank, to strategic foreign investors (see Annexes 2 and
11). The government has raised almost US$1.3 billion through the privatization of banks
(of this, US$0.7 billion with direct project support). The DIA is working on a bank
resolution strategy for the remaining four majority state-owned banks (all small).




17The SOEs in the restructuring list are the main beneficiaries of direct subsidies. They accounted for
US$116 million or 85% of the total direct subsidies to the enterprise sector in 2002 and US$37 million or
74% as of the third quarter of 2006. Further, the top 20 SOEs accounted for 80% of the direct subsidies
extended to the SOEs in the restructuring list and 60% of the subsidies to the total enterprise sector as of
the third quarter of 2006.




                                                                                                            17

As a result of the project and other donor support, the Serbian banking sector has almost
completed the transition from the state control to the private sector, largely to foreign
owners; it has increased competition and the flow of credit to the real sector; and it has
reduced the interest rates. More specifically, the total number of banks has decreased
from 47 in 2003 to 37 in 2006 (of which 22 are foreign controlled in 2006). Although the
number of banks has been declining from year to year, the expansion of access to credit
for both individuals and firms has been a major result of the reform of the banking system.
Subsequently, the credit to corporates accounts for 16.7% of GDP. Total assets have been
growing at an increasing pace and account for over 61% of GDP in 2006 compared to
31% in 2003 (although this is still low compared to other countries region). The share of
state controlled assets has declined to about 7% in 2006, while the foreign controlled
assets have increased their share to over 78% of the total assets, eliminating effectively
the ability of the state to distort the flow of financial resources through the banking
system. The ratio of citizens' deposits to GDP has increased 14.71% in 2006, which both
reflect the increasing confidence of the public in the soundness of banks. As a result of
cleaning up of balance sheets and expanding credit and deposit activity, the banks have
recorded a net positive pre-tax income.

Results in bankruptcy/liquidation of banks. Nineteen banks have been put into
bankruptcy/liquidation by the end of the project (an increase of six from end-2004). Of
them, one case has been closed, while the others - of which ten were supported by the
project - are undergoing the bankruptcy/ liquidation process that takes several years. The
results of the DIA's activities in this area are the following (see Annex 2):

· During 2002-2006, the DIA received US$88 million of net inflows from liquidation
    of bankrupt state owned banks18. Since 2002 the gross amount collected on all
    grounds totals US$384 million. In particular, the DIA has collected US$9.3 million
    from the sales proceeds of large SOEs or 12.78% of the reported receivables from
    such SOEs. With respect to the claims that the DIA carved out from the state-owned
    banks in privatization, as of end-2006, the remaining portfolio of such claims consists
    of 101 prime claims, amounting to US$476 million. During 2007, ten companies


18This amount takes into consideration the sales proceeds from selling these bank's real estate, fixed or
other assets, payments to their creditors, and success in collecting their receivables, including from large
SOEs based on the amendments to the Law on Privatization dated June 2005 that allowed debt write-off
from the privatization proceeds.




                                                                                                            18

    were sold and re-scheduling or revised arrangements are in the process of being
    negotiated with the new owners in respect of the related claims in the DIA's remit,
    totaling US$52 million of the above amount.
· With regards to the sale of non-performing loans carved out from the four large
    majority state-owned banks liquidated in 2002, the DIA sold fifty loans in 2005 from
    the four large banks liquidated in 2002. This represents 11.54% of the non-
    performing loan portfolio of the banks in bankruptcy/liquidation. Based on the
    changes in the legislation and internal procedures, the DIA is planning a second sale
    of the non-performing loans of banks in bankruptcy/liquidation.
· Finally, the fact that the project did not support costly rehabilitation of banks should
    be considered very fortunate and highly supportive of the achievement of the project
    objectives.

Results in restructuring the insurance sector. The project made a substantial contribution
to the insurance sector restructuring by supporting the ongoing tender of DDOR and
restructuring of Dunav. The sale of DDOR, the second largest insurer in Serbia, is
expected to be completed by the end of 2007 after some delay in early 2007 due to the
parliamentary elections (see Section 2.2). The restructuring of Dunav, the largest insurer
in Serbia, is expected to be completed by the end of 2008, followed by privatization.
These two state-owned insurance companies represent about 67% of the sector in terms
of insured premium.

The liquidation of insolvent insurance companies is underway. Of the 17 companies in
the DIA's portfolio, six have now been liquidated, and the cases closed. Of the remaining
11 companies, nine are or will be put into bankruptcy, and the remaining two are
expected to be settled by the liquidation process. The project did not directly fund
assistance to liquidation of insolvent insurers, as the DIA managed to handle it with its
own resources and the assistance of advisors financed by Sida (see Section 2.2).

3.3 Efficiency
The costs involved in contributing to private sector led growth by the project were low
considering the benefits received from the project activities and other support that the
project (and previous Bank projects) helped mobilize. The project benefits are and will be
demonstrated by increased private sector led growth and improved intermediation and
allocation of financial resources into productive investments by the financial sector.
Benefits, such as those listed below, clearly outweigh the costs of the project:

· The government has received US$4.8 billion of revenue for the budget from tender
    and auction sales of large SOEs (as of August 2007)19 and almost US$1.3 billion
    through the privatization of banks. It has gained US$88 million of net inflows from
    liquidation of banks. More importantly, the government's expenditures have gone



19This amount includes the proceeds from the sale of MobTel in addition to the sales value shown in
Annex 10.




                                                                                                    19

    down in terms of less spending on subsidies and less financing of any future losses
    incurred by the SOEs or banks (see Section 3.2).
· Net FDI has grown from US$326 million in 2002 to estimated US$4.3 billion in 2006.
    The cumulative net FDI in cash totaled US$8 billion in 2000-2006 (FDI from bank
    privatization totals US$1.3 billion; FDI from privatization of SOEs totals US$3.2
    billion, excluding investment commitments and social programs). The total FDI
    inflows per capita were US$197 and US$587 in 2005 and 2006, respectively,
    compared to the averages in other transition countries of US$124 and US$175,
    respectively. The FDI inflows represented 6.1% and 15.3% of the GDP in the same
    years compared to about 5% in other transition countries. Studies show that the role
    of a foreign strategic investor is critical in terms of increasing output, competitiveness,
    technology absorption, etc.
· According to the Impact Assessment of Privatization in Serbia done by the EAR in
    October 2005, analyses of companies and sectors show that companies privatized
    according to the 2001 Privatization Law have generally improved their performance
    (operating profit, sales, and exports, when relevant) and have invested to modernize
    their production.
· The banking sector reform has improved access to credit for both individuals and
    firms. Credit to non-government sector has expanded from US$4.2 billion in 2004 to
    over US$11 billion in mid-2007.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall weighted rating of the outcome is satisfactory based on the relevance, likely
contribution to private sector led growth, and efficiency of the project before and after the
adaptive restructuring approved in December 2005. The rating takes into consideration
the satisfactory average rating of the two components before the restructuring and the
highly satisfactory average rating (slightly so, after rounding) after the restructuring, both
weighted against the actual disbursements in respective periods, as shown below.

In case of Part A, the progress of the restructuring and privatization program was
satisfactory at the end-2005 with restructuring/privatization agents engaged for some 40
large SOEs (out of which 15 SOEs were directly financed by the project); six large SOEs
sold as going concerns from the SOEs in the restructuring list; bankruptcies initiated for
six large SOEs; 49 SOEs sold via tenders (directly or after restructuring) and 1,092
through auctions with the total sales value of US$1.6 billion and investment
commitments of US$1.2 million (see Annex 10). By the end of the project, the progress
accelerated increasingly, and Part A reached highly satisfactory results (see Section 3,
Annexes 2, 9 and 10).

In case of Part B, the overall progress in the banking reform was satisfactory at the end of
2005, as three majority state-owned banks had been privatized with the sales value of
US$389 million; 12 banks had been put to liquidation/bankruptcy; net inflows from
liquidation of banks totaled US$66 million, the total amount of receivables collected was
US$34 million; based on the amendments to the Privatization Law dated June 2005, the
DIA had identified receivables from SOEs that the DIA could attempt to claim from their
sales proceeds; and the DIA had sold 11.54% of the non-performing loan portfolio of the
banks in bankruptcy/liquidation (see Section 3.2). Based on the final results in the
banking sector and its contribution to the insurance sector restructuring, Part B achieved
satisfactory results by the end of the project, given the impact of the reforms on the
banking sector, while the restructuring of the insurance sector has got a good start (See
Section 3, Annexes 2 and 11).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty impacts. (i) The project benefits have reached the target groups identified in the
PDO ­ the financial system and the enterprise sector ­ demonstrated by the progress in
transferring the ownership of the large SOEs and state-owned banks to private sector (and
good progress in privatization / restructuring / resolution of the insurance sector), as
described in Sections 3.1-3.4. These results are already producing benefits in terms of
better access to credit, lower interest rates, better competition, better financial health of
the enterprise sector due to reduced subsidies, etc. The impact assessment carried out by
the EAR shows that companies privatized in accordance with the 2001 Privatization Law
have generally improved their performance. (ii) The project is expected to have a very
positive impact on the poverty reduction. It is recognized that an effective strategy for
fighting poverty requires a multi-sectoral approach, as applied in this project. In turn,
both private and financial sector development reforms are regarded as fundamental pillars
to the promotion of growth, employment creation, and more broadly to the establishment
of an adequate business enabling environment that would make early reform efforts more
sustainable.

Social development. The privatization and, in particular, restructuring leads in most
cases to reduction of labor in the subject enterprises and more so in the large SOEs which
were usually the largest employers in the country and, having been used to soft budget
constraints, had excess capacity of labor. Resolution of the large SOEs had thus high
social costs. Since the beginning of the program, the government, however, addressed the



                                                                                             21

social impact of the privatization and restructuring program and integrated concrete
measures into the enterprise reform program to support and compensate redundant
workers. The social program was developed for each large privatized SOE, co-funded by
the budget and the investor. The cumulative value of the social programs paid by the
investors amounted to US$392 million as of end-August 2007.

In addition, even though initially the restructuring and privatization program increases
unemployment, it needs to be considered that other employment opportunities arise with
the growth of the number of new enterprises generated by the restructuring and overall by
the faster growth of the private sector and more effective allocation of resources to
productive uses in the financial sector.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Bank's successful coordination of donor support with its own resources had a major
impact in both maximizing the impact of resources by improving efficiency and targeting
assistance and in improving operational efficiency by ensuring that appropriate support
could be provided at the time it was required. Very importantly, the Bank's assistance
was based on international best practice, with lessons applied from setting up and running
similar institutions in other transition economies.

The Privatization Agency. The project played a crucial role in strengthening the
capacity of the PA (in particular, of the Restructuring Center and the Tender Center) to
carry out the restructuring and privatization programs, as demonstrated by the results (see
Section 3.2 and Annex 2). This is true especially considering the initially limited capacity
in the Restructuring Unit, a lack of other donor funds for funding of all three phases of
the restructuring program, and need for supplemental funding for the direct privatization
program before new donor funds were mobilized. The project also played a key role in
the establishment of the Bankruptcy Unit in the PA, following the amendments to the
Privatization Law dated June 2005 based on which the PA was appointed as the
bankruptcy administrator of SOEs (see Section 2.2). This expedited the bankruptcy
process.

Based on the project and other donor support, the PA has employed about 70 local
consultants in the core business activities and their support units by the end of the project
life (the PA's permanent staff is over 300). Excluding the difficult year of 2004, the PA
was able to recruit and maintain highly qualified local staff and consultants, as it was able
to offer competitive salaries based on donor funding, mainly from the credit.

As a result of the assistance provided by the project and while there still remains a
number of SOEs in the restructuring and privatization program, the PA has been able to
implement the difficult program successfully. Consequently, the government is
considering using the PA's services for implementing the privatization of a large amount
of state and municipally owned utility companies. Furthermore, the project also helped
build local consultant capacity that is highly regarded based on the demand from the
neighboring countries undertaking similar programs.




                                                                                           22

Deposit Insurance Agency. The DIA benefited from extensive donor assistance to
further strengthen its institutional capacity for managing privatization and liquidation of
banks and insurance companies21. The Bank was, however, its largest donor with two
technical assistance and several adjustment credits. Building on the previous projects, this
project was a critical catalyst for further mobilizing, designing, and coordinating other
donor assistance. Combined with other donor assistance that financed international and
local consultants for the DIA, the project helped the DIA to gain the expertise to manage
the privatization and liquidation work going forward. In terms of strengthening and
building the DIA's capacity, the project's financial contribution was biggest in the area of
administering bankruptcy/liquidation of insolvent banks and collecting their receivables,
as it funded about 40 local consultants that mostly worked in the bankrupt banks and
shared their experience with the staff. The project contributed significantly to initiating
the insurance sector privatization and restructuring and to building the local capacity for
this work through these specific transactions and combined with other donor support.
Finally, the project contributed to maintaining transparent procurement procedures -
based on international competition - for selection of consultants funded by all donors.
This ensured the high quality of the advice received and the process followed.
Consequently, the PMU in the DIA that was established during the previous project has
been engaged in implementing large amounts of other donor and government projects due
to the experience and good performance demonstrated in implementing Bank projects.

See other parts of Section 3.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
There is a negligible to low risk that that the outcomes (or expected outcomes) will not be
maintained (ore realized) due to the following reasons (see also Section 3): (i) the reforms
supported by the project, such as privatization of state-owned banks, liquidation of
insolvent banks, and restructuring and privatization of SOEs are largely irreversible; (ii)
the government is committed to complete the privatization and restructuring program of
SOEs implemented by the PA by the end of 2008; (iii) the DIA is developing a bank
strategy, which will define the resolution strategy for the few remaining four small state-
owned banks; (iv) the government is expecting to complete the sale of DDOR by end-
2007 and is committed to privatizing Dunav in 2-3 years after the ongoing restructuring;
and (v) the government's overall reform program is built on joining the European Union
and World Trade Organization, which should ensure further progress in the reforms, even
though the unresolved status of Kosovo continues to represent a considerable risk to
government stability and reform effort.



21While the World Bank was the largest donor, the DIA received grant funding from a number of donors
for the banking and insurance sector restructuring over the years. The donors included the US Treasury,
USAID, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and Sida (the latter since 2005).


                                                                                                       23

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly satisfactory
The highly satisfactory rating of the Bank performance reflects several factors that
contributed to the level of achievement of the project development objectives. First,
building on the ongoing overall Bank assistance program, the Bank assisted the
government to identify very accurately the next issues in the reform progress, considering
the linkages between the financial and private sector reforms. The Bank further advised
the government on the implementation of the reforms that affected the design of the
project based on extensive lessons learnt in other transition countries and international
best practices in implementing such reforms. In addition, the Bank obtained input from
the donors to the design of the project, as did the other donors for theirs, in order to
maximize the outcome and avoid overlaps. Therefore, the project had extreme strategic
importance to the country and for the Bank's assistance strategy. Considering the
experience of the ongoing projects, the Bank identified accurately risks and incorporated
their mitigation into the ongoing and upcoming adjustment projects and into the design of
the project (for example, in terms of extensive capacity building of the agencies,
including competitive salaries for the staff). Further, the project benefited from the
experience of the whole Bank team involved with the adjustment and technical assistance
operations.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance was satisfactory in terms of supporting effective implementation
of the project through appropriate supervision and continuing exceptional efforts to
coordinate and mobilize donor funds for the reforms in line with the evolving needs of
the government. The Bank carried out careful supervision throughout the implementation
and identified on a timely basis issues that required attention either on the policy level or
in implementation and adjusted the project flexibly to meet the evolving needs.

For example, the Bank team monitored the tender program during the implementation
and offered technical advice on the appropriate exit for companies that failed the first
tender. It advised the PA to show caution in choosing the auction route of exit because,
while it is appealing due to different incentives it offers, it favors insiders more than
tenders. The Bank contributed to maintaining open and transparent selection of
international financial advisors and, consequently, these procedures were adopted for all
donor funded programs under both components.

As envisioned during preparation of the project, the complementary nature of the Bank
operations, including the subject credit, remained strong and facilitated concrete synergy
and results. For example, under the PFSAC II, the government reduced the mandatory
social program for buyers to one year and made improvements to the legislation to
expedite the restructuring for privatization program (above all, by including provisions
for conditional debt write-off).



                                                                                           24

The Bank team also helped the PA obtain additional funding from the EAR until the end
of 2008 in order to bring the capacity of the PA in line with its needs. The Bank team
continued coordination of the assistance to the enterprise and financial sector reform, thus
maximizing the outcome of all assistance efforts and improving the operational efficiency.
Adequacy of supervision was sufficient, including for the fiduciary aspects during the
active implementation period. The reporting of supervision was candid and clear and
focused on results of the programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall Bank performance was satisfactory in ensuring quality at entry and
supporting implementation effectively, even through the period after the project closure.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The rating reflects satisfactory performance of the government in ensuring quality during
preparation and implementation. In particular, the project received consistent support
from the government, given its importance for achieving the policy objectives of the
PFSAC II and PPFDPC I. Despite the delays in adopting important legislation for the
project due to the political instability (see Section 2.2), the government maintained its
reform course and, after the situations stabilized, facilitated considerable improvements
in the enabling environment for the implementation of the programs. In doing so, the
government considered the experience gained by the agencies in implementing the
reform on a timely basis within the limitations of the political situation. The government
can be complimented for providing adequate operational budget for the agencies and co-
financing for the PA and DIA operations. With regards to the donor coordination, the
government contributed to good cooperation with the numerous donors that facilitated the
implementation of the reforms in the financial and enterprise sectors. Finally, there were
no issues in terms of lack of compliance with any fiduciary issues.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall performance of the PA and the DIA was satisfactory in ensuring quality in
preparation and implementation. Both agencies were greatly committed to facilitating the
project implementation and proved to be very efficient in timely addressing issues within
their control, based on the experience gained on previous projects and effective
management. Given its high standards of performance, the government is considering
using the PA for the implementation of privatization of state and municipally owned
entities after completion of the SOE program. The DIA will implement the remaining
bank and insurance sector restructuring program in addition to its new permanent
activities in the deposit insurance. The PMUs in both agencies performed their fiduciary
obligations with no issues. Given their high standards of performance, the PMUs in both
agencies are administering (and have administered) other donor or Bank projects.




                                                                                         25

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall Borrower performance rating is satisfactory based on the government and the
implementation agencies' performance in ensuring quality in preparation and
implementation towards the achievement of the development objectives. However,
several changes in management of the PA and the DIA based on shifts in political
environment disrupted sometimes the operations (see Section 2.2).

6. Lessons Learned
The following lessons which are the same as in the PSD TA Grant and FSD TA Grant
can be drawn from the project experience:

Importance of drawing lessons from other transition countries. The project design
reflected best practice lessons from the Bank's prior operations in Europe and Central
Asia, tailored to Serbian environment, and in Serbia. In particular, it recognized the
urgent need for resolution of the large loss-making SOEs and maintaining a clean and
transparent privatization process for them, as well, and transferring such SOEs
immediately to bankruptcy in cases sales did not materialize quickly. In addition, based
on the Bank's experience, the project ­ together with the support of the policy credits ­
urged to find a comprehensive solution to debt owed by SOEs undergoing restructuring
and privatization to bankrupt banks in the DIA's portfolio (and other creditors) in order to
expedite the process. Both at the preparation and implementation stages, the project
benefited tremendously from direct experiences of staff and consultants who had
practical experience with bank restructuring programs in countries, such as Croatia,
Hungary, Slovakia, and Russia.

Technical assistance linkage to the Bank's policy reforms. Technical assistance in
support of politically difficult transition reforms have a higher chance of success if
designed as an integral part of the Bank's broader sector assistance strategy, supported at
the policy level by relevant conditions in adjustment operation(s). The reverse is also
true; the Bank's ability to provide extensive technical assistance on a timely basis has
been enormously important in enabling the PFSAC II and PPFSDPC I program to
achieve its objectives on the enterprise and financial sector reform, as recorded in
relevant policy conditions on privatization and restructuring of SOEs, subsequent
reduction of subsidies, progress in restructuring and privatization of the two largest
insurance companies, and bank privatization.

Reform champions at the policy level. The implementation of a complex and politically
sensitive technical assistance program does not only require a fully functioning
implementing agency, but also constant support at the level of senior policy-making. In
this case, from the very inception the project enjoyed full support of the reform minded
senior policy makers at the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and the National
Bank of Serbia, who ensured the policy environment to be conducive to achieving the
project objectives.




                                                                                         26

Importance of donor coordination. The effective coordination by the Bank of technical
assistance provided by bilateral donors can be a critical factor in quickly developing the
institutional capacity to implement high impact reforms. At every stage of project
preparation and implementation, the team maintained a robust dialogue with donors in
order to avoid duplication of efforts and leverage support for the reforms outlined in the
PFSAC II and PPFDPC I. In addition to serving as a catalyst for coordinating the
continued donor assistance from UK DFID, US Treasury, and Sida for the banking and
insurance sector reform and from the governments of the Netherlands and Sweden for the
enterprise sector reform, the Bank project acted as a catalyst for mobilizing a large grant
from the EAR for completing the SOE privatization program.

Flexibility built into the technical assistance operations is essential when dealing with
rapidly evolving operational environment, requiring adjustments in the project
implementation to reflect the shifting policy priorities. In this case, the project was able to
provide timely assistance to the financial sector as the emphasis of the program first
shifted from bank rehabilitation to privatization (while liquidation of previously bankrupt
banks was ongoing), then to restructuring, and ultimately to privatizing the insurance
sector. In the enterprise the project was adjusted to meet the urgent need for additional
finance for direct privatization, as the PSD TA Grant had closed.

Creating efficient project administration arrangements is a critical factor for
implementing a complex technical assistance program. Following the practice of the
previous Bank projects, the project invested in maintaining fully operational, competent
project management units in both agencies to ensure that the activities under the project
are implemented in a timely and transparent manner, in full accordance with the Bank's
standards on procurement, disbursement, and financial management.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Part A: Privatization through restructuring of socially-owned enterprises (actual
costs ­ US$11.4 million or 105% of original component costs and 80% of actual project
costs)

As originally envisioned, this component provided technical assistance to the PA, as
described below, for restructuring a select group of large loss-making, but potentially
viable SOEs or parts thereof and subsequently privatizing them through tenders or
auctions or, if not possible, putting them to bankruptcy. Towards the end of the project,
the component also financed some direct privatizations of large SOEs (see Section 1.7).

A.1. Privatization through restructuring of large socially-owned enterprises (actual costs
­ US$6.3 million or about 55% of the actual component costs)

This sub-component provided financing for the retainer fees of the restructuring and sales
agents that assisted the PA in the restructuring and privatization, following the
international best practices. Selection of advisors based on quality and price ensured the
high quality of the advisory services, and so most of the advisors were internationally
recognized investment banks.

To this end, the project funded 17 agents for restructuring and direct privatization,
providing assistance to 33 large SOEs22. First, the project funded restructuring agents for
the 16 large SOEs that had been earmarked for the Bank assistance under the
privatization through restructuring program in the course of the project implementation.
Of them, 14 completed restructuring, and two were transferred for direct sale based on
the privatization strategy funded by the project that recommended direct tender sales. Of
the 14 SOEs, ten were sold, one was finalizing the sale, two SOEs were undergoing the
tender procedure, and one SOE was undergoing bankruptcy procedures at the project-end.
Second, the project provided financing for financial advisors that finalized some existing
tenders initiated during the PSD TA Grant and new tenders of altogether 17 large SOEs.
For those 17 companies, 13 tenders were completed, three companies will be offered
through an auction procedure, and for one company the first tender is currently in process.
Out of the 13 completed tenders, nine companies were sold, two companies are currently
in a re-tender process, one has been transferred to sale through share fund methodology,
and one company was transferred to sale through bankruptcy.




22Some companies were pooled; therefore, the number of agents is less than the number of restructuring
and tender transactions.




                                                                                                      29

Consequently, the project supported 29 tenders of large SOEs from the restructuring list
and from direct privatizations, and in addition 11 auctions of large SOEs23.

A.2. Building the institutional capacity of the PA (actual costs ­ US$3.3 million or about
30% of the actual component costs)

This sub-component provided financing for 45 consultants and advisors that strengthened
the capacity of the PA to carry out and improve the restructuring and privatization
process. They included the following:

· Most of them were local project managers engaged to manage the operations and
    procurement during the restructuring and privatization process of the transactions
    supported by the project, manage the engaged restructuring agents, deal with the
    enterprise creditors and employees, and negotiate with potential investors.
· They also included project managers for a number of direct tender privatizations.
· In terms of value of contracts, the Restructuring Center benefited from extensive and
    long-term services of one international and one local resident advisor since mid-2003
    and early 2004, respectively, for restructuring and insolvency issues and
    implementation of restructuring of large SOEs (total value about US$550K).
· Likewise, as agreed, the Tender Center (that was responsible for sales of all SOEs
    through tenders) benefited from long-term resident advisory services (over US$600K)
    on tender privatization issues related to all SOEs.
· A considerable number of the consultants were legal and policy advisors involved to
    advise on issues, such as resolving debts owed by SOEs undergoing restructuring to
    state-owned banks in bankruptcy and liquidation administered by the DIA, improving
    the restructuring process and clarifying the rights of the PA, subsequently drafting
    amendments to the Privatization Law and by-law on restructuring, and resolving legal
    issues related to specific restructuring and privatization transactions. They also
    advised on social and environmental issues that needed to be addressed during the
    restructuring process of specific SOEs.
· Following the establishment of the Bankruptcy Unit in the PA, based on the
    amendment to the Privatization Law dated June 2005, the component financed a
    number of consultants to assist the Bankruptcy Unit in administering the first
    bankruptcy cases, and extensive advisory services since early 2005 to establish the
    Unit (over US$300K).
· The Bank also financed a number of extensive feasibility studies for RTB Bor, one of
    the country's largest loss-making enterprises in the restructuring list (over US$300K).




23This is higher than the number of SOEs supported by the project (33) because some SOEs were offered
for sale more than once.


                                                                                                    30

A.3. Project management and implementation (actual costs ­ US$1.7 million or about
15% of the actual component costs)

The project provided financing for a core team of key officers of the PA and the auditing
services for Part A during the extended implementation period. This followed the practice
adopted in 2001 based on the lessons learnt which demonstrated the importance of the
institutional capacity to carry out complicated reforms.

Part B: Bank and Insurance Restructuring Program (costs ­ US$3 million or 73% of
the original component costs and 20% of actual project costs)

The component supported the implementation of the bank and insurance sector
restructuring program, starting from January 200524. The component costs remained
lower than envisioned at appraisal for reasons described in Sections 1.7 and 2.2,
including the government's decision not to fund rehabilitation of any majority state-
owned banks, lower-than-expected retainer fees for the financial advisors hired, and
availability of other Bank and donor funds.

Part B.1. Bank and insurance company liquidation, rehabilitation, and privatization
(actual costs ­ US$2.4 million or 80% of the actual component costs)

This sub-component financed the auditing services for Part B and the following outputs:

(i) Liquidation and work-out of insolvent banks (costs ­ US$1.3 million or 54% of Part
B.1)

The project provided technical assistance to the DIA for administering the bankruptcy
and liquidation process for the deeply insolvent banks in its portfolio (19 banks in the end
of the project), such as: (i) consulting services to assist the DIA to perform its duties as a
bankruptcy trustee for banks in liquidation, (ii) workout of financial and non-financial
assets of receiverships, and (iii) legal support for the liquidation process. The following
outputs were financed:

· Contracts of 28 bankruptcy specialists/managers, seven loan work-out specialists, one
    legal advisor, and one information technology specialist.
· The bankruptcy specialists/managers assisted with administering bankruptcies of the
    following ten banks: nine in Beogradska banka, four in Investbanka, four in
    Jugobanka, four in Beobanka, two in Borska banka, and one in Slavija banka,
    Valjevska banka, Privredna banka, Dijamant banka, and RAJ banka each. Of the
    banks, RAJ banka is liquidation, the case of Dijamant banka has been closed, and the
    rest are undergoing bankruptcy procedures. The bankruptcy experts were responsible
    for day-to-day activities in the liquidation process, including encashment of these
    banks' property and other assets and collection of claims. The loan work-out


24The government started disbursements under this project after the closure of the FSD Technical
Assistance Grant in December 2004.


                                                                                                  31

     specialists worked with them, mainly focusing on collection of loans owed by debtors
     (mostly large SOEs) to the banks in bankruptcy (liquidation) that were in the DIA's
     portfolio.

(ii) Preparation of banks for privatization (actual costs ­ US$0.3 million or 13% of Part
B.1)

The project provided financing for undertaking the pre-privatization activities of
Vojvodjanska banka a.d. Novi Sad, the largest majority state-owned bank in Serbia in the
DIA's portfolio at that time, including an on-site advisor to help prepare the bank for
privatization. It also financed a financial analyst and three legal advisors to provide
assistance to the DIA's management and the advisors on financial and legal aspects of
privatization of state-owned banks and insurance companies in order to conduct the sale
of shares in consistence with the applicable law and the principles of publicity and
transparency, as well as the efficiency and speed. One translator provided expert written
and verbal translation and assistance to the DIA management, advisors, and other agency
staff primarily, but not limited to Deposit Insurance Sector. In addition, the project
provided financing for the Head of the Secretariat of the Board that was established to
assist the DIA management on liaising with the Board members, organizing the agenda
for Board''s bi-weekly meetings, preparing the background materials, etc.

(iii) Privatization of banks and insurance companies (actual costs ­ US$0.8 million or
33% of Part B.1)

The project provided financing for the retainer fees and services of the financial advisors
to undertake the marketing and implementation of privatization tenders of some of the
majority state-owned banks in the DIA's portfolio and some other services, as follows:

· A financial advisor to assist with privatization of Niska banka and Credy banka, one
     in each. Niska banka was sold in December 2005 with 89.39% of stakes acquired by a
     Hungarian bank. The tender for sale of 72.28% of Credy banka's shares was
     published in January 2006, but thereafter withdrawn, as no binding bids were
     received. The advisors were engaged for preparation of the tender documents, market
     assessments, publication and conduct of international public tender, evaluation of bids,
     and negotiations with the first ranked bidder. The financial advisors that won the bids
     for Vojvodjanska banka and Panonska banka requested no retainer fees, which would
     have been paid from the credit, but only a success fee based on the sales value.
     Therefore, the credit funds were not needed for these contracts. Vojvodjanska banka,
     the largest state-owned bank at that time, was sold in September 2006 with a 99.44%
     stake acquired by a Greek bank. Panonska banka was sold in July 2006 with 87.39%
     of shares acquired by an Italian banking and insurance group.
· A privatization advisor for DDOR, the second largest insurer. A tender was launched
     in March 2006, and a number of parties have expressed their interest. It is expected
     that the sale will be concluded before the end of 2007.
· Two on-site supervisory advisors for the implementation of the strategic restructuring
     plan in Dunav, the largest insurer in Serbia, and actuarial assessment of its liabilities.



                                                                                             32

   The advisors assisted the company in implementing a comprehensive restructuring
   plan which is still ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of 2008,
   followed by privatization.
· Design of the visual identity of the DIA. In accordance with the Law of Deposit
   Insurance dated July 2005, the DIA implemented a promotion campaign strategy to
   familiarize the public with the concept and objectives of the system of insurance of
   natural persons' deposits and to contribute to the growth of savings with banks
   operating in the Serbian market. The project financed the first part of this campaign to
   inform the public about the characteristics of the applicable deposit insurance scheme.

Part B.2. Project implementation (actual costs ­ US$0.6 million or 20% of the actual
component costs)

This sub-component financed the salaries of the key PMU staff for managing,
implementing, and monitoring Part B, as well as tender announcements for privatization
of Niska banka, Vojvodjanska banka, Panonska banka, Credy banka, and DDOR.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Part A: Privatization through Restructuring of Socially-Owned Enterprises

(a) Borrower
The objective of the Project was to facilitate private sector-led economic growth in
Republic of Serbia. The objective of this component was to provide urgent assistance to
the Republic of Serbia for launching and implementation of restructuring and
privatization process for the most problematic large SOEs in Serbia.

At the time of appraisal, the Serbian enterprise sector was still dominated by inefficient,
heavily subsidized socially-owned enterprises (SOEs). The project objectives were
consistent with both Government's long-term reform strategy and the Bank's Transition
Support Strategy (TSS) for FRY therefore, of crucial importance to Serbia's delayed
transition to market economy.

The Serbian restructuring strategy is an integral part of the Enterprise Privatization
Framework agreed with the Bank in the FRY/Republic of Serbia Letter of Development
Policy for the PFSAC I. The above framework is based on the Republic of Serbia
Privatization Law adopted, with the Bank support, in June 2001. A modern Bankruptcy
Law has also been adopted (supported by PFSAC II).

Based on lessons learned, originally developed restructuring model was slightly changed
by the Decree on Restructuring, adopted by the Serbian Parliament in June 2005. This
Decree intended to eliminate the difficulties with restructuring in the privatization
procedure, mainly by "write off" of debts to government and public creditors as of
December 2004 in whole upon privatization. This radical methodology made many of the
SOEs sellable and consequently the vast majority of the independent business units and
new companies created from SOE assets during the privatization process was sold
through the tender and auction process and some of them were directed to the Bankruptcy
unit for their final liquidation. In some instances the SOE were allowed to sell some of
their assets.

From the beginning of 2002 until the end of June 2007, the PA has managed to privatize
1950 companies, generating more than 2.3 billion of revenue for the budget, almost 1.2
billion of new investment commitments. From this number, 171 large SOEs have been
sold through tender procedure, and some 1,866 through auction. The study conducted by
the World Bank In 2005, recognized Serbia as the quickest reforming economy in the
World.

We find that the institutional development impact of the Project is highly satisfactory.
The Project played a key role in creating and strengthening the institutional capacity for
implementing complex transition reforms in the enterprise sector. In particular, the
Project helped to strengthen the Privatization Agency, the institution that is crucial in any
transition program. Very importantly, the Bank's assistance was based on international



                                                                                           39

best-practice, and lessons learned from setting up and running similar institutions in other
transition economies and resulted in both maximizing the impact of resources as well as
in improving operational efficiency.

Mladjan Dinkic, Minister, Ministry of Economy and Regional Development

(b)Privatization Agency, Republic of Serbia
The objective of this component was to provide urgent assistance to the Republic of
Serbia for launching and implementation of restructuring and privatization process for the
most problematic large SOEs in Serbia. The Project assisted in establishment of a
consistent approach and methodology for the restructuring and subsequent privatization
of large problematic SOEs that could not be sold in their current state, financially
supported hiring of financial advisors for restructuring and subsequent privatization of a
number of large loss-making enterprises and helped to strengthen the capacity of the
Privatization Agency to implement the privatization process in Serbia.

The Ministry of Economy consistently displayed strong commitment to the enterprise
sector reforms supported under the Project, and, in broader terms, under PFSAC program.
Despite several changes in the Serbian government, Ministry of Economy always
reaffirmed its commitment to the Project objectives and made a significant effort to
accelerate the implementation of the Project before its closing date. The Bank, at all
times, provided all the necessary support and assistance in Project implementation and
cooperation.

A.l. Privatization through Restructuring of SOEs

This sub-component covered the major part of costs (namely, the retainer fees) of
engaging the expert restructuring agents (investment banks, consulting companies and
other financial advisors) for a select number of SOEs. Companies were offered to
restructuring agents either singly, or in small "pools" of two to four companies, with the
objective of capturing economies of scale and attracting top-rate international advisors.
Financial advisors worked under close supervision of the Restructuring Unit of the PA.
The success fees for the restructuring agents, based on the sale of the successor
companies and the remaining assets, were paid from the sales proceeds by the Republic
of Serbia Government.

The project was focus on, but will not be limited to the group of 47 SOEs identified by
the Republic of Serbia Government as potential candidates for privatization through
restructuring. The list of SOEs to undergo privatization through restructuring with the
help of credit funds, agreed upon between the PA and the Bank in course of project
implementation, consisted of 16 SOEs, namely: Matroz; Sever, Livnica and FKJ (Pool 2);
Prvi Maj- Pirot, Beogradski Vunarski Kombinat-Belgrade, Leteks- Leskovac, the Kluz
group (various locations) and Industrija Obuce- Belgrade (Pool 3); IMT&IMR (Pool 4);
Prva Iskra, Baric; Viskoza, Loznica; IHP Prahovo, Prahovo; SFS, Paracin; and RTB Bor,
Bor.




                                                                                         40

The Decree on Restructuring, adopted by the Serbian Parliament in June 2005, intended
to eliminate the difficulties with restructuring in the privatization procedure, mainly by
"write off" of debts to government and public creditors as of December 2004 in whole
upon privatization. This radical methodology made many of the SOEs sellable and
consequently 9 of them have been already sold as going concern with 14.1 mill total
value of sales. Two have been transferred to tender center (IMT and IMR) and one put
into bankruptcy (Matroz). It has to be noted that the two largest privatization projects
financed by the Loan (RTB Bor and IHP Prahovo) are in the final stage of the tender
sales. Their sales would generate several hundreds of million USD of sales proceeds and
several hundreds of million USD of investments. For the remaining two companies (SFS
and Filip Kljajic) the PA is considering opening bankruptcy procedure.

In October 2004, the PA has requested and the Bank agreed to finance continuation of
existing tender projects, originally funded by another Bank project (PSD TA Grant) and
the start of the privatization of new tender projects, namely: (a) continuation of existing
tender projects: Keramika, Mladenovac; Dzervin, Knjazevac; Institut za puteve, Beograd;
Napredak, Stara Pazova; Beogradska Industrija Piva (BIP); and (b) privatization of new
tender projects: six agricultural companies (Pool 15); two bakeries (Pool 17); four
transportation companies (Pool 18)

For those 17 companies 13 tenders have been completed 3 companies will be offered
through an auction procedure and for one company the first tender is currently in process.
Out of the 13 completed tenders, 9 companies had been sold, 2 companies are currently
in a re-tender process, one had been transferred to sale through share fund methodology
and one company was transferred to a sale through bankruptcy. The total sales proceeds
generated for the successful tender companies are 65 mill and investment commitments
57 mill.

In general, international financial advisers with their extensive network of commercial
contacts brought several significant international investors interested in investing in
Serbia. Close cooperation between very experienced international consulting companies
and investment banks, with the top Serbian consulting companies, resulted in transfer of
the know-how and in establishment of long term international relations by the local
consulting companies. It has to be said that after these years, several of the Serbian
advisers are not less able than their international counterparts; indeed some of them are
clearly more capable than most of the international companies competing for the new
projects in South Eastern Europe.

A.2. Building the Institutional Capacity of the Privatization Agency

This sub-component provided technical assistance to build up institutional competence of
the PA to carry out the privatization through restructuring of SOEs financed under the
proposed project and supervise the financial advisors in the implementation of the above-
mentioned restructuring/privatization programs. The PA has utilized fund allocated under
this component to finance 43 local project managers within the PA (Restructuring Center,
Tender Center, Bankruptcy Unit) and two resident foreign advisors. This component was



                                                                                          41

also used for funding of consulting firms to assist in implementation of restructuring of
large SOEs, for Legal Advisory Services to CRC as well as to assist in establishment of
Bankruptcy Unit. As a result of this TA, the PA became competent public agency in
Serbia, qualified and efficient in implementation of the privatization process in Serbia.

A.3. Project Management and Implementation

This sub-component supported the work of the PMU already established in the PA, in the
management, implementation and monitoring of Parts A.1 and A.2 of the project, through
the provision of services, including the audit of records, accounts and financial statements,
goods, and financing of incremental operating costs, including PA staff salaries. The
PMU core staff have benefited from trainings in Bank's procurement, disbursement, and
financial management techniques. Competent PMU at the PA made sure that the
activities under the Project were implemented in a timely and transparent manner, in full
accordance with the Bank's standards on procurement. Very importantly, the Bank's
assistance and cooperation with the Bank's official was highly satisfactory. PMU
established in the PA will be involved in the Bor Regional Development Project.

Part B: Bank and Insurance Sector Restructuring

(a) Ministry of Finance, Republic of Serbia

Assessment of the Privatization and Restructuring of Banks and Enterprises
Technical Assistance Project ­ Part B

The Privatization and Restructuring of Banks and Enterprises Technical Assistance
Credit financed by IDA was an important piece of the overall reform agenda to
restructure and strengthen private and financial sectors in the country. In this project, the
Bank successfully applied lessons from past experience with bank restructuring in other
transition countries and we, from the side of the Government, would like to express our
appreciation of the excellent cooperation we have achieved with the Bank while working
on this program.

The objectives of the Grant were fully achieved and we are very pleased with the
outcomes of the project. It helped us to continue implementation of a comprehensive
bank resolution strategy and thus privatizing state assets. In addition, the project enabled
initiation of the insurance sector restructuring. With the help of the credit funds Serbian
financial sector undergone significant transformation during the Project implementation:
total number of banks decreased from 47 in end-2004 to 36 in mid-2007; deposits in the
banks grew from Euro 3.9 billion in 2004 to 9.7 billion in mid-2007; credit to non-
government sector also expanded from Euro 3.0 billion in 2004 to 8.0 billion in mid-
2007; the foreign banks' asset share grew from 50% in 2005 to over 76% by mid-2007.




                                                                                          42

We appreciate the institutional building effect of the project which helped to build
institutional capacity in the country by further strengthening the Deposit Insurance
Agency (DIA) that is now able to manage bank and insurance companies privatizations
and liquidations. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established in the DIA proved to
be very efficient and capable and we will continue using it for other projects in the sector.

We would also like to comment on the factors affecting project implementation.
Relatively stable political situation during the project implementation positively affected
the project implementation schedule. Sale of 6 state majority owned banks have been
completed during this project. We would like to emphasize that the new Government
formed in May 2007 is also very committed to the reforms.

In respect of the Bank performance and coordination, based on the experience during the
preparation and implementation stages, in our view the Bank's performance was highly
satisfactory. The coordination level with other donors was excellent.

We would like to thank you for your co-operation.

Mirko Cvetkovic, Minister of Finance

(b) Deposit Insurance Agency's Assessment of the PRBE TA Credit ­ Part B

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Part B of the Privatization and
Restructuring of Banks and Enterprises Technical Assistance Credit Project (PRBE TA).
Generally, we believe that PRBE TA addressed the key challenges of Serbia's structural
reform agenda in bank sector including the privatization of state owned banks. PRBE TA
provided a critical support to the continuation of the government's financial sector reform
agenda. Improvement made in the banking sector with support from the PRBE TA was
extraordinary. PRBE TA supported the continuation of the privatization process for state-
owned banks (six bank was sold) with inflow in excess of EUR 795 million. State
participation in the banking sector in terms of assets is reduced bellow 7% and the market
share of the banks in which the state has ownership is reduced bellow 16%. We would
like to emphasize that the Bank timely deployed substantial resources through a technical
assistance that helped the successful implementation of the project.

1. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the PRBE TA - Part B was to facilitate private sector-led economic
growth in the Republic of Serbia through implementation of a comprehensive banking
sector restructuring strategy aimed at creating a more viable financial sector. Specifically,
the project was supported the restructuring or liquidation of insolvent banks under the
control of the DIA and the privatization of most majority state-owned banks. The project
was envisaged as a continuation of the banking sector restructuring program that has
started in 2001 and was supported by Bank through four-years long Financial Sector
Development Technical Assistance Grant (FSD TA). As such, it aimed at providing



                                                                                          43

technical assistance for privatization and liquidation of state owned banks as a part of the
larger structural reform of the financial sector supported by other Bank's and other
donors' programs. The project objective was consistent with the basic objectives of the
process and the Serbian Government's Strategy for the Sale of Banks' Shares Owned by
the Republic of Serbia with the final aim to a well-functioning financial sector which is
essential for private-sector led growth. The project objectives were, therefore, of crucial
importance to Serbia's transition to market economy. The project objectives were clearly
defined and realistic given successful implementation of the previous project and Bank's
overall program in Serbia, as well as the fact that in appraisal phase liquidation of
insolvent banks was well underway and the privatization process for three banks has been
initiated. Assumptions of reaching project objectives were realistic given the adequate
political commitment, stabile Government as well as stabile management of the DIA
during the project implementation period.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The projects objectives has been expanded beginning of 2006 due to the new financial
legislation adopted in July 2005 with the aim of restructuring Serbian insurance system,
the reduction of state influence in the insurance sector and improvement of financial
discipline. Responsibility for liquidation and privatization of insurance companies was
transferred to the DIA. Thanks to the significant savings DIA has made in bank
privatization process due to the lower than expected costs of selected financial advisors
financed under the Project and in order to be able to carry out new duties, the Government
requested Bank's approval to expand project objectives and to reallocate portion of credit
to activities related to insurance companies liquidation and privatization. The Bank
approved this request in January 2006 showing high level of flexibility and
responsiveness to the needs of the Serbian Government and the DIA. This enabled
successful starting of the Serbian insurance sector reform restructuring.

3.3 Closing date
The project closing date was extended once by one year (from April 30, 2006, to April 30,
2007). Although the project was effective since 2003, implementation of the Part B has
started in January 2005 due to the fact that sufficient funds were available for project
activities from the previous project (FSD TA Grant) that has been extended until
December 31, 2004.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Achievement of objectives and outputs under the PRBE TA, Part B was satisfactory. The
project played a crucial role in helping the government initiate and implement a
comprehensive bank and insurance companies resolution strategy in a bold and
transparent manner. It supported continuation of the economically sound liquidation of
insolvent banks and insurance companies and provided timely and high-quality technical
assistance to help the authorities to implement bank and insurance companies
privatization program.




                                                                                         44

All indicators set by the Project Appraisal Document have been achieved under the
project.

As a result of banking sector restructuring directly supported by the project, the Serbian
financial sector has undergone dramatic transformation over the past 6 years. The total
number of banks in Serbia decreased from 83 in early 2001 to 36 in mid-2007. The
project was instrumental in building up the new financial system and restoring depositor
confidence. The restoration of confidence in the banking sector has been dramatic,
evidenced by the astonishing growth in bank deposits, which rose from virtually
negligible level in 2000, to nearly Euro 9.7 billion in mid- 2007. Reflecting growing
investor confidence in the policy framework, foreign bank penetration of the sector has
been rapid. The foreign banks' asset increased and share of more than 76 percent in mid-
2007 comparing to 50 percent in 2005.

4.2 Outputs by components:

B.1. Bank Liquidation, Rehabilitation and Privatization. This sub-component is rated as
satisfactory. This sub-component was envisaged to cover the following:

(i)     Consulting services to provide operational support for receiverships for insolvent
banks currently in the DIA portfolio. Bank provided technical assistance to the DIA for
withdrawal of licenses and implementation of liquidation process for deeply insolvent
banks. In particular, the component financed the following activities: (1) consulting
services to assist the DIA to perform its duties as a bankruptcy trustee for banks in
liquidation; (2) workout of financial and non-financial assets of receiverships; and (3)
legal support for the liquidation process. The project supported continuation of the
Government and DIA effort related to liquidation of deeply insolvent banks that have
been closed in 2001-2004. Over the past three years, the DIA has achieved significant
progress with liquidation process. The number of banks in DIA portfolio put in
liquidation increased in the period 2004 ­ 2007 from 13 to 19 including liquidation
procedure for 2 banks that have been closed or otherwise resolved. Efficiency of
receiverships was greatly increased by consolidating them in a single unit (Bank
Consolidation Unit), with the start-up costs financed under the FSD TA Grant. As regards
the asset resolution, the DIA has continued to be quite pro-active in renting or selling the
real estates property and enterprise equity stake of bankrupt banks. In 2005 and 2006 the
payment was made to the first payment order creditors of banks in bankruptcy. After the
payment to creditors of the First Payment Order, bankruptcy administrator will,
according to legal regulations, proceed to payment to creditors of lower payment orders.
The activities relating to the collection of receivables in 2005 and 2006 were largely
determined by amended legal regulations which govern the mode of recovery of
receivables from debtors of the banks in bankruptcy administered by the DIA.

(ii)    Consulting services to undertake the implementation of stabilization,
rehabilitation and pre-privatization activities for majority state-owned banks in DIA
portfolio that have been selected for privatization. It was originally envisaged that the
project will finance consulting services to undertake the implementation of stabilization,



                                                                                         45

rehabilitation and pre-privatization activities for majority state-owned banks in DIA
portfolio that have been selected for privatization. However, at the beginning of 2005
Swedish Sida decided to support bank privatization process by financing international
and local consultants to assist DIA in bank pre-privatization activities. Therefore, the
project support has been focused to bank privatization activities.

(iii)   Services of financial advisors to undertake the marketing and implementation of
privatization tenders for majority state-owned banks under the control of the DIA. Bank
continued to finance services of financial advisors to undertake the marketing and
implementation of privatization tenders for majority state-owned banks under the control
of the DIA that has started with FSD TA Grant. Under this sub-component it provided
technical assistance to the DIA to conduct privatization of a number of banks which had
become state-owned as a result of debt-for-equity swap to cover the resolution of debt
owed by Serbian banks to the Paris and London Club governments and banks, initiated
by the Government in mid-2002. The DIA is responsible for running the sale process, as
well as ensuring proper controls and governance in state-owned banks to preserve their
value prior to resolution. The privatization method used was case-by-case international
tender on the basis of transparent and competitive procedures. The Bank's support under
the project has been absolutely central to the Government's privatization program insofar
as it provided the DIA with the funding (i.e., retainer fees) required to engage consulting
teams led by reputable investment banks to conduct legal and financial due diligence,
prepare the sale documents and organize the tenders. The quality of privatization advisors
engaged under the project has been quite high. Great interest for providing these services
and competition between interested advisors resulted in less costs for the services than
expected and the DIA saved significant funds that has been transferred to the project Part
A for financing financial advisor for the privatization of RTB Bor. While from the
disbursement point of view this might have been considered as less than satisfactory
outcome, the substance of the matter is that significant results in bank privatization were
achieved with low costs for advisory services, so this reallocation of funds to project Part
A should be regarded as very fortunate and highly supportive of the achievement of the
project developmental objectives.

As a result of bank restructuring program, the state ownership in the banking system was
reduced bellow 20% which was the objective defined with the Bank in the context of
programmatic assistance program. The market share of the banks in which the state holds
participation at the in terms of assets represents 15.44%, in terms of equity it is 25.98%,
and in terms of deposits it is 19.56%. By the end of 2006, 6 majority state-owned banks
out of 10 has been sold to the reputable strategic investors through open tender, including
the country's largest state-owned bank, Vojvodjanska Banka. In 2006, EBRD acquired
25% of the capital in Komercialna and Cacanska banka. Institution Building Plan for both
banks was approved and its implementation commenced. State still holds majority and
minority packages in 9 banks (majority stake in 4 banks, minority stake in 5 banks).
Further development of the banking sector in Serbia is needed, including restructuring of
the state-owned banks, followed by transfer of state participation in private ownership.
The Management Board of the DIA is in a process of developing a bank strategy, which




                                                                                         46

will define the strategy (capital increase/restructuring/privatization/other) for each bank
in which the state holds participation.

B.2. Project Management and Implementation. This component is rated as highly
satisfactory. This sub-component supported the work of the PMU, already established at
the DIA within the FSD TA Grant, in the management, implementation and monitoring
of Part B.1 of the project, through the provision of services, including the audit of records,
accounts and financial statements, and financing of incremental operating costs. Since
2001 the PMU (with a core staff of five) has handled more than 15 projects funded by
various donors for the DIA and other Serbian institutions. Given the lack of project
implementation capacity in Serbia in general, it is expected that the PMU will continue to
provide project administration services to the Bank and other donor on a fee basis.

B.3. Liquidation, Rehabilitation and Privatization of Insurance Companies. This sub-
component is rated as satisfactory. Thanks to the flexibility and responsiveness to the
needs of Serbian Government and the DIA, after the changes in financial legislation in
mid 2005, the objectives of the project has been extended to include the reform of the
Serbian insurance system. Within this component services of financial advisors to
undertake the marketing and implementation of the first privatization tender for majority
state-owned insurance company DDOR Novi Sad under the control of the DIA were
provided. This tender is in the final phase although it suffered from certain delay due to
the parliamentary elections in January 2007 and the forming of the new Government in
May 2007. Moreover, services of advisors for implementation of the restructuring
strategy for the largest Serbian insurer Dunav osiguranje now well advanced have been
provided.

4.3 Institutional development impact:
Institutional development impact is rated as high. The project played an important role in
further building of the institutional capacity for implementing complex bank restructuring
process established within the FSD TA Grant. The Bank's successful coordination of
donor support with its own resources had a major impact in both maximizing the impact
of resources by improving efficiency and targeting of assistance and in improving
operational efficiency of the DIA by ensuring that appropriate support could be provided
at the time it was required. Very importantly, the Bank's assistance to the DIA
encouraged other donors (UK DFID and Swedish Sida) to support financial sector
reforms and the DIA capacity.

The DIA is now capable to handle bank and insurance companies receiverships with own
resources. The DIA's new technical expertise is witnessed by its capacity both to handle
complex bank failures and to carry out large scale privatizations to strategic investors.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Relative political stability in Serbia was characteristic for implementation of this project.
The majority of the Bank privatization program started in 2003 has been completed in the



                                                                                          47

period 2005-2006 under the Government formed in 2004 which continue the course of
reform and achieving the planned project outcomes. However, the first privatization of
the insurance company which was planed to be finalize in December 2006 was postponed
due to the parliamentary elections and continued upon the forming of the new
Government in May 2007.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Government commitment. The Serbian authorities consistently displayed strong
commitment to the banking sector reforms supported under the Project, and, in broader
terms, under other Bank programs. After taking office in May 2007, the new government
reaffirmed its commitment to the reforms and currently preparing the strategy for
resolution of the rest of the banks with the state ownership. The DIA management
remained unchanged.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
There were no major issues that negatively affected the project from the implementing
agency (i.e., DIA) side.

5.4 Costs and financing:
There were no major implementation or disbursement delays. Although the counterpart
contributions from the state budget have not been always provided in a timely manner,
the DIA managed to provide necessary funds from its own resources.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is rated as highly likely. The activities supported by the Project, such as
liquidation and privatization of banks and insurance companies are largely irreversible.
The authorities complete the agenda in the area of banking sector restructuring by the end
of 2006 and the strategy for the remaining banks in state ownership is expected soon. The
restructuring of insurance sector will be continued.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
At the moment, new arrangements with the Bank regarding financial sector restructuring
program are not envisaged, although the DIA will remain responsible for managing and
implementation of restructuring and privatization programs for the rest of the state owned
banks and insurance companies. Other donor funding to DIA that supported the program
also expired in 2006 (UK DFID) or will expire in the first quarter of 2008 (Sida). With
the support off the Ministry of Finance, the DIA is currently seeking new donor
assistance to complete the remaining work.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
The Bank performance is rated as highly satisfactory. The project was prepared in order
to continue technical support started with FSD TA Grant. The Bank showed high level of



                                                                                        48

responsiveness to the Client's needs accepting to expand project objectives and to
reallocate portion of credit to activities related to insurance companies liquidation and
privatization. Cooperation with the Bank team was excellent and we could always count
on their efficient and timely support.

Borrower

7.1 Government implementation performance:
The performance during implementation is rated as satisfactory. The project received
consistent support from the Serbian Government and the National Bank given its
importance for achieving the policy objectives.

7.2 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the DIA was highly satisfactory. The DIA facilitated the project
implementation and proved to be highly efficient in addressing issues within its control.
In particular, the PMU established at the DIA provided excellent support to the project
through efficient management of procurement, disbursements and financial management
functions, as well as handling of the counterpart funding allocations. Once its capacity
was established, the PMU managed to build excellent reputation within the system. Given
its high standards of performance, it is now administering other Bank and donor projects.

* There is a small difference between the number of restructured SOEs in this table        49 Suva Ruda               71 Rudnik Gornji Milanovac
prepared by the Bank and the results matrix and main text based on the information         50 Dimitrije Tucovic       72 Zmaj
from the PA. The difference is caused by a different principle in treating subsidiaries or
entities that emerged as a result of restructuring. The PA counts each of them as a
restructured SOE. Also it has to be noted that the separately sold subsidiaries are
counted as separately sold SOEs.                                                           51 Matroz                  73 Ljubisa Miodragovic
