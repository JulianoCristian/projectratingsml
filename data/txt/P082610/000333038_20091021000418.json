"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Emergency Public\n            Administration Project for Afghanistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: for an\n            emergency operation to be effective in a post-conflict\n            environment project design needs to be simple and the goals\n            need to be realistic. It is prudent to plan small, quick\n            operations in a series to apply the lessons learned from\n            previous operations. In these environments, intense Bank\n            supervision is required. Further, using professional agents\n            for essential government functions was essential for\n            success. While the financial management (FM) agent, audit\n            agent, and procurement agents did perform core government\n            functions in this post-conflict environment, an additional\n            agent for disbursements might have helped overcome some of\n            the delays encountered due to lack of capacity,\n            communications difficulties, and unfamiliarity with\n            international procedures. The government needs to continue\n            to engage the services of the advisors for as long as it\n            takes to build sufficient, demonstrable capacity in core\n            public administration areas even as the roles of the\n            advisors become increasingly transitional. A fixed timeframe\n            is not the best measure; the capabilities of the counterpart\n            staff will be determined when the agents are no longer\n            needed. Even as government staff master skills needed, the\n            shifting legal framework for financial management and\n            procurement in Afghanistan is becoming more demanding and\n            poses significant ongoing challenges to the government.\n            Public administration reforms are very difficult and take a\n            long time. The Bank and government need flexibility in\n            dealing with reforms in a fluid environment such as in\n            Afghanistan. Significant mid course adjustments of programs\n            should also be made easier. Similarly, such reforms require\n            strong relationships with government and these relationships\n            need to be broad, and not narrowly focused on ministry of\n            finance (MOF) and one or two key ministers and counterparts."}, "docdt": "2009-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
