Specifically, this calls for continued emphasis on\n            the objective of  the first Emergency Public Administration\n            Project (EPAP),-putting in place, on an emergency basis,\n            capacity in key public administration areas to facilitate\n            better use of  public resources, including donor funds, for\n            urgent reconstruction and development efforts. A further\n            emphasis of  this project is to begin to lay the foundation\n            for more broad-based civil service reform directed at\n            increasing the efficiency with which basic services are\n            delivered to the population. The Grant will finance the\n            continued employment by the TISA of  qualified firms to\n            assist the authorities in carrying out, on an interim basis,\n            government procurement and selected financial management\n            functions; develop the administration's capacity in\n            these areas; and assess existing systems and procedures to\n            recommend suitable policy reforms. Services will also be\n            provided to assist the Administrative Reform and Civil\n            Service Commission (ARCSC) to develop its capacity to\n            undertake the development and oversight of  merit-based\n            appointments of  senior civil servants and appeals, civil\n            service management, and overall management and\n            implementation of  public administration reform program.\n            Further services will be provided to ministries for approved\n            restructuring, and for studies and institution building\n            within selected entities. It builds on lessons in other\n            post-conflict countries where procurement and fiduciary\n            weaknesses have delayed reconstruction programs and put in\n            jeopardy the continued high level of  donor support that is needed."}, "docdt": "2003-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
