objectives of the Rehabilitation\n            Loan Project are: to support Kazakstan's reform\n            program; to ease the shortage of a foreign exchange\n            component required to finance critical imports of inputs,\n            raw materials and spare parts in key sectors; and to support\n            foreign exchange markets and allow the private sector access\n            to foreign exchange. The Kazakstani government recognizes\n            that it must deliver growth and employment as it\n            restructures the economy. The program discussed in this\n            report will provide the systematic support for macroeconomic\n            stabilization and long term efficient development. The\n            project will finance imports comprised of a foreign exchange\n            component and a preidentified imports component. The foreign\n            exchange component will support access of importers to the\n            foreign exchange auction market for financing imports\n            through established commercial practices. The preidentified\n            import component will finance essential imports required for\n            the continued delivery of essential public services and a\n            recovery in key productive sectors."}, "docdt": "1993-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
