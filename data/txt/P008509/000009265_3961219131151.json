"Ratings for the Rehabilitation Loan\n            Project in Kazakstan are as follows: overall outcome of the\n            project was rated satisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower were also rated satisfactory. The two\n            most important lessons from this operation are: (1) the\n            transition from a command to a competitive and growing\n            market economy is more complex and will take longer, than\n            many assumed initially. This is especially true in the case\n            of countries such as Kazakstan which in the past have had\n            very little contact with Western market economies; and (2)\n            fundamental to the success of any adjustment operation is\n            the borrower's commitment to the program. A core team\n            of national officials with whom Bank staff can work, and\n            whose reform efforts can be supported by Bank lending, is\n            essential if the Bank's assistance is going to be effective."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
