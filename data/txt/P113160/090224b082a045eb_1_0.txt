 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall project implementation is satisfactory. The major outcomes of the project in the four major components include:
 - User satisfaction is 71.0% achieving the target value of 60%;
 - Website quality improved substantially, new data dissemination system (1212.mn) developed and operational, metadata of surveys and censuses
 are disseminated with explanations through website. Types of electronic and printed products expanded. Made raw data of some surveys, census and
 IOT and SUT open to the public through 1212.mn.
 - Internationally accepted standards and classifications applied to most statistical areas, skills in authenticity verification and regular validations
 improved. Data quality management introduced, data quality reports piloted and developed for some statistical areas. Master questionnaire has been
 designed and is being used to update other surveys.
 -All data provided at GDDS, IMF evaluation for SDDS conducted and expected to enter the SDDS from 2015 officially.

 Two complimenting Trust Funds: SCB TF (93575) and Korea TF (94696) have been fully disbursed and completed their implementation.
