National Statistical System Project for Mongolia was as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: combination of\n            good preparation planning, strong policy dialogue on the\n            Bank side and project design fully reflecting the country\n            needs resulted in strong commitment on the borrower side and\n            exceptionally fast project preparation and movement from\n            identification to effectiveness. Early consideration was\n            given to organization of interpretation and translation\n            services. Project implementation was facing a challenge on\n            translation and interpretation side. Because of lack of\n            knowledge of foreign language among most of project\n            participants, particularly at local level, and broad\n            involvement of foreign speakers in training, this was a\n            constraint. Large volumes of interpretation and translation\n            services were delivered, ensuring proper communication of\n            technical knowledge, building skills and establishment of\n            strong rapport and understanding. Early engagement of\n            procurement specialist had a positive impact on finding the\n            best solutions to guiding project preparation and\n            implementation. Starting from project design stage, a good\n            balance between twinning arrangements, engagement of local\n            expertise, and leading role of the NSO was found and\n            maintained throughout project life."}, "docdt": "2015-06-26T02:44:03Z"}
