Key lessons learned follow. Given\n            the nature of an emergency operation, as in this case, where\n            a speedy implementation is of the essence, project design\n            should be simple, mainly concentrating on physical\n            reconstruction. Therefore, policy formulation, particularly\n            when it involves long-term issues such as institutional\n            development, needs to be taken into account in a different\n            setting: in this case, basic policy issues of the transport\n            sector, were dealt with in other projects. Moreover, in\n            cases where a component is part of more than one loan, e.g.,\n            Sava rive bridge, thus potentially, having several\n            counterparts, it should be reasonable to estimate, and take\n            into account the additional costs, and resources that will\n            be required. This further translates into the need to\n            coordinate the different implementation pace of different\n            components, both early on at the design stage, and during\n            implementation. Due to the different nature of this\n            project's major components - transport and landmine\n            clearing - landmine clearing had to be undertaken prior to\n            transport works, institutions developed, and procedures\n            established; however, various arrangements, i.e., local\n            administrations, police, and the army, cleared mines, hence\n            allowing transport works with no delays. In addition, though\n            not intended, the project's landmine component was\n            conducive to substantial institutional, economic, and\n            humanitarian benefits."}, "docdt": "2002-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
