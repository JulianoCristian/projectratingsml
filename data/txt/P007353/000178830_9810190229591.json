           and efficiency of rural primary education by providing\n            adequate school facilities, organized under an improved\n            nuclearization system, appropriately trained teachers and\n            administrators, and relevant curricula and teaching\n            materials. It will also increase the supply of critically\n            needed agricultural, forestry, and livestock professionals\n            and technicians. About 35,000 children, 10,000 overage\n            students and 15,000 out-of-school youths and adults would\n            attend project rural schools in 1982. The project would\n            contribute to making its beneficiaries more productive\n            participants in Honduras' economic development process.\n            Although unwillingness of qualified teachers and\n            administrators to go to rural areas and delays due to\n            community participation in school construction are potential\n            risks, they are considered small in view of the project\n            provisions for increasing teacher salaries for double shift\n            work and for supervision of construction activities by the\n            Education Ministry's School Construction Directorate."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
