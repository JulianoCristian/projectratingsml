                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation progress of the project is satisfactory. The two components of this operation are on track and all activities are expected to be completed prior to the project
                         closing date of July 31, 2013. On Component 1 related to infrastructure, the current progress of school construction, which accounts for 64% of the total credit indicates that 18
                         schools (70% of the target) are completed and 10 schools are already fully functional; including with the appointment of the heads of schools, teachers, installation of equipment and
                         furniture and textbooks and with a total enrollment of 2500 students. The remaining 7 schools (30% of the target) are between 60% - 95% completed. As reflected in the
                         disbursement chart, implementation progress of this operation has picked up significantly in the last two years and has been able to offset the lost time which was caused by
                         extensive delays during the start of the project (the various causes of those early delays are reflected in the earlier ISRs).

                         On Component 2 related to quality enhancing interventions, implementation of all earmarked activities have been completed except two which are ongoing. These two activities
                         include the procurement of remaining textbooks, which is currently at award stage (the delivery expected in May, 2013, two months before project closing); and the training of the last
                         cohort of 1100 English language teachers, which is also expected to be completed prior to the project closing date.
                         Over the project implementation period, the Government has made considerable effort in executing the project efficiently, with the aim of improving value for resources spent. In

                         particular (a) under component 1 (civil work component), the Government was able to reduce the scope of the original design of the secondary schools which were too extensive. The
                         Government was able to focus on just the core school facilities such as classrooms, laboratories, administration blocks and school utilities, and reducing facilities such as hostels
                         (which were deemed not necessary in an small island state); (b) meeting the target of constructing/ rehabilitating 26 (100%) schools with all essential facilities to provide conducive
                         teaching and learning environment in record time and thereby keeping construction costs contained; as planned in the project design the new facilities will add into the system some
                         additional 289 classrooms, 60 science laboratories, 26 computer laboratories and 13,200 student spaces; and (c) the Government (through on going final procuring process for
                         textbooks) will be able to procure all textbooks for 1-4 grades instead for only the planned 2 grades (5 and 6). Detailed data on how the project was able to contain costs and improve
                         efficiency will be reviewed during the upcoming mission and prior to the writing of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
                         For the final stretch of implementation prior to project closing, the Government has requested the use of savings in some financing categories (goods and operating expenses) to be
                         utilized in others (civil works, training, and consultancies) where additional funds are required. The Bank is current reviewing the Government request.

                         Currently about 80% of project implementation timeline has elapsed, while 74% of the US$42 million equivalent credit has been disbursed. According to the latest figures from the
                         Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT), US$31.08 million of the credit has been fully paid and by December 31, 2012, after concluding contract for remaining
                         textbooks, disbursement and commitments is expected to reach 95% of the credit.
                         This project is expected to close on July 31, 2012. The World Bank team will conduct an Implementation Support Mission in December, 2012 to review the status of all the activities
                         including reconfirming the realism of new targets proposed for PDO indicators, help the Government to plan for the closing of the operation in July 2013, and agree on timeline and
                         logistics to prepare the ICR. The ISR will be updated after the mission, and likely involve upgrading of the PDO and IP ratings (explained below).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i)     The Government and World Bank team jointly reviewed a detailed roadmap prepared by the Government for completing all ongoing activities (including timelines for all

                         remaining contracts). The review concluded that all activities will be completed prior to the project closing date. The progress on this roadmap will be reviewed in detail during the
                         upcoming mission in January 2013.

                         (ii)    Given that some financing categories have realized savings while others have budget short falls, the Government has prepared a detailed analysis of savings, funds
                         requirement and submit a request for restructuring for the purpose or re-allocation of funds purpose to the Bank for review.

                         (iii)      The envisaged restructuring might also include other housekeeping issues.

                         (iv)     Given that the original plan to collaborate with British Council/ VSO to scale up their innovative program to complete remaining 1100 in-service training for upgrading of
                         primary teachers in English language could not materialize due to budget constraints, it was agreed that the activity will be implemented using in-house capacity as per original plan.

                         It was further agreed that the Teacher Education Department will prepare and submit to the Bank implementation time line and revised budget for review. This has been done,
                         reviewed and approved by the Bank and some teachers are already under training.
