Project for Tanzania were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to global\n            environment outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            revisit assumptions made during appraisal on a regular\n            basis, listen to feed-back and, in response, restructure\n            rather early than late. There were feed-back loops, and red\n            flags did in fact show indicating that results achievement\n            was not on track - but they were put aside in favor of other\n            priorities: The challenges the project faced in matching the\n            anticipated results chain could have been addressed at a\n            time when a turnaround would still have been possible. The\n            impact of a changes or additions to the results framework is\n            negligible, when they come in a late stage such as the last\n            year of implementation. One of the more structural issues\n            this project suffered from might be related to a comparative\n            marginalization vis-a-vis interventions on the mainland:\n            compared to operations in education and other sectors in\n            mainland Tanzania, this was a rather small project, on an\n            island separated physically and politically from the\n            mainland. Perhaps due to its relative isolation and the\n            sensitive political economy between the Tanzania federal\n            government and Zanzibar, the project did not receive the\n            assistance it needed from the mainland government, (at least\n            not in the early stages of project implementation)."}, "docdt": "2014-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
