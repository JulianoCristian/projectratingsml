                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation progress is mostly on track. On Component 1 related to infrastructure (and with an allocation of 69% of the credit), as of February 2012 mission, with the
                         exception of 7 schools in which physical implementation progress is between 60-75%, the construction completion in 14 other schools is between 97%-100%. While there was an
                         extensive delay of almost 2 years at the start of the project (due to the need to prepare school designs), the implementation in this component picked up rapidly in the third year (as
                         reflected in the disbursement chart) and students will be in the new classrooms by July 2012. On Component 2 related to quality enhancing interventions, there is progress in all
                         activities and some have already been completed. Two pending issues include the need to ensure the second large procurement of textbooks to be completed (and delivered); and
                         the need to ensure that the shortfall of 1100 trained English language teachers is met prior to the closing date of July 2013. Currently about 59% of the credit (US$25.5 million) has
                         been disbursed. By June 30, 2012, disbursement (and commitments) is expected to reach 80% of the credit (US$ 33.6 million).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following issues were discussed and agreed with the Government during the last mission of February 2012:

                         (i) Given that the school construction is almost completed, the need to prepare detailed school readiness plans was discussed and templates developed by the Government reviewed
                         and agreed upon. It was agreed that a detailed time-line for implementing each of the domains listed in the template will be prepared, with a particular focus on those activities that
                         are related and dependent on each other.

                         (ii) Given that in-service training for upgrading of primary teachers in English language was not completed on time (due to low training capacity) and there is a shortfall of 1100
                         trainees who still require English language training, discussions have been held with the British Council/ VSO to explore ways to scale up their innovative program quickly during the
                         last year of project implementation. It was agreed that the Teacher Education Department and the the British Council/VSO will explore the details of this collaboration immediately in
                         order to complete the training activities prior to the project closing date.

                         (iii) Some 713,000 textbooks and 19,750 teachers guides for primary schools are still to be procured. The mission agreed on three criteria for textbooks evaluation involving (a) extent

                         of coverage of the primary curriculum; (b) contextualization in Zanzibar's historical, linguistic, and socio-cultural values; and (c) effective link with the accompanying teacher guides;
                         and also agreed on a timeline to ensure that all textbooks and teacher's guides are in the classrooms prior to project closing.

                         (iv) While there is implementation progress, progress towards Project Development Objectives targets is limited. The Ministry will assess data reliability and the assumptions
                         underlying the target values, based on recently available population data of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
