                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The implementation issues identified at midterm are related to the following: (i) updated cost of cost of civil works; (ii) approval of the textbook policy; (iii) strengthening project

                         monitoring and evaluation; (iv) school start readiness planning; and (v) teacher study. Agreements have been reached for addressing these issues and are noted in the MTR Aide
                         Memoire.

                         (i) Updated Cost of Civil Works
                         The MTR mission reviewed current budget for civil works and found it to be adequate to meet current and future commitments. Based on the anticipated surplus balance, the mission
                         recommended that MoEVT utilize these savings to cover critical activities which were either omitted during the cost-cutting exercise or those that arose as needs during the
                         implementation of school construction. It was agreed that among the activities to be considered as a priority would be the construction of housing with cafeteria for student-teachers
                         and completion of staff houses at Benjamin William Mkapa Teachers College. The mission recommended continued cost control of the remaining construction works.

                         (ii) Finalizing the Textbook Policy
                         The textbook policy which satisfies a condition of disbursement (for textbooks, girls' science camp, and life skills training) has been prepared, and the Bank reviewed the edited

                         of the book (three years minimum) and its legal life (six years minimum), and ownership of the textbook (by the school, to be issued to and returned by students). The mission's
                         comments have been incorporated into the policy, fully satisfying this condition of disbursement.

                         (iii) Strengthening Project Monitoring & Evaluation
                         The mission's overall assessment at midterm is that project implementation is progressing as planned. Assessing outcomes in the long run, however, will require robust qualitative
                         and quantitative data. The PAD assumed that the Ministry#s Education Management Information System (EMIS) established with the support of UNESCO's Institute of Statistics
                         would provide the necessary statistical data for the purpose of robust monitoring and evaluation. It appears, however, that the system is not yet fully operational even after extensive
                         delays. As a result, while there have been some improvements within the past few months in data cleaning and checking, there is still a serious lack of timely data to assess
                         outcomes/results, which will be essential going forward. The mission's assessment is that the Ministry will need to urgently assign a team led by a qualified expert with the primary
                         task of improving the collecting, processing, analysing and sharing relevant data and analysis with relevant stakeholders throughout the education system. Furthermore, data on
                         project inputs and outputs are also not adequately entered, analyzed, and retrieved for the purposes of decision making and is seriously overdue.

                         (iv) School Start Readiness Planning
                         Now that construction is well under way and moving towards completion, the Ministry has started to make preparation for the start of these schools. While maintenance plans and
                         teacher deployment plans are available it was agreed that the Ministry will form Ministry-wide team to work with school principals to ensure that school-specific readiness plans are
                         prepared. It was agreed that integrated school readiness plans, including the appointment of teachers and delivery of textbooks and science equipment, would be led by the Project
                         Coordinator on or about October 15, 2011.

                         Teacher Study
                         (v) Given that there are several teacher training interventions under way, it is important to urgently ensure overall consistency and coherence of these interventions as well as ensure
                         a broader understanding of teacher issues. This would include an analytical review of the adequacy of incentives, improvements in the working conditions for teachers, and
                         enhancement of accountability measures. It was agreed that the study on management of entrants to teacher training in the project's sub-component 2.A would be expanded to
                         include these issue s.
