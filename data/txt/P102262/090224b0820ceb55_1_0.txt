                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has been under implementation since July 1, 2007 and will close on November 30, 2013 (after a four month extension from the original closing date). The PDO remained
                         the same throughout, but one PDO indicator was added during restructuring done in March 2013. Any split evaluations required will be considered as part of the ICR preparation
                         process (which has already started).

                         Given the urgent need to provide spaces at the secondary education level and improve its quality, agreement was reached in 2007 with mainland Tanzania for a relatively large
                         education operation for Zanzibar. The Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement Project (ZBEIP, the Project) was prepared relatively fast over a period of 9 months and was presented
                         to the World Bank board on April 24, 2007. However, given the extended discussions between the mainland and Zanzibar on the ‘subsidiary’ agreement, the project became effective

                         only on January 29, 2008, which is when implementation started. The initial implementation period was beset with numerous hurdles, which included weak capacity in the
                         Government, teething problems in relation to learning Bank procedures and guidelines (as this was the first World Bank credit to Zanzibar Government), and delays in initiating
                         construction given the need to first prepare school designs, as no Project Preparation Advance (PPA) was requested by the mainland for these critical preparatory activities. As a
                         result, disbursement trend reflects an extended period of low disbursement until quarter 4 in 2010.

                         Progress towards achievement of the PDO targets is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. On progress towards achievement of PDO, there has been improvement in only two of the four
                         PDO indicators since the beginning of the project. The two PDO indicators related to passing the Certificate of Secondary Education Exam (CSEE) have consistently been below
                         targets. The CSEE is given in both Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar, and the two share a similar pass rate decline, especially in the past few years. An overview of the 2010-2012
                         CSEEs for Tanzania Mainland found that O-level examinations pass rates for mathematics, science and languages has been on the declining trend. Passes with Division I-III have
                         declined from 11 percent in 2010 to 9 percent in 2012. The CSEE results for Zanzibar show a similar trend. Similar trends in examination results may have a shared root cause.
                         While it may be the result of similar challenges (both systems have increased enrollment while trying to maintain quality), it is also possible that decreased pass rates are due to
                         factors outside of the control of both systems. The Union government created an expert commission to determine the contributors of declining results. The Commissions' preliminary
                         report notes a major change by National Examination Board (NECTA) in the manner in which examinations were graded (giving less weight to continuous assessment) as one of the
                         causes. Other factors cited include weak management and monitoring of the examinations and the disconnect between competency based curriculum and exams and content based
                         style of teaching. Others have cited teachers’ strikes last year for two months prior to the examinations due to delays in paying teachers’ claims as a major contributing factor. In
                         addition, the MoEVT of Zanzibar drafted a report compiling the views of education stakeholders on the causes of poor CSEE performance. Stakeholders cited commonly-held
                         limitations on the quality of education, including: limited teaching time, poor school conditions, inefficiencies in recruitment into the teaching profession math and science, low English
                         language competency, and underutilization of professional development training centers. Some of these activities have been the focus of this project, but primarily benefit an
                         increasing number of students who will sit for the CSEE in the coming few years. More detailed review of these issues is being planned as part of the preparation of the
                         implementation completion report (ICR).

                         Overall, PDO indicators show limited progress on quality improvement as reflected by those passing the CSEE examination. As noted, these figures have been declining for the
                         mainland and Zanzibar and seem to point to factors outside the immediate control of the project. The key driver of the declining quality in Zanzibar is, not unlike many other countries
                         in Sub-Saharan Africa, the massive expansion at the secondary level as a result of the increasing number of primary graduates. The key focus of this operation was to provide space
                         for a large share of these students. Prior to this operation, the Zanzibari secondary schools were elite schools built during the colonial period and given the expanding secondary
                         population, came to bursting capacity. Overall, the relief this operation has provided in terms of space, teacher training, and other interventions has helped to greatly maintain some
                         degree of quality for a large number of students, who would have otherwise either been in extremely crowded classrooms or would not have attended any secondary school at all.
                         Furthermore, the team's assessment is that the Zanzibari Government has been able to push hard with implementation of this operation, but always with the view of institutionalizing
                         the inputs, processes, reforms in the workings of the Ministry and local governments, thereby helping to ensure a solid ground for any further developments in the sector. Such
                         mainstreaming also helps to ensure sustainability and easier scaling up of quality interventions in the future.

                         As the project approaches closure, implementation of all planned activities are on track and expected to be completed on time. As regards to implementation of school infrastructure
                         under Component 1, the project has succeeded in expanding space to accommodate for the large flow of primary graduates. Construction/rehabilitation of 23 schools (89%) of the
                         target have been completed and already fully functional with 12,200 students already attending. Completion of the remaining 3 schools (11%) is expected by the middle of
                         November, prior to project closure. Concerning Component 2 related to quality enhancement programs, the government has been able to implement most of the remaining teacher

                         training activities including training of 1365 mathematics and science teachers, and 400 English and communication teachers, thereby implementing fully all planned training
                         activities. The delivery of textbooks for grade 1-4 is on track and the last batch all textbooks will be delivered by mid November, 2013. Overall, the project has provided the greatly
                         needed facilities and training for a fast expanding system, and has helped to set the ground for the next generation of education reforms.

                         Over the project implementation period, the Government has made considerable effort in executing the Project efficiently, with the aim of improving value for resources spent. In
                         particular (a) under Component 1 (civil work component), the Government was able to reduce the scope of the original design of the secondary schools which were too extensive and
                         expensive. The Government was able to focus on just the core school facilities such as classrooms, laboratories, administration blocks and school utilities, reducing facilities such as
                         hostels (which were deemed not necessary in an small island state); (b) meeting the target of constructing/ rehabilitating of 26 (100% ) schools with all essential facilities to provide
                         conducive teaching and learning environment in record time and thereby keeping construction costs contained; and (c) finding efficiencies in procuring all textbooks for 1-4 grades
                         instead for only the planned 2 grades (5 and 6).

                         Overall, the Government’s commitment to the education sector has remained strong throughout the period of implementation. Over 23% of the public funds have been allocated to
                         the sector for the 2013/2014 financial year. Overall project implementation progress is moderately satisfactory. The project has succeeded in expanding space and qualified teachers
                         for secondary education for the large flow of primary graduates. In line with policy reforms in the mainland as part of the Education Reform Compact (ERC), the Bank team has
                         discussed the importance of focusing on improved incentives and accountability, and student assessments that provide feedback for improving student learning outcomes. The Bank

                         initiated. Such a review would provide the Government with useful information for policy reforms and allocations into priority areas.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the reallocation of credit through level 2 project restructuring in January, the exchange rate worsened considerably. By May, the majority of the reallocated funds were
                         exhausted, and some activities were modified/ halted. During the July mission, the Government and the World Bank teams reviewed the expenditures and determined funding
                         priorities. Activities that could be scaled back without affecting project performance were reduced and funds were made available for higher priority activities. In addition, budgets for
                         the priority activities were carefully reviewed and streamlined. All activities are expected to be well resourced and are expected to be completed prior to the end of the project closing
