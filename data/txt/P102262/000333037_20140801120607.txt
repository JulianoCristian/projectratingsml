1.      Country context. Zanzibar comprises two main islands, Unguja and Pemba, and a
number of smaller islets along the western rim of the Indian Ocean. The islands lie about 40
kilometers off the coast of mainland Tanzania. In 1964, the sultanate of Zanzibar – with its
long history of Persian, Portuguese and Arab influence - joined with Tanganyika to form the
United Republic of Tanzania (URT). However, Zanzibar retains considerable autonomy over
her internal affairs and has her own legislature, judiciary and an executive. According to the
Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, both, primary and secondary education are
under the responsibility of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (RGZ) while tertiary
education is a “union matter”.
2.       Even though the service sector, including tourism, represents a more important share
of GDP than most other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, at the time of appraisal the people
of Zanzibar were not participating in tourism and other services in the numbers expected.
This was largely due to lack of required skills and English language proficiency; specifically,
skills in mathematics and science were inadequate to serve the needs of a modern economy.
Sector context
3.      At appraisal, education spending as a share of Government budget and of GDP was in
the range of 4.0-4.5% of GDP, and equivalent to about 18.5% of government spending
targeted to reach 22% over the next five years. Gross enrolment rates (GER) at primary
schools were about 91% (with about 80% net enrollment) while GER at secondary school
level was about 30%.
4.      According to the URT Constitution, both, primary and secondary education are under
the responsibility of the RGZ while tertiary education is a “union matter”. No matter these
differences in responsibility, the education system in Zanzibar is closely aligned with the
system on the mainland: While primary education curriculum and examinations are managed
in Zanzibar, curriculum and examinations for secondary education are the same for Zanzibar
and the mainland. The curriculum is under the auspices of the Tanzania Institute of Education
and the examinations under the National Examinations Council of Tanzania.
5.       The 2003 Zanzibar Education Sector Country Status Report identified the following
major constraints and challenges: (i) low access rates, particularly at secondary levels, (ii)
poor quality of education caused by inadequate facilities and limited access to textbooks, and
(iii) the difficult transition experiences between primary and secondary school caused by the
abrupt change in language of instruction (from Kiswahili to English).
6.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) described the following key issues: (i) The
rate of construction of new classroom space did not keep pace with the increased enrollments
in lower secondary which nearly tripled over the previous 10 years. In order to cope, double-
shifting was common practice in almost all secondary schools, but average class size was still
over 60. Consequently, school infrastructure was considered a priority; (ii) Poor English
language proficiency of secondary school students 1; (iii) Under-qualified and unqualified


1
  Since the language of instruction in primary school is Kiswahili, many students were unable to cope with the
transition to learning in English at secondary level.



                                                                                                            1
teachers: In addition to lack of qualification to teach at secondary school level (based on their
formal qualification, i.e. either diploma or degree 2), many were not sufficiently proficient in
English to be able to teach in this language; (iv) Acute shortages of teachers in secondary
level English, mathematics and science; (v) Inefficient deployment of secondary school
teachers; and (vi) Shortage of secondary school teaching/learning materials, including
textbooks, laboratory and ICT equipment.
7.       Gender disparities were not a major issue though access problems increased in the
final two years of secondary school and there were ongoing concerns about the interest of
girls in mathematics and science.
Project context
8.      Following the decision by the URT Government not to include Zanzibar in the
Tanzania Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP, approved by the Board in
June, 2004) but to develop a separate program for Zanzibar, the Zanzibar MoEVT asked the
World Bank to lead external partners in their analytical work and dialogue with RGZ on
support to secondary education. The initial intention was to develop a Sector Wide Approach
(SWaP) in education with involvement of the World Bank and other development partners,
and preparatory studies for the Project were coordinated with those for the SWaP. This
coincided with a considerable amount of analytical work globally and regionally by the Bank
to determine approaches and best practice in secondary education.
Higher level objectives to which the project contributes
9.      The improvement of Secondary education, the Project’s core objective, contributes to
all three pillars 3 of Zanzibar's Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUZA),
through increasing productivity, improving social well-being for those accessing secondary
education and their families, and contributing to democracy, crime reduction and
improved living conditions. Secondary Education is also embedded in the Tanzania Vision
2020, and the former Zanzibar Education Master Plan (1996 - 2006). The 2006 Zanzibar
Education Policy emphasized the development of quality secondary education and the
importance of boosting performance in English, mathematics and science. It directed for
children being taught mathematics and science through English from Standard 5. A first
Zanzibar Education Development Plan (ZEDP), prepared in 2007, was succeeded by a
second, launched in 2012 and prepared in close collaboration between the MoEVT, World
Bank, SIDA, USAID and UNICEF.
10.     All of these are embraced by the Dakar Framework of Action on Education for All
and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. RGZ has resolved to devote
at least 20% of the total public expenditure to the education sector. Furthermore, the
education sector was given top priority in the MKUZA covering the period 2007-2010.
MoEVT has also strengthened aid management and coordination by setting up a Zanzibar
Education Sector Committee which is a forum for policy dialogue between stakeholders
involving Ministry officials, NGOs, private sector and development partners.

2
 Following graduation from higher secondary school, prospective secondary school teachers have two possible
options for formal professional qualification: For those with lower grades at graduation: a two years training
program at a Teacher Training College, completed with a Diploma; for those with higher grades: a three-years
university program at the State University of Zanzibar, leading to a Degree.
3
 The MKUZA includes three pillars, or clusters of activities: (i) Growth and reduction of income poverty; (ii)
Social services and well-being; and (iii) governance and national unity.



                                                                                                            2
11.    The Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST) 4 for the period of FY07 to
FY10 was presented to the Board at the same time as this Project. The strategy
described principles for coordination of development support in Tanzania, and included
support for secondary education on Zanzibar.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
12.    The development objective of the Zanzibar Basic Education Improvement Project
(ZBEIP), as stated and approved in the PAD, was to improve completion in lower secondary
education (the first four years) with successful performance among students. 5
13.     Evidence of progress towards achieving the PDOs was to be assessed through the
following (original) PDO Indicators: (i) Absolute numbers of pupils, disaggregated by gender,
taking the examination at the end of lower secondary education (CSEE). (ii) Absolute
numbers of pupils, disaggregated by gender passing the CSEE. (iii) Absolute numbers of
pupils, disaggregated by gender passing the CSEE with Div. III or better.

1.3     Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
14.     The PDO was not revised during the life of the project.
15.      A Restructuring approved in April 2013 (when disbursement stood at 77%), formally
revised the targets for all three initial PDO indicators, and introduced a forth: (iv) Percentage
of CSEE takers divided by the population aged 17 years. As the project was implemented, it
became clear that the initial targets had become unrealistic since one of the key assumptions
made during project preparation did not happen: The examinations determining the transition
of students Form II to Form III were not abolished early into project implementation as
initially assumed. As a result, fewer students than expected passed through to O-level (CSEE)
exams at the end of Form IV 6, hence adding a percentage figure to the absolute numbers (of
CSEE passers) seemed to make a lot of sense.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries
16.     The main target groups to be reached by the project were primary and secondary
school students and teachers. Secondary school students were to be reached directly through
the provision of an improved learning environment, i.e. newly constructed or rehabilitated
classrooms and other school facilities, adequate distribution of learning material, and, in the
case of girls, availability of additional learning opportunities in science camps. Teachers
benefitted directly from access to learning opportunities, and distribution of teaching material.
Students were reached indirectly through, as was hoped, improved subject matter knowledge,

  The JAST is a joint product of the Government of the URT, the Tanzania Development Partners Group, and
the World Bank Group.
5
  The formulation of the PDO in the PAD and the Financing Agreement (FA) differ slightly. The formulation in
the FA is as follows: The objective of the Project is to support the Recipient’s efforts to improve the lower
secondary education in the islands of Zanzibar within its territory, including raising the rates of students
successfully completing the first four years of secondary education. This formulation does not imply any
deviations in terms of substance matter from the PDO presented in the PAD and approved by the Board of
Executive Directors.
6
 It is now planned to abolish these examinations only by 2015, once the first cohort of pupils that started
primary school under the revised curriculum, has reached Form II.



                                                                                                           3
language and teaching skills of their teachers. Other direct beneficiaries were head teachers,
school inspectors, school management committees, and last but not least MoEVTstaff.

1.5        Original Components
17.     The project as approved consisted of two components: (i) Increase enrolment and
improve quality in secondary education through provision of infrastructure; (ii) Improve
quality of education through teacher training, curriculum reform, and provision of learning
materials.
Component 1: Increased enrolment and improve quality in secondary education
through provision of infrastructure (US$35.1 million)
18.     This component was designed to meet the demand for school facilities for the
numbers of pupils enrolled in secondary schools at the time of appraisal, and to accommodate
the projected increase in secondary school enrolment. It was estimated that 24,000 new
school places would be created 7. The component covered the construction and rehabilitation
of school infrastructure, including the construction of nineteen new schools, incorporating
eight schools in rural areas with limited hostel facilities to serve students from remote rural
communities, particularly girls, and three with facilities to meet the needs of students with
disabilities. The rural schools were to be equipped with 10 staff houses each. All schools
were to be constructed with appropriate sanitary facilities and science laboratories, and
supplied with furniture and laboratory equipment. The component also included the
rehabilitation of six existing schools. In order to create additional supply of qualified teachers
to match the projected expansion of enrolment (the need was estimated with about 1,400
teachers), the project was also to support the construction of new facilities for Benjamin
William Mkapa Teacher Training College (BWMTTC) on Pemba Island.
Component 2: Improve quality of education through teacher training, curriculum
reform, and provision of learning materials (US$12.1 million).
19.     In complementarity to the expansion of physical infrastructure, the project included
measures to support the quality of education, including provision of in-service teacher
training, provision of textbooks and other learning resources, and provision of support for
planned curriculum reforms. These interventions targeted both upper-primary and secondary
education. They were to cover in-service-training of primary and lower secondary math and
science teachers in subject matter, and upper primary math and science teachers in English as
the language of instruction introduced with the primary education curriculum reform; in
addition, in-service courses were to be provided to school head teachers, inspectors and
subject advisors, as well as training and other support to the inspectorate and school
management committees. Further, the quality component included the revision of the primary
curriculum, and the provision of learning materials (textbooks) in five subjects for all upper
primary students based on the revised curriculum; textbooks in four subjects for all lower
secondary students, and in all subjects for forms V and VI; library books; learning materials
for deaf and blind students in three schools; support for science education for girls through
science camps; and the development of a new manual for education on life skills (including
HIV/AIDS, gender and environmental awareness) and workshops to assist teachers of
subjects such as biology and geography incorporate life skills into their teaching.



7
    Please note that this was an estimate and not a target.



                                                                                                4
1.6    Revised Components
20.     The components were not revised during the life of the project. However, some
project activities were modified, as follows:
21.    Component 2: The provision of new textbooks in five subjects for each pupil in upper
primary school was revised to lower primary, Standards 1, 2, 3 and 4. It would not have made
sense to provide new textbooks for higher grades in primary school, when the lower grades
had not been provided with textbooks first, since the learning based on the new curriculum
was expected to build up from the lower grades. The GPE project, approved in 2013, includes
provisions for new textbooks for upper primary grades, i.e. Standard 5, 6, instead.
22.     USAID provided secondary school math textbooks for Forms I-IV and V-VI which
led to cost savings for the respective activity for textbook provision for secondary education,
under Component 2.

1.7    Other Significant Changes
23.    The initial approach towards teacher training was modified, in the course of project
implementation: Whereas the PAD provided for a classroom-style center-based training, the
World Bank and Government teams jointly develop an alternative approach that ended up
being potentially more effective at improving teacher practice. (See more details in Annex 2,
on Component 2).
24.     The restructuring of April 2013, in addition to revisions in the Results Framework as
described in Section 1.3 above, reallocated funds in the amount of US$2.5 million (equivalent
to about 6% of credit proceeds), including the amount of US$1.4 million in exchange rate
gains, basically in favor of the categories Works (Component 1), Consultants Services and
Training. Also, in the same restructuring, the original closing date was extended by four
months to November 30, 2013

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Preparation
25.     To address urgent needs in secondary education upfront, while preparing for an
envisaged SWaP, the Government asked the World Bank to spearhead support for secondary
education first of all through an investment credit that was supposed to contribute to the
Program under development. The Bank's experience suggested that investments in
infrastructure would need to be balanced with inputs to promote quality. In addition to the
focus on secondary education, the project would strengthen the crucial link between the upper
primary and lower secondary levels. However, it became apparent that the education sector
policy environment and budgeting plan at the time of appraisal were not sufficiently
developed, and the intended SWaP never materialized at the end, hence the Project did not
form part of an overall program-oriented approach.
26.    Political economy issues between the URT federal government and Zanzibar (which
has been ruled by an opposition party to the party in power on the mainland) might have
adversely affected Project preparation. For example, there was a perception of only a small




                                                                                             5
window of opportunity for the preparation of the project with the IDA allocation that was
finally approved 8, which led to a short preparation time of approximately one year from the
first Identification Mission in May 2006 to Approval in April 2007. Another issue in this
context was that the MoF in Dar-es-Salam did not request a Project Preparation grant for the
Zanzibar MoEVT which would have helped enormously assuring readiness for
implementation of the Project upon approval.

2.2      Project Design
Assumptions, results, risks
27.     The concrete targets for the PDO indicators were modelled based on a comprehensive
list of assumptions and projections related to both the behavior over time of relevant
education indicators 9, and the implementation time-line 10.
28.      Critical risks identified at preparation included (i) needs for cost savings on public
service wage bill could constraint expansion of teacher workforce; (ii) additional resources
needed for introduction of preschool education to limit resource available for secondary
education; (iii) lack of teachers competencies to teach subjects in English in upper primary;
(iv) disproportionate running costs for hostel facilities in eight upper secondary school to
drain education budget; (v) inefficient use of funds and ineffective internal controls; (vi)
inadequate legal and regulatory framework for procurement; and (vii) and inadequate
institutional arrangements for procurement at MoEVT.
29.     Quality at Entry. A Quality of Entry (QaE) Review, conducted in June 2010 by the
Bank-internal Quality Assessment Group (QAG, now dissolved), rated the likelihood of this
project to achieve its objectives as Moderate. QAG came to the conclusion that the Bank had


8
  According to the TTL of the preparation team, there was a perception that the IDA amount allocated to
Zanzibar (US$42 m for a population of roughly 1 million) was exceptionally high in comparison to the SEDP-1
(US$150 m for a population of 36.5 million at the time), and that there might be a risk of a change of mind with
respect to the IDA allocation on the part of the federal government if this were not locked in quickly.
9
  These assumptions and projection were the following: (i) Primary Education intake growth rate to be
equivalent to population growth rate, given that primary education has reached full enrollment; (ii) Repetition
and Drop-out rate assumptions to remain constant and gradually decline; (iii) Abolishment of the Orientation
Secondary Class from 2008 creating a "double cohort" which would put stress on the system short term. (iv)
Standard 7 to be abolished from year 2011, and hence another double cohort entry to secondary expected in
2012 - based upon a sequencing of curriculum reforms in primary which were expected to be implemented from
year 2009 in Standard 4. (v) Transition rate to secondary to gradually increase but to flatten as the impact of the
double cohort were absorbed. (vi) Transition rate from Form II to Form III to increase as demand increases and
space becomes available due to new construction. (vii) Transition rate from Form II to Form III also to increase
due to the envisaged (at the time) elimination of an exam at the end of Form II; (viii) Target graduation and
examination ratios at "O-levels" (CSEE) were based on existing ratios where about 98% sit for the exam, 91%
passes, and only about 19% passes with Division III or better. These ratios were projected to remain constant.
(viii) Transition to upper secondary (Forms IV to Form V) to increase slightly.
10
  The main assumption was that bidding for school construction would start between April and June 2008,
projecting completion of construction work by mid-2010. This would have allowed students to benefit from the
new, more conducive learning environment for about 3 years before project closing. Assuming that at the same
time, teacher training and procurement of teaching materials would have progressed significantly, this could
have indeed contributed to an increased perseverance of students in secondary schools (as intended to be
measured by the increased number of students taking the CSEE) and to improved learning outcomes (as
anticipated through the PDO indicator related to the passing of and the quality of CSEE grades) attributable to
the Project’s interventions.



                                                                                                                 6
missed some important steps in the preparation process, and identified quality of entry as a
core weakness of this project. QAG was specifically concerned about the PDO indicators,
given the decline in the CSEE scores already observed at that time based on test results 11.
Consequently, Quality of Design was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.3     Implementation
30.   Implementation began slowly, and initial assumptions about the timing of project
implementation were not realized.
31.     The most significant challenge at the beginning of implementation was that school
designs were not ready until early 2010 (AM 05/10), over 2.5 years into effectiveness, which
held up the commencement of civil works. In the second semester of 2008, the MoEVT
Procurement Specialist in charge of the Project resigned, and the position was never re-filled.
Instead the Ministry’s procurement team took charge, reinforced by a consultant procurement
specialist, and supported intensively by Bank procurement staff.
32.    Most factors affecting implementation progress were indigenous, and related to
capacity weaknesses of the Implementing Agency. QAG, in its QaE review, encouraged the
team to reduce the apparent disconnect between rating of both DO achievement and IP, and
the actual progress achieved on the ground. Yet, Bank Supervision by a new team which
proactively addressed identified weaknesses was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
33.     By the end of the implementation period, the initial delays had been mitigated thanks
to re-planning and making use of efficiency gains. Most expected outputs were reached or
exceeded.

2.4     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
34.     Design. Project design and in particular the design of the results framework was based
on assumptions (see above, para 27) that were, as such not monitored and/or revisited. Once
the team finally acknowledged that the M&E design needed a revision, the restructuring of
April 2013 was of negligible relevance. Even though PDO indicator values were modified to
reflect a more realistic anticipation of project results, it came too late and did not take into
consideration the fundamental disconnects in the results chain.
35.     According to the PAD, MoEVT had developed a robust Education Management
Information System (EMIS) with support from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics, and
much of the basic information needed was supposed to be available from the system. In
addition, information on O-level examination results were to be obtained from NECTA
and this information analyzed and the results compared to those of all students in
URT. Ministry staff was supposed to monitor project execution through a set of key
performance indicators, enabling analysis of the data and dissemination among key line
officials - supported by IDA supervision missions. In addition to these quantitative
measures, the MoEVT was supposed to develop qualitative indicators of classroom
behavior, to be used in classroom observation to monitor the changes in teachers'
performance throughout the project.




11
 The comment of the CD to ISR#6 indicated that latest test results had shown a significant reduction in the
CSEE pass rate from 91% in 2006 to 77% in 2008.



                                                                                                              7
36.     Implementation and Utilization. As became apparent during implementation,
assumptions made at appraisal on the functioning of the EMIS had been over-optimistic.
Concerns about the weakness of the system were a recurrent theme in ISRs. The Mid-
Term Review (MTR), conducted in June 2011, came to the conclusion that the system
was not operational even after extensive delays. As a result, there was a serious lack of
timely data to assess outcomes/results. Furthermore, data on project inputs and outputs
had not been adequately entered, analyzed, and retrieved for the purposes of decision
making. UNESCO was not able to provide continued support as envisaged, due to
financial constraints. Hence, other sources of information were used, including for
example a PhD thesis which provided relevant, recent and reliable data on the quality of
education sector in Zanzibar for the MTR. The Bank team continued to provide informal
support and technical assistance throughout the operation to collect reliable data and
manage it for retrieval and analysis. The return of two M&E experts after completing
their advanced studies had helped to strengthen the MoEVT capacity from later in 2011.
At the end of the project implementation period, while still not high standard, the EMIS
collected reasonably reliable data.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
37.    Safeguards. The project triggered both the Environmental Assessment (OP/BO
4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) policies due to its focus on
construction and rehabilitation of schools. An Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) was prepared to identify, assess and mitigate likely negative
environmental and social impacts of the project. A Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) was prepared to address potential resettlement issues.
38.     As set out in the ESMF, the project benefits were expected to outweigh the
adverse impacts from school construction which would pose no direct risks to
biodiversity, natural habitats or wetlands, as it would not fund activities in protected
areas, national parks or wetlands. Further, out of 18 possible adverse impacts, half
were expected to be short-term and cleared with the completion of construction work.
The bulk of other impacts were expected to have readily available means for total and
effective mitigation. In order to fully comply with requirements of the World
Convention on Heritage Sites and preserve the integrity of Stone Town, all
construction work in Stone Town would adhere to guidelines set by the Stone Town
Development and Conservation Authority who would undertake routine supervision.
39.     Fiduciary compliance. Under oversight of the MoEVT Chief Accountant, the
Project used the RGZ Financial Management system. Overall, sound financial
management systems were maintained in place throughout implementation which
enabled proper project data to be captured and store for generation of acceptable
financial reports. The financial reports were prepared and submitted to the Bank on time
in compliance with the financing agreement. These reports were reviewed and found to
be satisfactory and therefore acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports were received on
time and where they came in late the reasons for delay were fixed on advice from the
Bank. The Controller and Auditor General issues unqualified (clean) opinion for the
project. Any issues of internal control weaknesses as identified by the auditors were
fixed by the project and verified by the Controller and Auditor General. Financial
management implementation support missions were also carried out to provide support
to the project during implementation. Overall the FM performance was noted to be
satisfactory as the project always fixed issues as they were identified.


                                                                                       8
40.    On the procurement side, a couple of mitigation measures had been put in place
against deficiencies established in the 2006 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Review: i.e., it was agreed to follow World Bank procurement guidelines.
Also, both a MoEVT tender board and an adequately staffed Procurement Management
Unit in the MoEVT were established; a procurement specialist hired for the first 18 to 24
months of project implementation provided hands-on training to Project Management
Team (PMT) staff and members of the tender board and helped in the preparation of an
18-month procurement plan. A case of allegations of misconduct related to textbook
procurement in 2009 was settled with involvement of the World Bank Group Integrity
Vice-Presidency 12.

2.5        Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
41.     There will be no immediate World Bank follow-up project to the ZBEIP. Project
achievements will be complemented by activities funded by other donors. Specifically, a
US$5.2 million GPE grant was approved in May 2013, in support of the second Zanzibar
Education Development Plan (ZEDP-2, 2012/13-2015/16) and supervised by the Swedish
International Development Agency. One of its four components (Teaching and Learning
Materials with Specific Focus on the Sciences and Mathematics) will build on the achieve-
ments of the ZBEIP: It includes, amongst others, the provision of textbooks and learning
materials for upper primary education which were, as indicated above, not covered by the
ZBEIP in contrast to initial plans. Zanzibar was not included into the IDA-supported Program
for Results towards the Tanzanian Big Results Initiative for education.

3.         Assessment of Outcomes

3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
42.        The overall relevance of the Project is rated substantial.
43.     Objectives. The relevance of project’s objectives was high, which is confirmed in the
Borrower’s ICR: The objectives have responded to the identified needs and priorities in the
country at the time of project preparation and up to now. It was and is fully in line with both
the MKUZA I (2006-10) und MKUZA II (2010-15), and Zanzibar education strategies and
policies, as well as with the 2007 JAST and the subsequent World Bank Group Country
Assistance Strategy for the period of FY2012-15 13.
44.     Design. The relevance of the original project design was modest: Even though the
choice of lending instrument and implementing arrangements was appropriate, as was the
credit/grant amount at Appraisal, the time-line was ambitious given the degree of
inexperience of the implementing agency and the fact that the project was not fully ready for
implementation when it was approved. In this light, the objectives related to learning
outcomes, and their respective indicators were overly optimistic. The fact that two results
indicators were in fact achieved without project activities possibly being attributable to these
achievements shows the significant design flaw when it comes to the results chain. (See para

  The Negotiated Resolution Agreement between Oxford University Press and the World Bank Group included the
debarment of Oxford University Press Tanzania for the period of 3 years, and a payment to remedy part of the
harm done by the misconduct. (see details in Press Release no. 2013/003/INT).

                                                                                                               9
48. below). Objectives and indicators made sense only under the risky assumptions that the
tight time line could be met, which turned out not to be the case.
45.     Implementation. Relevance of the project’s implementation was substantial: It is true
that assumptions taken in the design phase were not revisited, and consequently, the design
not formally revised even though challenges became obvious right from the beginning of
project implementation, as is documented in the early ISRs. Also, the April 2013
restructuring did not have any significant impact on the final outcome achievements of the
project. However, both the government and the Bank team did a great job in turning the
project around with intensive hands-on support to the implementing agency and delivered the
expected outputs without major extension.
46.    Exit: Relevance at exit is substantial. The outputs put in place with support of the
project will have a lasting positive impact on the learning environment for secondary
education on Zanzibar.

3.2        Efficacy: Achievement of Project Development Objectives
47.        Project efficacy is considered modest.
48.     This project faces a unique tension between on the one side failing to fully achieve the
intended outcomes on the PDO level, while on the other delivering the expected outputs on
the level of the components in the satisfactory range, hence the difference between ratings for
overall efficacy and outputs by components. The explanation for this disconnect is related to
the design of the results chain, which included different levels of education goals: Whereas
the outputs from activities like classroom construction/ rehabilitation, provision of teaching
and learning materials, teacher training and others) aimed at improving the learning
environment for students in primary (textbooks only) and lower secondary (all activities)
schools, it was also expected that the improved learning environment would impact on
improved learning outcomes at the end of the lower secondary in the same project
implementation period of six years. In hindsight, this was clearly ambitious. 14
49.    On the level of the PDO, only two (#1 and #4) out of the four PDO indicators show
reasonably good progress against targets formally revised through the 2013 restructuring.
50.     In particular, PDO indicator #1: the number of students taking the CSEE increased
considerably since project inception from a PAD baseline value of 5,389 in 2005 to 13,051 in
the year 2012 (see Figures, 1, 9 in Annex 6). Hence, actual values only slightly missed the
target (13,962) as formally revised with the Restructuring of April 2013 (93.5% of the target
value). When disaggregating numbers by gender, it must be recognized that while the gender
ratio was always very close to 50:50 up to the year 2009, the share of girls has increased
considerably since then (approx. 56.7% of CSEE takers were girls in the year 2012). This is
certainly an interesting trend which will require MoEVT’s attention in the future.
51.    Similarly, PDO Indicator #4 (introduced with the restructuring of April 2013): lower
secondary completion rates 15 have increased significantly from the Restructuring Paper (RP)



14
  The figures used for final target achievements in this Report were provided by the MoEVT during the last
Implementation Support mission in November 2013; however, they are not consistent with the values in the
Borrower ICR. An explanation for the divergence of data was not given by the Borrower.

     Defined in the RP as “The percentage of CSEE takers divided by the population aged 17 years”.


                                                                                                             10
baseline of 27% for 2007 to 46% in the years 2012, which is quite close to the end-of-project
target value of 49% (see Figure 8 in Annex 6).
52.     Even though the achievements in values for PDO indicators #1 and #4 are highly
commendable, they can very likely not be attributed to project activities, given that most
project activities were completed only in the course of 2013, and the figures refer to the
exams taken in (late) 2012. This disconnect is also acknowledged in the Borrower’s ICR. It is
obvious for component 1, where most newly constructed/ rehabilitated/ furnished and
equipped school buildings were finalized and handed over only in early 2013, and to a
significant degree also for component 2, where a large quantity of teacher training had not
been completed as of January 2013.
53.     The two remaining PDO indicators miss previously set target values by a large margin.
In particular, the absolute number of students actually passing the CSEE (PDO Indicator #2)
has increased at a much slower pace than expected from a PAD baseline value of 4,897 in
2005 to 6,935 in the year 2012, and even the (revised with April 2013 Restructuring) end-of-
project target value of 12,705 students was missed (actual numbers are 54.6% of the target
value). As a matter of fact, CSEE pass rates dropped massively, overall, both on the levels of
Zanzibar, where the rate declined from approx. 91% in 2005 to only approx. 53% in 2012,
and Tanzania mainland, where the trend shows an almost identical pattern. (see Figures 2, 3,
6 and 7, in Annex 6) 16. The URT government established a commission to investigate the
reasons for the observed decline in CSEE pass rates, but the final report still remains
confidential. It appears likely that factors external to the ZBEIP project may be primary
causes for these negative trends.
54.    The number of students passing the CSEE with Division III or better even (PDO
Indicator #3) decreased over the last years from a value of 990 students in the year 2005 to
only 757 students in the year 2012 therefore likewise clearly misses the set target values (see
Figure 4 in Annex 6).
55.    The failure to achieve the target values for PDOs 2 and 3 is the reason why the PDO
achievement is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
                                                                  Before restructuring   At Project closing      Overall

16
  The results of the 2013 CSEE examinations for Tanzania overall show an overall trend of improvement, i.e.
an increase of the overall pass rate of public school students by 14 %age points from 43.07% to 57.09%,
equivalent to an increase by 32%. Disaggregated figures for Zanzibar were not available at the time of the
completion of this Report.



                                                                                                                      11
57.     Note that the final achievements of both individual components are rated Satisfactory
in the Aide Memoire of the last Implementation Support mission of November 2013 and
Moderately Satisfactory in this ICR (see Annex 2, Outputs by Components), since the
envisaged outputs have been delivered without any major shortcomings. It can be expected
that the impacts of improved learning environment created through project activities will be
seen in student learning outcomes in the years to come.

3.3        Efficiency
58.    The efficiency of project is assessed as substantial: The project broadly succeeded in
implementing its program within the expected time frame, with an extension of the closing
date of only four months to complete activities. A comparative (across countries) unit cost
analysis undertaken for two major Project outputs, i.e., classroom construction and textbook
provision, comes to the conclusion that the efficiency standards are maintained and in line
with other similar projects in Africa. (See Annex 3).
59.      Over the project implementation period, the government has made considerable effort
in executing the Project efficiently, with the aim of improving value for resources spent. In
particular (a) under Component 1, the Government reduced the scope of the original design
which was too extensive by focusing on just the core school facilities 17, and eliminating or
reducing add-ons such as hostels (which were deemed unnecessary in a small island
environment) and staff houses; (b) met the targets for school construction/rehabilitation while
containing construction costs; and (c) procured all textbooks for 1-4 grades instead of books
for (a lower number of) secondary school students.
60.     Efficiency gains in textbook procurement were realized when USAID offered in
September 2009 to provide secondary school math textbooks for Forms I-IV and V-VI, which
had initially expected to be covered by Project Component 2, resulting in resource savings.
61.      At mid-term, options for savings in the amount of US$6.5million equivalent, or about
20.6% of the credit allocation, had been identified by reducing the scope of work and limiting
resources to priority areas in construction without jeopardizing the PDO. The savings realized
were used to cover cost-overruns elsewhere or needs that emerged during school construction,
i.e., the construction of housing with cafeteria for student-teachers and completion of staff
houses at BWMTTC /Pemba.

3.4        Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
62.     Based on Modest efficacy with respect to the achievement of the PDO and related
indicators, the overall outcome rating of the project is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory – even
though the overall relevance and efficiency were both rated Substantial.

3.5        Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
63.    Since, as described, the outputs of the project have been completed only in the latter
part of the implementation period, and basically constitute improvements in learning


17
     For example, classrooms, laboratories, administration blocks and school utilities.



                                                                                            12
environment, the impacts on enrollment and success of more disadvantaged population
groups, i.e., poor and/or female students, cannot be established for the time being, and neither
can any other social development impacts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
64.     The intensive collaboration of the Bank team with Ministry staff involved in project
implementation has contributed to a significant improvement of project management
capacities within the MoEVT, including monitoring & evaluation through the EMIS. While
the EMIS was quite weak in the earlier phases of project implementation, it now produces
reliable and comprehensive data, an achievement that helped, for example, for the preparation
of the recently approved GPE Project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
65.      So far, unintended outcomes and impacts have not been observed.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
66.     The risks identified in the PAD were appropriate, but the most relevant risk, the
inexperience and weak implementation capacity of the MoEVT was not explicitly mentioned
in the risk section of the main text in the PAD. The overall project financial management
risk at appraisal was assessed as Substantial, and analogous, the procurement risk as High.
An overall risk rating was not determined in the PAD.
67.     Given that there is no follow-up operation, neither from the Bank nor from other
donors except for some elements of the GPE project, and also that government resources are
limited there are some questions about the medium- to long-term sustainability of the
project’s achievements. These questions have also been raised in the Borrower’s ICR. The
government has allocated the annual amount of TSZ1 million (equivalent to about US$612)
to each school for maintenance purposes, including payment of utilities. However, it seems
that maintenance of school facilities constructed is not always assured as desirable. 18




18
  Observations during school visits suggested that some of the school compounds lack fences, making the
ground vulnerable to intrusion (by livestock, passers-by, etc.) and pollution; not all schools have maintenance
plans in place to take care of both clippings left by students all over the compounds, landscaping and small
repairs. Further, there is an unreliable provision of water for school sanitation in the absence of boreholes which
could be used during public water supply shortages. In several schools, newly bought science equipment and
materials remain unused (some not even unpacked), due to the non-availability of lab technicians, ICT
specialists and librarians. One head master, whose school was recently moved into a newly constructed building,
observed that as a result of the installation of electric equipment, e.g., fans, lights, maintenance costs would be
much higher than previously. He anticipated increased expenditure on stocking science labs once the materials
provided by the project were used up. Although unable to provide exact figures for these newly incurred
expenses, in the (likely) extent the government allocation was not enough he hoped to cover the shortfall
through parental contributions.

5.         Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1        Bank Performance
       (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
           Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
68.     The Bank team prepared the Project in a relatively short time, within a period of less
than one year, from the first Identification Mission in May 2006 and Concept Review in
October 2006 to Approval in April 2007 19, and did full due diligence on all relevant Bank-
internal review procedures and consultations: Preparation steps included a Quality
Enhancement Review (QER, January 2007), and two review meeting with AFTQK in
February 2007. The QER, amongst others, expressed concerns about the risk of implemen-
tation overload particularly with respect to required procurement of all sorts of educational
equipment and materials and add-on subcomponents, made suggestions to eliminate, merge
and sequence activities, and also recommended hiring a local staff for general implemen-
tation support right from the beginning. The AFTQK review as well expressed considerable
concerns about the overall implementation risks given the inexperience of the implementing
agency. The detailed project description in the PAD does not provide reason for the
assumption that these concerns and/or recommendations have been fully taken on board.
However, the design of the project was broadly endorsed during the review processes,
including by the QER and AFTQK. No concerns by any of the reviewers were documented
on the appropriateness of the results chain and indicators.
69.     Despite these efforts, in hindsight QaE cannot be rated other than moderately
unsatisfactory for the following reasons: (i) The lack of readiness for implementation caused
early delays with massive impacts on the implementation period; (ii) the inclusion of too
many activities into the design, specifically of Component 2, strained the capacity of the
MoEVT which had been diagnosed as weak during preparation; (iii) the overoptimistic
objectives and indicators related to learning outcomes distracted attention away from the
solid and necessary work on creating a conducive learning environment, which was central to
the Project, de facto. It also has to be noted that there are inconsistencies and ambiguities in
the PAD, for example, as to the resources set aside for each component, and the de facto
existence of a component 3 for project management, which is not mentioned in the PAD main
text, but appears later on in Annex 5 on Project Costs. Another issue that came out only in the
last Implementation Support mission of November 2013 is that two Intermediate Indicators
that were mentioned in the PAD main text had (erroneously) not been included into the
Results Framework (Annex 3), and hence, overlooked and never monitored.
       (b) Quality of Supervision
           Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
70.    The Bank team in charge of implementation support for the Project, based in Dar-es-
Salam, took significant efforts, particularly in the earlier stages of project implementation, to
help government staff to get up to speed on implementation, procurement etc. Altogether 11
formal implementation support missions were undertaken (two per year, except for 2011, the
year of the MTR, and in 2012, where only one implementation support mission was
undertaken). The close proximity of the major part of the team allowed for frequent direct

     See above, on political economy issues.



                                                                                              14
exchanges with the MoEVT team through an uncounted number of mutual technical visits 20,
phone and email follow-up in addition to the formal implementation support missions, which
was an important factor in realizing Project achievements. The Aide-Memoires provided
sufficient detail of progress made and challenges. There was a high degree of stability on the
Bank side, with only one TTL-change during the implementation period, and the change was
for a member of the task-team who had already been involved into the preparation of the
project and who then led the team until project completion. He was supported from mid-2009
by an international textbook specialist, from November 2010 by a local staff with senior level
experience in housing construction, and from January 2013 by an expert on teacher
development. Various other experts were brought in and provided targeted support on
individual activities. Finally, the Bank’s procurement and financial management specialists
were available on a regular and by-needs basis for hands-on-support to the implementation
team.
71.     However, while pro-active efforts were taken to tackle the initial implementation
problems and deliver the planned outputs, the team did not respond to the challenges related
to the design of the results framework. The QAG QaE Review recommended adjusting what
was perceived as unrealistic ratings (see above, para 32). The ISR# 7 (of June 2010) followed
suite, and announced a revision of indicator target values; the comments of the Sector
Manager at the time questioned the value of the indicators related to the CSEE as well as the
assumptions taken at the design phase, and the Country Director, at the time recommended
restructuring and advancing the Mid-Term Review (MTR). The team did not pursue this
route, hoping that the envisaged results on the level of PDO indicators could still be achieved
with accelerated implementation progress. Both DO and IP ratings were kept Satisfactory,
based on positive development of trends related to CSEE examinations, which turned to be
encouraging, at the time. It is true that indicator targets were adjusted in ISR#8 (of March
2011), i.e., the baseline data which initially referred to 2005 were modified to refer to 2007
from then on - but these changes were not processed as a formal restructuring. The project
ratings were finally downgraded (to MU for DO, and MS for IP) one year following the MTR,
in June 2012 (ISR#10). The Project was not formally restructured until April 2013. At this
point, the team missed a chance to revisit decisions made at the design stage, specifically on
the results framework and some critical assumptions, which were discovered to be obsolete.
72.     It is questionable, whether a restructuring of both PDO and PDO indicators would
have made any difference to the ultimate achievements in terms of outputs. For the project
team on the ground such a restructuring would have been perceived as a merely bureaucratic
exercise, which would not have made any difference when it came to turning implementation
performance around and assuring the delivery of number and quality of schools constructed
or rehabilitated, teachers trained and learning materials distributed. The team must be
commended though for turning project implementation around at an advanced stage of
project implementation, and that is why Bank performance for Quality of Supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

  There were at least 10 technical visits of team members to Zanzibar, and 6 visits of project counterparts from
Zanzibar to the Bank Office in Dar-es-Salam.



                                                                                                              15
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
73.     Despite the need for considerable efforts from the team to build MoEVT
implementation capacity and provide hands-on support, outputs were delivered in a
satisfactory way (see Component ratings in Annex 2). However, since Bank’s performance in
ensuring quality at entry being rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, as was the overall Outcome
rating of the Project, the overall rating for Bank Performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
74.     URT Government had limited involvement into the preparation of the project, and had
not applied for Project Preparation Facility (PPF) funds to provide resources for activities that
would have enhanced readiness for implementation during preparation. However, the RGZ
was highly supportive of the project from the beginning, and showed high ownership. During
the final Implementation Support mission, the MoEVT expressed his gratitude to the Bank
for having supported this project which was on top of the priority list for Zanzibar and
considered the most successful one implemented by the MoEVT so far. The MoEVT pro-
actively prepared its own highly informative, comprehensive and thorough ICR, which was
discussed with the mission team, and is annexed to this report (see summary in Annex 5).
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
75.     Implementation was the responsibility of the MoEVT. While it is true that the
Implementation Agency had to address considerable capacity challenges at project start, this
was more than equalized by the pro-activity, ownership and enthusiasm of Ministry staff to
make things work. The challenges for the Ministry had been aggravated by the resignation of
the Procurement Specialist in April 2008, who was never replaced. The Ministry procure-
ment team, including a consultant procurement specialist in mid-2009, supported through
training and frequent hands-on guidance by the Bank Procurement Specialist, filled in.
76.    At mid-term, in June 2011, civil works for school construction were well underway
with overall progress of about 40% expected to be completed by January 2012. Due to poor
contractor performance, the contract for three schools (Pajemtule, Tunguu and Dimani) had
to be terminated in June 2012. The government successfully initiated and completed the
procurement process and recruited three different contractors to complete the remaining work
by project closing.
77.     Critical policy changes affected the pace and scope of project implementation in
component 2: In the second semester of 2009 it became clear that the MoEVT had decided to
revise the full primary school curriculum (and not only the upper grades, as initially planned).
This had implications for project activities and schedule, for example for teacher training for
upper primary which was postponed until the later years of the project. In light of these
changes, it was decided for the Project to rather provide lower grade textbooks, and have the
upper grade textbooks delivered from other sources.
78.    The textbook policy, fundamental for the preparation of textbooks linked to the new
Standard I curriculum, was submitted for the Minister’s approval and issuance by August 1,
2011. The new curriculum came into effect in school year 2010/11. New text books were not
ready until 2012, hence implementation of the new curriculum started without all necessary
provisions in place, using existing textbook and teaching and learning materials.

                                                                                              16
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.      The Zanzibar MoEVT was very enthusiastically engaged in the implementation of the
Project. But there were capacity gaps and a need to learn and adjust to World Bank
procedures. The Project benefitted from full support of the Minister, and the implementation
team was led by a pro-active and closely engaged Project Coordinator. Upcoming challenges
were addressed and strong efforts taken to move project implementation forward. Last but not
least it is noteworthy that the Borrower prepared a very detailed and rich own Implementation
Completion Report which perfectly complements the Bank ICR.

6.     Lessons Learned

80.     The lessons learnt from this project are about due diligence, and about paying
attention to political economy-related factors of influence that might not have been
immediately obvious during project preparation and implementation:
81.      Assure readiness for implementation upon approval, and where this is not possible,
listen to early warning signs and follow advice given to mitigate insufficient readiness and/or
capacity issues right at the start of project implementation. This includes taken into
consideration advice given during preparation: A dedicated Implementation Specialist would
have been able to follow-up and help solve the initial challenges related to the procurement
and finalization of project designs, which would have helped the project stay within the
timeline. A Construction Specialist on board right from the beginning of project
implementation might have been able to provide more focused support. This is not a new
lesson, but one that was reinforced during the implementation of this project.
82.     Revisit assumptions made during appraisal on a regular basis, listen to feed-back
and, in response, restructure rather early than late. There were feed-back loops, and red
flags did in fact show indicating that results achievement was not on track - but they were put
aside in favor of other priorities: The challenges the Project faced in matching the anticipated
results chain could have been addressed at a time when a turnaround would still have been
possible. The impact of a changes or additions to the results framework is negligible, when
they come in a late stage such as the last year of implementation.
83.      Pay attention in a pro-active manner to situations that are potentially politically
sensitive. One of the more structural issues this project suffered from might be related to a
comparative marginalization vis-à-vis interventions on the mainland: Compared to operations
in education and other sectors in mainland Tanzania, this was a rather small project, on an
island separated physically and politically from the mainland. Perhaps due to its relative
isolation and the sensitive political economy between the Tanzania federal government and
Zanzibar, the Project did not receive the assistance it needed from the mainland government,
(at least not in the early stages of project implementation).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Increased enrollment and improve quality in secondary education
through provision of infrastructure ($35.1 million)
(Moderately Satisfactory)

84.    Overall implementation progress of this component which seeks to improve the
quality of secondary education through provision of infrastructure was Moderately
Satisfactory. All activities related to this component have been implemented as planned.
85.     The Project built 19 School and rehabilitated 6, and with that, added more than 16,100
student spaces, 339 classrooms, 75 science laboratories, 28 computer laboratories, 27
libraries and 54 staff houses. The supply, delivery and installation of all earmarked goods
(furniture, equipment) in respective schools have been completed. A total of 672 teachers
have been allocated to the new schools.
86.     Detail of completed schools, student enrollments and overall components output
details are given in a Table 2 below.

             PROJECT TARGETS                          STATUS AT END OF LAST ISM
Construction of 10 upper secondary schools   Construction of 10 schools have been
                                             completed and handed over. All completed
                                             schools are in use. Due to budget constraints
                                             student’s hostels were dropped, and only 3
                                             instead of 10 staff houses were constructed in
                                             all earmarked schools.
Construction of 9 lower secondary schools    Construction of 9 schools have been completed
                                             and handed over. All completed schools are in
                                             use.
Construction of facilities for BWMTTC        Construction has been completed, handed over
                                             and put in use. All earmarked facilities were
                                             constructed as per original plan.
Rehabilitation of 6 schools                  All schools rehabilitation completed handed
                                             over and in use.


87.     During the Project implementation
period the pupil-classroom ratio in secondary
schools (IOI#1) has developed much more
favorably than was foreseen at the time of
appraisal: The actual ratio decreased, despite
the considerable increases in enrolment, from
a value of 83 in the year 2006 to 58 students
per classrooms in the year 2012 (see graph on
Pupil-Classroom Ration 2006-2012) which is
considerably better than the targeted value of
92. This improvement has to be analyzed in light of the development of overall enrolment
figures across time. The trend cannot be attributed to the Project, given the late completion of
classrooms constructed or rehabilitated.

Component 2: Improve quality of education through teacher training,
curriculum reform, and provision of learning materials ($12.1 million).

(Moderately Satisfactory)
88.     All activities described in Component 2 were completed. While the
accomplishments under component 2 are equal in outputs to those in the PAD, almost
every activity was revised during implementation to improve its efficacy, cost-
effectiveness, or to better fit current needs. The main activities in this component
were (i) the training of teachers, and (ii) the provision of textbooks; these are reflected
in the Intermediate Indicators.
89.     Looking at the IOIs #2-6, focusing on the percentage of teachers who are
qualified to teach at the secondary level, notably in math, biology, chemistry, physics,
the picture is positive overall given that considerable progress can be observed for all
five indicators 1. Only one (IOI #2) out of the five indicators met the quite ambitious
PAD target value of 65%, though: As shown in Figure 10 below, the share of teachers
at secondary schools who are actually qualified to teach at this level, has increased
faster than was expected in the PAD reaching a value of 79% in the year 2012
(compared to a target value of 65%). It has to be acknowledged, however, that the
significant overall increase was not due to the increase in qualification of math and
science teachers, which were in the center of the project: The subject-specific shares
of qualified teachers each (approximately) reached the target value, but did not
overachieve. Only for mathematics the 65% mark was missed by a relatively large
margin (actual value in 2012 was 47%). 2




1
  However, it should be emphasized that the data obtained from MoEVT is rather imperfect for IOs 3-6
since it does not allow grasping the extent of out-of-field teaching (i.e. it only provides the information
whether a teacher teaching e.g. chemistry is qualified at all, but not whether he/she is actually qualified
to teach chemistry).
2
 This has, however, to some extent to be attributed to the fact that the baseline value of 28% was
particularly low for this subject which made the target already from the beginning very ambitious.



                                                                                                       21
90.     Similarly, for the IOIs #7-10 which correspond to the textbook-pupil ratios in
Forms III + IV3 for the core subjects Mathematics, Physics, English and Kiswahili
considerable improvements can be observed since initiation of the ZBEIP project. In
fact, the actual values even surpass the target ratio of one textbook per student in all
four core subjects and it can hence be assumed that, at least on average over all
schools, core subject textbooks are sufficiently available for secondary school
students.4 (See details in part F of the Data Sheet above).
91.     The PAD suggests two more IOIs in its main text (p. 4), i.e., the percentages
of teachers successfully completing (and passing the examination) in the in-service
language and mathematics/science courses, respectively, which were however not
included in the Results Framework Annex 3 (pp. 20-22). For this reason, these two
indicators were neglected, except for during the last Implementation Support mission
in November 2013. It became apparent that the required data were apparently not
centrally available for most of the years. Yet, MoEVT was able to provide
examination results for the year 2012 for the science and mathematics trainings on the
island of Unguja only (see Figure 11), which look relatively encouraging given that
approx. 90.7% of the teachers passed the final exam (PAD target value was 90%).




Textbook Procurement
92.    The project funded the provision (development, purchase and distribution) of
213,395 Standard 1-4 textbooks of Mathematics, English, Social Science, Science and
Kiswahili.
93.    During the original project design, funds had been designated to provide
textbooks for lower and higher secondary school students. In addition, some funds
were set to support the purchase of textbooks for upper primary (Standards 5 and 6) to
align with the new lower and upper primary curriculum, which introduced English as
the medium of instruction in Standard 5 instead of the beginning of lower secondary.


3
 Given that some of the textbooks are used for both, Forms III and IV, the mission team decided to
calculate avg. ratios for these two classes together since it was impossible to fully disentangle the
numbers used for Forms III and Form IV and numbers for Form IV only would hence potentially be
biased.
4
  The most likely reason for this rather surprising finding is low data quality on the number of
textbooks given out from MoEVT’s central storage which could have led to an exaggeration of the
indicator values. However, it can also not be ruled out that poor textbook management led to the
situation where more textbooks than actually needed were given out to schools.



                                                                                                  22
However, the Government subsequently realized that teaching Standard 4 leavers the
old curricula would create a policy shock that would have adverse effects on the
students. Instead, the new curriculum was phased in grade by grade, which meant
Standards 5 and 6 would not require textbooks until the last year of the project, while
Standards 1-4 would require textbooks immediately.

Teacher Training
94.     The project funded the training of a total of 3,780 primary and secondary
school teachers in Math, Science and/or English (see table below.)

95.     As of January 2013, a large quantity of teacher training had not been
completed 5. They included English and communication for upper primary math,
science, and geography teachers, content for upper primary math and science teachers,
and content for secondary math and science teachers. This brought about two issues:
the majority of the project and government funds were depleted on other activities,
and, as most teacher training was described in the PAD as multiple years of center-
based training, it was impossible to complete as originally described. While the 2013
restructuring freed some Component 1 funds be used for training, they were
insufficient to fund all the center-based training described in the PAD.




5
 The January 2013 Aide Memoire describes the causes that were inside and outside the Government’s
and World Bank’s control.



                                                                                                23
96.     Instead of the classroom-style center-based training described in the PAD6,
the World Bank and Government teams worked together to develop an approach that
ended up being more economical, timely, and potentially more effective at improving
teacher practice. The original plan was constrained in that (i) altogether 20 days of
center-based training (stretched over two years) was impossible to realize without
severely disrupting the school year; (ii) the transport and food costs were
insurmountable; (iii) research demonstrates that the most effective teacher training is
directly applicable and incorporated into teacher daily practice, which is unlikely with
compressed traditional classroom-style training.
97.     Hence, trainings hours were adjusted to incorporate fewer center-based
training days, and the prepared pace of center-based training was increased to cover
more material. One-third of the training days originally designated as center-based
were replaced with school-based training (SBT). Instead of teachers from
approximately 50 schools traveling substantial distances to each training center for
day-long training, and the government paying for their travel and meals, teachers
would congregate at nearby schools – usually from six to eight schools together -- and
conduct more interactive and discussion-based trainings that were facilitated by a
fellow teacher, known as a sub-cluster leader.
98.    To shift from the didactic lecture style of center-based training to peer learning
sessions, the Teacher Education Department capitalized on their experience designing
micro-teaching courses. Micro-teaching is a method where teachers are required to
develop classroom activities and materials, lead a group of peer teachers through them,
and discuss methods of improvement. Micro-teaching resembles the practice-based
approaches research has found highly correlated with translating teacher learning into
improved classroom practice.
99.     The Teacher Education Department developed 8 group activity modules to be
completed by teachers in during SBT and at home and largely incorporated micro-
teaching. Each session was centered on a different topic: teaching new concepts,
lesson planning, games, and student evaluation. Leaders built on center-based training
on these concepts, and each teacher worked to develop an activity on the topic for a
topic they were currently teaching. On the second day, teachers would lead their peers
in the activity who would afterwards provide feedback. To ensure that sub-cluster
leaders provide useful training, trainers would conduct supervisory visits to SBT and
support sub-cluster leaders as necessary.
100. By reducing travel times and shifting to half-day SBT sessions after classes,
teachers were able to receive a portion of their training without interrupting the
academic schedule. In addition, shorter trips or walking to the SBT venues reduced or
eliminated travel fees; half-day sessions meant reduced meal costs.
101. More importantly, by working in small peer groups and establishing local
leaders in sub-cluster leaders, teachers met with after the project reported making use
of the activities they developed during training in the classroom and a strengthened
confidence in their abilities.


6
  Three cohorts with 360 teachers each were each to participate at 2 years courses with 2 weeks of
center-based training and one supervision visit per year, completed by a final examination at the end of
the 2 years period.



                                                                                                     24
102. In more detail, the following Sub-components were covered by this
component:

2.A.1: In-service upgrading of course content for secondary science and
mathematics teachers
103. This subcomponent sought to finance the development and delivery of in-
service upgrading for 500 secondary teachers qualified to teach Forms 1 and 2 but not
Forms 3 and 4. Upgrading includes 20 days of in-service training and 2 follow-up
visits by qualified staff to provide feedback on teachers' classroom practice. As of
July 2013, 500 teachers had received the training and follow-ups.
104. Many teachers interviewed during the last Implementation Support mission of
November 2013 felt more confident and competent in their subjects. However, review
of follow-up suggested that the ability to teach in English was still very limited. Given
that secondary school teachers are expected to use English as the medium of
instruction, almost all teachers will require substantially more training before they are
qualified to use English as their primary means of instruction. In addition, teachers
who received the training but had minimal content knowledge beforehand, and the
training was insufficient to prepare them; they require additional training to meet the
expectations set for them by the curriculum and student standards. Although the
purpose of the upgrading was to provide for more qualified teachers in Form 3 and 4,
some headmasters were not ready to allocate the trained teachers to higher levels due
to high demand at all levels.


2.A.2 In-service upgrading of course content for upper primary science and
mathematics teachers
105. To prepare for the imminent changes to the curriculum in primary schools,
including the transition to English as the medium instruction in upper primary core
courses (including math and science), the project included in-service upgrading for
approximately 1,039 upper primary math and science teachers 7 . The course was
intended include a refresher of the appropriate curriculum, information on the revised
curriculum, and teaching methods. It was to be delivered in English to enhance
familiarity with the terminology and English communication. Over 1,050 teachers
received the training, practice, observations, and evaluation largely in the past 11
months. Although the project did not complete the activities over multiple years as
described in the PAD, it was completed using a practice-based approach that evidence
suggests is more effective at translating into changing teacher practice. In addition, it
built substantial capacity for continuous teacher learning by building a substructure of
teacher networks, local pedagogy leaders, and training designers as well as a culture
of teacher improvement that did not exist before the project.




7
    This value included head teachers and school inspectorates



                                                                                      25
2.A.3: In-service upgrading of upper primary English, science, math, and social
science teachers in English and Communication skills
106. As core courses continue the transition to English as the medium of instruction,
2,000 teachers were planned to receive training on use of the English Language as a
medium of instruction through a two-year training program. The program was to
include two weeks of center-based training annually and one supervision visit each
year. As of February 2012, the course design, training of trainers, and 360 teachers
had completed the training. As of January 2013, 300 social science and 500 math
teachers remained to receive the training. In the past 6 months, 400 mathematics
teachers received 20 days of English language training in Zanzibar.


2.A.4: Capacity building for Head Teachers, Subject Advisers, and Inspectors
107. At the beginning of the project, half of all head teachers had received no
training for their position. This activity was included to fund development a two-week
training course for head teachers, a training of trainers, and delivery of the training at
all training centers in Unguja and Pemba. The training was completed by February
2012. As of January 2013, a final report had been drafted. In May, members of the
Government received and provided feedback to the consultant who wrote the report.
The final version of the report was shared during the mission and the World Bank
received a copy.


2.A.5: Revision of pre-service primary (certificate) curriculum
108. The purpose of this subcomponent was to align the pre-service primary
teacher certificate curriculum with the new primary school curriculum for core
subjects, and was designed to be implemented in the training college by August 2008.
The activity was completed by July 2012.


2.A.6: Interim Upgrading of pre-service secondary teacher (diploma) curriculum
in science and mathematics
109. While the activity outlined in 2.A.2 provide some training to current
secondary math and science teachers, it did not address those entering the system. All
activities under this component were completed by July 2013. Training similar to that
outlined above would be incorporated into the pre-service training of new math
science teachers and provided to all teachers attending the State University of
Zanzibar (SUZA). To increase the impact of the trainings and capitalize on its
provision, they invited 100 current teachers to the Unguja training and 50 in Pemba.
By combining their efforts they made highly efficient use of limited resources and
provided training to a total of 325 teachers. The World Bank mission congratulates
the Government on this activity’s completion.


2.A.7: Management of entrants to teacher training
110. To better understand the characteristics, motivation, incentive receptiveness,
capability, and needs of teacher training entrants, it was agreed previously to finance a
study of the management of teacher training. The study should help provide

                                                                                       26
consistency and coherence among the project’s several interventions to improve
teacher quality and ensure a broader understanding of teacher issues. It should include
an analytical review of the adequacy of incentives, improvements in the working
conditions for teachers, and enhancement of accountability measures. The World
Bank provided feedback on the report draft in July and submitted a finalized report
before the mission.


2. B: Provision of instructional materials in key subjects for all secondary schools
and students
111. This component served to support the development of a policy to sustain
provision of textbooks in secondary school, the purchase and distribution of science
equipment, consumables to all schools teaching science, and the purchase and
distribution of library books and other learning materials for each secondary school. It
was planned initially that all materials would be purchased and distributed by 2007.
112. On textbooks, see more detailed discussion above. In January 2013, the initial
distribution was completed to attain a ratio of one new book per student in each
subject based on the previous year’s attendance data. Remaining books were kept in
warehouse and are distributed upon request by head teachers. Because ongoing
distribution cannot account for future needs, this practice will result in schools
approaching but never quite having sufficient textbooks for every child. During the
mission, group discussed how textbook inventory and distribution could be better
planned.
113. As of July 2013, materials for disabled students had been purchased and 60%
of materials had been distributed. It is unknown if the Human Resources Department
distributed the remaining materials as agreed.


2. C: Revision of primary curriculum and provision of appropriate learning
materials
114. This component was designed to support a consultancy and workshops to
develop a new curriculum for upper primary standards, train 900 upper primary
school teachers, and purchase and distribute textbooks in English in five subjects for
each pupil in upper primary school as well as a package of instructional materials for
each school. Instead of revising only the upper primary curriculum, the MoEVT
decided it was more appropriate to revise the entire primary curriculum, which was
completed by 2009, and performance standards have been created as the curriculum is
phased in. When the PAD was developed, the Government intended to implement the
new curriculum in all primary grades simultaneously. However, concerned that it
would shock the system and poorly serve students to be trained in one curriculum for
half of primary school and a different curriculum for the remaining portion, they
began those that started Standard 1 in 2008 using the new curriculum. Currently,
cohorts of students in Standards 1 through 5 are taught using the new curriculum, and
Standards 6 and 7.




                                                                                     27
2. D: Support for science education for girls
115. To support improvement of female student performance in mathematics and
science, science camps for girls were to be i) designed; ii) offered to 100 female
secondary students of science each year; and iii) evaluated externally in the third year.
To date the science camp has been conducted once for approximately 300 female
students, the content for four years has been drafted, and the one camp was evaluated
externally, and the final version of the report was shared with the mission. The 2011
camp was cancelled due to difficulties finalizing the content manual. It was cancelled
in 2012 for funding concerns and difficulties finalizing the content manual. In January
2013, it was agreed that the content for a camp would be finalized and photocopied at
the MoEVT instead of published to lower costs by February 28, and the camp would
be conducted by April 15. The final camps were cancelled due to a lack of funds.
Instead of funding future science camps, the materials will be used in after-school
science clubs, which will be more economical and – as demonstrated by the
implementation struggles faced during this project – more likely to be implemented.
The Zanzibar Institute for Education has committed to training 45 teachers (five per
training center) after the project’s close using government funds. The materials were
printed by the Ministry and published the final report and the materials on the
MoEVT website.


2. E: Provision of life skills, including HIV/AIDS, gender, and environmental
awareness
116. This component was designed to help biology and geography teachers
incorporate life skills and other topics into their teaching as well as support
extracurricular secondary school workshops. By 2011, 1,600 teachers had received
training on the manual's use, and by 2013 over 100 extracurricular health club leaders
in Pemba received training. While it was agreed in July that an additional training
would be conducted by the project’s closed, the Government did not prioritize
funding. Three of the four schools visited during the last Implementation Support
mission reported receiving copies of the manual, and they had indicated training the
teachers on its use. Many teachers reported a positive impact among their students.
Challenges noted include high teacher workloads, preventing extracurricular work,
and some trained teachers transferring schools. The teacher management report cited
that the life skills education had positive life outcomes on students, but the school
health clubs suffered from lack of allocated time, resources, and support mechanisms
necessary for them to sustain themselves in the long-term.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
117. This annex includes an analysis of the economic rationale for investments in
basic education in Zanzibar, and the cost effectiveness of ZBEIP focusing on
efficiency using the unit-cost analysis method. It is worth noting that the project was
the main intervention in the education sector in Zanzibar and first World Bank credit
to the government of Zanzibar. The Project played a pivotal role in the changes
observed in the education system during its implementation.
118. Economic theory states that education helps building human capital which is
essential for development of society and is typically associated with higher earnings
over an individual’s life span. A report by wage indicator survey 2013 on wages in
Zanzibar found out that workers with tertiary education earn thrice as much as those
with primary education8.Moreover, educated individuals tend to be better-nourished,
healthier, more productive, and generally show an increased participation in public
life. Educated women usually enjoy more autonomy and their level of education level
is associated with lower fertility rates and lower infant/child mortality rates. In line
with various theoretical models (e.g. the Augmented Solow Model), many empirical
studies using cross-national data from industrialized and developing countries
highlight the important contribution of education to economic growth 9 . Current
education spending is a fundamental determinant of the future educational profile of
the working age population, thus, impacting future labor market outcomes and other
socio-economic outcomes, including better earnings, secured employment
opportunities, and overall well-being.
119. In order to assess whether the investments were cost-effective and efficient, it
is important to conduct an efficiency analysis, which in this case will be undertaken
using the unit cost-analysis method. In the PAD economic and financial analysis
provides the private and social rate of returns to education and argues that among the
levels of the education systems, secondary education is the level most deserving of
expansion from the economic perspective. Furthermore, the PAD also stipulates the
social benefits of expansion in the secondary education. The nature of education
projects is such that analyses conducted immediately upon a project’s completion are
unlikely to be fully comprehensive as many of the benefits that accrue from
investments in education will materialize in the medium to long term; furthermore, at
this point it is not feasible to quantify and monetize the benefits hence prohibiting
cost-benefit analysis.

Unit - Cost Analysis

120. As mentioned earlier, data availability is a major constraint, making rigorous,
quantitative analysis difficult. Although detailed information on the costs of this
project are available, data from other comparable projects is generally unavailable.

Since this is the first education project in Zanzibar we will make the comparison using
information from other similar projects in nearby countries in Africa (namely Burundi
and Eritrea) as opposed to comparisons within Zanzibar. The strategy used will be
comparing the cost per unit of output with different projects. In this regard we will
compare the unit cost of two outputs namely: 1. Construction of classrooms which
comprises up to 83% of the total funds and 2. Development, production and
distribution of textbooks under ZBEIP. Nevertheless, comparisons of unit cost across
projects have to be taken with a grain of salt as projects’ activities are not entirely
comparable. Moreover, input prices can vary widely across countries or time causing
the production of the same output to have substantially different costs (e.g. labor and
transportation costs or energy). This adds two complications 1. of bringing all
projects’ cost figures to a comparable year (i.e. deflating the costs), (which in our case
has been chosen as 2007 due to availability of the data for the projects and other
country specific variables needed to make this transition) and 2. Comparing costs
across countries. The variables used during these comparisons are World Bank's
annual inflation rates (to bring the cost figures to 2007) and Purchasing Power Parity
(PPP) conversion factor to market exchange rate ratio (for comparison across
countries).

121. Component 1 of ZBEIP consisted of improving the quality of secondary
education via means of construction of infrastructure. Around 20 schools were
constructed with a provision of over 300 classrooms which have a capacity of over

16,000 students. Table 1 compares the unit cost of constructing a classroom with
ESRP10. and EESIP11. We can notice that the cost per classroom under ZBEIP when
converted to the 2007 levels and applying PPP conversion factor is similar to EESIP
and a little more than ESRP.
122. Similarly, part of the component 2 consisted of developing, producing and
distributing textbooks to students. Overall around 213,395 textbooks of Mathematics,
English, Social Science, Science and Kiswahili were provided to the students costing
around 1.13 million USD. As seen, the unit cost of a textbook for ZBEIP
(extrapolated backwards to 2007, see above) although a little higher is similar to
ESRP. This slight difference in unit cost can be explained by the fact that ESRP
provided textbooks for both primary and lower secondary whereas ZBEIP has
provided all the books for lower secondary hence making the cost a little higher. This
is in line with the trend that as level of education increases, the cost of textbook
pertaining to a particular education level also increases.
123. The slightly higher unit cost among both the components of ZBEIP, more so
in the case of ZBEIP and ESRP can be explained by following points which are
discussed before as well: (i) these activities are not fully comparable; (ii) input prices
may vary across time; and (iii) even though PPP conversion factors have been applied
to make the comparison comparable there is a huge difference by GDP per capita
(Burundi = $251 and Zanzibar = $656) between Zanzibar and Burundi making the
components under ZBEIP more "expensive".
124. This unit cost analysis is important in the case of ZBEIP since this is the first
World Bank credit to the government of Zanzibar and hence there are no other
avenues (comparing with other projects in Zanzibar) to compare the efficiency of the
project. Looking at Table 1 we can safely conclude that the efficiency standards are
maintained and are in line with other similar projects in Africa.

II.    CONTEXT

III.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS FRAMEWORK

3.3    Review of PAD PDO: A closer examination of the PDO indicators and
subsequent review by the Government and Bank supervision missions revealed the
following:
(i)    Unexpected Policy Changes: Some of the policy changes expected to be
       implemented during the project phase did not materialize or took place at
       different times periods than anticipated.
(ii)   Wrong Assumption: The appraisal mission made wrong assumptions: (i) the
       abolition of standard 7 was expected to take place in 2011 but will occur in
       2016 instead; (ii) It was believed that passing standard 7 was a requirement to
       attend secondary school which is untrue.
(iii) Wrong Time Frame: Mismatch of PAD Results framework (2005-2011) with
       PDO indicators (2006-2011) for Intermediate Outcome Indicators which did
       not match the project implementation period (2008-2013).
(iv) Questionable Source of Statistical Data: The baseline data did not match
       official data published in the Annual Budget Speech. The source of the data in
       the PAD can no longer be identified.
3.4    PDO Revision: Given the inconsistencies above, the Government and the
Bank revised PDO targets. Based on the revised PDO, it was noted that, overall,
Intermediate Outcome Indicators show significant progress.
(i)    The overall share of secondary teachers qualified to teach at the secondary
       level increased from 59 percent in 2006 to 79 percent in 2012, surpassing the
       target value of 65 percent.


                                                                                   39
(ii)    In science, the share of secondary teachers qualified to teach mathematics,
        biology, chemistry and physics has increased by about 20 percentage points
        each between 2006 and 2012, though the numbers still fall slightly below the
        target of 65 percent. The 65 percent benchmark has been almost reached in
        chemistry (where currently 62 percent of teachers are qualified), though the
        gap is larger in mathematics (where still only 47 percent of teachers are
        qualified, which is still a significant improvement compared to 28 percent in
        2006).
(iii)   The student class ratio improved between 2006 and 2011 (from 83 to 73), and
        is more favorable than the target value of 92. Hence, while the PAD assumed
        student-class ratios would stabilize during the period of project
        implementation, they have in fact improved. Textbook/student ratios in Form 4
        is (1/1) in Mathematics, English and Physics in 2013.

3.5     Consequently, it was concluded that: (i) the PAD PDO targets were unrealistic
and unattainable; and (ii) none of the parameters in the PAD’s projection model is
clearly linked or directly associated to the implementation of the Project. The full
outcome of component one will not be seen until the students entering form one in
2014 take the CSEE in 2018. Similarly, it is anticipated that the full impact of inputs
related to quality will not be achieved until 2020.

 IV.  OUTPUTS AND RESULTS ACHIEVED (OUTCOMES):
(a) Overview:
(b) Status of Implementation by component:
Component 1: Increasing Enrollment through Provision Of Infrastructure:
4.3     By November 2013, construction of 19 new schools and rehabilitation of 6
schools was complete. Furniture and laboratory equipment were procured, delivered,
and installed. The overall output under this component is 342 classrooms with student
capacity of 13,680, 75 science laboratories, 28 computer labs, 27 libraries and 52 staff
houses.
4.4      Availability of adequate financial resources affected the implementation of
activities under this component. As a result, the scope of civil works had to be reduced.
All student hostels were removed. Teacher housing was reduced from 10 houses per
school to 3.
 4.6     Field visits revealed that the sustainability of the school facilities and their
potential impact could be undermined by the following factors:
 (i)    Absence of fences in all the newly constructed facilities exposing the school to
        vandalism and livestock grazing.
(ii)    Water shortages negatively impact staff and student attendance due to
        unsanitary conditions.
(iii)   The proper utilization of science laboratories, computer labs and libraries is
        undermined by the lack of lab technicians, ICT specialists and librarians. As a
        result, new resources remain unused.

Component 2: Improve Quality Of Education Through Teacher Training, Curriculum
             Reform And Provision Of Learning Materials

SUB-COMPONENT 2A: Teacher Training: The Department of Teacher Education
was responsible for implementing activities under this sub-component. These are:
4.7      In-service Upgrading for Secondary Science and Mathematics: The purpose
was to use in-service training to upgrade the skills of at least 500 non–degree science
and mathematics teachers, currently teaching maths and science in Form 1-2. The
course material was developed in a 5 day workshop in 2009. This was followed by the
training of trainers in February 2010.
4.8    The first cohort of training for 350 teachers was conducted in 2010. The
second cohort of training for 150 teachers was conducted in September 2013. Upon
completion of the training, assessment in the form of written exams and course work
was conducted, with mixed results: While some changes in teaching and use of
resources were observed, the written exam results were discouraging. The average of
each test group was 55-65%. A follow-up of a small number of trainers and teachers,
revealed that: (i) while training materials were in English, the course was mainly

                                                                                      41
conducted in Kiswahili due to low English language proficiency among trainers and
trainees; (ii) the targeted trainees were non-qualified teachers many of whom had
never taught science and math. Consequently, it was concluded that: (a) the duration
of the course was too short to upgrade the capacity of these teachers; (b) there is need
for sustained long term effort to address the English language deficiency of both
teachers and students in order to improve quality of education.
4.11 In-service upgrading for primary science and mathematics teachers: To
prepare for the imminent changes to the curriculum in upper primary schools, an in-
service upgrading course was designed for approximately 1,039 math and science
teachers in primary school in Standards 4 and higher (along with subject specialists
and head teachers).
4.12 By July 2013, a training of trainers was planned, designed, and conducted for
40 trainers. Teacher training began in February 2013. By July 1,466 science teachers
had participated in 18 six-hour days of in-service training; 573 math teachers had
participated in 10 six-hour days of training.
4.13 In January 2013, the initial estimate of 1,039 recipients was revised to 950 to
more conservatively reflect the number of qualifying teachers. However, the PMT
found additional teachers that would benefit from the program such as those teaching
math or science instead of the subject they are trained in, resulting in the number of
participants to match the original number.
4.14 According to the PAD, teachers were to participate in 40 days of content
training. Given the constrained timeline, in January 2013 it was proposed that in-
service training time could be replaced by peer learning and in-school discussion to be
facilitated by qualified supervisors. A curriculum and activities have been developed
and 100 supervisors were selected and trained to facilitate peer learning sessions.
However, no peer learning sessions have been conducted due to lack of funds for
transportation of facilitators and teachers to cluster sites.
4.17    In-service upgrading for primary teachers of English and communication:
This sub-component aimed at training approximately 2,000 Primary English teachers
in English and Communication, since in 2015 the new syllabus will take effect. In
standard 5-6, 5 subjects (math, science, geography, ICT and English will be taught in
English. The target group was teachers of math, science, English and humanities.
4.18 By November 2013, 2000 upper primary teachers had received upgrading
training in using English and Communication.
4.19 Trained teachers have been deployed ad-hoc and correctly deploying them is a
matter that has to be undertaken seriously by the Ministry. This requires collaboration
between all stakeholders including the TTC, and follow-up has to be strengthened.
4.20 While the English proficiency of approximately 40% of the target teachers is
considered good, the level of proficiency of the majority is very low. In light of this
and considering the arguments presented in the previous section, achieving the desired
outcome of this activity is unlikely
4.21   Capacity building for Head teachers, Inspectors & Subject Advisors: […]
4.22 A training manual was developed in collaboration with experienced staff from
the inspectorate and representatives from head teachers and the Zanzibar higher
education institutions. 500 copies of the manual were printed. Training of Trainers
(TOT) was conducted in Unguja and Pemba, attended by 18 school inspectors from

                                                                                     42
Unguja and 14 in Pemba. 442 head teachers, of which 84 were from private schools,
27 subject advisors and 9 TC coordinators were also trained on leadership to
supervise and support teachers.
4.23 Though follow-up was not part of the original plan in PAD, follow-up for 288
schools public and private schools was planned, of which 81% were conducted.
4.24 While the schools visited were responsive to the introduction of computers
many were not responding to other the training deliverables. The following challenges
were observed: inability to design a vision and mission for their schools; lack of
emphasis on pedagogical leadership, prioritizing child-centered methodologies; and
using proper teaching aids.
4.25 The provision of two buses for Pemba and Unguja and office equipment
(computers, photocopiers, stationery) to the department was crucial to the training and
the follow-up. This allows the department to reach, inspect and follow up with more
schools more frequently, which benefits the learning child and the community at large.
4.26 Revision of Pre-Service Primary Teacher (certificate) curriculum: This
activity aimed to revise the curriculum to ensure compatibility with the provisions of
Education Policy of 2006. Implementation was scheduled for 2010/2011but was
delayed due to recruitment issues. By July 2012 the new curriculum was complete and
is currently being used.
4.27 Interim upgrading of pre-service secondary teachers (diploma) curriculum in
science and mathematics: The sub-component was supposed to finance the
development of an addition to the secondary teacher education diploma and to prepare
teachers of science and mathematics to teach these subjects up to form 4.
4.28 While the activity outlined in 2.A.2 provides some training to current
secondary math and science teachers, it did not address teachers entering the system.
To address this gap, similar training was incorporated into the pre-service training and
provided to all teachers attending SUZA. 175 secondary schools teachers received
interim upgrading training
4.29 Management of Entrants to teacher training: To better understand the
characteristics, motivation, incentive receptiveness, capability, and needs of teacher
training entrants, the sub-component financed a study of the management of teacher
training.
4.36 The study made numerous recommendations. Key issues that require urgent
attention include:
(i)     provision of competent science teachers;
(ii)    provision of well-trained pre-primary teachers; (iii) addressing the shortage of
        teachers in Pemba;
(iii)   regular monitoring and evaluation of the interventions introduced in the
        system in order to ensure that the targeted impacts are achieved to ensure
        sustainability.
4.37 SUB- COMPONENT 2B: Provision of Instructional Materials in Key Subjects
for All Secondary Schools.
4.38 All text books, laboratory equipment and consumables were procured and
distributed to all schools, TTCs, TCs. By November 2013, a ratio of one new book


                                                                                     43
per student in each subject based on the previous year’s attendance data had been
attained.
4.39 Library equipment apparatus and consumables were procured and distributed
to TCs and secondary schools in Unguja and Pemba. This will enable teachers to
teach science subjects efficiently and provide an opportunity to students in conducting
practical exercises in relevant subjects.
4.40 The new text books and other learning material are expected to improve of
teaching-learning process in schools.
4.41 SUB-COMPONENT 2C: Revision of Primary Curriculum and Provision of
Appropriate Learning Material.
4.42 The shortening of the primary curriculum from seven years of schooling to six
years has been under consideration by the Government of Zanzibar since 2006. To
ensure the provision of quality primary education, the Zanzibar Institute of Education
prepared a revised primary curriculum in 2010. The process of facing out the old
primary curriculum was initiated in 2010-2011 academic year.
4.44 Provision was made under the project to procure books and distribute to each
primary school in a ratio of one textbook per pupil in the upper primary (standards 5-
6). It should be noted, however, that:
(i)     the target pupils (currently in standard 2) will enter Standard 5 in the year
        2014; one year after the project completion;
(ii)    Since the old primary education syllabus is being gradually phased out, it is
        imperative that the production of all new textbooks should be in conformity
        with the revised primary education curriculum;
(iii)   Primary 1 to 4 curriculums has no instructional package (teachers’ guide). This
        will deprive teachers of material essential for effective teaching in the learning
        process;
(iv)    Enhanced teacher ownership of the revised curriculum provision of textbooks
        and teacher guides is essential.
4.45 Considering the projected enrolment in 2011, it was estimated that 1,243,448
textbooks and 30,400 accompanying teachers’ guides would be required. The new
curriculum for Primary Education was prepared and officially used since 2010 in all
public schools. This is including the subject syllabi. The curriculum orientation
training to teachers, head teachers and inspections was conducted as follows:-

4.46 SUB-COMPONENT 2D: Support for science education for girls. For many
years girls’ performance in science and mathematics was poor compared to boys’. To


                                                                                       44
bridge the gap, a Science Camp program was initiated, which aimed to improve girls’
performance in science and mathematics at ordinary secondary and advance level.
4.47 Based on a collaborative planning process, the Science Camp program was
designed to benefit 100 girls annually, by changing their attitude toward science. The
camp was held only once in 2010. 450 students from 199 secondary schools
participated. Most participants were from Form 1 with some from Forms 2 and 3.
Science camp modules were printed. These modules will be used to train students
through school-based science camps.
4.50 The evaluation report showed that organized camps produced meaningful
results for participants. About 88 % of the campers passed their Form 2 national
examinations and were selected to join Form 3 in different secondary schools. Further
analysis indicated that campers’ performance in science subjects was slightly above
average in their respective schools. However, it was not clear whether their
performance is attributable to participation in the camp.
4.53 SUB COMPONENT 2E: Provision of life skills, including HIV/AIDS gender
and environmental education. The aim of this sub-component was strengthening
education for life skills in secondary schools and teachers colleges by 2013. The old
life skills manual was reviewed, revised, updated and 6000 copies were printed and
distributed to all secondary schools. Training on how to teach life skills through
integration in core subjects was conducted. About 500 Form I teachers from Unguja
and Pemba have been trained since 2009. In 2010 and 2011 600 form 2 teachers and
500 Form 3 teachers were trained.
4.54 During 2012/13 life skills peer education training was conducted for 450
student leaders in Unguja and Pemba (50 per each TC). The training strengthened
peer education programs in school health clubs. Life skills training was also provided
to 100 health club teachers to support school health clubs and develop their delivery
of extracurricular instructions.

V.     PROJECT DESIGN AND READINESS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
5.1     Thanks to previous experience in civil works projects, the Ministry already
had a core team of engineers and procurement specialists. These teams, whose
members were later seconded to the PMT, participated in the preparation and
appraisal of the project. As a result, the appraisal team ensured that the project is
commensurate with the Governments’ capacity to implement it by putting in place the
necessary implementation arrangements. This included proper procurement and
financial management as well as adequate supervision, monitoring and evaluation of
project activities.
5.2    At appraisal stage World Bank architect insisted on using cost estimations
from any recent construction. This was found to be unrealistic, given that at least two
years had elapsed since the design, costing and tendering of such structures. At the
tendering stage, therefore, it was noted that cost of civil work contracts had increased
by 100% due to delays in the design of the facilities and increased cost of construction
material and other necessary inputs. As a result, the PMT had to reduce the scope of
the civil works by cutting all hostels in district rural schools and reducing staff
housing from 10 to 2 in every school. The cost estimate of each school was, therefore,
reduced from the initial estimate TZS7-10 billion to TZS3-4 billion per school.


                                                                                    45
5.3    Procurement Arrangements: By November 2013, procurement of all goods
and services was completed. Procurement under the project was managed by the
Procurement Management Unit of the Ministry. Since the beginning of the project, the
following has been achieved: (i) in the procurement of goods, 43 contracts amounting
to US$ 10.4 million have been procured; (ii) in the procurement of consultant services,
23 contracts with a total of US$ 2.7 million have been procured; (iii) in the
procurement of works, 17 contracts for construction of Secondary Schools with a total
of USD 31.8 million have been procured. […] The overall assessment with regards to
procurement is Satisfactory.
5.6     Disbursement Arrangements: The table below presents the disbursement of
the credit by year and category of expenditure. In the absence of a project preparation
facility (PPF) all project preparatory activities including the establishment of the
Project Management Unit had to be initiated or carried out soon after the credit
became effective in January 2008. These activities included preparation of term of
references, recruitment of consultants, preparation of bidding documents, tendering of
bids, etc. While most of the procurement and civil works staff were in place, the
financial management staff were recruited in mid-2008. As a result there were no
meaningful disbursement during 2008-9. As shown in the table less than 0.5% or
$156,000 of the credit was disbursed in the first two years of project implementation.
5.8    In general, the disbursement of funds by the Bank and PMT to contractors and
consultants was found to be highly satisfactory. Initially the PMT noted that
contractors were accumulating payment requests. Upon recognition of this anomaly,
the PMT advised them to submit requests for payment on monthly basis. A number of
contracts interviewed by the consultant expressed their full satisfaction on the timely
reimbursement of funds which they found was more prompt compared to other donor
funded projects.

VI.        IMPLEMENTATION
6.1    Bank Borrower performance: The Bank undertook bi-annual field mission
with adequate skills mix. The mission always prepared a detailed aide memoire in
close collaboration of the PMT and Senior Ministry officials. The Aide Memoires
provided detailed assessment of progress to date and issues that would require
immediate remedial measures. It specifically included a section with agreed


                                                                                                   46
arrangement and completion schedule. This arrangement made it easier for the PMT
to obtain Government approval and support on any pending issue.
6.2     The presence of the Task Team Leader (TTL) in Dar also made it easier for
PMT to interact with and visit the Bank office in Dar in order to solve any immediate
bottlenecks. As a result the performance of the Bank and the Government was
generally found highly satisfactory.
6.3     This is attributed to: (a) government commitment to grant the education sector
priority in the allocation of both development and recurrent budget (20%); (b) Senior
Ministry Officials giving the project high visibility by organizing official opening
ceremonies spearhead by the President of Tanzania or Zanzibar; (ii) dedication on the
part of the project management team (PMT) to enhance implementation while
ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness; (iii) frequency of Bank supervision
missions which allowed the possibility of addressing implementation bottle necks on
time; and (iv) demonstrated responsiveness and flexibility by the Bank in addressing
issues that emerged during implementation; etc.
6.4     Adherence to Schedule: The project was supposed to be implemented in 65
months from the date of Credit effectiveness. Based on the credit disbursement data in
chapter V of the report less than 0.005% of the credit was disbursed in the first two
years of project implementation. In the absence of Project Preparation Advance (PPA),
the implementation of project activities had to be initiated from scratch. It appears that
the appraisal team did not fully appreciate the challenging task of establishing an
effective institutional arrangement or PMT to plan, manage and implement project
activities as proposed in the PAD.
6.5     Consultants and Contractor Performance: The project recruited 5 firms and 6
individual consultants to design/supervise civil works and prepare various studies
respectively. In addition it contracted 6 civil works and building contractors to
contract schools. At completion, with the exception of few hitches which were
immediately tackled by the Bank and the Government, overall, the performance of
most contractors and consultants were found generally satisfactory.
6.6    Environment Safeguards: […]
6.7    To ensure adherence to environmental guidelines, Bank mission included an
environmentalist and the PMT regularly monitored construction sites. As a result
there were no serious adverse environmental impacts that can be associated to the
implementation of the project. This includes involuntary resettlement of people.


VII.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1    The Bank intervention in the education sector in Zanzibar was highly relevant
and timely. It came at a time when the Government of Zanzibar introduced major
reforms in the Education Sector. In spite of project design flaws and by the sheer
commitment of the Government, close collaboration and team work among the PMT
and Bank project management team, all project activities were completed on schedule.
7.2      Though it is too early to assess outcomes/impact since most of the project
activities were just completed, the project is expected to increase access, considering
the significant increase of facilities “hardware” which was the main focus of the
project (70% of credit). With respect to improving quality “Software”, the project will
also achieve its target outputs. It is however, doubtful if the limited resources (30% of

                                                                                      47
the credit) allocated to this component will achieve the results proposed in the PDO.
This is primarily due to: (a) lack of appreciation at appraisal of the magnitude of the
tasks ahead; (b) use of unreliable data which resulted overestimation of expected
outcomes in the short run.
7.3    To enhance outcome in the medium term and impact in the long-term, the
Government included in the Zanzibar Education Development Plan (ZEDP) Action
Plan 2012/13 – 2015/16 measures that are aimed to address the issues and
shortcoming highlighted in this report. These measures include:
(i)     Budget Allocation: Government plans to sustain the political commitment and
        priority granted to the education sector in the allocation of annual budget. In
        the past 5 years approximately 5% of GDP and 20% of annual recurrent
        budget were allocated to the Education Sector.
(ii)    Institutionalization of Activities: Project activities were built and integrated
        into the Ministry’s core work plan and program and effectively decentralized
        to respective departments. This implies that, though the project
        implementation is completed, each department will continue to carry on
        implementing these activities;
(iii)   Education Sector Donor Support Group: ZEDP Action Plan 2012/13 –
        2015/16 identifies key strategies to address both quality and access issues.
        Development partners such as the African Development Bank (AfDB), Global
        Partnership for Education (GPE), Swedish International Development Agency
        (SIDA), UNESCO, UNICEF, World Bank, Government of Oman, etc. have
        made commitment to support the implementation of the Plan;
7.4     Finally, the following lesson could be drawn from the implementation of this
project:
(a)     Adherence to Project Cycle; there are no short cuts in the design of a
        development projects. The Project Cycle should be followed methodically to
        ensure that quality of project design is not compromised;
(b)     Institutions Culture Matters. In spite of major design weakness such as cost
        under estimation, inflated PDO targets, absence of Project Preparation
        Advance (PPA) the project was implemented on schedule and has met all its
        target deliverables. This could be attributed to some of the following factors:
        •    Importance of institutional memory: Following credit approval the
             Ministry was restructured and senior management staff were rotated. In
             order to sustain institutional memory and secure smooth implementation,
             the MoEVT opted to maintain the Project Coordinator and rest of PMT
             as appraised;
        •    Delegation of authority, close collaboration, team work which are
             imbedded in the MoEVT institutional culture appear to have played a
             significant role in the satisfactory implementation of the project;
        •    Building synergy: It appears that in spite of the high turnover of Bank
             project management staff particularly the Task Team Leader and the
             Procurement Specialist, their close working relationship with the PMT
             created a conducive environment for the implementation of project
             activities.
