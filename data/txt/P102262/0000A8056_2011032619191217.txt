                                                                                                                                                                                                  Page 3 of 4
                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                       Report No: ISR2917



                         (a) Prudent measures need to be exercised during construction in order to keep costs under control and achieve the education access objectives of the project. For close monitoring
                         of the procurement and execution of works, meetings between MoEVT and the World Bank will be held monthly.

                         (b)The mission provided advice for ensuring that the textbooks policy adequately cover important areas such as textbook development, standards, cost and financing, care for
                         textbooks, and fostering the development of the Zanzibari publishing industry. Refining the policy accordingly would also ensure consistency with the World Bank's policy on
                         textbooks and reading materials. The final policy document will be discussed and agreed with the Ministry prior to submission to the Bank.

                         (c) The mission is concerned by the weak capacity in the EMIS unit for data retrieval and analysis. While the Ministry provided the key figures on project indicators as requested, they
                         were unable to provide analysis on completion, transition, and survival rates and trends as had been agreed. It has been agreed that the MoEVT will engage a senior consultant to
                         provide the needed technical support to the EMIS team and to analyze available data to provide trends for these key indicators by March end, 2011. Such analysis will be crucial in
                         preparation for the mid-term review of the operation planned in late April/ early May 2011.
