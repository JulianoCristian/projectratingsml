The original project design\n            included three Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            Indicators and ten intermediate outcome indicators to\n            monitor progress towards the PDO. Overall, the PDO remains\n            valid/ relevant and continues to be achievable, even though\n            a modest extension of project closing date will be needed to\n            complete all outstanding activities The modifications for\n            this project restructuring are: (i) to allocate unallocated\n            amount and reallocate savings across categories to finance\n            critical activities that are in need of additional\n            resources; (ii) to change PDO indicators target values;\n            (iii) to add a new PDO indicator; and (iv) to extend the\n            project closing date by four months. The changes will not\n            affect the formulation of the PDO. They will help to\n            consolidate and strengthen various on-going activities\n            across components and categories, complete all planned\n            activities across components and categories before closing,\n            and meet the PDO as measured by related outcome indicators."}, "docdt": "2013-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
