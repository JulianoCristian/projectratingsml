MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ALBANIA
FOR A DURRES WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Albania for SDR 8.4 million (US$11.6 aiillion equivalent), on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity, to assist in the rehabilitation and repair of water aud sewerage systems
in the Durres District and to assist in the strengthening of the institutions responsible for operating
the systems.
2.    Background. Statistically, the population of Albania appears to be well served with water
but lacking in adequate sewerage service, but in fact both water supply and sewerage service are
deficient. About 80% of the population has access to a piped water connection; hlcwever, the level
of service is poor. Every system is subject to shortages, most as a result of leakage and waste.
Customer metering is widespread; however, most of the meters are broken and those that work are
not read. As a result, the amount of the leakage and wastage can only be estimated. Because
customers are billed at a flat rate, they have no incentive to conserve water, Only 35% of the
population has access to water-borne sewerage, and there are no sewage treatment plants. The
situation has developed as a result of inadequate maintenance and under-investment.
3.    There are 250 water works and 75 sewerage works in Albania. All of the sewerage works
and six of the water works are under the jursdiction of the Ministry of Construction, Housing and
Territory Adjustment (MOC). Although the remainder of the water works futction as departments
of counties, municipalities, towns and villages, they still have little autonomy except for operation
and maintenance. Water tariffs are subject to a price cap set uniformly for every water works by
the Council of Ministers without regard to cost differentials between areas or the achievement of any
particular level of cost recovery. The provision of water service was seen in the past as part of the
package of social benefits made available to the people by the central government. The low cost
borne by consumers for these and other social services partly justified the relatively low salaries paid
to workers. Even now, most consumers' salaries are litde more than $24/month. Similarly,
sewerage service, where provided, is paid from the national budget and is free. The MOC sets the
priorities and allocates funds for all investment. The result has been lack of commitment by local
authorities, deferred maintenance and under investment. The MOC would like to give local
jurisdictions more responsibility for investment decisions and financing, but so far has neither the
authority nor a plan for making the change. The present challenge for Albania is to set up a systun
of cost recovery to ensure adequate funds for operation and maintenance and evenually expansion
of water supply systems and to improve its sector institutions so that the funds that are available are
invested wisely. The situation is fairly unique because of the low level of purchasing power in
Albania compared with the standard of service that can be provided by the water systems in place
(i.e. running water delivered to housing units). In other countries with similar income levels, hand
carried water is often the only possibility. Clearly, a transition path in cost recovery is required in
this sector as in many other parts of the economy.
4.    The Government of Albania's (GOA) priority areas for improving water and sewerage
services are the Tirana District which includes the City of Tirana, Albania's capital and largest city,



and the Durres District which includes Durres City, Albania's second largest city and its main port.
The priority of these areas is based on their economic importance and the size of the beneficiary
population. The combined population of both districts is 600,000 (19% of Albania's total
population). The GOA has asked the Italian Government to assist the Tirana District and has asked
IDA to assist the Durres District. The German Government is assisting the Districts of Kavaja,
Kukes and Korcha and the town of Kruya with water improvements.
5.    Bank/lDA Water and Sewerage Sector Experience. The proposed Credit would be the
Association's first operation in the sector in Albania. Therefore, the relevant experience is the
Bank/IDA general experience in the sector including that recently reported by the Bank's Operations
Evaluation Department.-  This experience has been significant.  As of December 31, 1993,
Bank/IDA lending to the water supply and sewerage sector totaled $11 billion for 277 projects. Most
of these projects were successful in meeting their physical objectives and in achieving least-cost
solutions; however, success in achieving strong and fmancial viable institutions and pOverty relief,
key Bank/Association sector objectives, has been limited. In the few cases where physical objectives
were not met, it was mostly due to cost overruns which required some project components to be
dropped. Cost overruns were rarely the result of poor cost estimating but more often the result of
inflation and delays in construction. Vhere components were dropped, it was usually the sanitation
and pollution control components. Independent, strong and financially viable institutions have been
achieved only in projects which had the full commitment of the borrower and substantial resources
for training and technical assistance. Reasons for failure have been: (i) lack of clear sector policies;
(ii) lack of management and financial autonomy at the utility level; (iii) high staff turnover; and (iv)
staff inexperience. Few Bank/IDA projects are able to demonstrate success in meeting the needs of
the poor. This does not necessarily mean that they did not. The main problem has been the lack
of detailed data on the numbers of poor households and their location, and when success is achieved,
there is not always a means of measuring it. The Project has been designed taking account of the
experience described above.
6.    Project Objectives. The Project's main objectives would be to eliminate water shortages and
associated health risks to the existing population in the project area and to establish a strong local
institutional framework for the provision of water supply and sewerage services so that the
improvements will be sustainable.
7.    Project Description. The project area encompasses the District of Durres. One water system
operated by the Durres District Water Works (DDWW) serves 91 percent of the population in the
District. There are three water borne sewerage systems operated by two independent Sewerage
Works that serve 48 percent of the population: the Durres City Sewerage Works (DCSW) (for
Durres City, Durres Beach and Shkozet) and the Shijak Sewerage Works (SSW) (for Shijak). The
total permanent population served with piped water by the DDWW, including the District of Kavaja
which the DDWW supplies water to in bulk, is 200,000. During the summer, the population served
reaches 300,000 with the arrival of weekend visitors to Durres Beach. The permanent population
connected to the three sewerage systems is about 100,000.

8.    The situation in the Durres District is typical of the situation with water systems throughout
the country. Water is available in the early morning for 2 hours and for 1-1/2 hours in the
afternoon. The supply capacity is insufficient for the demard anti the pipes are undersized and ieak.
The plumbmg in public buildings and flats is poorly maintained and is a source of significant water
loss. Many flats have storage tanlks which are allowed to overflow when filled. Most of the meters
are broken and those that work are not read. The poor condition of the water system causes
inconvenience, economic loss and risk to public health. Negative pressures in the distribution
network allow untreated ground water, and possibly sewage, to enter the system and to contaminate
the supply, which at the source is of good quality. In the past ten years, four typhoid epidemics in
Durres have been traced to contamination of the water supply.
9.    The proposed Project would comprise rehabilitation and repair works and technical assistance
for institutional strengthening. The main components are: (a) rehabilitation of water supply and
sewerage pumping stations; (b) limited expansion of well field production capacity; (c) water main
rehabilitation and repair; (d) le?k repair; (e) critical sewer repairs; (f) customer education on water
conservation and plumbing fixture repair; (g) master metering; (h) metering of consumers; (i)
provision of operation and maintenance equipment to the operating agencies in the project area; (j)
provision of TA for institutional strengthening of the DDWW; and (k) provision of TA for the
merging of the DCSW and SSW to form the Durres District Sewerage Works (DDSW) and for the
institutional strengthening of the DDSW.
10.   Project Implementation. The Project was prepared and would be implemented by a Project
Implementation Unit, now a division of the DDWW, with oversight by a Project Coordinator in the
MOC. Foreign consultants assisted by three local institutes have been engaged to prepare fial
designs and bidding documents. A feasibility study prepared by the same consultants i3 completed.
A PPF advance and a METAP grant were used to finance the feasibility study. The remainder of
the PPF is being used to fiance the preparatirn of final designs and bidding documents.
Construction supervision would be financed from the IDA Credit.
11.   Environmental Aspects. The Project would have a positive impact on the environment.
Water pipes would be either ductile iron, steel or plastic. No asbestos cement pipe would be used.
Sewerage from the three sewerage systems is discharged without treatment to a surface drainage
canal which flows to the Adriatic Sea several kilometers north of Durres Beach so that the Beach
swimming area is protected from pollution, parfially by distance and partially by natural treatment
in the canal. Whereas the Project would increase the volume of sewerage discharged, the total solids
and BOD loading would increase only slightly. Resources are sufficient to address only a small part
of the sewerage needs in the project area and the first priority and the focus of the Project would be
to undertake urgent repairs to the collection systems in order to provide the greatest health protection
to the population served. The next phase of investments should concentrate on expanding the
collection systems in developed areas with overloaded septic systems and to providing a minimum
level of treatment--screening and grit removal.
12.   Whereas at present, no sewage treatment is provided by the municipalities and industries in
the District, there is no danger from hazardous wastes. There is a minor potential for pollution of
the Durres Beach swimming area from the overflow of a non-functioning pumping station in Durres
City; however, this station would be made operational by the Project. Most of the pollution loading
comes from domestic sources even though 40 percent of the water use is by industry and commercial



- 4 -
establishments. Industrial water use is mostly for cooling, food processing or sanitary purposes.
There are only three factories served by the DDWW water system that have a potential for the
production of hazardous pollutants. These are a plastic factory, a chemical products factory and a
pesticide factory. None of them discharge to any of the three municipal systems and only the plastic
fact try is currently operating.
13.   The project environmental classification is B. Therefore, a formal environmental assessment
was not made.
14.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. Inadequate water supply and sewerage service, especially
in urban areas, is a risk to public health. an impediment to economic growth and a source of great
hardship on the population. Whereas the needs of the sector are great, the resources are limited.
Short term improvements will only come about if better use is made of existing resources through
good management, efficient operation and effective maintenance. Long term improvements will
require institutional and policy changes at the national level. By its presence, the Bank can promote
policy changes and ensure that tire limited resources are utilized in the most efficient manner. The
District of Durres, an economically important area where the situation is particularly bad, is a good
starting place for IDA to demonstrate what is possible w h limited resources. It is also a logical
choice in view of the fact that the water system problems in Tirana District are being addressed by
the Italian Government.
15.   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Albania was discussed by the Board on
September 14, 1993 and the Durres Water Supply Rehabilitation Project was specifically mentioned
in the CAS. The Project is linked to the CAS emphasis on the rehabilitation of Albania's dilapidated
public infrastructure which at present is a deterrent to foreign investment and growth of the private
sector. The Project also addresses poverty alleviation and environmental improvement, areas of
special emphasis under the CAS.
16.   Agreements Reached. Agreement was reached on the following during negotiations:
a.    on an institutional strengthening Action Plan for the restructuring and strengthening
of DDWW;
b.    on the establishment of DDSW as a new state enterprise no later than December 31,
1994 and on an Action Plan for its strengthening;
c.    that GOA would provide as a grant funds for the sewerage component of the Project,
including amounts allocated from the Credit;
d.    that GOA would provide to DDWW  a $4.0 million credit for investment in the
Project under the same financial terms as the funds it will provide from the IDA
Credit;
e.    that GOA would reimburse DDWW  in the form of an equity contribution for
expenditures on customs duties and taxes;
f.    on the indexing of water tariffs to the cost of salaries and electricity;



-5 -
g.    on the exemption of for DDWW from any price cap on tariffs;
h.    on a $50,000 annual limit on DDWW's expenditures on investments other than the
Project;
i.    that DDWW would receive either from the Kavaja District Water Works or GOA the
marginal cost of the water it supplies Kavaja from Junte 30, 1994 onwards;
j.    that DDWW  would control their costs and maintain their tariffs such that their
working ratio is no more than 60% in 1994 and 55% thereafter;
k.    on reporting requirements during project implementation; and
1.    on (i) the selection of consultants satisfactory to the Association for the provision of
TA (ii) the execution of a subsidiary loan agreement by DDWW with GOA
satisfactory to the Association for the onlending of the IDA Credit, (iii) the staffmg
of the PIU, (iv) the preparation of a project implementation manual, and (v) the
establishment of project accounts as conditions of Credit effectiveness.
17.   Benefits. The main benefits of the Project would be: (a) a safe and dependable water supply
for a population of 200,000 with attendant health benefits; (b) more reliaole sewerage service for a
population of 100,000; and (c) the elimination of an undependable water supply as a major constraint
to economic development in the project area.
18.   Project Sustainability. Making the Project sustainable will require institutional changes at
both the local and national levels. The Project would address the local changes by supporting Action
Plans for institutional strengthening. The Action Plans would combine the two existing sewerage
agencies to form a new district sewerage enterprise, DDSW, and restructure DDWW and DDSW
following corporate models and with technical assistance make both organizations operationally
strong and managerially autonomous. Changes in national tariff po!icy proposed during project
preparation would contribute to financial sustainability by ensuring that DDWW recovers from
tariffs its full operation and maintenance costs and starts making contributions to its investments.
During negotiations, the GOA agreed to the most important national policy change for the finncial
sustainability of the Project, removal of a uniform cap on the price of water (para 13). The
introduction of sewerage tariffs would be reviewed as part of a proposed sector strategy study.
19. Risks. There are three significant risks to successfiul inplementation of the Project. The first
is that the rehabilitation measures to be undertaken will not reduce the water losses enough to
significantly improve water service in the project area as has happened in similar projects in other
countries. To maximize the chances for success, the borrower has engaged a firm with demonstrated
success in similar situations to prepare and supervise implementation of the Project and has given
particular importance to the design of the water loss reduction and demand management components
of the Project. The second risk is that the weakness of the existing institutions will result in delays
in implementation. The presence of the same consultants should minimize this risk too. The third
risk is financial. It is possible that DDWW will not raise sufficient cash to fund the local share of
the project cost. Close monitoring by the Association by frequent missions and quarterly reporting



- 6 -
to the Association by DDWW on the status of their fuiances should enable any shortfall to be
identified quickly so that remedial action can be taken.
20.   Recomnendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
