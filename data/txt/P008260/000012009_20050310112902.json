In relation\n            to the Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation (WSUR) Project,\n            the audit fully concurs with satisfactory project outcomes,\n            likely sustainability, modest institutional development\n            impacts, and satisfactory performances. Three main lessons\n            address the following: 1) The importance for project\n            flexibility during implementation increases, particularly\n            under difficult situations. The primary focus of these two\n            projects on physical rehabilitation was appropriate, given\n            the government's concern with political reform and\n            civil unrest. It also provided time to nurture on\n            institutional reform agenda and build borrower buy-ins. This\n            subsequently made it possible to help the government cope\n            with ongoing urgent issues resulting from the 1999 crisis\n            caused by the influx of refugees from Kosovo. 2) Sequencing\n            of demanding reform activities and major rehabilitation\n            efforts, as well as the timeframe for their implementation,\n            need to be adequately analyzed to take full account of\n            practical priorities, and the available implementation\n            capacity. 3) The early establishment of a benchmark system\n            is important to facilitate appropriate monitoring of\n            progress and evaluation of impact of activities."}, "docdt": "2005-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
