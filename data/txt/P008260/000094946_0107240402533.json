The significant lessons learned during this\n            project include: 1) During the preparation stage, the\n            project suffered from a failure to identify key weaknesses\n            of the sector and to act decisively to overcome them. 2) It\n            was not possible and unrealistic to expect the Government to\n            support substantial institutional changes in one water\n            enterprise without linking it to broader sector reforms to\n            address the fundamental imbalances in the sector. 3)\n            Politicization of tariff liberalization, staff recruitment,\n            and other administrative and financial matters undermined\n            the potential for reform in the water and sewage sector and\n            diminished improvements in service delivery. 4) The\n            commercial and financial autonomy of the Durres District\n            Water Works (DDWW) was essential to reduce political\n            interference in the day-to-day management and to achieve the\n            financial objectives for DDWW. 5) Local government\n            participation in the project preparation and implementation\n            was essential to establish ownership and commitment. 6)\n            Frequent changes of the Ministers of the Ministry of Public\n            Works and of the General Managers of the Water and Sewerage\n            Directory had a very negative impact on continuity,\n            commitment, and meeting development objectives. 7)\n            Implementation of technical assistance for institutional\n            improvements at the outset was critical for achieving the\n            project objectives."}, "docdt": "2001-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
