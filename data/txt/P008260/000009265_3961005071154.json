existing\n            population in the project area and to establish a strong\n            local institutional framework for the provision of water\n            supply and sewerage services so that the improvements will\n            be sustainable. The project will rehabilitate poorly\n            maintained water supply and sewerage systems in Durres\n            District which includes Durres City, Albania's second\n            largest city and its main port, and strengthen local\n            institutions. The main project investment components are\n            water distribution network rehabilitation, pumping station\n            rehabilitation, well field rehabilitation, a water loss\n            reduction and demand management program, and critical\n            repairs to sewerage collection systems in Durres City and\n            Shijak. The core program objective categories for Albania\n            are poverty and the environment. The project will help\n            alleviate poverty by making reliable water service available\n            at affordable prices to the urban poor in the project area.\n            The project will also address environmental concerns by\n            improving sewerage collection systems in two urban areas and\n            implementing water pricing policies that reflect real costs."}, "docdt": "1994-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
