MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
1.       I submit for approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for US$73.0 million
equivalent. This sector investment loan (SIL) would support Jordan's human
resources development strategy by improving the quality of its basic and
secondary education system. The loan would be repayable in 17 years with 5
years grace and would bear the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The
operation would be cofinanced by the Japan OECF and UK ODA.
2.       Background. Lacking natural endowments, relying on imports for most
of its food and raw materials, and faced with one of the world's highest rates
of population growth (3.82 a year), Jordan has in the past depended heavily on
jobs obtained by Jordanians elsewhere in the Middle East region to maintain
external balances, limit domestic unemployment and fuel GDP growth. In recent
years, however, stagnant or falling oil prices, increased competition from
lower priced Asian labor and rising domestic skill levtels in neighboring
countries have reduced Jordan's penetration of regional labor markets, leading
to substantial reductions in remittances from abroad and increases in
unemployment at home. A recent Bank staff review of the Jordanian economy has
identified a strategy for expanding Jordan's human capital earnings and
employment based on, inter alia, lowering the international price of Jordanian
labor through the adoption of a competitive exchange rate and other macro
policies, and enhancing the quality, flexibility and hence the employability
of Jordan's human resource base through comprehensive upgrading of the
education system. The 23f depreciation of the Jordanian dinar in real terms
vis-a-vis the US dollar in 1988, together with the C-overnment's ongoing
adjustment program (supported by the Bank's proposed industry and trade
adjustment loan and the IMF's standby arrangement), is helping to reduce the
price of labor; quality enhancement is the subject of the proposed Human
Resources Development SIL.
3.       The need for a fundamental restructuring of the general education
system had already been foreseen by the Jordanian Government, which had
convened a National Conference on Educational Development in September 1987,
as part of a wider macroeconomic strategy to reduce Jordan's dependence on
external labor markets and promote the export of high value-added goods and
services. The principal conclusion of the conference was that the rapid
quantitative growth of the system--universal basic education (Grades 1-9) and
a 652 enrollment rate in secondary education (Grades 10-12)-had entailed
serious qualitative costs. Curricula and textbooks were outdated in terms of
both pedagogy and subject matter; teachers were under-qualified; and physical
facilities (with accommodation of 50% of basic education enrollments in rented
classrooms) were substandard and not conducive to learning. Following the
conference. the Government formulated an education reform strategy to be



- 2 -
implen-ited over a ten-year period (1989-98) in three phases. The proposed
SIL would finance the first phase (1989-92) of the reform program and would
represent a continuation of Bank lending to the sector, which has comprised
eight education/manpower projects since 1972.
4.       ProJect Obiectives. Th2 SIL would support policy and institutional
reforms designed to give Jordan the skill- and knowledge-intensive manpower
base it needs. More specifically, the reform and the SIL would help enhance
student achievement by (i) restructuring the school system and improving the
quality of teaching and learning; (ii) developing an iL.stitutional structure
responsive to the system's long-term qualitative and quantitative needs; and
(iii) developing the system's capacity to evaluate the reform program and
sustain it on a self-renewing basis.
5.       Projeet Description. The proposed operation would cover 7 national
programs and 34 subprojects in curriculum reform, textbook development,
teacher and supervisory staff upgrading, education technology, improvement of
school facilities, vocational training and education research and
development. The Bank has appraised the national programs. Subprojects would
be prepared by the beneficiary institutions and appraised and approved by an
intermediary institution, the Higher Council for Science and Technology. The
Intermediary would be responsible for overall coordination, supervision, and
financial management. Program components would include: (i) developing and
introducing into schools new curricula and textbooks for six basic education
subjects; (ii) setting up a Textbook Publishing Unit to institutionalize
textbook development, testing and revision, and an improved storage and
distribution system; (iii) upgrading, through university-level certification
programs, the academic qualifications of about 4,000 basic education teachers,
1,500 secondary teachers and 360 principals/supervisors; (iv) providing
in-service training on reform innovations for about 12,000 basic education
teachers, 4,800 principals and supervisors, and 750 support staff; (v)
instituting a new university-based BA program for pre-service training of
basic education teachers (to provide an additional 2,000 teachers a year);
(vi) starting construction of 180 new schools, 90 of which would be completed
during Phase I to accommodate about 52,000 students (representing about 3it of
those who are currently in rented facilities) and to create about 36,000 nLw
student places (representing about 25% of the natural enrollment increase);
and providing libraries, labs and workshops in the new schools as well as in
about 180 existing schools; (vii) expanding vocational training capacity at
existing and new training centers, to take account of the increased demand
resulting from secondary school curriculum restructuring and anticipated
market needs; and (viii) establishing a National Center f. r Educational
Research and Development to institutionalize policy-based research and
development, together with the capacity to evaluate and help sustain ongoing
innovation in education.
6.       Project Coss and Financing. The proposed US$73.0 million loan would
finance 29S of the four-year investment program for the first phase of the
reform. Total Phase I cost is estimated at US$252.5 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$104.1 million (41S). Cofinancing in the
amount of US$1.4 million equivalent will be provided by the UK ODA. The
Japanese Government is considering cofinancing in an equivalent amount to the
Bank loan, i.e., US$73.0 million. Although no final response has been
received, Japan is expected to provide this amount. An observer from the
Japan OECF participated in the Bank's appraisal mission and we expect the OECF
appraisal to take place shortly. The signing of the loan agreement between



-3-
OECF and the Borrower is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank's loan
agreement. Should the amount of the OECF loan be less than the amount applied
for, the school construction under the program will be adjusted in light of
the financing available. The program's costs and financing plan are in
Schedule A; amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are in
Schedule B. Key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Jordan are in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff
*      Appraisal Report No. 7641-JO, of May 22, 1989 is also attached.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank suppor's the Government's
emphasis on human resources development as a key determinant of Jordan's
long-run economic growth. The Government's overall strategy in this area
focuses on providing new oppor'-mities for employment growth by enhancing both
the quality of Jordan's labor sipply (and hence increasing its penetration of
the higher-skill portion of the external labor market) and the quantity and
quality of skilled labor demand in the domestic economy. The education reform
thus dovetails with the Government's ongoing adjustment efforts and the
proposed Bank industry and trade adjustment loan. In addition to education
system reform, the Bank is providing support to current efforts to enhance
Jordan's scientific/technological capacity-efforts designed to help make
Jordan a skilled human resources entrepot, along the lines of Singapore and
Hong Kong--through a science and technology sector study which is likely to
lead to a lending operation. In the case of education reform, the Bink has
helped the Government to translate broad reform goals into a detailed ten-year
implementation plan. The continuation of this involvement both financially
and through technical advice is important for effective implementation of the
reform program.
8.       AgTeed Actions. The Government has provided a Sector Development
Policy Statement and an Action Program specifying key activities with respect
to policy measures, institutional development and qualitative improvements,
together with target dates and performance indicators. To support
pre-effectiveness preparation activities, up to US$3.0 million equivalent in
retroactive financing will be provided against eligible expenditures for civil
works and technical assistance. The Government has agreed to: (i) joint
monitoring by the Government and the Bank of Action Program targets through
semi-annual reports, annual review meetings and a mid-term review; (ii)
submit, for the Bank's approval, appraisal reports prepared by the
Intermediary agency on all subprojects to be implemented during the 12-month
period following the date of loan effectiveness, and thereafter to submit
appraisal reports on subprojects selected by the Bank for review; and (iii)
implement, starting in March 1990, the recommendations of a study of
opportunities for further cost savings and cost reductions in the education
system. In the event of a shortfall in OECF cofinancing (para 6), or in
domestic counterpart funds, the Government has agreed to reduce total program
costs by extending the implementation period of the school construction
program to cover the amount of the shortfall. In any event, the Government
will maintain all other activities of the reform program intact. A condition
of effectiveness of the Bank loan would be the signing by the Government of
the cofinanciers' (ODA and OECF) loan agreements.
9.       Benefits. The prime benefit of the project would be the upgrading of
Jordan's human resources base into an increasingly knowledge-intensive,
skills-adaptable work force, capable of responding flexibly to changing



-4-
employment opportunities aud needs.  This I. turn would give Jordan the
manpower it needs to promote high value-added, technology-based,
export-oriented manufacturing and service activities, as well as helping to
revive Jordan's competitiveness as a regionwide source of skilled labor.
Specific benefits would include the following: basic education quality would
be strengthened, spe:ialization at the secondary level enhanced, and
technical/vocational education made more relevant to modern technology and
market r.eeds; teacher quality would be upgraded, and other educational
inputs/resources would be substantially improved and used more
cost-effectively. The capacity of the education system would be qualitatively
enriched and the basis would be laid for long-term, ongoing reform through the
1990s and beyond. The delegation of subproject appraisal and supervision
responsibility to the Government would help enhance its planning and
management capacity and support the application of objective criteria to other
investments in the sector.
10.      Risks. The operation has two potential risks.  The first concerns
external and domestic financing. Should OECF cofinancing not materialize in
the full amount (paras 6 and 8) or should domestic financial constraints
reduce the amount of counterpart funding availabl;. to the operation, the
Government has agreed to reduce total program costs by extending the
implementation period of the school construction program to cover the amount
of the shortfall. The second risk concerns the capacity to implement a sector
operation. The complexity of the program and the large number of subprojects
(over 30), many of which are interlinked within and across program components,
could overstretch the Government's implementation capacity. This risk is
mitigated by the following factors: the beneficiary institutions and the
Intermediary have been instrumental in planning and designing the reform and
its components (and are therefore fully knowledgeable about its objectives and
implementation requirements); the SIL incorporates a large technical
assistance component (about 107 manyears of in-country training and overseas
fellowships and 30 manyears of specialist services, a portion of which has
already started) to supplement indigenous technical and managerial capacity;
the program is incremental and can be adjusted over time to take account of
implementation delays; and there are extensive built-in opportunities for
Government/Bank reviews of progress against the detailed targets and
performance indicators set forth in the mutually agreed Action Program.
11.      Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
