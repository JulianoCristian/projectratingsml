    Report (ICR) for the Human Resources Development Sector\n            Investment Loan (HRDSIL I ) to Jordan. The development\n            objectives selected for the project were: (i) to raise the\n            quality of basic and secondary education and to enhance\n            student achievement levels; (ii) to use sector resources\n            more efficiently; and  (iii) to develop institutional\n            structures that would be responsive to the system's\n            qualitative and quantitative needs over the long term. The\n            key lessons to be learned from this project were: (a)\n            education reform programs require a long-term strategy,\n            continuing consensus among different stakeholders and\n            government ownership; (b) technical institutions have a\n            great potential to impact implementation; (c) fundamental\n            policy change requires greater effort at consensus building\n            which cannot be assumed a priori; (d) project implementation\n            should respect technical standards; and (e) lending\n            instruments must match objectives."}, "docdt": "1997-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
