operational improvements. Because several agencies will be\n            involved in project implementation, the project will require\n            close cooperation among those agencies. This should be\n            facilitated by the establishment of a Project Steering\n            Committee. There will also be a certain risk in the ability\n            of ASWC to attract and retain competent management, but this\n            should be reduced by the promulgation of new job\n            classifications and salary structures proposed under the project."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
