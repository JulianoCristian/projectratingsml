{"cdata!": "Specifically, the proposed project would\n            help:  (i) ensure efficient operation of existing terminals\n            in the industrial port of Lazaro Cardenas; (ii) strengthen\n            the administration and finances of the industrial port; and\n            (iii) improve access to, and increase the utilization of\n            industrial port installations.  The project would also; (iv)\n            provide effective pollution and flood control in the port\n            area; and (v) maintain a dialogue on remaining institutional\n            and related policy issues affecting the performance of the\n            port subsector.  To achieve these objectives, the project\n            includes:  (a) construction of roads, rail installations and\n            provision of maritime access to industries, facilities and\n            services; (b) acquisition of general cargo handling\n            equipment; and (c) installation of sewerage treatment\n            systems for effluents; and (d) provision of equipment and\n            shops for solid waste management. Furthermore, the project\n            involves; (e) land preparation and services for small- and\n            medium-sized industries; (f) provision of flood protection\n            works; and (g) consulting services and training."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
