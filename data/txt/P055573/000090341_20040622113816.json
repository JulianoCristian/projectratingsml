satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that Project\n            Implementation Units (PIUs) create structures parallel to\n            those of the government and distort local pay scales. In the\n            absence of clear central government commitment to replace\n            Bank funds with its own, or the ability of the Fund to\n            mobilize funds from international or Georgian donors, the\n            Fund is likely to dissolve, and the focus it brings to\n            preserving cultural heritage lost. Although scope exists for\n            raising funds through entrance fees and through\n            contributions of private benefactors, in all countries much\n            of the funding for the preservation of cultural heritage\n            comes from the government. The Emergency Rehabilitation\n            Program proved to be a highly popular approach for\n            preserving cultural heritage, and helped to focus the\n            nation's attention on both the richness of\n            Georgia's legacy and on the need to protect it. People\n            whose homes were in poor condition but were not eligible for\n            a grant under the Neighborhood Fund Program had difficulty\n            understanding why they did not also deserve support. As in\n            cities around the world, the investments in Old Town,\n            Tbilisi have attracted substantial private investment to\n            upgrade historic buildings and to operate shops, cafes,\n            restaurants, hotels, and other businesses. Although the\n            project included substantial resources for monitoring and\n            evaluation, performance indicators were poorly specified,\n            and plans for monitoring them could not be implemented."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
