There are two\n            components. The investment component sets up an emergency\n            rehabilitation fund that 1) responds to project proposals\n            submitted by outside organizations and community groups to\n            finance urgent repairs at priority cultural heritage sites,\n            important cultural activities, and artifacts at serious\n            risk; and 2) finances four cultural heritage pilot sites for\n            historic renovation and related activities. The technical\n            assistance component 1) strengthens and supports the\n            cultural heritage project implementation unit (PIU) in\n            project management, finance and administration, procurement,\n            monitoring and evaluation, engineering, and other\n            specializations; 2) provides training and study tours for\n            the PIU, other heritage agencies and institutions, municipal\n            government, and community groups involved in the project; 3)\n            supports a program of public information, education, and\n            communication activities related to cultural heritage\n            including seminars, a newsletter, arts and music\n            competitions, and oral histories; 4) formulates a blueprint\n            to develop cultural heritage zones; and 5) develops a\n            management and evaluation system to monitor project impacts\n            and performance, which includes technical and financial\n            audits, beneficiary assessments, Bank supervision, and\n            independent reporting."}, "docdt": "1998-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
