The\n            free limit above which Bank approval of a project is\n            required, would be maintained at $200,000. The aggregate\n            free limit would be $2.5 million. The debt limit as defined\n            in the previous loan agreement would also be retained. The\n            financing of public sector enterprises would not exceed 25\n            percent of the amount of the proposed loan without the\n            agreement of the Bank. SNI is, with the Bank Group's\n            assistance, continuing its important role in the Tunisian\n            economy. It has recently experienced difficulties in its\n            organization and staff, but the remedial measures which are\n            being introduced should enable the Company to cope\n            effectively with the growing tasks ahead.
