It\n            would also provide technical assistance to strengthen the\n            bank's lending programs. Major benefits from the\n            project include reduction in waste of agricultural products,\n            provision of increased amount and a greater variety of\n            foods, and employment creation. In addition, the project\n            will provide technical assistance in three areas: consulting\n            services for sector analysis, project identification, and\n            monitoring and evaluation systems; training courses and\n            fellowships; and development of computerization of the\n            monitoring and evaluation of data."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
