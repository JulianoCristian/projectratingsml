Although it is expected\n            that surface water quality will improve with the reduction\n            in nitrogen, and phosphorous transport to run-off waters\n            from swine, and cattle manure disposal sites, including that\n            of drainage, and irrigation canals, measures will be\n            implemented to improve manure management, and\n            environmentally sound agricultural management. Water quality\n            monitoring programs will be undertaken, to establish a\n            baseline database on the quality of surface waters. It is\n            also expected that reductions in nutrient leaching to\n            groundwater flows will occur, improving drinking water\n            supplies. Nonetheless, wellhead protection programs will be\n            implemented, and extensive groundwater monitoring programs\n            established in the highly intensive agricultural, and animal\n            production areas, with improved animal waste management\n            systems. While the introduction of better farming systems\n            will conduce to improved soil quality, and more productive\n            lands, soil monitoring of selected areas will be undertaken,\n            to establish the effect of these improvements on soil, and\n            water quality. Similarly, biodiversity will increase,\n            nonetheless, impacts on new plant, and livestock will be\n            observed to prevent soil worm, and microbial activity."}, "docdt": "2001-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
