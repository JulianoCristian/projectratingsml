Project for Romania aims to increase significantly the use\n            of environment-friendly agricultural practices in the\n            project area and thereby reduce nutrient discharge from\n            agricultural sources in Romania to the Danube River and\n            Black Sea. There are three main components. The first has\n            four sub-components: it 1) provides incentives for the\n            installation of improved manure storage facilities and\n            equipment for manure collection and application in the seven\n            comunas; 2) promotes the adoption of better agricultural\n            practices to improve agricultural production while reducing\n            nutrient discharge pollution for agriculture; 3) develops\n            and supports a specific land use management plan for the\n            Boianu-Sticleanu Polder and ecological restoration of the\n            Calderasi-Raul Polder; and 4) strengthens capacity in\n            Calarasi Judet and the public health directorate to monitor\n            soil and water quality and environmental impacts. The second\n            component strengthens national policy and regulatory\n            capacity. The third component finances a broad public\n            information campaign of the project's activities and\n            benefits at the local, national, and regional levels to\n            achieve replicability of project interventions."}, "docdt": "2001-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
