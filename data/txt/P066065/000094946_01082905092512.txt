Meeting Program/Schedule
What is to be presented:
Draft proposal for manure collection and storage system. Household level facilities and comuna
storage construction - design principles, operating scheme, criteria for location selection.



Equipment needs for collection, storage, composting and use of manure as fertilizer.
By whom:
Phil Metcalfe, ADAS UK, consultant, manure component;
Ion Toncea, ICCPT Fundulea, consultant, environment-friendly agricultural practices.
Summary Meeting Minutes (Comments, Questions and Response by Presenters)
Question:
Silviu Pasare, inspector, EPI - How the liquid fraction of the manure will be managed?
Answer:
Phil Metcalfe - the liquid fraction of the manure and urine will be collected in special basin and,
at the household level, will be periodically tipped over the waste heap using a bucket. The liquid
not absorbed by the waste will return to the basin. At the comuna storage the liquid fraction and
the rainfall will be collected into a basin.
Question:
Gheorghe Sultan, mayor, Al. Odobescu comuna - Why it was proposed an over-ground
construction. The Al. Odobescu comuna has a feasibility study for the manure storage facility and
the solution recommended is a semi-submersed construction.
Answer:
Phil Metcalfe - the depth of 4 m may not be suitable for sites with high water table and the
drainage cannot be supplied for this type of structures. The partial submersion of the structures
results in a basin for the collection of rainfall installed at a lower level with risks for high water
tables. Also the cost of the construction of a submersed platform was considered by the civil
engineer to be more expensive than a structure built on the surface.
Question:
Constantin Anghel, mayor, Independenta comuna - Will the designed system provide for
facilities (eg. Bins) for segregating the waste? How the recyclable materials are to be handled?
Answer:
Ion Toncea, consultant - The project will provide facilities (cost sharing) for the farmers to
procure bins and the storage structures, at the comuna level, will have separate bunkers for
recyclable materials (scrap iron, glass, plastic).
Question:
Cornelia Vaidean, mayor, Vlad Tepes comuna - If the platform will allow the storage of manure
for at least 5-6 months?
Answer:
Ion Toncea, consultant - The design was prepared for a 5 month storage period at the comuna
platform and one month at the household level.
Question:
Pavel Petre, mayor, Ciocanesti comuna - Except the household and comuna sanitation, would the
collected manure have any value?
Answer:



Phil Metcalfe, consultant - The main economic benefit from management of agricultural waste
will be realized in the recycling of the nutrients in crop production. The manure can substitute the
mineral factory produced fertilizers and the expected benefit is around 5 millions ROL/ha in a
four years crop rotation.

Summary Meeting Minutes (Comments, Questions and Response by Presenters)
Question:
Aurel lanos, inspector, EPI - If the EPI staff will be trained for the Monitoring Programme?
Answer:
Ramesh Kanwar - A special training program (international and local) will be provided by the
project.
Question:
Gheorghe Sultan, mayor, Al. Odobescu comuna - He agree with the proposed manure collection
and storage system. How will be selected the first comunas for constuction of storage structures?
Answer:
Stefan Nicolau, PPU Director - the PPU will develop criteria for selecting the comunas. These
criteria will be used in consultation with the stakeholders, represented by a Local Coordination
Committee to be established.
Question:
Constantin Anghel, mayor, Independenta comuna - He agree with the proposed manure storage
system. When the project will become effective? From his experience if the project effectiveness
is delayed the peoples desire will decrease and also their support.
Answer:
Stefan Nicolau - The project could become effective in September 2001.
Question:
Comelia Vaidean, mayor, Vlad Tepes comuna - If the platform will be fully certified by the EPI
and PHD?
Answer:
Ion Ciofu - The construction permit will be issued only if all the legal procedures will be
followed. An environmental impact study and the permits for the local agencies (OCAOTA,
PHD, Romanian Waters Regia, County Council etc.) will be required by the EPI before the

Summary Meeting Minutes (Comments, Questions and Response by Presenters)
Comments:
Anghel Constantin, mayor, Independenta comuna - He totally agree with the proposed solution
for the manure management. He wants to know which will be the role of the Local Coordination
Committee.
Answer:
Stefan Nicolau, PPU Director - the role of the Coordination Committee will be to express
opinions regarding the project yearly budget, proposed action plans and contracted agencies. The
Project Coordination Committee will also be consulted on the selection criteria for comuna
selection.
Question:
Gheorghe Sultan, mayor, Al. Odobescu comuna - He agree with the proposed manure collection
and storage system. If between the selection criteria there are ones related to the comuna
commitment for other project components as agro-forestry?
Answer:
Stefan Nicolau, PPU Director - the PPU will develop criteria for selecting the comunas. These
criteria will be used in consultation with the stakeholders, represented by the Local Coordination
Committee to be established. The comunas participation in the agroforestry program will be a
main condition for selection to receive support for manure management.
Question:
Constantin Anghel, mayor, Independenta comuna - He agree with the proposed manure storage
system. Will the County Council support the comunas for obtaining the construction permits?
Answer:
Mihai Arbagic, President of the County Council - The chief architect will prepare a schedule for
the required actions needed for issuing the Urban Certificate. He estimates that all certificates
could be issued before the end of the year 2000.
Question:
Comelia Vaidean, mayor, Vlad Tepes comuna - If the EPI will request a tax for the issuing of
the Environmental Permit
Answer:



-   Ion Ciofu - The construction permit will be issued only if all the legal procedures will be
followed. An environmental impact study and the permits for the local agencies (OCAOTA, PHD,
Romanian Waters Regia, County Council etc.) will be required by the EPI before the issuing of the
Environmental Permit. According to the law the comunas will have to pay a 1,000,000 lei tax.
