In 2001\n            Romania was on the path of European Union (EU) accession and\n            facing the challenge of harmonizing with the EU\n            environmental agreements. Given its large agriculture\n            sector, the EU Directive on protecting water against\n            pollution with agricultural nutrients (the Nitrates\n            Directive) was of special importance. The agricultural\n            pollution control project a successful pilot to test and\n            demonstrate these practices under Romanian conditions and\n            have devised a strategy for country-wide implementation. The\n            integrated nutrient pollution control project was designed\n            to support the government of Romania to more fully meet the\n            EU Nitrates Directive requirements by scaling up these\n            practices while reducing nutrient discharges to water\n            bodies, promoting behavioral change at the community level,\n            and strengthening institutional and regulatory capacity. The\n            project supports a menu of investments focusing on Nitrate\n            Vulnerable Zone communes in ten river basins and eleven\n            counties. It is also helping to build capacity within the\n            Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and the\n            National Administration for Romanian waters, as well as in\n            other national, regional, and county agencies involved with\n            the nitrates directive."}, "docdt": "2009-07-16T05:52:03Z"}
