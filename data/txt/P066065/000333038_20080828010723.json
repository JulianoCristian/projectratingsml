Control Project for Romania were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; the risk to global environment outcome was\n            moderate; the Bank's performance was satisfactory; and\n            the Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: The afforestation program\n            which helped farmers against erosion, and the manure\n            platforms which achieved health benefits and cleaner\n            environment are most notable in this respect. The central\n            government respected country council and communities\n            preferences in the design of project activities, notably the\n            emphasis on manure storage as part of communal waste\n            management and afforestation, and in amending some of the\n            project activities, as discussed in earlier sections. This\n            was a key factor ensuring the local ownership that the\n            project enjoyed and led it to success. This is critical to\n            the widespread adoption of new technologies and practices.\n            Furthermore, information dissemination is needed early in\n            the project cycle to overcome the considerable lack of\n            understanding of the health and environmental benefits from\n            improved waste management, and to achieve significant\n            participation in project activities."}, "docdt": "2007-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
