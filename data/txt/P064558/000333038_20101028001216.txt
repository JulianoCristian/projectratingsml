                                          GRANT
                                   Restructuring Paper

1.     This Restructuring Paper seeks for your approval to reallocate resources of the
additional grant and extend the closing date of the Burundi, BI-Agriculture Rehabilitation
& Sustainable Land Management Project, IDA-H4060 to June 30, 2011 as requested by
the Government of Burundi on July 13, 2010.

2.      The project is progressing smoothly to achieve its development objectives as
shown by its key performance indicators which, in some cases, have been outpaced.
Yields increased for the major agricultural and livestock productions in the project area:
irrigated rice (from 2.5 to 4.8 tons per hectare), milk (from 2 to 6 liters per day per cow),
and cassava (from 8 to 12 tons per hectare). More than 3600 investment sub-projects
have been approved, completed, and/or are being implemented; 45 percent of these sub-
projects were for female beneficiaries. Marshlands (1,500 hectares) were rehabilitated
and developed. Eight provincial master plans for land use were prepared and are being
implemented. Sustainable land management practices (simple soil and water conservation
technologies and cover crops) were adopted on 10,000 hectares of watershed.
Community forests have been established on 28,000 hectares with 56 million trees
planted, mostly local species, introduced in farming systems. PRASAB reached large
numbers of people: 75,000 rural households (375,000 people, including 170,000 women)
benefited from productive sub-projects and 140,000 households benefited from
community development sub-projects. About 200,000 households of refugees and
displaced persons benefited from the emergency support provided by the project for their
reinsertion.

3.      A recent beneficiary assessment revealed a positive impact of the project on
beneficiaries' livelihoods: 98 percent responded that the project improved their
nutritional status, 87 percent, their revenues; 97 percent, their skills and knowledge and
92 percent, their organizational skills. The project implementation performance has been
rated satisfactory since its effectiveness.

4.     The project resources will be reallocated as follows:

      Category of Expenditure                   Allocation SDR                % of Financing
        Current           Revised             Current      Revised          Current     Revise
 (1) Goods, works and
  services required for                                                      100%           100%
                                             3
 (a) Sub-projects under         na.        6,600,000      7,200,156
 Part A1 of the Project

 (b) Parts A2, B and C          na.        1,000,000      1,469,115
      of the Project
       (2) Training             na.        1,500,000       430,729         100%          100%
     (3) Incremental            na.         200,000        200,000         100%          100%
     Operating Costs
   TOTAL AMOUNT                            9,300,000      9,300,000


5.      The proposed reallocation and extension are necessary to allow the project to
continue to use efficiently and effectively its resources to (i) respond to the pressing
needs of project beneficiaries and (ii) fund recently approved sub-projects. The
reallocation of resources will help rebalance adequately resources between the training
and the sub-project categories. In fact, overestimated training resources could not be
disbursed in the short time frame while underestimated sub-project resources are being
quickly disbursed due to high demands from the populations.

6.      The project objective continues to be achievable; the performance of the borrower
and the implementing agency is satisfactory and the borrower has prepared an action plan
acceptable to the Bank to complete the project. There are no outstanding audit reports and
all reports are satisfactory to the Bank.
