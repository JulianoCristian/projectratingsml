                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was due to close in October 31, 2010. Since the additional financing was not fully disbursed, the Government requested the extension of the project which was approved
                         by the Bank. The project will now close on June 30. The project has progressed toward achieving its development objective as reflected by its key performance indicators. By its
                         closing date the disbursement rate will be about 100%. M&E which was weak at project start has been reinforced during implementation. Financial management and procurement
                         have been rated satisfactory. Safeguard policies were complied with. A final impact evaluation of the project was conducted on June 2010 which revealed that substantial progresses
                         have been achieved on several fronts: more than US$ 30 million have been transferred to 237,000 households benefiting 1.4 million people of which 45% are women. Capacities of
                         institutions (Producers' associations, service providers, communal,provincial committees etc.) have been reinforced and have led to social cohesion which is particularly important for
                         a post conflict country such as Burundi. Average internal rate of return of productive investments has outpaced what was previously set. Environmental protection is now fully adopted
                         as a key practice for sustainable farm management. However more work will need to be done to improve further some aspects of project implementation of which: limited service
                         providers which avoid a fair competition and inflated costs; weak public service providers; difficulty for the research institute to adapt its certification methodology, less emphasis on
                         market access, etc. These issues will be addressed head on with the new project Agro-Pastoral and Markets Development Project which is now being implemented in the same area
                         as PRASAB.
