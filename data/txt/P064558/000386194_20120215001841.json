Management Project for\n            Burundi were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; Global Environment Objectives (GEO) outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            risk to GEO outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: depth over\n            breadth in training and capacity building. While the failure\n            rate of project financed Sub-projects (SPs) is very low, a\n            recurring explanation for failed or lower-than-expected\n            returns for some SPs pertains to beneficiary capacity for\n            adhering to good practices, particularly in livestock. While\n            the project provided over 275,000 person days of training,\n            many of these agro technical in nature, there was a need for\n            sustained monitoring or mentoring that may have improved the\n            efficiency of outcomes. Performance based contracts for\n            better performance. The incentive to Local Implementing\n            Agencies (LIAs), both public and private, needs to be\n            performance based. Project lessons show that Sustainable\n            Land Management (SLM) needs to be economically interesting\n            to be sustainable: Where the economic incentives were lower\n            in the project, there was greater deterioration of\n            project-financed SLM infrastructure, and vice versa. One\n            further lesson emerging from the ICR review of project\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) design relates to\n            support units in the Bank. In exploring the issue of\n            Agriculture Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land Management\n            Project (PRASAB's) weak M and E design, the ICR team\n            concludes that a contributing factor to the poor original\n            design was the delivery of the project at precisely the\n            moment of transition from the project design summary to the\n            modern results framework."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
