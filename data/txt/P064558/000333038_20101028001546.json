The reallocation and extension are\n            necessary to allow the project to continue to use\n            efficiently and effectively its resources to: (i) respond to\n            the pressing needs of project beneficiaries; and (ii) fund\n            recently approved sub-projects. The reallocation of\n            resources will help rebalance adequately resources between\n            the training and the sub-project categories. In fact,\n            overestimated training resources could not be disbursed in\n            the short time frame while underestimated sub-project\n            resources are being quickly disbursed due to high demands\n            from the populations.
