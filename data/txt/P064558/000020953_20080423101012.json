The procedure for involuntary resettlement is\n            not, in most cases, triggered because people are affected by\n            physical movement. It is triggered because the project\n            activity requires the acquisition of land, and people may be\n            affected because they cultivate the land, own buildings, use\n            resources to water and feed animals, or use their property\n            in any manner for economic, spiritual or other purpose. Such\n            use would no longer be possible during or / and after the\n            implementation of the project This project will affect three\n            categories or groups; 1) an individual who is affected when\n            he suffers loss of property, land or property and / or\n            access to natural resources and / or economic response to\n            the activities under the project, and to whom compensation\n            is due; 2) a household which suffers if one or more of its\n            members is affected by the activities of sub-project, either\n            by the loss of property, land or loss of access or affected\n            in any other manner by the activities of project and 3)\n            vulnerable households which may have special needs that are\n            different from those of most households."}, "docdt": "2008-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
