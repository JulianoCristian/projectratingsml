REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA AND A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A THIRD POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of US$9.0 million to the Republic of
Ghana and a proposed loan for the equivalent of US$9.0 million to the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana to help finance a power project. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, with interest
at 8.5 percent per annum and the development credit would be on standard IDA
terms. Of the proceeds of the credit, US$5.2 million would be relent to ECG
for 20 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per
annum, US$3.7 million would be made available to ECG as a grant for a rural
electrification scheme and US$100,000 would be retained by the Government for
a power sector study.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Fiscal and Balance of Payments Aspects
of Ghana's Development" (638a-GH) dated May 19, 1975, was distributed to the
Executive Directors in June 1975. A special economic report on export promo-
tion and financial intermediation will be distributed shortly. Basic data are
summarized in Annex 1.
Basic Economic Characteristics
3.        Compared with most other West African nations, Ghana enjoys a
fairly high standard of living; its annual per capita GNP, according to World
Bank estimates, was about US$460 in 1975, but this is almost certainly over-
stated because of the existing exchange rate. Over the past decade and a half
GDP growth averaged about 2.5 percent per annum and failed to keep pace with
the growth of population. There was virtually no growth in the volume of
exports, which depended almost entirely on a few traditional export commodi-
ties -- cocoa (of which Ghana is the world's largest producer), gold, and
timber. In addition to contributing 60 percent of the country's export
earnings, cocoa provides around 30 percent of government revenue and employs
upwards of 20 percent of the labor force. Although the development strategy
of the early 1960s broadened the industrial base, industries remained heavily
dependent on imported inputs. This strategy resulted in recurrent balance
of payments crises and an accumulation of external debt.
4.        Economic and social policies of the early 1960s emphasized extensive
government involvement in a wide range of social services, in setting up a
large number of state enterprises and in allocating resources through an exten-
sive system of physical and financial controls. Since the mid-1960s, there

-2-
has been a growing imbalance in public finances due to rapid growth of
budget current expenditures, slow growth in current revenue and uneconomic
operations of several government enterprises. The imbalance has depressed
government development expenditures to an inadequate level and has also been
a persistent source of inflationary pressure.
5.        After cocoa and timber, Ghana's principal traditional exports are
gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite. Production of most of these minerals
is stagnating, mainly because of depletion of the ore reserves. However, a
proposal is being considered that would open a new mine to produce bauxite
for local reduction to alumina to supply the existing aluminum smelter.
Ghana imports its entire petroleum requirements, mostly in the form of crude
oil which is refined domestically and used chiefly as a source of fuel for
the transport sector. Hydroelectric power meets most of Ghana's energy re-
quirements.
6.        Despite the economic problems of the 1960s, Ghana has devoted con-
siderable effort to development of its human resources. The education system
is well established, elementary education has been free and universal since
1962, public health facilities are fairly widespread and further expansion
favors rural areas. It is the declared policy of the Government to achieve
a more equitable income distribution by increasing productive investments in
the rural areas, by expanding low cost rural housing and water supply, and
by improving feeder roads.
Recent Developments
7.        The military government that took office in early 1972 inherited
a critical balance of payments position. Large medium- and short-term debts
had been incurred and foreign exchange reserves were virtually exhausted,
largely as a result of a liberal import policy and a decline in cocoa produc-
tion and prices. In an endeavour to redress the situation, the previous
Government, in December 1971, introduced a 44 percent devaluation of the Cedi
in terms of the US Dollar. The new Government, shortly after taking over,
revalued the Cedi, reducing the previous devaluation to about 20 percent. In
addition, the Government enacted an import retrenchment program which hit
the industrial and distributive sectors hard, causing GDP to fall by 3.7
percent in 1972. A recovery followed in the next two years (growth rates of
4.6 and 4.9 percent) encouraged by a greater availability of imports, but in
1975 there was virtually no rise in GDP.
8.        A strong improvement in the balance of payments in 1972 and 1973,
brought about by import controls and favorable price developments for cocoa,
gold and timber, ended abruptly in 1974 when the impact of higher oil prices
and a breakdown of the import licensing system caused an acute foreign ex-
change crisis. The situation was reversed in 1975 - at the-end of which
exchange reserves had increased to $150 million (about two months imports) -
following a re-enforcement of import controls and a drawing on the IMF Oil
Facility. At the end of December 1976, exchange reserves amounted to US$104



- 3 -
million, equivalent to about six weeks imports. Recently, the world cocoa
price has risen sharply, partly in response to an expected poor harvest in
West Africa. Higher export earnings for cocoa, in spite of a lower volume,
should therefore ease the foreign exchange position in the near future.
Advantage should be taken of this situation to correct some of the presently
severe distortions in the domestic price/incentive structure which is heavily
biased against exports, enables large profits to be made by importers and is
resulting in a serious misallocation of domestic resources.
Public Finance
9.        The steep rise in cocoa prices and efforts by government to expand
non-cocoa revenue have substantially increased revenue collections. Current
expenditure, however, has risen even more rapidly, resulting in extensive
borrowing from the Bank of Ghana to finance development expenditure. This has
been a major factor contributing to the high rate of increase in domestic
prices, which has been aggravated by imported inflation, the inhibiting
effects of import controls on domestic industrial production and the effects
on domestic food and agricultural availability of two years of low rainfall.
The cost of living rose by 30 percent in 1975, and increased to a rate of 50
percent per annum during 1976; there are now widespread shortages of many
types of consumer goods. Revenue and expenditure measures announced in the
1976/77 budget are intended to produce a smaller deficit than in the previous
year. On the revenue side the major changes include higher excise duties and
the introduction of a uniform 10 percent import license levy. The currently
high cocoa price should temporarily improve revenues, but much more stringent
controls will have to be imposed on public expenditures if inflation is to
be checked.
Prospects
10.       A Five-Year Development Plan, covering the period 1976-1980, shows
a target rate of GDP growth of 5.5 percent per annum. However, sharp fluc-
tuations in revenue and export earnings will continue to hamper an effective
development policy in Ghana, since diversification away from cocoa can proceed
only gradually. Recent measures on the balance of payments and the budget
reflect an awareness of needed policy directions, but the severe external
resource constraint and the rate of inflation require difficult policy deci-
sions in the near future to restore external and domestic equilibrium.
11.       Ghana's growth prospects over the next five to ten years will
depend to a considerable extent on the effective implementation of appropriate
policies to deal with the problems outlined above. Key policy measures should
aim at: (a) correcting the imbalance on external account through a more
realistic structure of prices and costs; (b) reducing the strong inflationary
tendencies associated with large public sector deficits; (c) promoting an
expansion of domestic production through more appropriate price incentives,
more assured supplies of necessary inputs and greater productivity of invest-
ment. It is difficult at present to assess the likelihood of the Government
taking all the economic policy measures necessary to restore equilibrium on



4-
the external account and provide a more secure basis for accelerated growth
in the domestic economy. Some important policy actions have already been
taken. Fertilizer subsidies are being phased out, cocoa producer prices have
been increased, as well as public utility rates and agricultural interest
rates, and recent budgets have attempted to limit the growth of current
expenditures. While these measures represent important steps the pace of
implementation is still too gradual given the severity of Ghana's economic
problems, and a considerably reinforced effort will be required over the next
few years to achieve correction of the economy's structural imbalances.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
12.       An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external debt was concluded in March 1974. Under this agreement, all pay-
ments due after February 1, 1972, in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations,
will be paid over a period of 28 years, including a grace period of 10 years,
with an interest rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum. Pre-1972 trade credit
arrears are gradually being cleared. At the end of February 1976, these
amounted to US$61 million, compared to US$188 million at the end of 1972.
Remittance of profit and dividends is still restricted. The current
external debt service ratio is only about 3.5 percent and is expected to
drop to about 3.0 percent by the end of the decade and then rise, when
the grace period on the rescheduled debt expires in 1982, to around 7.0
percent in the late 1980s. The Bank Group's share of Ghana's total ex-
ternal debt service in 1975 is estimated at about 18%; this is expected to
rise to about one-third by the end of 1980 and gradually decline thereafter
as a result of the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement. Ghana is rely-
ing on official sources for the bulk of the external capital required to
support its development program, and relatively little of its medium and
long-term borrowing will be on commercial terms. The March 1974 agreement
with creditors on rescheduling helped provide the foundation for a resumption
of assistance. Canada, Germany, the United States, the Arab Funds, the U.K.
and the European Economic Community have indicated a willingness to commit
substantial capital assistance, most of which will be provided on soft
terms. Bank Group Lending, as a proportion of total external public debt, is
expected to increase from about 14 percent in 1975 to about 25% by the end of
the decade. In view of the very low present and prospective debt service
ratio, Ghana can be considered creditworthy for additional Bank lending.
However, the country's vulnerability to fluctuations in the prices of cocoa
and other primary products makes it desirable that future debt service obli-
gations should be kept as low as possible. Continued assistance on the basis
of a blend of Bank/IDA financing would appear to be justified, given the
country's relatively low per capita income.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
13.       Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation in
Ghana, the Bank has made eight loans totaling US$142.5 million -- two for
the Volta dam and associated infrastructure works for electricity generation,
one for telecommunications, one for highways, one for cocoa development, one
for the National Investment Bank, one on Third Window terms for agricultural
development, and one for a regional clinker plant, financed as part of the
three nation (Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast) CIMAO industrial development project;
IDA has extended 12 credits totaling US$96.3 million -- five for agriculture
(including livestock, cocoa and fisheries), two for water supply and sewerage,
two for power distribution and three for highways. Annex II contains a summary
statement of loans and credits as of January 31, 1977, with notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. There are no IFC investments.
14.       The principal objectives of Bank Group assistance to Ghana are:
(a) to encourage Government to adopt economic policies designed to strengthen
the balance of payments and improve domestic demand management, (b) to help
rehabilitate and expand production of cocoa, the country's main foreign
exchange earner, (c) to promote agricultural and industrial diversification,
particularly for export promotion and import substitution, and (d) to improve
the country's essential infrastructure so as to relieve constraints upon
economic growth. At the same time, the Bank Group's lending program will
give emphasis to projects which would raise the living standards of the
poorer groups of the population; particular attention would also be given,
in the context of individual projects, to specific policy action (e.g. on
pricing, tariffs and subsidies) designed to improve output and productivity
in the economy and improve the performance of public enterprises.
15.       The two power projects currently under consideration are complemen-
tary undertakings designed to meet essential power requirements for future
economic growth. In line with the country's development priorities, future
Bank Group lending will place increasing emphasis on the agricultural and
industrial sectors. In agriculture, it is expected that a second sugar
project will be prepared to help increase output of the on-going Bank-financed
operation and reduce the country's dependence on imports. A second rural
development project is under preparation aimed at increasing agricultural
output and the incomes of small farmers in the Volta Region in Ghana. In
addition further assistance is contemplated for increased cocoa output, which
would strengthen Ghana's foreign exchange earnings. In industry a small scale
industries project is being prepared and a second loan to the National Invest-
ment Bank will be considered in due course; both these projects should help
diversify industrial production and provide wider employment opportunities.
Funds from the Project Preparation Facility have been approved to help finance
preparation work on the proposed Kibi bauxite/alumina project. In the social
sectors, the Government has requested assistance in designing and implementing
projects to improve urban development. A possible project is being prepared,
with financial assistance from the Project Preparation Facility, for upgrading
several low income settlements and developing sites and services in a number
of urban areas; an employment component is planned to provide work opportuni-
ties in the informal sector.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Bank Financing in the Sector
16.       The Bank has made four previous loans to the power sector in Ghana
totaling US$70.1 million. Two loans, for US$47 million in 1962 and US$6
million in 1969, assisted the Volta River Authority (VRA) in building and
expanding its power generating and transmission facilities, the major com-
ponent of which was the Akosombo power plant on the Volta River, about 100 km
northeast of Accra (see map). This six unit hydroelectric facility, with a
total installed capacity of 912 MW, presently provides more than 90 percent of
the country's electric power requirements. Two credits, for US$10 million in
1968 and US$7.1 million in 1971, assisted the Government in financing ECG's
program to improve and expand its distribution systems to meet growing demand
for power, particularly for industrial use. The physical execution of the
projects has been satisfactory. A project performance audit report (No. 1363
of Nov. 23, 1976) of the second loan to VRA concluded that the project was
implemented successfully, presented no unusual problems and that proposals for
rationalizing the structure of the electric supply industry were considered
but no action was taken. Audit reports on the two projects involving ECG are
being prepared.
Sector Objectives
17.       The principal sector objectives are to:
(a) increase firm generating capacity in order to be able to supply
the demand growth beyond 1978;
(b) carry out feasibility studies for the required generating and
transmission line facilities for the years 1983/84 onwards;
(c) extend hydropower supply to areas where costly diesel generat-
ing plants are now in operation and to new rural areas;
(d) extend and reinforce transmission and distribution systems in
order to take care of the load growth and to improve the quality
of service; and
(e) Rationalize the tariff structure.
In addition to these sector objectives, ECG intends to improve its organiza-
tion, management and accounting. The proposed project and an associated loan
that will help finance the proposed Kpong hydroelectric facility, are designed
to help further these objectives.
Institutional Structure
18.       Two organizations, the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the Electri-
city Corporation of Ghana (ECG), are responsible for providing public power



- 7 -
supplies in Ghana. VRA, created under a special act in 1961 to construct and
operate the Akosombo hydroplant, supplies bulk power to the Volta Aluminum
Company's smelter at Tema, to the ECG, to the gold, diamond, and bauxite
mines, to the Communaute Electrique du Benin, which in turn supplies power to
Togo and Benin, and to the Akosombo township. ECG is responsible for the
distribution of power throughout Ghana and the generation of public power
supply in areas that cannot be economically connected to the VRA system. Both
VRA and ECG have been making separate plans for the sub-sector; VRA for
hydrogeneration and transmission lines, and ECG for subtransmission lines and
distribution. VRA is currently conducting a feasibility study to determine
the long-term development of the Ghanaian high voltage grid. The feasibility of
merging ECG and VRA has been considered off and on since the mid-60s. As ECG
and VRA have developed into relatively mature organizations with distinctly
different functions, a merger is not expected to bring about major benefits.
19.       ECG supplies electricity to all consumers requring up to 30 MVA at
a voltage not exceeding 34.5 kV. As of December 31, 1974, ECG had 138,000
consumers and sold a total of 774 GWh, of which industrial consumers accounted
for about 54 percent, residential consumers 27 percent, commercial users 17
percent and losses and self-consumption the remainder. ECG's present facilities
consist of: (a) 33 and 11 kV lines and related substations which receive the
power from either VRA's system or ECG's own diesel plants and distribute it to
consumers; and (b) 28 diesel generating stations with a total installed capac-
ity in 1975 of 81 MW. The main diesel plants are those of Tema (33 MW in-
stalled) and Accra (15 MW installed but of low dependability).
Electricity Coverage
20.       About 100 towns in Ghana receive public power supply.   Except for
the township of Akosombo, which receives its supply from VRA, all the towns
are served by ECG. Thus about 2.25 million people in urban areas, or 25
percent of the total population, benefit from public power supply and nearly
half live in a household with a power connection. In the rural areas, communi-
ties with about 263,000 people receive power, representing about 4 percent of
the total rural population. Only about 10 percent of these have a connection.
21.       The proposed project has been designed to meet ECG's short to medium-
term needs. In addition ECG itself proposes to complete some relatively minor
reinforcements and small extensions to existing schemes. Although there is no
long-term program of rural electrification for the country, the Government does
favor gradual extension of public power supplies to rural areas and periodi-
cally asks ECG to implement this effort. These electrification requests have
been carried out by ECG without informing Government about the financial and
economic viability of the investments. During negotiations, the Government
agreed to consult ECG on the economic/financial evaluation of proposed rural
electrification projects (Section 3.02, Guarantee Agreement).
Tariffs
22.       Existing tariffs in Ghana reflect the low cost of hydropower supplied
by VRA from the Akosombo plant. ECG's tariffs are based on the VRA bulk supply
tariff plus the costs of distribution and operation. The small residential,



- 8 -
commercial, and industrial consumers pay a simple kWh charge in a declining
block tariff. Large consumers pay a monthly maximum demand charge and an
energy charge per kWh which decreases with kWh consumption per KVA of maximum
demand. Surplus hydro energy at a zero marginal cost in the short run will be
available until 1985 given the present commissioning date of Kpong and the
present load forecast. While this surplus hydro energy exists it should be
made available to industrial consumers for steam generation on an interrup-
tible basis. On the other hand existing special low tariffs for firm power
to industrial consumers should be eliminated because they lead to uneconomic
utilization of electricity. During negotiations ECG agreed that as from
January 1, 1978 all power supplied by it to its customers for steam produc-
tion will be supplied on an interruptible basis (Section 4.04, Loan Agree-
ment); ECG also agreed to eliminate the special low tariffs for firm power
to industrial consumers and replace them by the normal industrial tariff
at the expiration dates of the present contracts (Section 5.08, Loan
Agreement).
23.       Tariff restructuring and increases in level are needed to reflect
the incremental costs of power in Ghana. To reflect such costs, the present
ECG tariffs would need to be increased by an average of 70 percent in real
terms. In view of this extremely large tariff increase, it would not be
feasible to implement marginal cost pricing in the short-run. Furthermore,
in order to establish a sound tariff policy, the marginal cost of electricity
supplied at different locations, distribution voltage levels and types of load
of the ECG system should be determined. During negotiations Government agreed
to undertake a study of these costs as part of an overall power sector study
to establish a framework for future tariff policy (Section 3.01, Credit
Agreement). The study, which would be presented for review by the Bank by
June 30, 1978, would determine the appropriate levels of tariffs which should
be charged to the various categories of ECG and VRA customers, to reflect
economic costs, taking into account social and wider economic considera-
tions.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Ghana in
November/December 1975. A report, entitled "Electricity Corporation of Ghana:
Appraisal of the Third Power Project" No. 1196-GH, dated March 1, 1977, is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. A credit, loan and
project summary is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washing-
ton from December 6 to December 10, 1976. The Government/ECG delegations were
headed by Dr. S.K.B. Asante and Mr. K.A. Duker respectively.
Project Components
25.       The main objectives of the proposed project are to help finance a
further phase of ECG's development program, consisting mainly of expansion of
subtransmission and distribution facilities, and to improve the Corporation's
operations and management. The project includes the following components:



- 9 -
(a)  Sub-transmission and Distribution Lines:   About 230 circuit km
of overhead and about 20 km of underground 33 kV lines; about
6 circuit km of 11 kV overhead lines with about 11 MVA of dis-
tribution transformers. About 32 km of low tension distribu-
tion lines.
(b)  Substations:  11 new substations with about 150 MVA of trans-
former capacity; expansion of about 6 existing substations with
about 60 MVA of additional transformer capacity.
(c)  Materials and Vehicles:   Equipment and material for rehabili-
tating the existing sub-transmission and distribution system;
heavy, medium and light weight vehicles to replace and/or
expand the existing fleet;
(d)  Consultants Services:  About 105 man-months of engineering
services at US$4,400 per man-month to help execute the project
and two man-years of assistance to help prepare a power sector
study, at an estimated cost of US$100,000.
Project Cost and Financing
26.       Project costs are estimated at US$26.7 million (net of identifiable
taxes and duties but including contingencies) with a foreign exchange component
of US$18.0 million, representing about two-thirds of the total. Since project
components are well defined, a 5 percent allowance for physical contingencies
seems justified. Price contingencies have been calculated separately for for-
eign and local components. The following table summarizes project costs, which
are detailed in Annex III:
Estimated Cost

27.       The proposed loan and credit of US$9.0 million each would finance
the foreign exchange component. Local costs of US$8.7 million equivalent
would be financed by internally generated funds. The proposed loan would be

made directly to ECG with the Government as Guarantor; part (US$5.2 million)
of the Credit would be relent to ECG by the Government on the same terms as
the Bank loan, the portion (US$3.7 million) related to a rural scheme (Kumawu)
will be granted to ECG and the remaining US$100,000 will be retained by
Government for a power sector study.
Project Execution
28.       As part of the project, ECG has hired the South Western Electricity
Board, UK, (SWEB) as consultants in accordance with terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank and IDA, for the design, procurement and supervision of
project execution. Construction of sub-transmission lines and substations
will be executed by the contractors; low tension facilities will be installed
by ECG's own work force. Contracts have been awarded; supplies would be
delivered during 1977 and 1978, and construction would start late in 1977 to
early 1978 with phased completion from 1978 to the end of 1979.
Procurement
29.       Equipment, supplies, erection and related services to be financed
out of the proceeds of the proposed loan/credit would be procured under in-
ternational competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank/IDA Guidelines,
except for about US$500,000 equivalent of sub-transmission and distribution
equipment and materials which for standardization reasons would be procured
from the suppliers of similar equipment and materials under the previous
projects. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.5 million is recommended
to cover foreign exchange payments after January 1, 1976, for consulting
services, and cash down payments for equipment contracts placed in accordance
with the Bank Group's procurement guidelines.
Disbursement
30.       The proposed loan/credit would be disbursed to cover 100 percent of
the CIF cost of equipment and materials and the foreign exchange component of
erection of lines and substations and consultants services.
31.       There is a close inter-relationship between the proposed ECG project
and the proposed Kpong project regarding extension of electricity service to
the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area in southwestern Ghana. As part of the proposed
Kpong project an 80 km, 161 kV transmission line and related substation would
connect the area with VRA's main grid at Dunkwa while distribution lines would
be provided under the proposed ECG project. It is therefore proposed as a
condition of disbursement for expenditures for the related parts of the
proposed project that a letter of intent shall have been issued by VRA to a
contractor for the construction of the 161 kV transmission line (Schedule 1,
para. 4 (a), Loan Agreement).



The Borrower
32.       The Electricity Corporation of Ghana was established in 1967 as a
Government-owned public utility with power to conduct its business according
to commercial principles. The Ministry of Works and Housing supervises ECG,
which is directed by a board of seven members, including ECG's and VRA's
managing directors and representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Works
and Housing.
33.       The Corporation's top management team has performed moderately well.
The position of Engineering Department Manager has been vacant since 1971.
Technical assistance from the United Kingdom is being sought to fill the
position; during negotiations ECG confirmed that the post will be filled by
July 1, 1977, under this arrangement or an alternate one acceptable to the
Bank. In addition, two key positions in the accounting department need to be
filled, and during negotiations ECG confirmed that it would fill them by July
1 1977. (Section 4.01 (b), Loan Agreement). So far as general personnel is
concerned, ECG would appear to be overstaffed at lower levels. The present
employee/customer ratio is 1 to 27 and more acceptable ratios of 1 to 50 are
found in neighboring countries, e.g. Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast. ECG gave
assurances during negotiations that it will (a) formulate, with the assistance
of experts, a staff development plan by January 1, 1978, and (b) carry out by
July 1, 1977, a survey of staff training requirements and appoint a senior
staff member in charge of training. (Sections 4.01 (c) and (d) Loan Agreement).
34.       ECG's operations require improvement in a number of areas, especially
maintenance. Weaknesses include lack of proper maintenance resulting in
frequent breakdowns, power failures and unsatisfactory voltage regulation.
Main reasons for these deficiencies can be traced to problems such as absence
of an engineering department manager and lack of a good fleet of service
vehicles which this proposed project should help to alleviate.
ECG's Finances
35.       In the first year after its formation, ECG's financial performance
was excellent, with a sound financial position and rates of return well above
8 percent stipulated in the previous Development Credit Agreement. However,
since 1972 the performance has steadily deteriorated and profitability has
shown a serious decline. Rates of return on partially revalued assets fell to
2.6 percent in 1974 and 3.3 percent in 1975 due to a slowing down in energy
sales, increased wage costs and abrupt increases in fuel oil costs. ECG's
liquidity was reduced to such levels that it was unable to meet its debt
service obligations to the Government in 1974 and 1975 in respect of relent
IDA and KfW credits (IDA Credits 118 and 256-GH). The total amount unpaid at
the end of 1975 was about US$6.2 million. However, Government has agreed with
ECG to a rescheduling formula under which maturities on IDA-II (256-GH) and
KfW-II have been extended from 1977 to 1982 and 1984 respectively, and repay-
ment of all unpaid maturities for IDA-I (118-GH) and KfW-I are to be paid by
the end of 1977.

36.       Financial management, particularly in general accounting, financial
planning and control, asset valuation, billing and receivables require improve-
ment, and the recruitment of additional professional staff should help correct
these deficiencies. In addition, ECG agreed during negotiations (a) to reduce
the level of its accounts receivable by December 31, 1977, to a sum not exceed-
ing three months' billing revenues, and (b) to undertake a revaluation of in-
ventories and a review of the inventory management valuation system by
December 31, 1977, and, after consultations with the Bank, to implement appro-
priate improvements (Sections 5.07 and 5.10 respectively, Loan Agreement).
37.       The Government has just approved tariff increases for ECG averaging
about 29 percent, effective October 1976. This action was taken in parallel
with a 60 percent increase in VRA's bulk tariff to ECG, effective September 1,
1976. The new ECG tariff, plus further tariff increases of 3 to 15 percent per
annum as from 1978, are expected to restore ECG's liquidity and enable it to
meet by 1977 its rate of return obligation of 8 percent on the revalued rate
base as stipulated under the previous Credit Agreement (256-GH) and retained
for this project. Furthermore ECG will take fully compensating tariff action
within three months of an event which would cause ECG's operating expenses
(excluding purchased power but including debt service) to increase more than
an estimated 10 percent. ECG's assets have not been revalued since 1967.
During negotiations ECG agreed to revalue its assets as of December 31, 1976,
by June 30, 1977, and maintain its asset valuation on a current basis there-
after. Revaluation will be carried out by applying indices for local and
international inflation. Should the actual revaluation yield a value differ-
ent from the estimated Cedis 69 million as at December 31, 1976, the rate of
return standard would be adjusted proportionately (Sections 5.04 and 5.05 Loan
Agreement) so as to insure sufficient cash generation to meet ECG's investment
requirements.
38.       ECG's difficult financial situation has been aggravated by the fact
that the Government had failed to meet its obligations under Credit 256-GH to
reimburse ECG for operating loses incurred in connection with rural electrifica-
tion schemes, which ECG has executed and operated on Government's behalf. As
of the end of December 1975, the Government owed an estimated US$2.4 million
on this account. The Government has now agreed to reimburse ECG for all past
amounts due for rural operating losses in three equal semi-annual installments
between December 1976 and 1977.
Benefits, Justification and Risk
39.       The proposed project, the third Bank Group lending operation to
assist ECG, would help to improve and extend the distribution of public
electricity supplies in Ghana and, thereby, serve the wider goal of improved
economic development. Specifically, the project would: (a) reinforce the
distribution network of areas already served so as to meet increased demand;
(b) replace diesel generated power by cheaper hydro power through integration
of isolated areas formerly serviced either by ECG itself or, in the case of
some industries, by individually owned generating units; and (c) provide for
improved management of ECG itself. The project is thus closely related to the
proposed Kpong project.



- 13 -
40.       The forecast of total ECG load is based on extrapolation of the past
trends for each type of consumer and on the expected new consumer developments
not included in the overall trend, such as specific industrial projects. The
average annual growth rate for total ECG consumption is forecast at 11 percent
for the period 1975-80 and 8 percent thereafter. The proposed subprojects
constitute the least-cost solution to deliver the forecast load for a period
of 15 years when compared with reasonable alternatives, taking into account
the standardization of voltages adopted in Ghana and other local conditions
such as requirements for underground installations in some congested areas.
So far as project risks are concerned, from a technical standpoint they are
no greater than those normal for projects of this type, and the managerial/
financial risks should be minimized as a result of the agreements entered
into during negotications and referred to in paragraphs 32 to 38.
41.       The rate of return calculations show rates of return ranging from
0.1 percent in the case of the proposed distribution in Tema (mainly because
of the high proportion of energy sold at very low price for industrial loads
under special contracts (see para. 22)) to 21.4 percent in the case of the
Accra-Weija scheme, with an overall rate, using current tariffs and other
measures as proxies for benefits, of 10 percent. If benefits were assumed to
be valued at marginal cost, that is 70 percent higher than existing tariff
levels, the rate of return on the Tema component would be 13.9 percent and the
overall rate of return would be 14.2 percent, although this still would be an
inadequate measure of the actual economic benefits.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Cr. No. 163 -    Fisheries Project:   US$1.3 million
Credit of September 25, 1969
Effective Date: January 21, 1970
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project originally provided for: (a) the construction of
forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such vessels;
(c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies, and (d) the improve-
ment of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division.
Following protracted problems over design and price, the number of boats
was reduced from the original 40 to 10, and delivery of the boats has been
completed. A combination of mechanical problems and poor catches by purse
seine methods have resulted in lower income for sub-borrowers. In order to
improve the trawling capacity reliability and reduce time spent under re-
pair, measures are now being discussed to increase the engine power of the
boats and the maintenance facilities of the GIHOC Boatyard, utilizing about
US$500,000 left in the project account. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1972 has been extended to June 30, 1977 to allow for consultant
advice on the procurement of engines and boatyard equipment.
Cr. No. 205 -    Cocoa Rehabilitation Project:   US$8.5 million
Credit of June 26, 1970
Effective Date: March 12, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project, principally involving the rehabilitation of 51,000
acres and replanting of 36,000 acres of cocoa experienced delays mainly due
to poor weather conditions, poor farmer participation, limited availability
of labor, and shortages of insecticides. Project performance last year was
unsatisfactory with only 24 percent of the planting targets (7,000 acres) and
22 percent of the rehabilitation targets (10,000 acres) achieved. Only 62
percent of the original planting target and 35 percent of rehabilitation
target have been achieved to date. The closing date has been extended to
December 31, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit of January 29, 1973

Although 1975-76 sugar production (12,100 tons) was lower than
appraisal estimates, rehabilitation of factories and expansion of cane
acreage at Asutsuare progressed steadily despite procurement difficulties.
Estimated sugar production for 1976-77 is about 17,150 tons. Appraisal
production estimates have been revised to take account of implementation
delays and it is now expected that full development sugar output of 42,000
tons will be realized in 1980, two years behind schedule.
Cr. No. 438 -    First Highway Project; US$13 million
Credit of November 21, 1973
Effective Date: January 22, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project provides for the rehabilitation of 138 miles of trunk
roads, preparation of a road maintenance program and feasibility studies
to determine future road work requirements and procurement of traffic control
and pavement survey equipment. Due to considerable difficulties in getting
the major item, road rehabilitation, underway, the number of roads were
reduced from the original project provision of 345 miles to the present 138
miles. Recent actions by the Government and its executing agency, the Ghana
Highway Authority (GHA) have resulted in improvement in the overall progress
of the work. The Government has agreed to cover all additional costs which
were caused partly by higher standards of improvement and partly by inflation.
Studies have been satisfactorily completed, a maintenance program is being
implemented under the Second Highway project, and equipment acquisition is
still in progress. It is likely that there will be a delay of two years in
project completion over the appraisal estimate of June 1977.
Cr. No. 499 -    Second Water Supply Project; US$10.4 million
Credit of July 26, 1974
Effective Date: January 7, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project is a follow-up on the first Water Supply project
financed under Credit 160-GH and consists of the construction of an earth
dam at Weija; extension of the distribution system in the Accra/Tema area;
extension of rural water supplies near Accra; and technical assistance
and training. A delay in Credit Effectiveness was due mainly to the delayed
conclusion of a loan agreement between the Government and CIDA which financed
pumping stations and treatment work. The work is substantially behind
schedule due to delays in procurement. For example, the procurement of ADB-
financed large diameter pipes has been delayed more than a year, although
it is now expected that the contract will be shortly awarded. The construction
of the Weija dam is about 80 percent complete but some remaining critical

components may present difficult problems; there are presently under discus-
sion with the Corporation. It is expected that the project will be completed
in June 1980, one year after the appraisal estimate, and that there will be a
substantial cost overrun.
Cr. No. 500 -    Livestock Development Project; US$2.0 million
Credit of July 26, 1974
Effective Date: May 14, 1975
Closing Date: June 30. 1981
Project management has been improved following the appointment
of a permanent Managing Director of the Ghana Livestock Company, the approval
of new ranch development plans and the best use of existing finance under the
project. Because of unanticipated difficulties in acquiring necessary land,
and cost overruns resulting from higher cattle prices due mainly to the
Sahalian drought, the Executive Directors approved a revised project descrip-
tion in August 1976. The project now includes: (i) development of two com-
mercial ranches for 4,000 head of cattle, (ii) credit for 20 private live-
stock producers, (iii) the preparation of a follow-up project, and training
for ranch managers. Project costs are estimated at US$2.3 million. Govern-
ment has agreed to provide any additional foreign exchange, above and beyond
that available in the Credit, to help complete the project. The market
prospects for beef are very good and permit the project to be commercially
viable on a substantially smaller scale than at appraisal.
Cr. No. 531 -    Oil Palm Project; US$13.6 million
Credit of March 5. 1975
Effective Date: June 30, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project became effective on June 30, 1976 after a two-year
delay. Approximately 35,000 seedlings would be ready to plant 500 acres
in May 1977. Land will be cleared mechanically to accelerate the planting
program for completion by 1980; land-clearing machinery and initial vehicle
and equipment have been ordered. The managing director, project manager,
and financial controller have been dppointed. Nursery and headquarters
building sites have been cleared and a 2-1/2 mile road, which leads to the
site, has been bulldozed and graded. Cost overruns are expected on buildings,
oil mill civil works and equipment because of the long delay in implementa-
tion.
Ln. No. 1122 -   Telecomirunications Project; US$23 million
Loan of June 10, 1975
Effective Date: January 23. 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project components include the rehabilitation and expansion of
telephone exchange equipment, improvement and expansion of long distance
telephone facilities and expansion of telex services. Engineering consult-
ants have been appointed and bids for equipment are being evaluated. Project
is progressing according to schedule.

Ln. No. 1180 -   National Investment Bank Project; US$10 million
Loan of December 23, 1975
Effective Date: March 2, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project provides for a US$10 million loan to the National
Investment Bank to help finance industrial, tourism and agro-industrial
development projects and to support small and medium scale private enter-
prises. Despite the high inflation and slow economic growth, NIB was able
to maintain its operations at the 1974 level, i.e., total approvals of
021.3 million. Ninety loans were approved for V16 million in the industrial
sector. Recovery of arrears is the major problem but the senior management
is continuing its efforts to reduce the portfolio exposure to less than 40
percent.
Cr. No. 1181 -   Ashanti Region Cocoa Project; US$14 million
Loan of December 23, 1975
Effective Date: February 23, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Project consists of replanting and maintaining during the three
year project period 42,500 acres of hybrid cocoa in the Ashanti region.
Credit and training will be provided to farmers; other project components
are the provision of feeder road equipment, consultancy services for de-
signing a survey of the cocoa sector and evaluating seed garden produc-
tion. Field progress is on schedule though some difficulties have been
experienced in finding active farmers. Project performance during 1975-76
was very satisfactory with 96 percent of the 6,000 acres planting targets
achieved. Progress in designing the cocoa sector survey, appointing a seed
garden consultant, completing a farmer input study, and formulating a cocoa
pricing policy has been slow. The Government has obtained additional financ-
ing of US$5.0 million from BADEA for this project.
Cr. No. 594 -    Second Highway Project:   US$10 million Credit
US$18 million Loan of December 23, 1975
Ln No. 1182 -     Effective Date:  March 30, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The Loan/Credit became effective March 30, 1976, postponed from
February 23, 1976, due to delay in Government's submission of Legal Opinion
and Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The project is in support of the first 4-
year phase of an 8-year road maintenance program plus rehabilitation of
a short section of trunk road. The main elements are the procurement of
road maintenance equipment and spare parts; assistance to the Ghana Highway
Authority (GHA) in the management and planning of the maintenance program;
and an onlending operation through the Ghana Bank of Housing and Construction
(BHC), with related technical assistance to provide domestic contractors with
foreign exchange to enable them to procure equipment and spare parts to carry

out Ghana Highway Authority maintenance projects; and funds for the rehabili-
tation of the Accra-Nsawam trunk road section. Orders have been placed for
equipment and spare parts, part of the equipment has been received, and the
contract for the Accra-Nsawam road has been awarded, following international
competitive bidding. Screening of domestic contracts for sub-loans from BHC is
under way.
Ln. No. 1291-T - Upper Region Agricultural Development
Project; US$21 million
Loan of June 28, 1976
Effective Date: Not yet effective
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project, the first Bank operation for integrated agricultural
development in Ghana, would provide most of the 125,000 farm families living
in the Upper Region with improved support services, farm inputs and physical
infrastructure. Two principal objectives are to increase farm incomes via
increase in agricultural production and to establish permanent farm support
services. The investment period will be spread over five years, 1976/77 to
1980/81. Date of effectiveness has been extended to March 31, 1977 to
allow time for recruitment of key personnel and the establishment of the
Farmers Services Company.
Ln. No. 1298 -    CIMAO - Regional Clinker Project; US$3.5 million
Loan of June 28, 1976
Effective Date: Not yet effective
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This is the first Bank regional operation involving the Republic
of Ghana, the Republic of Togo, and the Republic of Ivory Coast. The main
project consists of a clinker plant, with an annual production capacity of
1.2 million tons, to be located in Togo. The Bank has approved a loan of
US$60 million, of which US$3.5 million is loaned to the Government of Ghana
to acquire preferred shares in Ciments de l'Afrique de l'ouest (CIMAO), an
entity which will own and operate the above project. Loans of US$3.5 mil-
lion each have been given to the Governments of Togo and Ivory Coast for
the same purpose. Procurement of the industrial complex is proceeding
satisfactorily. The main mechanical contract was signed in October 1976.
Recruitment efforts have started. Date of effectiveness has been extended
to May 31, 1977.
