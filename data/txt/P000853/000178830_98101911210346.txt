APPRAISAL OF THIRD POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Introduction
i.           The Ghana Government and Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
have requested the Bank to help finance a further phase of development in the
power sector, comprising ECG's 1976-79 development project and priority items
of the Government's rural electrification program; the works consist mainly
of expansion to the sub-transmission and distribution facilities; in addition,
the project provides for improvements to ECG's operations and management.
ECG is the Government-owned enterprise which distributes throughout the greater
part of the country the electric energy that it purchases from the Volta River
Authority (VRA); however, in the remoter centers which have still not been
reached by the main VRA transmission network, ECG generates its own power.
A Bank loan/IDA credit of US$ 18.0 million in total -- 50% loan and 50% credit --
is proposed for the project; for the loan ECG would be the Borrower and the
Government would be the Guarantor; for the credit, the Government would be the
recipient and would relend it to ECG. The Government of Ghana is at the same
time requesting a Bank loan of US$ 39 million to help finance the next generating
station at Kpong (see Appraisal Report 1299-a-GH). Previously, two IDA credits
totalling us$ 17.1 million were made to ECG; two Bank loans totalling US$ 53
million were also made to VRA as participation in the construction of the
Akosombo hydro-power plant. All these IDA and Bank operations were completed
satisfactorily and without undue delay. The Bank's audit observations on these
past operations are being addressed in paras. 2.07, 5.06, 6.12 and 6.13.
Institutions
ii.          Two organizations, VRA and ECG, are responsible for providing
public supplies of power in Ghana. VRA was created under a special Government
Act in 1961 to construct and operate the Akosombo hydroplant on the Volta River;
VRA supplies bulk power to ECG, to the smelter of the Volta Aluminum Co.,
(VALCO) at Tema, to several gold, diamond,manganese and bauxite mining industries
(the mines), to the township of Akosombo and to the Communaute Electrique du
Benin (CEB); the latter supplies Togo and Benin. ECG, established in 1967,
supplies electricity to ai consumers other than those supplied by VRA, requiring
up to 30 MVA at a voltage-not exceeding 34.5 kV. As of December 31, 1974, ECG
had 138,000 consumers; of the total energy sold by ECG in 1974 (774 GWh),
industrial consumers accounted for about 54%, residential consumers for 27% and
commercial consumers 17%, and other consumptions 2%.



- ii -
Tariffs
iii.         To be able to establish a sound tariff policy, the marginal cost
of electricity supply at different locations, distribution voltage levels and
type of load of the ECG system should be determined. In order to achieve on
the average prices that would reflect the marginal cost of electricity in
Ghana, the present ECG tariffs would need to be increased by an average of 70%
in real terms. A tariff increase of this order of magnitude would not be
feasible in the short run. During negociations, it was agreed to complete a
power sector study by June 1978 and to derive therefrom a tariff structure
reflecting as closely as possible economic costs.
The project
iv.           The project proposed for Bank/IDA financing comprises (a) about
250 circuit km of 33 kV sub-transmission lines; about 6 circuit km of 11 kV
lines with 11 MVA of distribution transformers; (b) about 32 km of low tension
(380/220 V) distribution lines; (c) 11 new 33/11 kV substations with about
150 MVA of transformer capacity; expansion of about 6 existing 33/11 substations
with 60 MVA of additional transformer capacity; (d) miscellaneous supply
materials; (e) vehicles; and (f) US$ 46h,ooo of engineering services equivalent
to 105 man-months at US$ 4,400 per man-months. Included in item (a) is a
sizeable component (18% of total project cost) for the rural electrification
scheme from Kumasi to Kumawu.
v.           The project provides for the distribution of power in the Sefwi-
Wiawso-Bibiani area which is expected to be fed from the VRA grid through an
80 km 161 kV line to be constructed by VRA under the proposed third Bank loan
to VRA (see appraisal report 1299-a-GH).
Project Costs
vi.            The project is estimated to cost ¢ 30.7 (US$ 26.7) million
including a foreign exchange component of ¢ 20.7 (us$ 18.0) million. The costs,
which include overall allowances for physical and price contingencies of 3.0%
and 22.2% respectively, exclude import duties and other related charges;
ECG is exempted from these charges. ECG called for bids in mid-July 1976,
and bids were opened in mid-September 1976; this has allowed the project cost
estimates to be based on actual bid prices.
Project Financing
vii.          A Bank loan/IDA credit of us$ 18.0 million in total (50% loan
and 50% credit) is proposed; this would finance the foreign exchange component
of the project. The recipient of the credit would be the Government of Ghana,
which would relend part of the proceeds to ECG at standard Bank terms. Total
local costs amounting to about US$ 8.7 million equivalent would be financed
by customer contributions and ECG's internally generated funds. Retroactive
financing of up to US$ 1.5 million is recommended to cover the foreign exchange
component of initial payments for engineering consulting services for project
preparation work and for project expenditures expected to be made before Loan/
Credit signing.



- iii 
Procurement
viii.        Equipment supplies, erection and related services to be financed
out of the proceeds of the proposed loan/credit would be procured under
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank/IDA Guidelines,
except for about US$ 500,000 equivalent of sub-transmission and distribution
equipment and materials which for standardization reasons would be procured
from the suppliers of the equipment under the previous program; it is
recommended that the Bank agree to this procedure provided that the prices
are reasonably in line with those obtained for similar items under international
competitive bidding.
Disbursement
ix.          The proposed loan/credit would be disbursed against the CIF cost
of equipment and materials and the foreign exchange cost component of erection
and services. Disbursement for any locally manufactured purchases would be
made on the basis of 100% ex-factory. To allow sufficient time for the
submission of final invoices, a closing date of December 31, 1980 is proposed.
Project Execution
x.           ECG has hired the South Western Electricity Board, UK (SWEB) as
their consultants to assist them in the design and procurement, as well as the
supervision of the execution of the project. Construction of sub-transmission
lines and sub-stations will be executed by contractors; low tension facilities
will be installed by ECG's own force. Contracts were awarded in February 1977;
supplies would be delivered during 1977 and 1978, and construction would start
late in 1977 to early 1978 with phased completion from 1978 to the end of 1979.
Justification
xi.          The average annual growth rate of total ECG consumption is forecast
at 11% for the period 1975-1980 and 8% thereafter. This load growth will
require expansion of VRA generating (Kpong) and transmission facilities along
with reinforcement and expansion of the ECG distribution network. The proposed
project would (a) reinforce the distribution network to meet the increased
demand of existing consumers and to connect new loads; (b) replace existing
diesel generators now run by ECG or by some industries for own use; and (c)
provide for review and implementation of staff planning and training, revaluation
of inventory and fixed assets, and a study of tariff structure and levels all
needed to improve ECG's efficiency and viability.
xii.         The proposed subprojects constitute the least cost solution to
deliver the load forecast for a period of 15 years when compared with reasonable
alternatives, taking into account the standardization of voltages adopted in
Ghana and other local conditions such as the need for underground installations
in some congested areas.
xiii.        Each subproject has been evaluated as part of an overall investment
program necessary to meet the long term load growth. This program includes



- iv -
generation, transmission and distribution. The return on investment has been
found as the discount rate which equalizes eosts (capital and operating) and
benefits. Revenues for new consumptions, fuel savings for existing self-
generation and other benefits of new consumption, would not reflect the real
economic benefits in view of consumers' willingness to pay the higher costs
of alternatives for at least part of the same service e.g. kerosene for cooking
and lighting, candles, etc. Current tariffs are based on the lov cost of
Akosombo hydro-energy and do not allow consumers to reveal their willingness
to pay a price for electricity based on the now higher long run marginal cost
of Kpong.
xiv.          Direct evaluation of benefits has been done whenever possible,
such as the fuel substitution by electricity (water pumps, diesel generation,
etc.). Otherwise, the present underevaluated tariffs have been used as a proxy
of benefits, which would represent the most pessimistic rate of return
evaluation. On this basis, using a shadow exchange rate, of 1.7 cedis (1.48
times the market rate) the resulting rate of return of the overall project is
10%. If benefits not evaluated directly were assumed to be valued at marginal
cost (70% greater than present tariffs and roughly comparable to 75% of tariffs
paid in Liberia), the return of the overall project is about 14%.
Organization and Management
xv.           ECG's management is generally competent.  All senior staff have
had a long-term association with ECG; however, the position of Chief Engineer
has been vacant since 1971. This situation undoubtedly has had a negative
influence on ECG's operations. Maintenance is very often delayed; this results
in frequent breakdowns and power failures, particularly in the low voltage
grids of Accra. ECG's operations are expected to improve under the Project.
Finances
xvi.          Outside its own operations, ECG executes and operates rural
electrification schemes on behalf of the Government. While the Government has
regularly reimbursed the capital expenditures related to the schemes, it did
not do so for operating losses, although it had agreed to it. However, in
November 1976, the Government undertook to pay past operating losses by the
end of 1977.
xvii.         Between 1968, ECG's first year of operation, and 1971, ECG's
financial performance was excellent. However, in 1972, ECG's financial perfor-
mance commenced to deteriorate and since then profitability has shown serious
decline; rate of return on partially revalued assets which was slightly below
the required 8% in 1972 and 1973 fell to 3.3% in 1975. Following poor operating
results, ECG's liquidity was reduced to such levels that the entity was unable
to fully meet its debt service obligations in 1974 and 1975 in respect of
onlent IDA and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) credits (IDA credits 118 &
256-GH and KfW Credits I & II); the total amount unpaid at the end of 1975 was
about US$ 6.2 million. During negotiations the Government confirmed that it
agreed to extend final maturities of the IDA and KfW II Credits to 1982 and
1984 respectively. The Government also agreed to ECG settling outstanding
amounts of the IDA and KfW I Credits by the end of 1977.



v 
xviii.       ECG will be the Borrower for the Bank loan of US$ 9.0 million
and the Beneficiary of almost all of IDA Credit, In fact, the Government
confirmed during negotiations that of the US$ 9.0 million IDA Credit it
will retain US$ 100,000 for the power sector study (para. iii), it will
onlend US$ 3.7 million relating to the Kumawu scheme on a grant basis and
it will onlend the remaining US$ 5.2 million on standard Bank terms.
xix.         The Government just approved ECG tariff increases of about 29%
effective October 1, 1976. This action was taken in parallel with a 60%
increase in VRA's bulk tariff to ECG, effective September 1, 1976. The new
ECG tariffs plus further tariff increases of 3-15% p.a. during 1978-1980
are expected to restore ECG's liquidity and its rate of return performance
of 8% on revalued assets as stipulated under the previous Credit 256-GH and
reconfirmed under the proposed Bank/IDA loans.
xx.          ECG's financial position is expected to be excellent during the
project construction period. The level of Bank borrowing is more related to
Ghana's foreign exchange than ECG's own needs. Should the projected liquidity
materialize, it was agreed that dividend payments would be made after ECG's
ownl requirements, including contributions to investment needs, have been met.
xxi.          Subject to agreement on the conditions set out in Chapter 7,
the project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan and an IDA credit of US$ 9.0
million each at standard terms.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01          The Ghana Government and Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
have requested the Bank to help finance a further phase of ECG's development,
consisting mainly of expansion to the sub-transmission and distribution
facilities; and improvements to ECG's operations and management. ECG is the
Government-owned enterprise responsible for electricity distribution to the
general public throughout Ghana. ECG distributes electric energy that it
purchases from the Volta River Authority (VRA) throughout the greater part of
the country, however, in the remoter centers which have still not been reached
by the main VRA transmission network, ECG generates its own power.
1.02          A Bank loan/IDA credit of US$ 18.0 million in total (50% loan
and 50% credit) is proposed; this would provide the foreign exchange needed
(see para. 2.01) to meet part of ECG's 1976-79 development project and some
priority items of the Government's rural electrification program. This would
be the third Bank group operation to ECG, the fifth in Ghana's power sector.
Tn 1968, IDA Credit 118-GH (us$ lo million) helped ECG to rehabilitate and
expand the distribution systems in Tema, Sekondi, Takoradi and Kumasi. In 1971,
Credit 256-GH of US$ 7.1 million assisted ECG in financing (i) the further
expansion of all four main systems mentioned above, (ii) the installation of
new systems, and (iii) the construction cf 33/11 kV lines and substations to
interconnect ECG's own systems and also connect ECG's systems with the VRA
main transmission system from Akosombo. The Bank has also participated in the
financing of the construction of VRA's Akosombo hydropower plant through two
loans, 310-GH in 1962 for us$ 47 million and 618-GH in 1969 for US$ 6 million.
All these IDA and Bank operations were completed satisfactorily and without
undue delay. OED's audit comments on aspects of (i) merging the two power
authorities, (ii) revaluation of assets, (iii) rate of return, and (iv) over-
staffing are being addressed in paras 2.07, 5.06, 6.12 and 6.13 respectively.
1.03          The proposed Bank/IDA project is based on studies carried out by
the Borrower's own staff in 1975. The Bank and IDA were instrumental in
formulating the project through identification and pre-appraisal missions in
1974-75.  The appraisal of the project was carried out in November-December
1975 and the present report has been prepared by Messrs. B.M. Thiam, S. Alber-
Glanstaetten, J. Gilling and R.W. Bates.
2. THE SECTOR
General Economic Background
2
2.01          Ghana covers an area of about 240,000 km , extending about 400 km
from west to east between Ivory Coast and Togo, and about 700 km from north
to south between the Sahelian country of Upper Volta and the Gulf of Guinea.
In 1976, the population was about 9.8 million; this has been growing at an



- 2 -
average of about 2.6% per annum.  Ghana's 1975 GNP is estimated at current
prices at about us$ 1460 which compares favorably with that of most other West
African countries; recent GDP growth rates have been -3.8% in 1972, +4.6%
in 1973 and +4.9% in 19714. Despite a rise in cocoa prices, Ghana's balance
of payments position deteriorated drastically in 1974; this was mainly due to
(i) the four-fold increase in the oil import bill between 1973 and 1974,
(ii) increases in the price of non-oil imports, and (iii) loosening of restric-
tions on imports; the current account deficit in 1974 was about US$ 187 million
compared to a surplus of US$ 128 million in 1973, and the overall deficit of
about uS$ 187 million against US$ 145 million surplus in 1973. However, in
1975, the current account deficit diminished to US$ 45 million and the overall
surplus was US$ 132 million.
2.02         The Government has issued general guidelines for a Five-Year
Development Plan covering the period 1976-80, pending the preparation of a
more detailed plan; however, a 5.5% average GDP rate has been set. While the
plan recognizes the country's dependence on a single commodity--cocoa-- which
accounts for about 60% of the country's export earnings and 30% of Government
revenues, it also stresses the need for economic diversification, for which the
availability of a sufficient and reliable supply of electric energy represents
a major ingredient. In this respect,Ghana has had a substantial advantage over
most of the other West African countries in that it has been possible through
the utilization of the large hydro-power source of Akosombo on the Volta River
to generate enough cheap power not only to supply a large aluminum smelter,
but also to a large part of the country. This advantage became even more
pronounced in recent years when large increases in fuel costs forced countries
using oil to generate their electricity to increase dramatically the retail
price of their energy. Until the end of the present decade, Ghana should
continue to benefit from electric energy at a cost far below those experienced
in most other West African countries. However, when the Akosombo output is
fully absorbed by existing demand, and less economic hydro sources (e.g. the
Kpong hydro-plant downstream from Akosombo on the Volta River) have to be tapped,
this particularly advantageous position will deteriorate.
2.03          Ghana's total hydroelectric potential is estimated at about 1,500
MWl/ of which 882 MW (60%) is generated from the existing Akosombo hydro-plant
generating facility. Although drilling (mainly off-shore) has been conducted,
no oil resources have been discovered. Petroleum product consumption in 1975
amounted to 800,000 metric tons; this was supplied from the Tema refinery, the
capacity of which is 1.4 million metric tons per year. Ghana does not have
any coal deposits, the forests do, however, contribute substantially to domestic
needs for charcoal.
1/ This hydro potential represents about 9,000 GWh/year, of which 5,400 GWh
corresponds to Akosombo.



-3-
Sector Organization
2.o4         Two organizations, the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) are responsible for providing public
supplies of power in Ghana. The VRA supplies bulk power to ECG, to the
smelter of the Volta Aluminum Co. (VALCO) at Tema, to several gold, diamond,
manganese and bauxite mining industries (the mines), to the township of
Akosombo and to Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB), which supplies Togo and
Benin. ECG is responsible for the distribution of power to all other consumers
throughout Ghana.
2.05         VRA was created under a special Government Act in 1961 in order to
construct and operate the Akosombo hydro-plant on the Volta River. The Act
provides for a Board (appointed by the Head of State) consisting of a chairman
and seven members, including VRA's Chief Executive. The broad delegation of
powers laid down in the Act enables VRA to take any action necessary to conduct
its affairs (electricity generation and bulk selling) in accordance with sound
financial and public utility practices. In addition to generating and selling
bulk electricity, VRA is also responsible for some non-power activities
(transport on Volta Lake, and research and development activities related to
the Volta Lake). Since its incorporation ten years ago, VRA has worked effi-
ciently and has progressively improved its performance.
2.06         ECG supplies electricity to all consumers requiring up to 30 MVA
at a voltage not exceeding 34.5 kV.  As of December 31, 1974, ECG had a total
of 138,000 consumers.  ECG's load in 1974 consisted of 54% industrial consumption,
27% residential consumption, 17% commercial consumption, and 2% for other
consumption. ECG's organization and overall management aspects (personnel,
training, operations, Accounting System, billing, inventories) are fully analyzed
in Chapter 5 and ECG's past and future finances in Chapter 6.
2.07         The feasibility of merging ECG and VRA has been under consideration
off and on since the mid-sixties. As by now both ECG and VRA have developed
into relatively mature organizations with distinctly different functions, a
merger therefore is not expected to bring about major net benefits.
Electric Service Coverage
2.08         About 100 towns in Ghana receive a public power supply; with the
exception of Akosombo which receives its supply from VRA, all towns are served
by ECG. Some 2.25 million people representing about 25% of the total population
live in these towns and nearly half (i.e. 11-12% of the total Ghanaian popula-
tion) live in a household with a connection. About 263,000 people live in
rural communities with an electricity supply, representing about 4% of the total
rural population. Only some 10% of these (less than half of 1% of the total
rural population) have a connection.

Existing Facilities
VRA
2.10         VRA's present facilities consist of the Akosombo hydro-plant;
920 km of 161 kV transmission lines and several 161/34.5 kV substations. The
installed capacity of Akosombo is 912 MW consisting of six units; its long-
term dependable generation and output are respectively estimated at 5400 GWh
and 762 MW.
ECG
2.11         ECG's present facilities consist of 33 and 11 kV lines and cables
with 33/11/0.4 kV substations feeding the power from either VRA's transmission
lines or ECG's own diesel plants; in November 1975, ECG had 28 diesel plants
with a total installed capacity of 81 MW; the main diesel plants are those of
Tema (33 MW installed) and Accra (15 MW installed but of low dependability).
The quality of service is generally satisfactory although there are shortcomings,
the reasons for which are explained in para. 5.08.
Overall
2.12         The dependable power and energy in Ghana including 30 MW from
ECG's Tema diesel plant are presently about 792 MW and 5,600 GWh respectively.
An additional contribution of about 25 to 30 MW and 100 to 150 GWh from the
standby generating facilities of the mines could also be added, but this should
not be considered as firm.
Sector Planning
2.13         The two corporations in charge of the Power Sector in Ghana have
each been making separate plans for the development of the subsector concerned:
VRA for hydro-generation and transmission lines, and ECG for subtransmission
and distribution systems. The two corporations coordinate their actions mainly
through their Boards of Directors; the Managing Director of ECG is a member of
VRA's Board and VRA's Chief Executive is a member of ECG's Board.
VBA
2.14         VRA has undertaken several studies to determine the construction
and timing of the next least-cost generation facility taking into account the
capacity of Akosombo and future power requirements. In 1975 the consultants,
ACRES (Canada), completed a study showing that (i) Ghana will face power and
energy deficits from 1978 onwards unless new generating facilities are commis-
sioned, and (ii) after considering such alternatives as the Bui 1/ hydro-scheme
and thermal power plants, the construction of a hydro-electric plant at Kpong
downstream from Akosombo on the Volta River would be the least-cost solution.
Consequently, VRA has decided to build Kpong 2/ and has approached the Bank and
1/ Bui is located upstream of Akosombo, on the Black Volta.
2/ Kpong is planned to have an installed capacity of 4 x 40 MW, a firm output
of 140 MW, an annual generation of 970 GWh, and is expected to be commis-
sioned in late 1980.



several other agencies for the financing of the project; a third Bank loan
to VRA is under consideration, mostly for the financing of the Kpong project.
VRA, in collaboration with Energie Electrique de Cote d'Ivoire (EECI) 1/ is
furthermore studying the feasibility of an intertie with the Ivory Coast grid
by 1979. If constructed, this would allow the exchange of power and energy
between the two countries and would result in substantial cost savings.
Meanwhile, the feasibility study of the Bui hydro-electric project is underway.
This would determine whether Bui is the least-cost alternative for electricity
generation after Kpong.
2.15         As regards the transmission lines, VRA assisted by the Italian
consultant, Italconsult-CESI, has completed the study of the long-term
development of the Ghanaian high voltage grid. The short and medium-term
developments of this grid consists of (i) an 80 km extension of the 161 kV
grid westward to the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area where one of the schemes of the
project is located; (ii) a 40 km/69 kV extension of the VRA grid from Asiekpe
to Ho; (iii) a small 20 kV extension from Lome (Togo) to electrify the Ghanaian
township of Aflao; (iv) reinforcement of VRA's substantions to take care of
local load increases; (v) reactive power compensation in Prestea and Kumasi to
reduce losses; and (vi) additional transmission facilities between Tema and
Accra.
ECG
2.16         Distribution system planning is not normally done on long-term
basis; this is due to the uncertainties of the load growth pattern. For the
short and medium-term, the proposed project has been drawn up; in addition, ECG
proposes to complete some relatively minor reinforcements and small extensions
to existing schemes.
Rural Electrification
2.17         Although there is no explicit long-term program of rural electri-
fication 2/ for the country as a whole, the Government favors rural electrifi-
cation in general and annually orders ECG to carry out specific works within
the amounts available from the national budget 3/. ECG has been carrying out the
Government's rural electrification requests, year after year without evaluating
and informing the Government about the financial and economic viability of
these investments. During negotiations the Government agreed to exchange views
with ECG on the financial and economic viability of rural electrification
projects.
1/  EECI is the Electricity Corporation of Ivory Coast.
2/  ECG definition of "rural" is financial, and covers any scheme which is financed
directly by the Government and for which ECG acts partly as an agent.
3/  For FY 1975/76, the Government has authorized capital expenditures of ¢ 4.8
million (about US$4.2 million); more than half this amount is to supply
power from the VRA grid to Ho in the Volta region.



-7-
Tari ffs
2.18          Current electricity tariffs in Ghana are based on the low cost
of hydro-power supplied by VRA from the Akosombo dam. The era of cheap
electricity will end as successively more expensive hydro-plants at Kpong
(1980) and possibly Bui (1985) and thermal plants thereafter are brought
online. ECG's tariffs are based on the VRA bulk supply tariff plus the costs
of distribution and operation and are of two types (for details see Annex 6).
The small residential, commercial, and industrial consumers pay a simple kwh
charge in a declining block tariff. Large consumers pay a monthly maximum
demand charge and an energy charge per KWh which decreases with KWh consumption
per KVA of maximum demand.
2.19          Tariff restructuring and increases in level are needed to reflect
the incremental cost of power in Ghana. Examination of the power and energy
forecast in Annex 5 shows that the load factor of the VRA/ECG system is very
high (86% in 1974) and will continue to be high in the future (82% in 1985).
This is due to the significant proportion of the Valco aluminum smelter load
in the total system load. Because of this high load factor, the overall system
capacity is limited by hydro-energy capability (kWh) rather than by kW capacity.
In view of this, there is no need, for the time being, for a tariff structure
which distinguishes between peak and off-peak consumption or to encourage power
intensive industries.
2.20          Surplus hydro-energy at a zero marginal cost in the short run will
be available until 1985 given the present load forecast and commissioning date
of Kpong (year end 1980). While this surplus hydro-energy exists it should be
made available to industrial consumers for steam generation on an interruptible
basis at a price competitive with the cost of fuel oil. Consequently it will
provide benefits to Ghana equal to cost of fuel oil saved. On the other hand,
the existing special low tariffs for firm power to industrial consumers should
be eliminated because they lead to uneconomic utilization of electricity.
During negotiations, the Government and ECG agreed to eliminate the special low
tariffs for firm power to industrial consumers and replace them by the normal
industrial tariff at the expiration dates of the present contracts.
2.21          To be able to establish a sound tariff policy, the marginal cost
of electricity supply at different locations, distribution voltage levels and
typesof load of the ECG system should be determined. Given the ECG inadequate
information system, it is not possible to make a judgment on the cost of dis-
tributing electricity to the different classes of consumers. During negotiations
ECG agreed to undertake a study of these costs as part of an overall power sector
study as outlined in Annex 6 to establish a framework for future tariff policy.
In order to achieve on the average prices that would reflect the marginal cost
of electricity in Ghana, the present ECG tariffs would need to be increased by
an average of 70% in real terms. In view of this extremely large tariff
increase, it would not be feasible to implement marginal cost pricing in Ghana's
electricity power sector in the short run.



- 8 -
2.22         An allowance for the power sector study has been made in the
cost estimate for consultants' services. The results of the study should be
presented for review by the Bank before June 30, 1978 with a view to derive
therefrom a tariff structure designed to reflect the marginal cost of power,
taking into account social and wider economic considerations. This was con-
firmed during negotiations.
3. THE PROJECT
3.01         The project proposed for Bank financing comprises the main
components listed below; further details are given in Annex 1.
(i) Subtransmission lines
About 230 circuit km of overhead and about 20 km of underground
33 kV lines; about 6 circuit km of 11 kV overhead lines with about 11 MVA of
distribution (33/0.4 kV and ll/0.4 kV) transformers mounted in such lines as
described in the Annex.
(ii) Distribution lines
About 32 km of low tension (380/220V) distribution lines.
(iii) Substations
11 new 33/11 kV substations with about 150 MVA of transformer capacity;
expansion of about 6 existing 33/11 kV substations with about 60 MVA of addi-
tional transformer capacity.
(iv) Miscellaneous supply materials
About US$ 2.6 million worth of miscellaneous equipment and material
for rehabilitating the existing subtransmission and distribution system.
(v) Vehicles
About us$ 1.49 million worth of vehicles (heavy, medium and light
trucks, station wagons) to replace and expand existing transportation facilities.
This component would not have been considered in the project if ECG were not
suffering from the shortage of foreign currency in Ghana (more than 70% of ECG's
existing service vehicles are at least four years old and need to be replaced).
(vi) Consultants' services
About us$ 464,000 in engineering services--equivalent to about 105
man-months at US$ 4,400 per man-month--required for the execution of the project
(see para. 3.10) and US$ 100,000 to cover two man years for the power sector
study (see para. 2.22).



- 9 -
3.02          The project provides for the supply of power to the Sefwi-
Wiawso-Bibiani area (see Annex 1). This area is expected to be fed from the
VRA grid through an 80 km 161 kV line to be constructed by VRA under the third
Bank loan which is now under consideration. It is important to achieve an
adequate coordination between the construction of the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani
scheme by ECG and that of the 161 kV line by VRA. In this respect, a letter
of intent for the construction of this 161 kV line will be a condition of
disbursement for that part of the proposed loan/credit financing the Sefwi-
Wiawso-Bibiani scheme.
Project Costs
3.03          The project is estimated to cost ¢ 30.7 (uS$ 26.7) million
including a foreign exchange component of 0 20.7 (us$ 18.0) million. The
costs which are summarized below and set out in detail in Annexes 2 and 3
exclude import duties and other related charges. ECG is exempted from these
charges.

3.04            ECG has called for bids at mid-July 1976, and bids were opened in
mid-September 1976; this has allowed the above cost estimates to be based on
actual bid prices.



- 11 -
3.05          Since the various components of the project are well defined, a
5% allowance for physical contingencies appears justified for the equipment
and materials to be used for these facilities. No such allowance has been
included for interchangeable items like small distribution equipment and service
vehicles; consequently, in relation to the total base line cost the overall
allowance for physical contingencies amounts to 3.6%. Price contingencies have
been allowed separately for foreign and local components 1/; the assumptions
lead to an overall allowance for price contingencies of 28.2% on the base line
costs plus physical contingencies.
Project Financing
3.o6           A Bank loan/IDA credit of US$ 18.0 million in total (50% loan
and 50% credit) is proposed; this would finance the foreign exchange component
of the project. The recipient of the IDA credit would be the Government of
Ghana which would relend, at terms of the proposed Bank loan, part of the pro-
ceeds to ECG which would also be the borrower of the Bank loan (see para. 6.07).
Total local costs amounting to about US$ 8.7 million equivalent would be financed
by customer contributions and ECG's internally generated funds. Retroactive
financing is recommended for US$ 1.5 million to cover the foreign exchange
component of (i) initial payments for engineering consulting services and (ii)
for payments related to letters of intent issued by ECG in February 1977 (see
para. 3.10).
Items for Bank/IDA Financing
3.07           The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit of US$ 9.0 million each
would be applied as follows:
BANK LOAN     IDA CREDIT
(us$ - million)

1/ For the'foreign component, the following rates were used 10% in 1976, 8% in
1977-78, and 7% in 1980; for the local component the rates were 30% in 1976,
18% in 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. The latter percentages were derived from
the nature of works, i.e. erection of distribution equipment to be implemented.



- 12 -
Procurement
3.o8          Equipment, supplies, erection and related services to be financed
out of the proceeds of the proposed loan/credit would be procured under
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines,
except for about US$ 500,000 equivalent of subtransmission and distribution
equipment and materials which for standardization reasons would be procured
from the suppliers of the equipment under the previous program; it is recom-
mended that the Bank and IDA agree to this procedure provided that the prices
are reasonably in line with those obtained for similar items under international
competitive bidding.
Disbursement
3.09          The proposed loan/credit would be disbursed against the CIF cost
of equipment and materials and the foreign exchange cost component of erection
and services. Disbursement for any locally manufactured purchases would be
made on the basis of 100% ex-factory. The estimated schedule of disbursement
is given in Annex 4. To allow sufficient time for the submission of final
invoices, a closing date of December 31, 1980 is proposed.
Project Execution
3.10          As part of the project ECG has hired the South Western Electricity
Board, UK, (SWEB) in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
as their consultants to assist them in the design of the project items, the
preparation of tender documents, the tendering, the bid analysis, the preparation
and administration of contracts, as well as the supervision of the execution
of the project. Construction of subtransmission lines and related substations
will be executed by contractors and low tension facilities will be installed
by ECG's own force. The preliminary design, the preparation of bidding documents,
the opening of bids and their analysis have been completed late 1976. With the
approval of the Bank, ECG issued letters of intent within the bid's period of
validity and subsequently made the required payments (see also para. 3.06).
Construction Schedule
3.11          Contracts were awarded in February 1977; supplies would be deli-
vered during 1977-78 and construction would start late in 1977 (and in early
1978 for some items) with phased completion from 1978 to the end of 1979. The
attachment to Annex 1 shows the construction schedules for the main project
items; these are based on past experience and are realistic.
4.  JUSTIFICATION
General
4.ol          In support of the Government's development policy (see para. 2.02),
the power sector is gearing up to supply the required demand for electricity in
the medium term. This will require an expansion of the generating and transmission



- 13 -
capacity by VRA (Kpong and power transmission facilities) and provision by
ECG of the distribution facilities to support the forecast demand growth.
Specifically, the Project would :
(a)  extend and reinforce the subtransmission lines and distribution
networks so as to meet the increased demand of existing consumers
and new loads;
(b) replace diesel generated power by cheaper hydro-power by integrating
to the main network isolated areas heretofore serviced either by
ECG itself or, in the case of some industries, by individually-owned
generating units; and
(c) provide for review and implementation of staff planning and training,
revaluation of inventory and fixed assets and a study of tariff
level and structure.
4.02          The economic justification which follows is based on the fact
that (a) the individual sub-projects are required to serve the expected demand
growth (para. 4.03) and (b) they constitute the least cost solution (para. 4.05).
As indicated in para. 4.o8 it is not possible to evaluate the real rate of
economic return on this project, therefore, the attempts that have been made
to evaluate benefits based on the present prices of electricity in Ghana (para.
4.11 through 4.13) are intended to demonstrate the inadequacy of the present
tariff levels vis-a-vis the marginal cost of electric power in Ghana. To
correct this situation it is proposed (a) to eliminate the present special
industrial tariffs (see para. 2.20) which do not even cover the generating cost
of Kpong power and (b) to undertake a comprehensive power sector study (see
para. 2.22).
Consumption Forecast
4.03          The forecast of total ECG load growth is shown in Annex 5.  This
forecast is based on extrapolation of the past trends for each type of consumer
and on the expected new consumer developments not included in the overall
trend, such as specific industrial projects. The average annual growth rate
for total ECG consumption is forecast at 11% for the period 1975-80 and 8%
thereafter. Overall growth rates and composition of the ECG load are summarized
in the table below.

4.o4          Consumption forecasts for each of the areas served by the
sub-projects have been made on the basis of the general trend for the non-
industrial loads (residential, commercial, etc.) and on the basis of the
specific information available for the main industries and some special
services (such as water pumping) to be supplied. In the case of the industrial
and special services load, an important part of the expected electricity
consumption would come from substituting for direct fuel energy consumption,
such as that of water pumps, sawmills, glass furnaces, etc. the electricity
which would become available at lower cost as a result of the project. Details
of the demand forecast for the specific subprojects are given in Annex 7.
Least-Cost Solution
4.05          The proposed subprojects consist basically of 33 kV subtrans-
mission lines of several conductor sizes in accordance with their expected
loadings, and the corresponding substations. They constitute the least-cost
solution to deliver the forecast load for a period of 15 years when compared
with reasonable alternatives, taking into account the standardization of
voltages adopted in Ghana and other local conditions such as requirements for
underground installations in some congested areas. It is assumed that after
these lines would reach their full capacity, the ECG sub-transmission system
of which the proposed subprojects form part, would be reinforced according to
future requirements.
Basis for Economic Evaluation
4.o6          The energy to be distributed through the project facilities
would require in the long-run the necessary expansion in the generating and
transmission system of VRA. Consequently, for economic evaluation purposes
the cost components include the investment and operating cost of the three
main elements of the power system: generation, transmission and distribution,
irrespective of the institutional separation between VRA and ECG. This approach
has also been used in the appraisal of the Kpong hydro-electric project.



- 15 -
4.07          Each subproject has been evaluated as part of an investment
program which includes generation/transmission, the 33 kV subtransmission
financed by the proposed loan, and additional low voltage facilities and
future substation reinforcement required to support load growth to the capa-
city of the 33 kV lines. Details of program costs are given in Annex 7.
4.o8          Current ECG tariffs, if taken as the sole proxy for benefits,
would not reflect the real economic benefits obtained by consumers as evidenced
by their willingness to pay. The current tariffs are based on the low cost of
Akosombo hydro-energy and do not reflect the long-run marginal cost. The
willingness to pay a higher price for an undefinable percentage of incremental
consumption is demonstrated by the actual use of more expensive substitutes
(diesel generation for own use, oil for cooking, candles, etc.).
4.09          In view of this situation, direct evaluation of benefits for
substitution loads of the industrial and water pumping energy requirements has
been made on the basis of the value of fuel savings and on the reduction in
production costs of the glass factory 1/ by use of electricity. For the rest
of ECG's supply, benefits have been estimated on basis of present ECG tariffs,
since no other direct method of evaluation could be satisfactorily applied. For
purposes of comparison, an assumption has also been made that consumers would
be willing to pay a price approaching long run marginal cost which is 1.7 timies
the average existing tariff and roughly 75% of the tariff level in Liberia.
4.1o          Among the benefits obtained from fuel energy substitution, the
use of electric boilers at Tema textile industries has been considered. In
this case surplus hydro-energy will be used to replace oil in the oil fired
boilers for steam production. It is expected that sufficient surplus hydro-
energy will be available as a result of Kpong project until 1985. The use of
firm hydro-energy for replacing oil would not be economically justified because
the long run marginal cost of electricity is about three times the fuel cost
required to produce the same amount of heat, when power and fuel costs are
expressed in economic terms, as indicated in Annex 7. The electricity for oil
substitution would only be justified as long as surplus hydro-energy (with zero
marginal cost) is available. In the context of the Kpong project it was agreed
that VRA would agree to offer ECG surplus power on disconnectable basis.
Rate of return
4.11         The economic rate of return for each subproject and the overall
project has been estimated by finding the discount rate which equalizes
incremental costs and incremental benefits, both costs and benefits being
expressed in economic terms. A shadow rate of exchange of 1.7 Cedis/US$1(1.48
time the market rate) has been adopted. No shadow pricing has been applied to
the local labor concerned because skilled and semi-skilled labor as required
in this project is fully employed. Details of specific assumptions made in
the rate of return calculations are shown in Annex 7.
1/ Electric furnaces reduce defects on production due to better heat control.

4.12          The table below provides the results of the rate of return of
the overall project and individual subprojects for the estimated cost and
load forecast.

4.13           In the first column of the above table, benefits are estimated
on the basis of existing tariffs and other proxies. The second column shows
the effect on the rate of return when normal industrial tariffs are charged to
industrial users served by the Tema grid, instead of special contract rates.
Both columns indicate clearly that the rate of return for the whole project
is reasonable 2/, despite the gross undervaluation of benefits that occurs when
using current tariffs as a proxy (paras. 4.08 and 4.09).  As a further yardstick
for comparative purposes, the third column of the above table illustrates the
return for each subproject when benefits are valued at 70% higher than the
current tariff levels i.e. approaching long run marginal cost. Long run marginal
pricing is still reasonable considering that it corresponds to only 75% of the
tariffs charged in Liberia (see Annex 7), which has the lowest tariffs among
neighboring countries 3/. This analysis confirms the recommendations referred
to in paras. 2.20 and 2.22 concerning the use of surplus hydro-energy on a
disconnectable basis, the elimination of special tariffs for firm power and
the carrying out of a study for ECG's tariffs.
1/ Refers to the portion of benefits (approximately 30% of total in col. 1) for
which there is no fuel substitution, replacement of existing diesel generation,
or other proxy.
2/ The rates of return on the Kumasi-Kumawu and Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani schemes
reflect their predominant rural character; the rate of return on the latter
is slightly higher than the former because it includes more productive uses
of electricity, i.e., sawmills, metal working, etc.
3/ Annex 7, Table 2, page 8 shows the overall rate of return as a function of
percentage increase of ECG tariff to show the effect of intermediate tariff
increases.

5. THE BORROWER
5.01          Unlike the two previous Bank group operations, which were IDA
Credits (118-256-GH), the present operation consists of (i) a Bank loan for
which ECG will be the Borrower and the Government the Guarantor, and (ii) an
IDA Credit for which the Government will be the Borrower and ECG the Beneficiary
(see also para. 6.07).
5.02          ECG was established in 1967 following the Government's undertaking
under loan 310-GH to reorganize the Electricity Division of the Ministry of Works
and Housing as a Government-owned public utility with power to conduct its
business according to commercial principles. The Ministry of Works and Housing
supervises ECG, which is directed by a Board of seven members including ECG's
and VRA's Managing Directors, and representatives of the Ministries of Finance,
and Works and Housing.
Organization and Management
5.03          ECG's headquarter operations are organized in four departments
(Engineering, Accounting, Internal Audit, and Administration), and a small
tariff section; in addition there are ten regional offices, the most important
of which are in Accra and Tema. All these units are ultimately responsible to
the Managing Director, who is ECG's Chief Executive. Functional control over
the regional offices is also exercised by       ECG's department heads (see also
Annex 8).
5.o4          ECG's management has performed moderately well, leaving many
necessary improvements to be implemented. ECG's new Managing Director is a
dynamic and competent engineer who took over the job in early 1975 after a long
career in utilities which had brought him to the position of Director of
Engineering in VRA, which he filled until he was asked to take over his present
job. The managers heading the Accounting, Internal Audit and Administration
Departments are also competent; they all have had a long term association with
ECG. The position of manager of the Engineering Department has been vacant
since 1971, and this situation undoubtedly has had a negative influence on
the efficiency of ECG's operations. During the negotiations, ECG confirmed
that a Chief Engineer will be engaged by July 1, 1977. Present provisions
(Credit 256-GH) on Bank consultation for future appointments of Managing
Director and Chief Engineer have been confirmed. Except for an expatriate
engineer, seconded from Germany for the operation of ECG's main control center,
all the utility's management is Ghanaian.
5.05          Whereas top level positions appear adequately filled, middle
management is weak and many vacancies exist. This is especially apparent in
the Accounting Department where there are key vacancies in the sections dealing
with the financial accounts, budget and stores. In order to attract adequately
qualified staff for these positions, ECG has recently raised compensation levels
for accountants; however, whether the salaries are now adequate to attract the
required staff is not yet known. During the negotiations, ECG agreed to fill
the vacant accounting positions by July 1, 1977.



- 18 -
Personnel
5.06          For several years up to 1973 ECG managed to stabilize its staff
at about 4,800, but additions during 1974 brought the utility's establishment
to its present size of about 5,200, with an employee to customer ratio of
1 to 27. Although reflecting a 33% improvement over the situation in 1969,
this figure - as crude a measure for the staffing as it may be - indicates
continued overstaffing. More acceptable ratios about 1 to 50 are found in
Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, while overstaffing applies mostly
to the lower level of staff, there is a lack of staff at the middle management
level (see para. 5.05). The UK aid authorities have been asked to provide a
manpower expert to determine ECG's future manpower needs and propose policies
to adjust to these needs. It is understood that this request is being favorably
considered. During negotiations, ECG gave assurances that (i) with the assis-
tance of experts, it would draw up by January 1, 1978, and thereafter implement
a staff plan, and(ii) until such plan has been agreed with the Bank, ECG will
not increase overall staff numbers.
Training
5.07          ECG has never carried out a systematic survey of its training
requirements; there is no senior staff member in charge of training. This
situation necessarily leads to unclear objectives and lack of comprehensiveness
and coordination in this important aspect of ECG's operations. However, the
programming of foreign training for the engineering personnel is relatively
well developed. All other staff are essentially trained on the job with occa-
sional participation in specialized courses at local institutes. For several
years ECG has been building a training school at Tema which was expected to be
completed by the end of 1976; the school will be mainly for vocational training
of its junior staff. ECG is fully aware of the need to streamline and to improve
its training programs, and it has requested the UK aid authorities to provide
a training expert. During the negotiations ECG agreed to carry out a survey
of its training requirements by July 1, 1977 and appoint a senior staff member
in charge of training.
Operations
5.o8          While ECG's operations are generally satisfactory there are
shortcomings, particularly in respect of maintenance which is very often
delayed; this results in frequent breakdowns, power failures and unsatisfac-
tory voltage regulation, particularly in the low voltage grids of Accra.
The main reasons for this situation are: (i) the absence of an engineering
department manager since 1971 (see para. 5.o4), (ii) the lack of a local training
school (see para. 5.07), (iii) the lack of a good fleet of service vehicles;
three quarters of ECG's present fleet of vehicles are old and need to be replaced,
and (iv) frequent shortages of spare materials. The project will be of major
help in rectifying the shortcomings of ECG's operations. Performances indicators
to be used during supervisions are shown in Annex 11.



- 19 -
Accounting and Financial Planning
5.09          ECG's accounting system was established and instituted by Coopers
& Lybrand in the late sixties and the corresponding manuals are still being
followed. The standards of accounting in ECG are adequate. Due primarily to
the lack of staff, financial planning and control are weak and accounting is
delayed. It is expected that with the recruitment of adequately qualified
staff (see para. 5.05) the weakness will be corrected.
Billing and Receivables
5.10          ECG's billing is on a monthly basis. ECG's accounts receivable
improved from the equivalent of about 5-1/2 months revenue in 1970 to 3-1/2
months in 1973. The main element in this relative success was the institution
of a central payment facility for Government accounts. Since then accounts
receivables have increased, and in 1975 amounted to about 4 months revenues;
this has been due to frequent breakdowns of ECG's electronic billing machines
in Accra and more recently to teething troubles of a new consumers-based
billing system. Increased collections from residential consumers is clearly
the key to better performance. The new billing system was expected to have
produced accurate and timely billing data by mid-1976 which should give ECG
an adequate lever to start a vigorous disconnection program. During the
negotiations ECG agreed that it would take such measures which would ensure
that the level of its accounts receivables would, by December 31, 1977, be
reduced to a sum not exceeding 3 months' billing revenue and thereafter be
maintained at such level.
Inventories
5.11          ECG's stock levels have increased from ¢ 2.4 (US$ 2.1) million
in 1970 to ¢ 6.1 (us$ 5.3) million in 1974.  The 1974 level represents material
requirements for about 18 months; this is high. At the same time, ECG is
critically short of vital items (insulators, transformers, meters, etc.), which
is probably partly related to Ghana's import licensing system. However, ECG
also acknowledges that its inventory management has been suffering from a lack
of qualified personnel. Reorder levels and stock values in particular need to
be reviewed. During negotiations ECG agreed to undertake by December 31, 1977
with the assistance of experts: (i) a revaluation of its inventories, and
(ii) a review of its inventory management and valuation system; and after
consultation with the Bank, implement the appropriate recommendations for
improvements.



- 20 -
Audit
5.12          In accordance with the terms of previous IDA Credit, ECG's
external audit is carried out by Messrs. Coopers & Lybrand in association with
a local firm of chartered accountants. This arrangement is satisfactory. In
addition to the audit per se, ECG's auditors provide management letters con-
taining suggestions to overcome system weaknesses discovered during the course
of the audit. ECG is continuing to build up an internal audit section to
complement the work of external auditors and which emphasizes (i) control of
the application of accounting procedures and (ii) physical stock taking.
Insurance
5.13         ECG's insurance policies provide protection against losses of goods-
in-transit, fire in buildings, third party claims on vehicles and other property,
and workmen's compensation. Transmission and distribution lines are not insured;
this is in line with accepted public utility practices.
6. FINANCES
6.01         Outside its regular activities ECG executes and operates rural
electrification schemes on behalf of the Government; ECG keeps separate accounts
for these works. As of December 1975 rural assets represented about 7% of ECG's
regular Fssets. While the Government reimbursed ECG for capital expenditures,
it has not reimbursed ECG for operating losses in these areas, and as of end-
December 1975 the Government owed ¢ 2.8 million in this respect.
6.02         ECG's past financial performance related to its regular activities
with a forecast of the entity's future finances is set out in the Statements
given in Annex 9.

Past Finances
6.03          Between 1968, ECG's first year of operation, and 1971, ECG's
financial performance was excellent; rates of return were well above the
required 8%; the financial position of the entity was sound and financial
indicators were above reasonable levels. Based on the excellent results of
1971 a dividend was paid to the Government in 1972. However, in 1972, ECG's
financial performance commenced to deteriorate and since then profitability
has shown serious decline; rate of return on partially revalued assets which
was slightly below the required 8% in 1972 and 1973 fell to 2.6% in 1974 and
despite a 20% tariff increase in August 1975, improved only marginally to 3.3%
in 1975. The major factors contributing to the decline have been a slowing
down in the growth of energy sales from 12% to 8% in 1974/75, large increases
in employment related expenses, following substantial salary and wage settle-
ments, and a doubling of fuel and lubricant expenses. Personnel and fuel
expenses account for about 50% of ECG's operating expenses. Following poor
operating results, ECG's liquidity was reduced to such levels that the entity
was unable to fully meet its debt service obligations to the Government in
1974 and 1975 in respect of onlent IDA and KfW credits (IDA Credits 118 and
256-GH and KfW Credits I and II); the total amount unpaid at the end of 1975
was about 0 7.1 (us$ 6.2) million. Salient features of ECG's finances during
this period of financial decline (1972-1975) are set out in the table below:

6.o4         To assist ECG in regularizing its debt service obligations, the
Government confirmed during negotiations that it agreed (i) to permit ECG
to settle all amounts due on the onlent IDA I and KfW I Credits by the end
of 1977 and (ii) to extend the final maturities of the onlent IDA II and the
KfW II Credits from 1977 to 1982 and 1984 respectively. This is satisfactory.
6.05         Concerning the Government's undertaking under Credit 256-GH to
reimburse ECG for rural operating losses, the Government confirmed during
negotiations to settle all past amounts due in three equal semi-annual
installments commencing in December 1976, and ending in December 1977. The
Government further confirmed that it agreed that ECG submit yearly estimates
of future operating losses and that on this basis, provisions would be made
in the Government's budget.

6.07         As indicated in para. 5.01, ECG will be the Borrower of the Bank
loan of US$ 9.0 million. Of the US$ 9.0 million IDA Credit, the Government
would retain US$ 100,000 for the power sector study (para. 2.22), would
onlend to ECG US$ 3.7 million related to the rural Kumawu scheme on a grant
basis and would onlend the remaining US$ 5.2 million for items not related
to rural schemes on standard Bank terms.
6.08         The Bank loan would carry the prevailing interest rate (8.5% p.a.),
a 3/4% commitment charge and a term of 20 years including four and half years
grace. ECG is expected to start a further three year phase of development in
1980. Aggregate foreign exchange borrowing of ¢ 18.8 (US$ 16.3) million, on
the grounds of country requirements, have been assumed for these works.
Future Finances
6.09         In order to allow VRA to raise the necessary local capital required
for the financing of the next hydro-electric scheme at Kpong, the Government
approved a 60% increase in VRA's tariffs to ECG, effective September 1, 1976.
The Government also approved, effective October 1, 1976, a 20% tariff increase
in ECG's domestic and a 33% increase in ECG's industrial/commercial tariffs,
equivalent to an average increase of about 29%.
6.10         The main assumptions underlying ECG's projected finances are:
(i) VRA will increase tariff levels to ECG, during 1978-1981, 10-25% to meet
its additional financial obligations for Kpong and to earn a 7-9% return on
the Government's investment; and (ii) ECG's operating expenses other than
purchased power will grow 10-25% p.a. 1/, reflecting system growth and infla-
tion. Additional detailed assumptions are shown in Annex 10. On this basis,
ECG is expected to achieve the following operating results:
1976      1977      1978      1960       1982
Electricity Sales (GWh)              941     1,096    1,277       1,465     1,698

1/ Should actual operating costs be higher, the Rate of Return mechanism (see
para. 6.10 next page) would provide automatic coverage.



- 24 -
The existing revenue covenant of an 8% return on net fixed assets plus 5%
working capital minus customer contributions was confirmed during negotiations.
It is estimated that in order to maintain this 8% return, ECG's tariffs would
have to increase - in current terms - very moderately in 1978 (3%) and there-
after 7-15% per annum. In recognition of the present uncertainty caused by
high inflation rates in Ghana, ECG and the Government agreed during negotiations
to take compensating tariff action within three months of an event which would
cause ECG's operating expenses, excluding purchased power, but including debt
service to increase by more than 10%. In order to assess well ahead required
tariff action ECG agreed during negotiations also to submit to the Bank each
year full financial forecasts by July 31. Finally, during negotiations the
Bank suggested for further consideration by the Ghanaian Authorities to introduce
an automatic tariff adjustments mechanism. Automatic tariff increases have
been used in other countries to avoid the political difficulties of drastic
and sudden tariff increases.
6.11         Assets have not been fully revalued since 1967.  A partial
revaluation, taking into account increases in ECG's long-term debt, following
exchange rate changes, took place in 1971. ECG has always agreed in principle
to a revaluation of assets but has delayed implementation because it could
not agree with the auditors on a regular, reliable and inexpensive revaluation
method. It was confirmed during negotiations that ECG will revalue its 1976
assets by indices satisfactory to the Bank by June 30, 1977 and keep assets
on current values thereafter. The resulting asset values would be adopted
for purposes of the rate of return calculation (see para. 6.12). Should the
actual revaluation of the 1976 assets yield a different net fixed asset value
than the estimated ¢ 69 million, the 8% return target would be adjusted
proportionately. It was understood that assets will be maintained at current
values by applying to local and foreign assets indices for local and inter-
national inflation. The financial projections assume a 40% revaluation in 1976.
Thereafter, an annual revaluation of 11% has been assumed reflecting the
weighted average of local (20%) and international (7%) inflation rates.
6.12         ECG's financial position throughout the forecast period is
expected to be satisfactory. Debt/equity ratio would remain at around 30/70
which provides for an ample margin for further borrowing. ECG is also
expected to retain a generous liquidity position which can be explained by
(i) the profile of the project's financing plan with 71% Bank borrowing, and
29% internal funding and (ii) by ECG's requirement for full payment of the
consumer contribution at the start of construction. ECG's borrowing from
the Bank Group is in fact primarily determined by Ghana's foreign exchange.
As indicated in the financial plan (para. 6.06) ECG is expected to accumulate
about US$ 14 million in cash by 1980. This projected liquidity should enable
ECG to resume paying dividends to the Government (see also para. 6.14).
During negotiations it was agreed that such payments would be made after
ECG's own requirement, including contributions to future investment needs,
have been met.
6.13        During negotiations ECG agreed that the debt limitation covenant
of Credit 256-GH, stipulating that no new long-term debt would be incurred



- 25 -
unless ECG's revenues covered the maximum future debt service 1.5 time,
be extended to the proposed loan.
Fiscal Impact
6.14         The project will affect the Government budget by (i) interest
earnings on the portion of the IDA Credit which will be onlent to ECG, and
(ii) disbursements for local currency element of the rural Kumavu scheme.
Interest earnings are estimated at US$ 2.1 million, whereas, the local cost
component of Kumavu amounts to US$ 1.8 million. No income or import tax
revenues are expected, because of ECG's tax exemptions (see para. 3.03).
Should ECG's projected liquidity in fact materialize, dividends payments in
the order of ¢ 2-3.0 million per year may become available to the Government
(see para. 6.12).
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01         As a condition of disbursement for that part of the proposed loan/
credit financing the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani scheme, a letter of intent for the
construction of the 161 kV line feeding this scheme should have been signed
in order to ensure an adequate coordination between the construction of the
161 kV line and that of the distribution scheme (para. 3.02).
7.02         Under the proposed third Bank loan to VRA:
(i) VRA will offer ECG surplus hydro-power for industrial steam production
on disconnectable basis (para. 4.10); and
(ii) The Government agreed to allow ECG to pass on VRA's tariff increases
to its own customers.
7.03         During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
and ECG that:
(i)  The Government will exchange views with ECG on the financial and
economic viability of rural electrification projects (para 2.17);
(ii)  ECG will make surplus hydro-energy available to industrial consumers
on an interruptible basis for steam generation (paras. 2.20 and 4.10);
moreover, the existing special low tariffs for firm power to industrial
consumers will be replaced by the normal tariff at the expiration
dates of the present contracts (para. 2.20);
(iii)  As part of an overall power sector study, a study of generation,
transmission and distribution costs, and tariff structure will be
carried out and presented for review by the Bank before June 30, 1978
(para.2.22).



- 26 -
(iv)    The Government will onlend that portion of the proposed IDA Credit
which is related to the Kumawu rural scheme on a grant basis and
will onlend to ECG the portion of the credit unrelated to rural
works at standard Bank terms (para. 6.07);
(v)    The Bank will continue to be consulted on appointments of
Managing Director and Chief Engineer (para. 5.04); and
(vi)    Compensating tariff action would be taken should an event occur
which would increase operating expenses by more than 10% (para.6.10).
7.04         During negotiations, assurances were obtained from ECG that:
(i)    The post of Chief Engineer will be filled by July 1, 1977 (para.5.04);
(ii)    Measures will be taken to fill the vacant key accounting positions
(para.5.05);
(iii)    A staff plan agreed with the Bank will be drawn up by January 1, 1978
and thereafter implemented (para.5.06);
(iv)    A survey of training requirements will be completed by July 1, 1977
and a senior staff member will be appointed in charge of training
(para.5.07);
(v)    By June 30, 1977, assets will be revalued in the 1976 accounts, kept
on a currently valued basis thereafter and these values will be
applied for purposes of the rate of return calculation (para.6.11);
(vi)    The level of accounts receivable will be reduced by December 31, 1977
to a sum not exceeding three months'billing revenue and thereafter
be maintained at that level 6para.5.10);
(vii)    With the assistance of experts a revaluation of the inventories and
a review of the inventory management valuation system will be
completed by December 31, 1977 (para.5.11);
(viii)    The annual accounts will continue to be audited by independent
auditors (para.5.12);
(ix)    A rate of return of 8% on the rate base as specified in Credit 256-GH
will continue to be carried pending the full revaluation of 1976
assets; each year by July 31, financial projections will be sub-
mitted to the Bank/IDA (para.6.12);
(x)    Dividends will only be paid to Government after ECG's requirements
(including investment needs) have been met (para.6.12); and
(xi)    Long-term debt limitation will be observed (para.6.13).
With the foregoing agreements the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 9.0
million for 20 years including 4-1/2 years of grace and an IDA Credit of
US$ 9.0 million.

Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
Third Expansion Phase
Detailed Project Description
1.         The proposed ECG Third Phase project consists of (a) constructing
33 kV, 11 kV and LV overhead lines and related substations for specific
electricity requirements and for rural development; (b) laying 33 kV under-
ground cables and reinforcing substations at Tema for industrial requirements;
(c) supply materials and service vehicles; and (d) securing consultant
services.
(a) Constructing 33 kV, 11 kV and LV overhead lines and related substations
Five lines are planned:
(i) From Tarkwa to Aboso:
This 33 kV 95 mm2 cu equivalent double circuit line of 7.5 km
will link the Volta River Authority 161/33 kV substation at
Tarkwa to a 33/11 kV 2 x 10 MVA substation to be built at
Aboso. This line will enable the Aboso Glass Factory to be
supplied with the electricity needed (9 MW, 24 hours/day) to
expand from the present output of 37 tons/day of bottLes to
60 tons/day by end of 1977 and 90 tons/day in 1978 1
(ii) From Accra to Teshie-Nungua (east of Accra):
This component of the project consists of a 5.7 km double
circuit line (33 kV, 95 mm2 cu equivalent), two 2.35 km 33 kV
cables and a 33/11 2 x 10 MVA substation to be built at Teshie.
The Ghana State Housing Corporation is presently implementing
a six-phase construction program of 2,200 dwellings at Teshie;
completion is expected for 1979. This construction program
includes houses, a 200-bed hospital, six schools, commercial
buildings; overall this development will require about 1.7 MW
in 1979 and about 9 Gwh/year by 1980;
1/ The African Development Bank has given a loan in Units of Account of
5 million (about US$ 6 million) to finance this expansion of the factory.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 3 pages
(iii) From Accra to Weija Waterworks of GWSC (west of Accra):
This 33 kV, 95 mm2 cu equivalent double circuit line of
8.5 km is intended to supply, through a 33/3.3 kV 2 x 5 MVA
substation, the GWSC (Gha a Water and Sewerage Corporation)
pumping station at Weija_ and an irrigation area that is
located 6 km beyond Weija. From the waterworks to the
irrigation area, only a single circuit line is envisaged.
The initial (1979) requirements of the Weija waterworks are
about 2.5 MW and 12 GWh/year; the requirements of the
irrigation project, which is sponsored by the Ministry of
Agriculture (Irrigation Department), are about 1.5 MW and
9 GWh/yea,.;
(iv) From a Volta River Authority 161/33 kV substation near
Asanwinso to the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area:
This 86.5 km, 33 kV 95 mm2 cu equivalent single circuit
line will supply existing industries (sawmills at Sefwi-
Wiawso; bauxite at Awaso; gold at Subin; and a metal and
wood complex at Bibiani) through seven 33/11 kV substations
with a total installed capacity of 11.45 MVA; related LV
distribution lines are also included. This component,
which is also a first phase rural electrification scheme,
will bring electricity to seven townships and about
30,000 people. The electricity requirements of the area
are estimated at about 7.1 MW and about 35 GWh/year by
1980;
(v) From Kumasi to NSuta and Kumawu:
This 91 km, 33 kV 95 mm2 cu equivalent single circuit line
is intended to supply about 15.3 GWh in 1980 with a maximum
demand of about 4.1 MW through four new 33/11 kV substations
and 15 new 33/11 kV/LV substations with a total installed
capacity of 14.55 MVA; related LV distribution lines are also
included in the component. This line would allow the elect-
rification of rural areas (12 townships with a total popula-
tion of about 40,000 people) and the shutting down of two of
ECG's isolated diesel generating plants; it would also supply
a sawmill (2.5 MW) planned to be constructed at Kumawu, a
quarry, a tire retreading factory, water pumping stations,
and schools.
1/ This water pumping station is a component of a project co-financed by IDA
(Credit 499-GH).



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 3 pages
(b) Laying 33 kV Underground Cables and Reinforcing Substations at Tema
This component of the project includes laying 11.2 km of 33 kV
cable of 3 x 240 mm2 cu equivalent, equipping two new 33/11 kV substations
(2 x 20 MVA transformers each) reinforcing two 33/11 substations 2 x 20
MVA transformers and 2 x 10 MVA transformers), and constructing 3.7 km of
33 kV overhead line (95 mm2 cu equivalent). In addition to meeting the
electricity requirements of the Tema Steelworks (about 12 MW by 1979 and
54 GWh/year), these works will help realize cost savings, since electrode
boilers will be substituted for the existing oil-fired boilers which would
be put on standby; industries concerned are Tema Textile Ltd. (about 13 MW
at commissioning date and 42 GWh/year); sale of electricity for these
electrode boilers will be done on an interruptible basis using surplus hydro
energy when available (see para. 4.10).
(c) Supply Material and Service Vehicles (for values see Annex 2)
(i) Spares for the plant involved in constructing the above
lines and substations and in laying the above cables;
(ii) Spares for the existing 33 kV, 11 kV and LV distribution
grids;
(iii) Materials required for the Accra low voltage reinforce-
ments;
(iv) Miscellaneous distribution materials (not in stock) for
a three year development of ECG's distribution networks;
(v) Service vehicles (more than 70% of ECG's existing service
vehicles are at least four years old and need to be
replaced).
(d) Securing Consultant Services
These services are required for (i) preparing the specifications
and tender documents for the project, (ii) analyzing bids, (iii) supervising
project execution and moreover (iv) for carrying out a oower sector study
aiming at proposing a sound tariff policy.

ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
Outline of Draft Terms of Reference for a Tariff Study for
Ghana's Electric Power Sector
Objective
The purpose of the study is to derive a tariff structure for the
sale of electricity to customers of both VRA and ECG which reflects as
closely as possible the costs to the national economy of meeting the demand
for electricity and to determine the appropriate levels of tariffs which
should be charged to the various categories of customers of both VRA and
ECG having regard to:
(i)    financial requirements of VRA and ECG;
(ii)   Government social policy and development
objectives, and
(iii) the economic costs of other forms of energy
such as petroleum products, their prices,
the substitutability of different energy
sources, and the resultant cross elasticity
of demand.
Guidelines for Study Execution
Analysis of Cost Structure
(a) The relevant costs are not financial costs to ECG and VRA of
expanding and operating its system to meet the demand but the incremental costs
to the economy. Strictly speaking, therefore, shadow prices (for capital,
labor and foreign exchange) rather than actual prices to VRA/ECG should be used
as appropriate for measuring costs and any taxes on VRA/ECG's inputs should be
deducted and subsidies added back. However, the consultant cannot be expected
to calculate the appropriate shadow prices to use but must rely on guidelines
from the authorities. Failing this, he will have no alternative but to use
the actual prices of inputs (duly corrected for taxes and subsidies), although
it is suggested that, in any case, the opportunity cost of capital for discount-
ing future costs should be taken as 12%.
(b) It is expected that the first step would be to analyse the long
run and short run marginal costs of generating, transmitting and distributing
electricity at different places, times and voltage levels to different con-
sumers over the next few years. This would require due attention to the daily
and seasonal variations in forecast system demand and, to the extent possible,
in forecast demands of various consumer classes. Much of the required informa-
tion for this purpose may have to be specially collected, e.g. by taking sub-



ANNEX 6
Table 3
Page 2 of 3 pages
station readings, by enquiring about shift working, seasonal work patterns,
etc., and by statistical analysis of available load curves. The basis for
the estimates of marginal costs would be the development program for the
period 1977-85, the proposed operating regime and proposals for subsequent
expansion.
(c) For the time periods when demand does not come up against the
system capacity constraint (allowing for the reserve margins set to maintain
security of supply) marginal costs would be simply marginal running costs
(short run costs) grossed up to allow for losses at the different voltage
levels and, where relevant, in different regions. The relevant losses are
incremental losses, even if they can be estimated only approximately, not
average losses.
(d) At periods when an increase in generation would bring the system
up against the security constraint, the marginal cost of meeting demand would
be the addition to all system costs resulting from adding to generation capac-
ity and/or storage, transmission and distribution in order to provide the
increased supply with an unchanged probability of failure. These are long run
costs.
(e) It would also be necessary to study the incremental costs attri-
butable to poor power factors for these types of consumer (the larger ones) who
can be expected to improve their power factor in response to suitable tariff
incentives. The most important cost to concentrate on is the extra MVA capacity
required to cater for these poor power factors.
Existing Tariffs
(f) It is envisaged that the next step would be to examine the exist-
ing tariff structure and rates and compare them with the structure of marginal
costs of supply derived from the foregoing analysis. Large differences between
the two may be an indication that the existing system is giving the wrong price
signals to consumers. Examination of the existing system should pay particular
attention to the types of metering in use and the quality of meter maintenance,
since this would provide some guidance to what types of tariff are feasible.
Other features to look for in examining the existing system are whether it is
difficult to administer, conducive to disputes or conducive to fraud, since
these will provide useful pointers to improvement in devising the new tariff
structure.
New Tariff Proposals
(g) With the information thus collected, if should be possible to
make a first set of proposals for changing the existing tariff system so that
the incentives (and disincentives) it provides to consumers correspond more
closely to the schedule of marginal costs derived. These proposals would con-
sist of a classification of consumers and a tariff (or set of tariffs) for each
class, together with any connection charges and changes for reactive power
which can be justified. They would have to be modified as necessary to take

account of the following:
(i)   Any strong arguments for slanting electricity tariffs
because of price distortions (e.g. of substitutes for
public electricity supply) elsewhere in the economy
which are likely to affect electricity sales in the
absence of such slanting.
(ii) The availability of surplus hydro energy when short
run marginal costs are applicable and lower cost
interruptible power can be sold to industries.
(iii) The need for VRA and ECG to meet rate of return
covenants.
(iv) Any income redistribution objectives of the government,
e.g. the provision of a low price social block for low
income consumers.
(v)   Practicality and cost.  There is a trade-off between
the cost of administering any tariff structure (which
depends largely on the cost of metering and billing)
and the extent to which it can reflect the structur-
ing of marginal costs. Complex metering, for
example, since the response of small consumers to the
extra incentives (or disincentives) it offers would
not justify the expense.

Demand Forecasts, Rate of Return Calculations
Introduction
1.        The material given in this Annex provides an amplification on the
assumptions, methodology, and issues discussed in Chapter 4.
Demand Forecast
2.        Domestic loads were forecast using the following assumptions:
(i)  for the Teshie housing development, 0.5 krW maximum
demand per dwelling with a 50% load factor and no
demand diversity at system peak;
(ii) for the rural development areas of Sefwi-Wiawso and
Kumawu, 18 watts per capita maximum demand with no
diversity from system peak and a 45% load factor.
3.        Industrial loads were forecast on the basis of written requests from
industries for immediate and their forecast of future needs. Consideration was
also given to the industrial potential of the areas served by each subproject.
4.        In general load growth on the facilities provided by the project was
assumed to continue until the capacity of the line was reached - approximately
15 years in most cases. If the line capacity had not been reached in 15 years
it was assumed to remain constant thereafter. This approach was used because
of uncertainty of demand for newly served areas and the consideration that if
the project could not be justified with 15 years load growth, it was likely an
uneconomical project in any event.
Accra-Teshie
5.        The Ghana State Housing Corporation is undertaking a construction
program at Teshie of 2,200 dwellings in 6 phases to be completed in 1979. This
portion of the ECG project will supply power to these dwellings (houses and
apartments), to a 200 bed hospital, six schools and to commercial premises.
Estimated demand is 1.7 MW and 9 GWh by 1980. Given the proximity to Accra
and the potential for the area, a 12% growth rate in consumption has been fore-
cast.
Accra-Weija Scheme
6.        Power is required to increase pumping capacity at Weija waterworks
and for an irrigation project 6 km beyond Weija.  The water works is ovned by
the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation and supplies the Accra-Tema area.
The expansion of pumping capacity is part of a Bank financed scheme while the
irrigation project is sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture. Power require-
ments for the two schemes are estimated at about 4 MW and 21 GWh initially in



ANNEX 7
Table 2
Page 2 of 8 pages
mid-1979 and growing at 7% for the water works and 2% for irrigation.
Kumasi-Kumawu Scheme
7.        The extension of the interconnected system from Kumasi to the
Kumawu area would enable ECG to (i) electrify 12 small townships with a com-
bined population of about 40,000 people; (ii) replace existing diesel genera-
tion in two of its own plants at Kumawu (where at present supply to a popula-
tion of about 7,000 people is possible during only some eight hours a day) and
Mampong (population 14,000); (iii) replace existing diesel generation by the
Ghana Broadcasting Corporation at its important TV and radio relay station
near Jamasi and to provide additional power to the station; and (iv) provide
power to a proposed sawmill to be established at Kamawu. Demand is forecast
to grow at 6% per year starting from the 1979 base of 4.1 MW and 15 GWh.
Capacity of the Kumasi-Agona line will be reached in about 15 years.
Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani Scheme
8.        Economic development in the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area, for which the
Government gives high priority, has been impeded by the lack of power. The
supply of power to the area will relieve severe power problems currently exper-
ienced by industries in the area, enable them in consequence to increase produc-
tion, eliminate the need to burn oil in high-cost Diesel generators, allow the
establishment of new industries, and supply seven townships having a total
estimated population of 30,000. There are four major companies already in
existence, which develop minerals and timber -- two of the main natural resources
of Ghana -- and are almost entirely export oriented earning significant sums of
foreign exchange. In addition the companies support large communities, often
with developed infrastructure. Currently, they use about 5,000 metric tons of
oil a year. The generators are old, and give rise to breakdown and disruption
of production. With the supply of public power, an important new timber-proces-
sing plant will be constructed in the area. Additionally, it will be possible
for ECG to close down old diesel generators presently supplying two villages.
The existing and new industries will provide a financial floor to the project
from which to develop and electrify smaller rural communities thus supporting
the Government's rural electrification policy. This component of the project
will allow ECG to make a significant extension of its interconnected system into
the western part of the country.
9.        A 161 kV transmission line appraised and proposed for Bank financing
in the VRA Kpong project will supply the area. Justification of the Kpong
project is thus related to demand in this area. Demand is forecast to grow from
7.1 MW and 34.4 GWh in 1979 by 10% per year. The capacity of the ECG sub-trans-
mission lines will be reached in about 15 years.
Tarkwa-Aboso Scheme
10.       The Aboso Glass factory is currently being converted from an oil
fired production process to electric kilns. The conversion is being financed
by an ADB loan equivalent to $5 million for the production of glass bottles.
The electric kilns have higher thermal and production efficiency, permit higher
quality control and reduce maintenance costs by 50%. The Aboso glass factorv is
presently supplied with 1 MW of VRA power via the State Gold Mines. The provi-

sion of a separate supply will allow the Gold Mines to increase production in
addition to perm-itting the increase of production of bottles from 3,000 tons
per year to about 21,000 tons by 1980. Bottles are currently in short supply
in Ghana and 12,000 tons would have been imported in 1975, if import licences
had been granted for the entire quantity demanded.
Tema Expansion and Reinforcements
11.       The upgrading of supply to 33 kV from 11 kV and the direct connection
of two textile firms and a steel works to the VRA substation will permit (i)
increases in production, (ii) the use of electrode boilers for steam generation
using surplus hydro energy, and (iii) will relieve existing facilities to allow
for additional load growth in Tema. Tema steelworks is planning to install a
foundry, to rehabilitate its existing steelworks and to install an additional
furnace to increase production. Additional firm power requirements are
expected to be 12 MW and 54 GWh   The Ghana Textile Manufacturing Company is
installing electrode boilers for steam generation. GTMC demand will increase
from 7 MW and 42 GW.h   Similarly, Tema Textiles is installing electrode boilers
thereby increasing demand by 13 MW and 83 GWh.
Methodology for Comparing Costs and Benefits
12.       The study life was taken as 33 years corresponding to the physical
life of the facilities provided by the project. Salvage value was assumed to
be nil. All costs and benefits were expressed in 1976 US dollars with local
components converted at a shadow exchange rate of 1.70 cedis/$. Present values
were computed as at the beginning of 1976.
Generation Costs
13.       The long run marginal cost of generation in Ghana will rise as Kpong,
Bui, and thermal plants are brought on line according to the Acres Engineering
Power and Energy Studies report for VRA of May 1975. Firm loads for each ECG
project component must bear the long run marginal cost of generation as explained
in Chap. 4, para 4.05. The calculation of the long run marginal cost as of the
beginning of 1976 is based upon the costs of Kpong as given in the Kpong apprai-
sal report and Acres' estimates of the cost of Bui and steam-electric thermal
plants which are at present the most economical means of meeting projected load
growth. The long run marginal cost is expected to remain constant as thermal
plants are added and as economies of scale offset real price increases in capi-
tal costs. The capital costs of generating plus the necessary transmission faci-
lities together with operating and maintenance costs are summarised below:

ANNEX 7
Table 2
Page 4 of 8 pages
14.       The service life of Kpong and Bui are taken to be 50 years while
that of steam-electric plants, 25 years. Average incremental costs based
on the sector forecast shown in Annex 5 were calculated as an aDproximation
of the longrun marginal cost. The result is shown in Figure 1 for various
discount rates. As a point of reference, the average incremental cost of
energy from Kpong is 20.3 $mills/kVIh but the total average incremental cost
including future generation plans is 22.9 $mills/kWh as at the beginning
of 1976.
15.       The cost of generation and transmission is shown as a present
value for 6% and 11% discount rates in Table 3.  It is necessary to present
the cost in this manner because the average incremental cost per kwh for
generation and transmission depend on the discount rate. These costs can
not be treated as discrete cash flows but must be considered as economic
costs which depend on the discount rate. The discount rate cap not be fixed
priori because of the joint nature of the distribution and generation invest-
ments. An overall rate of return must be found; thus, it was necessary to
treat generation costs as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Low Voltage Distribution Costs
16.       Low voltage distribution costs must be included in the overall
program to supply electricity to final residential and commercial consumers.
These costs will not be incurred for industries taking 33 kV supply. Total
distribution costs of $300/kV7 were used in the appraisal of the Kpong report
for subtransmission and low voltage. Low voltage is typically 50% of total
distribution cost; therefore, $150/kW of annual incremental demand has been
added to project costs for subtransmission. Additions to low voltage facili-
ties is much more closely in phase with annual increases in peak power (x4)
demand as these facilities are installed primarily to serve new customers and
investments are less lumpy.
Additional Transformers
17.       Additional transformer capacity must be added during the study life
to some subprojects in order to permit loads to grow to line capacities. The
cost is estimated to be $10/kVA. These costs do not add substantially to
program capital investment costs.
Valuation of Benefits
Liberian Tariff as a Proxy for Benefits
18.       The 1976 Tariff and distribution of consumption in Liberia is shown
below using a shadow exchange rate of 1.2 L$/US$.

19.       The mix of consumption in the towns served by this project has been
assumed to be the same as for ECG overall in 1981 in order to compute the
average value per kWh using 75% of the Liberian tariff as a proxy for bene-
fits of consumption in these towns.

20.       The average price which will be paid under the 1976 ECG tariff in
US$ at the shadow exchange rate of 1.70 cedis/$ is:
ECG 1981 %    US$/kWh
Domestic (including 10% tax)                             20         0.0225
Commercial                                               18         0.0428

100        0.0222 average
A comparison of the table above and that in para. 18 shows that the street
lighting and commercial rates are quite similar under both methods of valua-
tion but domestic and industrial consumption are valued 135% and 148% more,
respectively, using 75% of the Liberian tariff as the proxy for benefits,
while the overall increase in value of benefits is 70%.
Interruptible Electricity for Steam Generation
21.       If electrode boilers are used to generate steam which is currently
produced by burning oil, the benefit attributable to the use of electricity
is the resource cost saving to Ghana. This saving is the crude oil plus
refinery and transportation costs but excluding taxes and dealer margins.
If the quantity of steam produced is increased in the future and the indust-
rialists' choice is between oil and electricity, then the benefit of electri-
city consumption can be measured by the consumer cost of the oil alternative
which includes tax and dealer margins.
22.       The value of electricity used for steam generation in place of oil
is shown below.
Official Rate          Shadow Rate
Cedis       US$        Cedis      US$

Consumer cost saving - additional          0.0128       0.0111    0.0142    0.084

These values are based on the 1975 crude oil price of $13.50/bbl.

Firm Industrial Loads At Tema
23.       All loads at Tema other than the interruptible load for steam genera-
tion at Tema are treated as firm loads which bear the long run marginal cost of
generation and transmission in addition to the project costs. The benefits of
the firm consumption are valued at the 1976 tariff since there is no substitute
for this supply or other proxy for evaluation.
Diesel Generation Savings
24.       Fuel and operation and maintenance costs will be saved for existing
diesel generators. Savings will be 0.050 $/kwh based on the following assump-
tions.

O&M                                           0.008

25.       Existing generators at many locations must soon be replaced at a
capital cost of $500/kw capacity.
Diesel Pumping
26.       The alternative to ECG supply for pumping at Weija is diesel pumping.
If the engine is coupled directly to the pump, the cost of the electric motor
is saved. The energy equivalent cost of diesel pumping is estimated to be.

27.       Specific cost and benefit assumptions relating to particular sub-
projects are discussed below.
Aboso Glass Factory
28.       The ADB appraisal report of the loan for the Aboso Glass Factorv
assumes the price of electricity will be at the 1975 rate of 0.013 cedis/kwh
in calculating projected income. The anticipated rate of return is about 20%
by 1980. Assuming all other costs for the Glass Factory remain constant and
a minimum acceptable financial return of 12%, the maximum value of electricity
is about 3.4 times the budgeted amount or 0.026 $/kWh at the shadow exchange
rate.   ssuming that the 1976 tariff increase is passed on to Glass Factory
customers this value becomes 0.034 $/kWh in 1976 terms.

Rates of Return
29.       The rate of return for each subproject and for the total project
was determined by finding the discount rate which equalized the present
value of costs and benefits. The present values were normalized to a per
kWh basis by dividing the present values of costs and benefits by the
present value of consumption, that is:
PV(costs)        =  PV(benefits
PV(consumption)      PV(consumption)
PV(costs)    = PV(project) + PV(additional capital)
+ PV(generation + transmission
PV(benefits  = PV(oil savings) + PV(capital contributions)
+ PV(other savings) + PV(revenues)
30.       Rates of return for each subproject are as follows:

31.       In column (1) the 1976 tariff is used to value consumption benefits
for which there is no substitution such as diesel pumping at Weija or evi-
dence of willingness to pay such as with the Aboso Glass Factory. In column
(2) consideration is made of eliminating the special load tariff for the
three industries served at Tema and setting the tariff for firm power at the
normal industrial tariff. The interruptible load is still valued at the cost
of oil saved by using electrode boilers. In column (3) all firm load consump-
tion for which there is no substitute or other proxy is valued at 1.7 times
the 1976 ECG tariff. The firm load at Tema is valued at the full industrial
tariff. ECG revenues account for approximately 30% of total benefits in
column 1. The graph below shows the variation of the overall project rate of
return with increases in ECG tariff over the average 1976 level following the
elimination of the special load tariff.

32.       The main conclusions that can be drawn from the rate of return cal-
culation are that tariff levels and structure require review and adjustment
in order to prqWVide economically efficient price signals to consumers. This
is particularly true for the special load tariffs.

ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
THIRD EXPANSION PHASE
Assumptions Underlying Financial Forecasts
1.             General:  The 1976 forecast of operating expenses, other than
purchased power, and working capital are based on actuals up to June 1976.
Projections of operating expenses are shown in constant terms. Price con-
tingencies are shown separately.
2.             Energy Sales:  Forecasts are based on appraisal estimates
which are substantially in line with ECG's own projections and the projec-
tions prepared by consultants (Acres) within the framework of the Kpong
feasibility report. The 1976 estimate is in line with actual sales up to
June 1976.
3.             Average Revenue/kWh:  The basis is the expected result of the
tariff increase of October 1976.
4.             Future Tariff Increases:  Projections are tailored to provide
ECG with the additional revenues to achieve the required 8% return on ECG's
rate base.
5.             Purchased Power:  The basis is the forecast power purchases
times the average VRA rate resulting from the September 1976 increase.
Additionally an overhead allowance of 0.2 Mills/kWh has been added.
6.             Generation and Standby:  The 1976 estimates were increases
10% p.a. to reflect the sales growth to ECG's minor centers supplied by
diesel stations.
7.             Distribution, Transport and Administration:  The 1976 estimates
are held constant to reflect the targets under the proposed project to
increase staff productivity and to renew ECG's vehicle park.
8.             Future Bulk Rate Increases:  Projections are based on VRA's
revenue requirements to meet its agreed rate of return targets.
9.             Price Congingencies:  Estimates are based on the recently con-
cluded three year contract with ECG's unions implying salary/wage increases
of 25% in 1977 and 5% thereafter. A new contract has been assumed for 1980.
Unit fuel costs have been assumed to increase 10% p.a. Miscellaneous mater-
ials are expected to increase initially 25% p.a. with yearly rates dropping
to 15% by 1980.



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 2 pages
10.            Depreciation:  5% on average gross fixed assets, an approximate
reflection of historical values.
11.             Other Income:  A constant sum of 0 300,000 has been assumed to
reflect income from installation charges and miscellaneous fees and profits.
0 160,000 have been allowed for investment income.
12.            Debt Service:  Interest - on existing debts as per actual loan
documents. For the proposed Bank and on-lent IDA Credit, the Bank's standard
terms have been applied. Future borrowing is estimated to cost 10% p.a.
13.            Amortization:  On existing debts, the scheduling is in line
with the Government's approval (i) to require payments of all arrears on the
on-lent IDA I and KfW I Credits by 1977 and (ii) to extend the maturities of
the on-lent IDA II and KfW II Credits from 1977 to 1982 and 1984 respectively.
The Bank's standard terms have been applied to the proposed lending to ECG.
14.             Construction Program:  Proposed project as per appraised cost
information and construction program. The next major investment program has
been estimated on the basis of unit investment cost of US$ 300 (1976 prices)
per kW demand. This basis has been derived from the cost of the proposed
project. Minor miscellaneous investments have been estimated at roughly
0 500,000 p.a. as per ECG's information for 1976/77.
15.            Plant in Operation:  The proposed project is assumed to be
fully in service by the end of 1980.
16.             Investments:  Entry reflects ECG holding 96,000 ordinary
shares of a local cable manufacturer.
17.             Cash-Operational Requirements:  Estimates reflect requirements
of 1 month payroll and fuel expenses, 2 months purchased power expenses and 3
months debt service.
18.            Accounts Receivables:  Starting in 1977 estimates are based on
3 months billing.
19.             Inventories:  Held constant at 1976 levels to reflect ECG's
efforts to control further increases.
20.            Rural Electrification-Receivables:  1976 entry reflects the
Government payment of 0 1.0 as the first installment. In 1977 the Government
is expected to have reimbursed ECG fully. Thereafter, regular settlement has
been assumed.
21.            Accounts Payable:  Estimates are based on the mid 1976 result.
As ECG will actually be paying VRA's September 1976 billing in 12 monthly
installments, 0 790,000 are therefore judged to remain outstanding in this
respect at the end of 1976. Accounts payable are estimated to grow at
¢ 600,000 p.a. reflecting approximately the growth rate in sales.
22.            Rural Electrification-Payables:  1976 entry reflects Government
advances for capital works in rural areas.
