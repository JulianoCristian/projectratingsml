The Project contributes to the\n            second phase of the National Program for Decentralized Rural\n            Development. The extension is necessary to due to the\n            reasons highlighted below: (a) as a results of this\n            year's food crisis, the project supports 170 rural\n            communes with the provision of food and grain subsidies to\n            poor and vulnerable households; in partnership with the\n            National Coordination of the Project, SONAGES, Mayors and\n            their Councils, and this activity is currently in full swing\n            and will continue for the remaining of the year 2012 and\n            beyond; (b) with respect to the complexity of procurement\n            procedures at the level of rural communes, and on the basis\n            of the experience of the last three years, completion of\n            planned investment for 2012 will not become effective before\n            the end of the first quarter of 2013; and (c) with municipal\n            and legislative elections scheduled for December 2012, this\n            is impacting key local development actors - mayors,\n            municipal councilors and members of Village Development\n            Councils - as this may delay implementation of communal\n            investments and activities."}, "docdt": "2012-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
