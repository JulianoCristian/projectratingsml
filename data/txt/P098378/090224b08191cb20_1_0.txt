                         The May 28 to June 8, 2012 supervision mission recommended to schedule the next mission in November 2012. However, the country entered an intense political process that has
                         led to the successful organization of the combined municipal and legislative elections December 2, 2012. Organizing a formal supervision mission with field visits, discussions with
                         mayors, community representatives and local partners of the project was therefore not possible in November 2012. An alternative was to organize a technical mission with the Project

                         (i) progress towards PDO achievement; ( ii) components’ performance; (iii) fiduciary management; (iv) results of the emergency food (cereals) distribution to drought-affected poor
                         households and Malian refugees; and (v) state of the follow-up CBRD III project preparation. The review covered the 9-months period from January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012.

                         In general, the CBRD II Project is performing well toward achieving its development objective. The overall results are satisfactory with the Project including Triggers' achievements,
                         intermediate results and indicators of results. All targets in year 4 (December 2011) are met or exceeded significantly, allowing to state that the objectives of the project will be
                         achieved. All key indicators are filled annually.
                         From January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012, the average of physical implementation rate of the project is 76 %. This rate is significantly higher than that recorded end September
                         of 2009, 2010 and 201.
                         For the 9 months of year 2012, the financial execution rate is 71%,
                         At September 30, 2012 the cumulative disbursement rate is 95.50 % since effectiveness of the project.
                         In 2012, 87% of the rural communes, obtained a physical implementation rate above 50% ; 100 % of the communes plan effectively their annual investment plans ; 98 % of the
                         investment are technically audited satisfactory ; 100 % of the communes are financial audit rating is satisfactory. That confirm that local development mechanism is now rooted in the
                         practices of the rural communities and particularly the difficulties in procurement are better managed and mastered by the mayors and municipal councils.
                         Distribution of cereals to poor households and Malian refugees has been achieved successfully. At total 36 853 households (221,118 persons) received 5,021 tons of cereals (maize,
                         rice) ; refugees received 140 tons of cereals.
