1. The closing date for Burkina Faso, Second Phase COMMUNITY BASED RURAL
   DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, Credit No4281 - BUR, P098378 will be extended from
   November 30, 2012 until May 31, 2013.

2. The objective of the Project is to support the Recipient's rural communes in planning
   and implementing local development activities in a participatory and sustainable
   manner. The Project contributes to the second phase of the National Program for
   Decentralized Rural Development.

The last implementation support mission took place May 28 to June 8, 2012, and, it is
noted that the project is well on the way toward achieving its development objective. All
performance indicators and triggers have been met or exceeded their planned targets. As
of June 8, 2012: the percentage of households in supported villages using basic services
(primary schools, health center, water source) is 65.12; the percentage of investment
maintained in a satisfactory way is 100%; and the percentage of Rural Municipal
Councils with a satisfactory rating during the annual performance review stands at 100;
the percentage of Municipal Councils in which planning functions are carried out
satisfactorily is 100 %.

Overall results are rated satisfactory

3. The last ISR is rated satisfactory. There are no outstanding audit reports.


The government has asked for an extension of the closing date from November 30 2012
to May 31, 2013. The proposed extension is necessary to due to the reasons highlighted
below:

      a) As a results of this year’s food crisis, the project supports 170 rural communes
         with the provision of food and grain subsidies to poor and vulnerable households;
         in partnership with the National Coordination of the Project, SONAGES, Mayors
         and their Councils, and this activity is currently in full swing and will continue for
         the remaining of the year 2012 and beyond.

   b) With respect to the complexity of procurement procedures at the level of rural
      communes, and on the basis of the experience of the last three years, completion
      of planned investment for 2012 will not become effective before the end of the
      first quarter of 2013.

   c) With municipal and legislative elections scheduled for December 2012, this is
      impacting key local development actors - mayors, municipal councilors and
      members of Village Development Councils - as this may delay implementation of
      communal investments and activities.

4. An action plan to complete the project is attached. This will be the first extension of
the project.
