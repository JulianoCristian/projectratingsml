                         At December 31, 2011, the cumulative disbursement rate is 71.12% since effectiveness of the project.
                         In 2011 a total of 224 of 302 municipalities or 85%, obtained a physical implementation rate above 60% and less than 25% of communes have had a delivery rate of less than 50%

                         mastered by the mayors and municipal councils.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In 2012, municipal and legislative coupled elections scheduled for December 2012 is already providing various stresses in key local development actors (mayors, municipal
                         councilors and members of Village Development Councils, etc.) as this may delay implementation in communal investments.
                         The project supports all the 176 rural communes food deficits through the purchase transaction and distribution of grain to poor vulnerable households, this activity is in full swing in
                         partnership between the National Coordination of the Project, the SONAGES, Mayors and their Councils, and CVD. This activity will lead to until the next harvest in October 2012 and
                         can be beyond.
                         The government has asked for an extension of the closing date to May 31, 2013 due to the related above situation of 2012.
                          The preparation of the third phase has started in January 2012. The concept Notes Review held on March 21, 2012 authorized the official launch of the preparation of the Project.
                         A successful pre-evaluation mission was conducted May 10 - 25, 2012.
