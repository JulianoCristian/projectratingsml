                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Procurement at the commune level: Current procurement guidelines are too complex for rural communes, which lack capacity to follow these guidelines. As a result, there is a need

                         to simplify procurement guidelines that take into account the capacity constraints atthe commune level. This was a recommendation of the last supervision mission, and the need has
                         been relayed to the Government by other local development actors and projects as well as rural commune representatives themselves. A national committee has been set up to work
                         and make proposals, and first results are expected to be available before the next supervision mission.

                         New rural land tenure law: The effective application of the new law on rural land (adopted in 2010) is a major challenge for the Government. The Millennium Challenge Account
                         (MCA) is right now supporting the implementation of the Law in 17 rural communes. The project currently supports the preparation of a national action plan, which will initially cover a
                         period of 5 years. A donor round table is scheduled for June 2011 with the goal to secure donors' alignment and financial commitment to support the implementation of this action
                         plan.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
