                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to support the Recipient's rural communes in planning and implementing local development activities in a participatory and
                         sustainable manner. The Project contributes to the second phase of the National Program for Decentralized Rural Development.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In general, the Project is performing well toward achieving its development objective. The last supervision mission, which took place in April 2011, noted that all performance
                         indicators and triggers have already been met, eighteen months before the closing date. The annual physical average rate of execution as of December 31, 2010 as noted by the
                         mission is 85.5%. This rate is almost 13 percentage points higher compared to 2009 when it was 72.7%. The annual rate of financial execution has also improved significantly,

                         passing from 43.5% in 2009 to 51.7% at the end of 2010; through training, procurements procedures are now much better mastered by rural communes. However, the difference
                         between physical and financial rates of execution remains large, mainly due to the time delay between the transfer of project resources to the Public Treasury and the actual payment
                         of service providers (for services rendered to rural communes). The agreed mechanism of flow of funds indeed requires that service provided are paid by the treasury for the services
                         they provide to rural communes.

                         the Forest Investment Program and the Decentralization Project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Procurement at the commune level: As was noted during the last two supervision missions, current procurement guidelines continue to be too complex for rural communes. Although
                         these communes have been demonstrating greater understanding of procurement procedures, thanks to training and capacity building activities, it remains critical for authorities to
                         help simplify procurement guidelines that take into account the capacity constraints at the commune level. The national committee set up to work on this issue was expected to issue

                         their report in April 2011, but this report is not yet prepared. This is in part due part to the high mobility of the committee members, and in part to the recent social unrest in the country
                         which temporarily shifted attention away structural reforms.

                         New rural land tenure law: The effective application of the new law on rural land (adopted in 2010) is a major challenge for the Government. The Millennium Challenge Account
                         (MCA) is right now supporting the implementation of the Law in 17 rural communes. The project currently supports the preparation of a national action plan, which will initially cover a
                         period of 5 years. A donor round table is scheduled for June 2011 with the goal to secure donors' alignment and financial commitment to support the implementation of this action
                         plan.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
