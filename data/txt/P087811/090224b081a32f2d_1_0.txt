                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective is to streamline the compulsory standards requirements for business, develop systems to enhance product quality and safety,
                         and increase enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors. The key project outcomes will be a decrease in the cost of regulatory compliance for business and, in the
                         longer term, an increase in the share of non-gold trade with WTO partners.

                         Project has now entered the final stage of its graduation process to international recognition status by ILAC, which is expected to announce its final decision on full membership of the
                         Kyrgyz Accreditation Center shortly. Notwithstanding the above mentioned progress in the development of the Kyrgyz Republic's quality infrastructure, the adoption of quality
                         management systems by enterprises while increasing remains slow, due to a combination of factors ranging from competing investment priorities for companies that continue to face
                         difficult economic conditions to the relatively low level of sophistication of local companies and buyers’ markets in which they operate. At Project closure, 12 companies in a wide
                         range of sectors had acquired international certification of quality management systems (i.e. ISO) in sectors ranging from agribusiness and foodstuff to manufacturing (cement, bulbs)
                         and services. Of these companies, only two benefited from the support of the pilot Matching Grant Facility set up under the project. As of en February, 2013 disbursement levels
                         stood at 90.47% of Grant funds with a total value of USD 4,523,373 while an additional 4.75% is expected to be disbursed by project closure on March 31, 2013 under signed
                         contracts currently under implementation.
