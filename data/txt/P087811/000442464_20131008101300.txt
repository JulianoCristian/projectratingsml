1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic environment

1.      Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Kyrgyz Republic’s political and
economic transition during the 1990’s was mired by heavy cross-winds and severe economic
losses. The immediate impact was a cumulative decline in GDP of 54 percent from 1991 to 1995
and a sharp increase in inflation. After a short recovery in 1996, the Kyrgyz economy was again
severely affected by the Russian financial crisis in 1998: annual GDP growth fell to about 2
percent, inflation reached 36 percent and the Kyrgyz Som depreciated against the dollar by 43
percent. The economy started to show signs of recovery in 2000, with GDP growth rebounding
to more than 5 percent in 2001. Inflation decreased below the two digits level and the foreign
exchange rate stabilized.

2.      In response to the tumultuous economic climate of the 1990s, the country embarked on a
number of policy reforms to improve governance, enhance economic liberalization, and promote
privatization and financial sector development. These efforts resulted in the Kyrgyz Republic
accessing the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1998 and establishing itself as one of the
more pro-active economic reformers in the region.

3.      Nevertheless, the Kyrgyz Republic continued to face significant challenges. The country
lacked natural resources, with the exception of gold and water, and is geographically landlocked.
The economy was mostly based on agricultural production, hydropower generation and a
declining gold production.

4.      In addition, the business environment remained inadequate and was not conducive to
foreign investment and private sector growth. As a result, private sector investment was muted
and foreign direct investment in the non-gold sectors was negligible. Perhaps more importantly,
the Kyrgyz Republic’s trading gap with other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries widened as the country failed to capitalize on price stability and growing demand from
its key traditional regional trading partners, Russia and Kazakhstan.

5.     Private sector growth was also dampened by political turmoil. The first elected President
of the Republic was forcibly removed from office in 2005. Political and social tensions were in
turn aggravated by a lackluster economy with limited opportunities for private sector investment.

6.      Kyrgyz policymakers faced numerous challenges on policies to accelerate private sector
investment and export diversification. The policy reform agenda included the following areas: (i)
lowering administrative barriers to businesses (notably in the areas of taxation and inspections);
(ii) enhancing enforcement of property and creditors’ rights; (iii) improving the lending
infrastructure and legal framework; (iv) modernizing and streamlining the customs regime and
cross-border environment; (v) targeting investment in infrastructure notably to support trade; and



                                                1
(vi) streamlining and aligning the domestic standards and certification regime on international
standards.

Reforming the Standards Regime to Support Trade-Led Growth

7.     Despite the country’s entry into the WTO in December 1998, the Kyrgyz Republic had
not been able to reap the benefits of its WTO membership to access new markets. In addition, the
country’s trade position with traditional neighboring CIS markets was deteriorating. For example,
while the value of imports from Russia had doubled from 1999 to 2005, the value of exports to
Russia declined by 7 percent. Similarly, for the same period, exports to Kazakhstan had
increased by 24 percent while imports increased by 156 percent. The principal factors behind the
disappointing trade performance ranged from shortage of resources to inadequate infrastructure
and lack of marketing capabilities, they were also largely related to regulatory and institutional
constraints affecting the competitiveness of domestic companies and products. Among these,
constraints stemming from regulatory differences in standards needed to be addressed urgently to
allow the country to adapt to WTO requirements to benefit from trade liberalization and to keep
pace with trading partners.

8.     As Kyrgyz Republic’s traditional regional trading partners were progressively moving
towards adoption of international standards, the Kyrgyz Republic recognized the urgency of
adopting these standards as a prerequisite for successfully engaging in the increasingly
competitive trade arena. The Law on the Fundamentals of Technical Regulation in the Kyrgyz
Republic, developed with the assistance of USAID and adopted in April 2004, set an ambitious
agenda for the country’s transition to international standards.

9.      Furthermore, the absence of an internationally recognized metrology and quality
infrastructure was hindering economic development as it raised the country’s vulnerability to
non-tariff barriers to trade, that in turn delayed market access and further industrial and
economic development. As a result, harmonization of domestic standards with international
standards and the establishment of a reliable metrology and quality infrastructure became high
priorities on the agenda of policymakers.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.     According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the Development Grant
Agreement, the development objectives of the project were to: i) streamline the national technical
regulation and standards framework for business; ii) develop systems to enhance quality and
safety of products; and iii) increase enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors.

11.     The key project outcome indicator was to be a decrease in the cost of regulatory
compliance for business. The PAD further states that although it may not have been measurable
during the life of the project, the project was also expected to result in the longer-term in an
increase in the share of non-gold trade with existing WTO partners. However, this is not
interpreted as part of the PDO because the results were not intended to be visible during the life
of the project.




                                                2
12.     Key results indicators of project activities included: (i) development and adoption of
Technical Regulations (TRs) in key regulated sectors; (ii) removal of unnecessary mandatory
certification requirements; (iii) reduction in the list of products subject to mandatory
certification; (iv) increase in the percentage of national documentary standards harmonized with
international standards; (v) increase in the number of measurement and calibration services with
lower associated uncertainties; (vi) establish an Accreditation Body compliant with ISO/IEC
17011; (vii) at least two testing laboratories and two certifying bodies accredited according to
international standards; and (viii) at least ten companies certified under ISO 9001, ISO 22000
and/or HACCP).

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

13.    By reducing technical barriers to trade such as decreasing the cost of regulatory
compliance and enhancing the quality and safety of products the project was expected to boost
the competitiveness of local businesses and efficiency of public sector agencies. The targeted
focus of Technical Regulations supported by the project on the agribusiness sector was aimed at
promoting growth of exports over a longer timeframe, particularly those to non-traditional WTO-
member markets thus helping to diversify the country’s export base of agricultural products. The
growth in exports was expected to have a ripple effect on other producers along the supply chain
such as raw materials suppliers, transport services providers, freight handlers, and ultimately
workers in those enterprises that benefited directly and indirectly from the opportunities
generated by the activities of this project.

14.    The adoption of quality standards through the reinforcement of the Metrology, Standards,
Testing and Quality (MSTQ) infrastructure in line with international standards was expected to
generate important benefits to consumers and the environment. Better quality and safety of
products would protect consumers from potential hazards as well as provide them with goods of
higher quality standards. TRs on environmental protection would minimize the adverse impact
from production activity on the environment.

15.     The institutional improvements engendered by the project were expected to benefit
numerous government agencies that were linked to MSTQ. In addition, linkages between Center
for Standards and Metrology (CSM, previously NISM) and institutions of higher learning would
contribute to research activity at academic institutions that could lead to improvements in
industrial productivity.

1.5    Original Components

16.    In order to achieve its objectives, the project was designed with the following major
output components:



                                               3
Component 1: Technical Regulations (TR) – US$1,482,000

17.    The assistance under this component would help facilitate the transition to the new
standards framework by building capacity of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism
(MITT/MoER)1 and other agencies involved in the development of technical regulation.

18.        Under this component, the project would provide support in the following areas:

      i.   development of a work plan for implementation of the Law on the Fundamentals of
           Technical Regulation (LFTR), which had been approved in 2004;
     ii.   development of technical regulations in critical sectors with high contribution to GDP
           and export/import substitution potential such as agro-business and food processing;
    iii.   design and establishment of an integrated information system linking MITT/MoER, the
           National Institute of Standards and Metrology (NISM/CSM)2 and different line ministries
           and regulatory agencies responsible for development of sector specific technical
           regulations; and
    iv.    establishment of the required WTO Enquiry Point for processing inquiries and
           notification of adopted technical regulations and related regulatory documents to the
           WTO and its members.


Component 2: Metrology and Standards - US$2,238,700

19.        This component would:

      i.   provide critical etalons, instrumentation and electronic test measuring equipment to help
           the metrology institute provide basic measurement needs required by the industry and
           ensure the accuracy and traceability of measurements performed by the domestic
           laboratory infrastructure; and
     ii.   establish procedures for preparation, adoption and application of standards in accordance
           with the WTO’s Agreement on the Technical Barrier to Trade.


Component 3: Accreditation and Quality Enhancement - US$1,130,900

20.        Assistance in this component would focus on three areas as described below.

           (i) Accreditation (US$200,000)

21.     As part of its technical regulation and standards reform, the Kyrgyz Government was
planning to spin-off the accreditation function from NISM/CSM and set up an independent,
internationally recognized accreditation scheme. For the new accreditation body to gain
international recognition, its structure was to be in compliance with the general requirements of

1
    During the course of the Project the MITT was restructured and renamed MoER.
2
    During the course of the Project the NISM was restructured and renamed CSM.


                                                         4
the applicable standard for accreditation bodies (ISO/IEC 17011) related to governance and
structural arrangements.

22.     Since the ability of the new national accreditation body to attain international recognition
would largely depend on its institutional design, governance arrangements, staff skills and
expertise, this sub-component would provide institutional development assistance to help
structure and build-up the accreditation body in accordance with international standards.

       (ii) Testing Laboratories and Certifying bodies (US$830,900)

23.     This sub-component would provide support on a pilot basis for upgrading and
accreditation of selected laboratories operating in the agro-business and food processing sectors
as well as selected certifying bodies in quality management systems and products. The laboratory
and certifying bodies involved in this demonstration pilot would be selected based on the
assessment to be carried out by a technical consultant.

       (iii) Quality at enterprise level (US$100,000)

24.     This sub-component would provide assistance on a pilot basis to enterprises willing to
introduce quality in their production lines and management systems (International Organization
for Standardization, ISO and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, HACCP certifications).
Procedures, guidelines and eligibility criteria for selecting beneficiaries and administrating the
sub-grant facility would be set forth in the Guidelines for Operation of Sub-grants to be
developed by the Recipient and agreed with the World Bank.

25.    Although the grant scheme was envisioned to be relatively small (US$100,000), it was
expected to be extremely useful for its demonstration effect and could also help mobilize
additional resources from donors, notably in the form of commercial credit lines.


Component 4: Project Management (US$217,500)

26.     This component would provide support to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The
start-up cost of the PIU would be funded by a Project Preparation Facility.

27.     PIU staff would include an independent Project Manager with basic knowledge of
technical regulation and MSTQ-related issues, a procurement specialist, and a disbursement
specialist selected on a competitive basis. The project would also set up a Steering Committee
consisting of representatives of the Government, various relevant agencies and ministries as well
as private sector representatives. The Steering Committee would provide policy guidance and
ensure that Project activities are implemented in accordance with the project development
objectives.

PHRD Grant

28.     Given the complexity and scope of the TR reforms, the Bank applied for a Japan Policy
and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Technical Assistance Grant (TF090641) in the
amount of US$299,600 on behalf of the Government. The Grant Agreement was signed on
March 10, 2008. Grant proceeds were used to: (i) help address implementation capacity issues in
the area of legal metrology, conformity assessment and market surveillance; (ii) strengthen
overall Project management and coordination; (iii) support implementation agencies’ outreach
efforts to increase public awareness of the benefits of the TR reforms to businesses and
consumers, and (iv) launch and manage the Matching Grant Facility for adoption of product and
quality system at enterprise level.

Changes to IDA Grant Agreement

29.    Several changes to the Project in terms of the Closing Date, implementation
arrangements, and reallocation of funds were approved. Each of these modifications to the Grant
Agreement was considered Level 2 restructuring that did not affect the Project’s PDOs. These
changes are summarized below:

Extensions of Project Closing Date

      First extension: due to the technical complexity of the MSTQ reform agenda and to the
       disruptive political events that transpired during the first half of 2010, the Bank
       management approved an extension of the closing date to October 31, 2012 on April 15,
       2011.
      Second extension: a five month extension was requested to complete an important
       ongoing equipment contract delivery consisting of high precision metrology equipment as
       well as to allow project stakeholders to make more progress towards international
       accreditation of laboratories (one of the intermediate indicators). The Bank management
       approved the extension of the closing date to March 31, 2013 on September 4, 2012.

Creation of a new expenditure category

30.     Creation of expenditure category “training:” During the early stages of implementation it
became clear that staff from the agencies in charge of MSTQ – CSM, Kyrgyz Accreditation
Center (KAC) and the TR Department needed to participate and network with their counterparts
in other countries by participating in international congresses and fora. These activities were
expected to deepen the knowledge and understanding of how other long-established
internationally-known counterpart agencies worked as well as increase the visibility of the
Kyrgyz Republic’s MSTQ infrastructure. Bank management approved the amendment dated
December 3, 2008 introducing a new expenditure category “training” defined as Project-related
study tours, training course, seminars, workshops and other training activities not included under
goods or services.




                                                6
Reallocation of funds

31.     Reallocation of funds to category “works:” At the time of project preparation the Bank
was not aware of some issues concerning the physical conditions of the locations for the CSM
reference laboratories. As a result, it became necessary to retrofit the facilities that would house
the etalons or national references of basic measures. Thus, the Bank approved an amendment
dated October 8, 2007 to reallocate funds from the “goods” category to “works” that was to be
used exclusively for construction to bring the facilities that would house the metrology labs up to
international standards. The reallocated amount was supported by savings in the actual costs of
equipment as originally planned.

32.     Reallocation of funds to category “operating costs:” this reallocation was needed to re-
inject money into operating costs for the PIU in view of an underestimate of salary expenses
resulting from the extended implementation period. An amount of SDR75,338 was shifted from
“Re-financing of funds for the project preparation” to the Operating Costs category. The Bank
management approved an amendment dated May 13, 2010

33.     Reallocation of funds to category “operating costs:” this reallocation was needed to re-
inject additional funds into operating costs for the PIU to account to the second project extension
of five months. An amount of SDR23,000 was reallocated to Operating Costs from the Sub-
Grants category. The Bank approved an amendment dated September 9, 2012


2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis

34.      The RTBET project was designed to provide assistance to streamline the technical
regulation framework and develop and strengthen the Metrology, Standards, Testing and Quality
infrastructure. In the design of the project the Bank benefitted from prior support from
multilateral and bilateral donors, in particular the EU, the Swiss and USAID a series of
initiatives had been undertaken to provide assistance in those areas, which culminated with the
passage of the Law on the Fundamentals of Technical Regulation in 2004. The Project had a
well-placed emphasis on building capacity and culture change through the introduction of best
practices. The skill mix of the team appropriately covered numerous aspects of MSTQ.

35.     In the design of the project the Bank focused on key challenges associated with Technical
Barriers to Trade that had not yet been addressed by any specific donor – mainly SECO/ITC
(Swiss), USAID/Pragma, GTZ (Germany) and EU TACIS, as most of the donor focus had been
more on Administrative Barriers to Trade. Project design thus addressed key gaps the Bank had
identified to help the transition to an effective modern standards regime and quality
infrastructure.

36.    The analysis underpinning the enterprise competitiveness objective was limited in scope.
The project’s support of enterprise competitiveness was part of the third component which dealt



                                                 7
with the upgrading of selected laboratories operating in the agri-business and food processing
sectors and by a small quality enhancement sub-component that provided financial support to
companies seeking to introduce quality in their production process through ISO certification.
However, increased competitiveness hinges on multiple factors, among which those targeted by
the Project were important components. Production efficiency and product quality are necessary
elements of competitive advantage. Achieving lower costs than competitors involves numerous
elements of the production process of which the regulatory cost of compliance is only one albeit
an important one. The comparative costs of other resources, which in the case of the Kyrgyz
Republic involve labor and natural resources, are also key determinants of competitive advantage.
At the same time the productivity of the resources used in production, which in turn depends on
the technology used in the production process, will determine the degree of cost advantages. But
sustainable competitive advantage also depends on the extent to which producers can
differentiate themselves from competitors in other markets. During preparation it might have
been useful to have discussed in greater detail the benefits of the project relative to any other
barriers to competitiveness, which may have existed at the time and which could have been taken
into consideration in identifying expected project outcomes or in broadening the scope of the
Project. Greater analysis of the demand for ISO certification by companies seeking to enhance
their product quality may have helped to identify the degree of funding that was in fact needed.

37.     At the time of preparation, other Bank operations were tackling non-MSTQ related
competitiveness issues. One of these projects was the Agribusiness and Marketing Project
(P049724) whose Development Objective was to expand the level of activity of processing,
marketing, and trade enterprises downstream of the farm-gate, to increase the number and
economic importance of producer organizations, and to improve the functioning of markets and
trade linkages between producers, and primary and secondary level trade organizations. The
project became effective in 2005 and closed in 2013, for a total budget of US$13 million. When
preparing the RTBET Project, the Bank’s team interacted greatly with their counterparts in the
agribusiness project. Similar efforts during appraisal in addressing other key challenges and
opportunities faced by the Project might have been helpful.

38.    The linkage between outputs and outcomes in the case of this project was also dependent
on the expected response by Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and by foreign buyers. To what extent would
exporters invest in quality improvements in their production process; and what would have been
the acceptance by foreign buyers of Kyrgyz product standards? The answers to these questions
might have helped set realistic expectations for outcomes related to the matching grant sub-
component.

Assessment of the project design

39.     The objective of the RTBET project in terms of streamlining national technical
regulations, enhancing quality and safety of products and increasing competitiveness was
consistent with the priority areas established in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of May
2003, which identified three priority areas of intervention: (i) promoting private sector-led
growth; (ii) preventing the deterioration of key infrastructure and social services; and (iii)
addressing governance constraints to growth and poverty reduction. The project’s three PDOs
covered a broad agenda for quality standards and competitiveness comprised of technically
complex components. Recognizing that quality and safety standards affect all sectors of the


                                               8
economy, which would have been unwieldy for a small project like the RTBET, the Bank
decided to focus on selected industries, principally agribusiness and food processing industries
because of their export potential and their importance to consumer safety, as well as the
medical/pharmaceutical industry among others.

40.     Since the beneficiaries included private sector enterprises there was some measure of
external oversight of project activities. Industry representatives were invited to participate in the
Project’s Steering Committee, which was seen as essential to ensuring that the new system works
for the benefit of entrepreneurs.

41.     The PDOs focused on the transition from the old Soviet standards to the new
international standards that have become the pillars of globalizing markets. The three main
project components addressed the essential elements of the strategy to enhance the quality and
safety of production, which would eventually be expected to strengthen the international
competitiveness of selected sectors. Due to its technical nature however, the RTBET project
became a complex undertaking that called for reforming the legal, regulatory and institutional
framework with a new quality infrastructure that replaced the earlier compulsory Soviet era
system prone to rent seeking. Institutional adjustments and “mind-change” required to enable the
transition from the old Soviet-style standards system to a modern WTO compliant one were
going to be challenging tasks.

42.     The design of the three project objectives was somewhat ambitious given the institutional
development requirements that were necessary to achieve the overall objectives even if only
focused on selected sectors. The connection between the project components of i) improving the
quality and safety of products in targeted sectors through new technical regulations; ii) upgrading
the national network of testing laboratories, and iii) increasing enterprise competitiveness in pilot
sectors to the PDOs was not as strong or clearly justified as implied in the PAD. With regards to
increasing non-gold trade with existing WTO partners, the design aimed a bit high in terms of
development outcomes during such a short time with limited funds.

43.      The PDO of increasing enterprise competitiveness by upgrading testing laboratories that
would be used by exporters in the agri-business/food processing sectors and a US$100,000
facility to support companies seeking quality enhancements in their production process was not
realistic. It fell short of adequately addressing such a broad area as enterprise competitiveness
and the multiple factors that contribute to competitiveness.

44.     Given the small size of the project and its focus on the MSTQ infrastructure a narrower
scope of objectives could have been considered, for example, just reducing the cost of regulatory
compliance and upgrading the quality of the production process based on micro-indicators of
outcome pertaining to the agri-business/food processing sector, and eliminate the objective of
increasing enterprise competitiveness.

45.     A Quality Assessment (QALP-2) by the Bank performed in June 2010 rated the quality of
the design as Satisfactory.




                                                 9
Adequacy of Government commitment

46.    As the first CIS country to enter the WTO in 1998, the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic was fully committed to the elimination of technical barriers to trade which was
demonstrated by the passage of the 2004 Law. Country ownership for the Project was constant
at the highest levels in the country including the Presidency, and relevant ministries, notably
MITT/MoER.

Assessment of risks

47.    The highest risk factor for the Project as identified in the PAD was the country political
risk and possible instability of the Government and to a lesser degree, a lack of cooperation
between the implementing agencies. Going into this project the Bank was aware that because of
the high risk factors and technical complexity of project activities the key to its success was
going to be close supervision by an experienced team that would be committed to managing the
project until its completion. Greater consideration of the financial risks such as insufficient
support from donor agencies or Government budgetary restrictions that could challenge the
sustainability of the project would have been helpful in determining alternative strategies to
address these contingencies.

48.    Given the high risk factor and technical complexity of the project perhaps a longer period
of implementation could have been considered as well as a larger amount of funding that would
have provided the flexibility to finance additional equipment for laboratories that may not have
been foreseen at the time of preparation.

2.2    Implementation

49.    Successful implementation of this project can be attributed to Government commitment,
management effectiveness by the implementing agencies and proactive supervision by Bank staff
and the PIU. A Quality Assessment (QALP-2) performed in June 2010 rated the Implementation
Progress as Satisfactory.

50.   The following factors are considered instrumental to the Project’s implementation and
outcomes:

51.    Government commitment: Government commitment to the project was instrumental in
overcoming some serious obstacles during its implementation. Difficult political circumstances
in 2010-2011 on the other hand affected negatively project implementation and contributed to
the need for extension of the closing date by 23 months (Section 1.7). While the availability of
budgetary resources was always an issue reflecting the broader poor state of public finance in the
country, the overall commitment of the Borrower manifested itself through the life of the project
that underwent frequent social and political upheavals in the country. Despite high staff turnover
at the Ministry level – nine ministers of economy from project negotiations to closure, the
independent Kyrgyz Accreditation Center (KAC) was allowed to develop and its creation which
had disrupted earlier vested interests was never seriously challenged.




                                               10
52.    Continuity of Bank staff team: This is a project whose small dollar amount could have
rendered it easily vulnerable to being crowded out by larger issues and projects in the country
dialogue. The fact that it did not suffer this fate is due greatly to the dedication and to the lasting
continuity of the staff team – both field office staff and the TTL, who remained with the Project
from the beginning.

53.     Quality of experts and consultants: International and local consultants provided valuable
input in the development of new TRs. A highly experienced international advisor on technical
regulations also supported capacity building. The work by these experts contributed to the
project exceeding significantly the original target for approval of technical regulations and the
reduction in the number of products subject to mandatory certification. Other consultants who
had been involved in the development of metrology institutes in other countries assisted with the
identification of critical instrumentation for the development of the metrology infrastructure.

54.      Twinning arrangements involving CSM and KAC and their counterparts overseas was
a very effective tool for strengthening institutional development within a short timeframe. The
brokered twinning arrangements with internationally recognized peer technical agencies such as
the one between CSM and the German Metrology Institute (PTB) and KAC with the Turkish
Accreditation body (TurKak) led to the establishment of excellent cooperation between these
institutions. In the case of CSM their relationship with PTB also facilitated the challenging task
of selecting the type of metrology equipment best suited to the specific needs of the country.
TurKak was instrumental in preparing KAC’s full membership in ILAC.

55.    Coordination with Donors: The RTBET project became a privileged platform for donor
coordination on activities of projects funded by various donors active in the area of MSTQ,
innovation, trade facilitation and SME development. The nature of collaboration with other
donors was purely operational and not formalized in specific co-financing agreements. The
RTBET project was able to provide funding for investment in the procurement and installation of
equipment, while most other donors had only marginal resources for the purchase of goods. At
the same time other donors’ projects complemented the RTBET investment by contributing with
resources devoted to technical assistance, training and consulting.

56.     For example, cooperation with the German bilateral donor GTZ/GIZ in the area of
technical regulations supported the development of Technical Regulations by retaining local
consultants to actively participate to the Technical Committees for the definition of draft TRs. In
the area of metrology GIZ provided an international consultant on the International Standards
Regime. GIZ also supported the renovation of the facilities to house KAC, while the project
financed the equipment and the creation of the institutional website. The ITC/SECO project
retained an international consultant to provide technical assistance to KAC. This type of
collaboration is expected to maintain donor engagement in supporting the sustainability of the
PDOs.

57.     Disruptive country risk factors: Political instability contributed to delays in Project
implementation that were resolved through two extensions of the closing date of 23 months in
total (Section 1.7). The first elected president of the Republic was forcibly removed from office
in 2005 after nearly 15 years in power following a disputed re-election. These events occurred
during project preparation. Then in April 2010, anti-government political demonstrations took


                                                  11
place against the authoritarian tendencies of his successor, who had centralized power within the
presidency. The April 2010 events left a power vacuum in the south with a mosaic of ethnic
groups, which were mobilized by politicians. In June 2010, political and social tensions climaxed
into violent inter-ethnic clashes resulting in 300 deaths and large scale destruction of public and
private property.

58.       The events of April and June 2010 jeopardized project implementation in several ways:

         The lack of a functioning Parliament halted the adoption of a number or pending
          Technical Regulations;
         The volatile situation limited incoming travel of experts required to assist the beneficiary
          in the definition of technical specifications for both high-precision equipment and
          laboratory renovation;
       The lack of a permanent Government and the lack of clarity in the institutional structure
          of the Government made it impossible to deploy some of the additional required technical
          assistance; and
       The purchasing of metrology and laboratory equipment was also adversely impacted as
          suppliers increased the costs of guarantees, insurance, shipping costs and installation
          charges, particularly to account for greater security risks for their staff.

59.     Complexity of Institutional Development: Implementation delays were also experienced
due to the complexity of the institution building process associated with the reforms of technical
regulations and standards. Because these required extensive revamping of an institutional
standards framework that had prevailed in the region for decades, the Kyrgyz Republic as with
many of the CIS countries initially encountered difficulties and resistance from within the
Government and implementing agencies in the transition to the new regulatory and quality
standards system, and thus achievement of a number of project activities was slow to materialize
such as those dealing with metrology and standards.

60.     Purchasing of complex calibrating and laboratory equipment led to project delays: The
complexity of MSTQ equipment was another factor that contributed to the project delays. While
procurement under the project was well managed, the technical specifications of some of the
equipment purchases had to be revised in order to attract qualified bids. The preparation of
technical specifications for the procurement of high precision metrology equipment was delayed
at inception due to the difficulties in identifying and retaining an appropriate international
technical expert with the required set of skills. The announcement for the hiring of an
international consultant was advertised three times. This issue was subsequently resolved
through the organization of the above-mentioned twinning arrangement with the German PTB
through which the PTB provided the technical resources to define technical specifications for the
equipment that was subsequently acquired and installed in refurbished facilities. The tender for
the Integrated Information System (IIS) linking various regulatory and supervisory agencies in
support of TR development was canceled as the two offers received did not comply with the
specifications. An international IT technical specialist was then retained under the project to
assist in the revision of the technical specifications. The tender for the purchase of testing
equipment for the three laboratories under the Ministry of Health was also cancelled in January


                                                  12
2011 due to issues with the technical specifications. These issues were resolved with the hiring
of an international consultant who revised the specifications and the next bidding round resulted
in the award of the contracts.

61.     As implementation of the Project gathered momentum and the implementing agencies
became more experienced in the acquisition of equipment new opportunities for upgrading of
laboratories were identified. For example, with more money and time the project could have
supported the establishment of a testing laboratory for water and bottled water, a sector with high
growth and export potential. Funding for the water laboratory was originally to come from
savings from other project components. Discussions on the water lab started in 2010 and
envisioned an arrangement based on a public-private sector venture, where the Government
would build the lab and then turn over its management to a private sector company. However,
the actual savings from other components was not sufficient to move forward with this activity.

62.     Support of private sector firms in acquiring quality standards: Utilization of the
matching grant facility for adoption of quality standards by private sector firms was much less
than anticipated. The trend in acquisition of voluntary quality standards (ISO) by firms was slow
suggesting that companies were not yet investing in quality or aiming to expand into new
(quality sensitive) WTO markets. Many Kyrgyz companies appeared to be much more focused
on maintaining their internal market shares and keeping afloat as going concerns rather than
investing in quality systems in support of market expansion and exports in what many perceived
as a mostly unstable political and international economic environment. In addition, smaller yet
high export potential enterprises (e.g., textile/apparel) tended to shy away from exploring new
markets given their limited production capacity. While some of these issues could have been
anticipated at the time of project design, the major challenge facing potential users of the facility
was the high degree of market uncertainty and financial disruption after 2010; a development
that could not have been anticipated at the time of project design.

63.    Due to the technical complexity of project activities and other factors mentioned above,
project implementation was delayed and the closing date was extended by 23 months.
Accreditation of targeted testing laboratories and certifying bodies was advanced at the time of
closing and are expected to be achieved in the near future.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design

64.     Per the PAD, there was one main outcome (PDO) indicator: decrease in the cost of
regulatory compliance for business. By definition, such an indicator would be calculated as the
ratio of the cost of regulatory compliance to total operating expenses of businesses that
benefitted from the project. In the absence of such information the PAD relied on “macro”
information drawn from various indexes such as the Doing business (DB) and the Business
Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS). With respect to enterprise
competitiveness, there was no quantifiable indicator that could have been utilized to measure
outcomes. The reference in the PAD to non-gold exports to WTO member countries was not
intended to be measurable during the life of the project.



                                                 13
65.     The Doing Business (DB) index that was used as the indicator represents the overall
ranking for the Kyrgyz Republic. While there is a correlation between the cost of regulatory
compliance and the overall level of the DB ranking, there are other country indicators that are
included in the overall index: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across
borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. Not all of these indicators are directly
related to the outcomes of the project. In fact the majority of these sub-indexes are not directly
related to the PDOs.

66.     Perhaps some consideration could have been given to the definition of a short-term
indicator of increased competitiveness. An additional trade-related indicator could have been
reduced import dependence, since this would reflect the impact from the adoption of new quality
standards by local businesses that are focused primarily on the domestic market. Local
consumers may have switched to higher quality local products that were more price competitive
than imports.

67.     At the time of project preparation it may have also been useful to develop information
through surveys of businesses in a targeted industry such as food processing by compiling a
“dashboard” of financial and business indicators that could have provided better focus on the
relationship of reduced cost of regulatory compliance and enhanced quality standards on the
competitiveness of companies in that industry.

68.     In view of the challenges of measuring the key outcome indicators, this analysis has
relied on the intermediate indicators of outcome as proxies of project effectiveness. Intermediate
results indicators were maintained up-to-date throughout the course of the project and covered all
of the project components. Perhaps some additional intermediate indicators of the level of
activity by CSM, KAC, the laboratories and certifying bodies might have been useful as a
measure of how businesses were incorporating the new standards in their operations.

M&E Implementation and utilization

69.    Project information was monitored through the Implementation Status and Results (ISRs).
The Bank supervision missions and the PIU kept the project information up-to-date with detailed
records on each of the components. Nevertheless, the main data sources were comprised of the
intermediate indicators of outcome.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

70.    No deviations were found with respect to the Bank’s financial management, procurement,
and disbursement policies. All annual audits performed by external auditors confirmed that the
financial reports for the project gave a true view of actual expenditures and that the PIU provided
the auditors with all the relevant information to arrive at their opinions.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

71.    The Ministry of Economy requested a follow-up World Bank operation to build on the
foundation established under the RTBET project and provide further support to the National


                                                 14
Quality Infrastructure (NQI) of the Kyrgyz Republic. However, the current available IDA
envelope is limited, and the World Bank may not be in a position to accommodate the Ministry’s
request. The RTBET project team will explore ways to continue supporting this reform agenda.
The MSTQ and NQI space remain important areas of interest to other donors, who will continue
to provide technical assistance support to selected agencies. PTB, building on the twinning
arrangement brokered under the RTBET project, will continue to involve technical experts from
the CSM in their regional capacity building TA project in the areas of metrology and calibration.
TurKAK is continuing to provide technical assistance in the area of accreditation to the KCA in
continuation to the excellent working relationships established through a similar twinning
arrangement brokered between the two peer institutions under the project. GIZ will remain
engaged in the area of administrative barriers to trade while ITC/SECO is expected to continue
support to SMEs in the area of export and trade promotion. All of these donor activities will help
provide valuable continued support to the MSTQ reform agenda and individual agencies
involved in the system. The RTBET project team is also currently preparing a results movie to
document and disseminate the project results and provide information on the benefits of MSTQ
reforms, notably to neighboring countries as MSTQ reforms have much to gain from enhanced
regional cooperation.


3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

72.      The development objectives of the project, streamlining TRs and standards framework
and developing a system to promote the quality and safety of products is consistent with the
current Country and Bank development goals. The overall goal of the current Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS: 2014-2017) is rooted in a single pillar of improved governance,
which in the case of the RTBET project is reflected in accountability, transparency and
efficiency in utilization of resources. The current CPS’s support for improved governance
focuses on three broad areas of engagement—public administration and public service delivery,
business environment and investment climate, and natural resources and physical infrastructure.
An improved business environment and investment climate is seen as a prerequisite for faster
growth and job creation. These CPS objectives are reflected in the RTBET’s PDOs of
streamlining the national technical regulations and increasing enterprise competitiveness. Project
activities support the Country’s efforts to harmonize its regulatory and institutional framework
with WTO and international trade system requirements. As highlighted by the QALP review of
June 2010, the “project was highly relevant and consisted of the strategic building blocks to
assist the Government in tackling priority issues in trade and business environment”. The Project
remains relevant for the current Government national development strategy that makes direct
reference to MSTQ as a key element for the diversification of the economy and enterprise
competitiveness.

73.    The development of a system to enhance quality and safety of products – including the
environmental impact of production activities, and by doing so increasing enterprise



                                               15
competitiveness – directly addresses the current core objective of improved governance as it
applies to the private sector.

Relevance of design and implementation

74.      The project design is deemed highly relevant for achieving the two main dimensions of
the PDO (namely, reducing the cost of regulatory compliance and developing systems for
product quality and safety) because the component definitions and intermediate outcomes were
closely related to the PDO level outcomes. New TRs and the transition from mandatory to
voluntary certifications supported by a risk-based inspections regime contributed to the reduction
in the cost of regulatory compliance. The PDO indicator “cost of regulatory compliance”
reflected a relevant project outcome generally speaking, but using the overall ranking in cost of
doing business survey did not reflect closely the results achieved through project interventions
(Section 2.3). The intermediate outcomes were very relevant for measuring the project outcomes.
Project activities and results proved instrumental in advancing reforms towards streamlining of
the business environment (introduction of Risk-Based Inspections regime), and provided
continued support to the various governments and relevant ministries in tackling the challenges
of the country’s MSTQ reform. Project activities not only helped to streamline business
regulations but they also supported the Country’s efforts to harmonize its regulatory and
institutional framework with WTO and international trading system requirements. The project’s
targeting of agribusiness also supports the overall country strategy to improve the management
of natural resources in a way that optimizes job growth and thus improve the standard of living.

75.     However, the design of the component to support quality enhancements was not as
relevant to the third dimension of the PDO (increasing enterprise competitiveness in pilot
sectors). Component 3 (ii) was to upgrade laboratories that provided testing services utilized by
agribusinesses/food processing companies and the grant facility in Component 3 (iii) was to
provide co-financing for companies seeking ISO quality certification. Improving the quality of
producers’ output through improved measurement capabilities, testing of product quality and
ISO quality certification are necessary but not sufficient conditions for increasing enterprise
competitiveness. In addition, the matching grant set up in support of enterprise acquisition of
certification was small and limited in scope.

76.    Based on the reasons discussed above, the overall relevance of this project is deemed to
be High.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

77.     The Project has achieved substantive results in the two first dimensions of the PDO. It
streamlined the national technical regulation and standards framework for businesses, reducing
the cost of regulatory compliance to a high extent. It also developed systems to enhance quality
and safety of products to a substantial extent. However, the project achieved modest results in
the third dimension of the PDO - enhanced enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors. The
overall project efficacy is considered substantial (see section 3.3).

78.   This section assesses to what extent each dimension of the PDO was achieved through
component outcomes and how these outcomes contributed to reducing the cost of regulatory


                                               16
compliance for business (see Table 1). The efficacy of the PDO is assessed through the analysis
of the Intermediate Indicators that were identified in the PAD (shown on Table 1) and additional
documentary evidence of outcomes captured in selected indicators. Indeed, while the overall
project design was good, the M&E framework had some weaknesses and for that reason the
assessment of the PDO achievement in the ICR is based on intermediary outcome indicators.
Each of the Intermediate Indicators was supported by project outputs that are summarized in
Annex 2 of this report.

79.     The degree of achievement of project outcomes is accurately measured by the
intermediate indicators. While the PDO indicator of reduced cost of regulatory compliance
reflects the overall achievement of the three PDOs, even though the indicator chosen for this
project was only marginally relevant, the intermediate indicators do reflect the degree of
achievement of each of the three PDOs. The new TRs incorporated the latest international
practices in product quality and safety guided by risk-based principles and did away with the
excessive mandatory requirements that prevailed under the old GostStandard. The reduction in
the number of products subject to mandatory certification contributed directly to easing the
regulatory burden for producers, including exporters, of products that are not considered to
represent a risk to consumers and that are manufactured according to fairly standardized
processes. A notable increase in the number of documentary standards harmonized with
international standards enhanced the system of quality and safety of products since it has
increasingly been guided by practices that have produced positive outcomes worldwide. The
increase in the number of measurement and calibration services provided by the labs equipped
under the project will also help raise the quality of output by local producers, who supply inputs
to other businesses, sell directly to consumers, and export.

80.       Key achievements of the Project by Component are summarized below:

         The Technical Regulations component exceeded its expected performance, although the
          enforcement and surveillance of the new regulations is still in the early stages of
          implementation. Key achievements include:
          o The target for the number of new Technical Regulations issued under the project was
            eight, while the actual value to date is 35. These 35 new Technical Regulations are
            now in force in various sectors, ranging from food and agricultural products to
            construction and transportation services.
          o The list of products subject to mandatory certification has been reduced significantly
            to 684 at project completion from 5,500 at project design. This led to a significant
            decrease in the number of mandatory standards for safety and quality requirements
            from 22,000 old Soviet GostStandards to just 100 WTO compliant modern standards.
          o The issuance of the new Technical Regulations also led to the simplification of
            procedures for product certification, lowering the number of days required for
            certification from 15 to seven.
          o By introducing product classification on the basis of their inherent risks, these new
            Technical Regulations are at the root of the Risk Based Inspections regime that is
            now being implemented in the country. The introduction of this reform led to a



                                                 17
              threefold decrease in the number of business inspections to 7,247 in 2012 from
              20,629 in 2011.

     The Metrology and Standards component has achieved its expected impact with newly
      equipped metrology laboratories. The procurement of state of the art metrological and
      laboratory equipment expanded the range and accuracy of tests performed in the Kyrgyz
      Republic.

     The Accreditation and Quality Standards component has made substantial progress
      particularly in the establishment of the Kyrgyz Accreditation Center (KAC), but is has not
      yet reached the critical mass needed to achieve its intermediate impact. Qualified
      international auditors carried out an assessment of the international accreditation readiness
      level of selected testing laboratories and certification bodies. In the case of the laboratories,
      the readiness ranged from 90 percent to 95 percent depending on the type of testing
      equipment and procedures. In the case of the certification bodies, the readiness level was
      assessed at 75 percent. ILAC is expected to review KAC readiness for full membership in
      October 2013. Notwithstanding the progress in the development of the Kyrgyz Republic’s
      quality of infrastructure under the project, the adoption of quality systems by enterprises
      remains slow, due to several factors, ranging from low sophistication of local companies and
      competing investment priorities.

     Enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors. With respect to the third dimension of the PDO
      –enhanced enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors, the results are modest. Improved
      enterprise competitiveness was to be achieved through enterprise acquisition of quality
      certification. The small matching grant facility that was set up under the project was designed
      as a pilot to facilitate enterprise acquisition of quality certification in a few sectors. At project
      closure, 12 companies had acquired international certification of quality management
      systems (i.e. ISO). These companies operate in a variety of sectors, ranging from
      agribusiness and foodstuff to manufacturing (cement, bulbs) and services. Of these
      companies, only two benefited from the support of the pilot matching grant facility set up
      under the project. While the result is modest, interest in quality certification has been
      growing. Agro-industry associations (fruit and vegetable association) are promoting the
      importance of quality for competitiveness due to pressures from destinations markets such as
      Russia, which recently joined the WTO and remains a key trading partner for the Kyrgyz
      Republic. The establishment of the WTO inquiry point is expected to help channel
      information from and to trading partners of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Contribution of intermediate outcomes to the PDOs

PDO #1: Streamlining the national technical regulation and standards framework for
business through Component 1 “Technical Regulations”

81.     The project streamlined the national technical regulation and standards framework for
business to a high extent. Subsequently, the introduction of new standards through TRs has
established a solid foundation for lower costs of regulatory compliance and for increased
competitiveness of enterprises. The reduction in the number of products subject to mandatory
certification (down to 684 from 5,500 at project design) led to a significant decrease in the
number of mandatory standards identified for safety and quality requirements from the old
Soviet GostStandard. This has resulted in a decrease in the regulatory cost of compliance for
many producers. The introduction of Technical Regulations also simplified the procedure for
certification of products, lowering the average number of days required for certification from 15
to seven. The project thus helped to transform the MSTQ from a “control system” to a
“compliance risk-based” system based on the new TRs and a market surveillance infrastructure.

82.     The development of new TRs outperformed the targets set out in the PAD. As shown in
Table A2-1 in Annex 2, there is an ongoing pipeline of new TRs aimed at improving the quality
and safety of products as well as reducing the cost of regulatory compliance. While the activities
in MSTQ supported by this Project targeted certain industries such as food production, there is a
significant pipeline of new TRs in other industries that are in various stages of preparation. The
workflow of new TRs was facilitated by the acquisition of an IT system, also financed by the
project, for collaboration and monitoring by different agencies and other stakeholders involved
in development of new TRs. The establishment of the WTO Enquiry Point supported by the
project will also serve as a channel to support the harmonization of the domestic regulatory
system with international standards.

83.    By introducing product classification on the basis of their inherent risks, the Technical
Regulations reform is also at the root of the Risk-Based Inspections regime (RBI) that is now
being implemented in the country. The Legal Metrology Inspectorate started to operate in 2012



                                                      19
although during its initial phase of operations it has limited its supervision and surveillance
activities to public sector entities.

84.     An important micro-indicator of PDO’s is the effectiveness of the new TR’s in achieving
greater safety and higher quality of products and services. While the quality of the technical
work in the development of the TRs has been in line with international standards, their
enforcement through the work of the Legal Metrology Inspectorate is only at the beginning
stages. The key to achieving internationally recognized quality standards, and thus strengthening
the competitiveness of goods and services which will in turn contribute to the expansion of
exports to other WTO member countries will hinge on the effectiveness of surveillance and
enforcement actions in engendering a culture of quality and safety in the business community.
This is an important outcome that will require additional time for achievement.

PDO #2: Developing systems to enhance quality and safety of products

85.     The project developed metrology and standards and accreditation and testing
laboratories/certifying bodies to enhance quality and safety of products to a substantial extent.
The institutional development impact on KAC and on the testing and laboratory labs and
certification bodies and their pending accreditation bodes well for the eventual effectiveness of
this component.

Through Component 2 “Metrology and Standards”

86.     Through the project’s support, CSM exceeded the targets for calibration measurement &
calibration services with lower associated uncertainty and continues to provide more and better
measurement and calibration services with tangible positive impact on Kyrgyz companies. Two
state-of-the-art reference laboratories are fully operational and allow CSM to provide more
reliable and precise measurement and calibration services to the Kyrgyz public and private
sectors.


                          Table 2: CSM Calibration Activities
                                        2010       2011       2012
                          Mass              -      29         32
                          Temperature   -          25         29


87.     The availability of reliable calibration services in the Kyrgyz republic makes it cheaper
and understandably more convenient for Kyrgyz companies to now calibrate in Bishkek. Kyrgyz
entrepreneurs also benefit from lower fees and an increased range of services. New services now
available to users thanks to the installation of the new high precision metrology laboratories
procured under the project allow companies to calibrate in Bishkek instead of taking their
equipment to Almaty which resulted in lower costs (see Table 3 below). Additional laboratories
in six areas (volume, pH-meter, density, pressure, time & frequency, and viscosity) were
installed by the time of project closure and are expected to further enhance the availability of
calibration services to the broad spectrum of production activities in the country (see Annex 2 for
more details).

                Source: CSM

88.     The approximation to international standards has also contributed to raising the quality of
goods and services produced in the Kyrgyz Republic to international ISO/IEC standards. At the
time of this ICR about 46 percent of national standards were fully in line with international WTO
standards, as targeted at appraisal, and this percentage is expected to increase.

89.     At project inception the Kyrgyz Republic was not represented in a systematic way in
international and regional fora on metrology, standards and accreditation; RTBET helped put the
Kyrgyz Republic “on the map” in the Quality infrastructure area. As a result, today Kyrgyz
technical delegations are tasked with technical responsibilities in multilateral fora; the most
recent example is from the COOMET meeting in September 2012 where CSM was tasked with
the definition of guidelines for calibration of weights and calculation of uncertainty to be adopted
by the COOMET countries3.

And through sub-components 3 (i) and (ii) “Accreditation and Testing Laboratories and
Certifying Bodies”

Accreditation

90.     The project managed to centralize the accreditation functions under one umbrella that
were previously housed in different government agencies, and spin it off from metrology, as
these are two separate and incompatible technical functions. By consolidating the accreditation
function from various agencies under one independent agency, the project lowered opportunities
for rent seeking, and possible conflicts of interest.

91.   A well-functioning KAC was established and equipped under the RTBET project. As
shown by Table 4 below, KAC has been active in accrediting testing and calibration laboratories

of water and geological materials.

92.     One of the critical steps for global recognition of KAC was its full acceptance into the
ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation). The application for full ILAC
membership was initiated in 2009 and at the time of project closure KAC was at the final stage
of the process. Full ILAC membership was one of the key Project Intermediate Indicators that
establishes the technical competence of KAC in the accreditation of laboratories and certification
bodies compliant with the highest international standards. Once accredited, KAC will be in a
position to apply all relevant ISO standards in their accreditation activities of domestic
laboratories and certification bodies.

Testing Laboratories and Certifying bodies

93.     The RTBET supported the upgrading of three laboratories in the Epidemiology center
under the Ministry of Health: microbiology, chemicals and radiology. These laboratories provide
services to the agri-business and food processing sectors. As shown in Table 5 below, the newly
equipped labs have been providing testing services for numerous companies. The new equipment
allows the lab to perform tests in the area of pesticides and residues that were not available
before the Project.

                        Table 5: Laboratories Activity
                                              2010       2011          2012

94.    The increase in the number of products tested has been made possible through the
expanded capabilities of the labs through the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment. Table 6
below shows the larger list of tests available in the case of the radiology lab.

95.     On international accreditation of selected testing laboratories under ISO 17025 and
certification bodies under ISO 17065, the delays related to the installation of testing laboratories
accumulated throughout implementation in turn delayed the process of international accreditation
against the relevant ISO standards. At the time of project closure two international experts had
assessed the readiness of the testing laboratories at 90 percent to 95 percent with the gap
attributed to the need to perform laboratory inter-comparisons. In the case of certification bodies
the main gap is in the translation into English of guidelines and internal documentation. When
fully accredited to international standards these labs and accreditation bodies will serve as the
new standard for other labs and accreditation bodies.

PDO #3: Increasing enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors through sub-component 1 (c)
“Quality at enterprise level”

96.      The project increased enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors to a modest extent. The
adoption of quality management systems by enterprises remains slow, due to a combination of
factors ranging from competing investment priorities for companies that continue to face difficult
economic conditions to the relatively low level of sophistication of local companies and buyers’
markets in which they operate. As explained in Annex 2, only two companies received support
under the project for certification of ISO standards. However, 10 other companies have received
ISO certification that did not tap the resources of the Grant Facility. One of the critical linkages
between the project and the PDO of increased enterprise competitiveness is its effectiveness in
instilling a culture of quality at the enterprise level. Achievement of this objective may still take
some time.

Other Evidence

97.    This section presents additional indicators of outcome that complement the analysis
based on Intermediate Indicators. As discussed in section 2.3 the DB indicator was not a realistic



                                                    23
outcome indicator because it was not directly linked to the PDOs of the RTBET. However, there
are other “macro” indicators that can be used as evidence of outcomes such as the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index and the Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS). The relevant information contained in each of these indicators can be considered as
proxies for the main outcome indicator of “reduced cost of regulatory compliance.”

98.     The Global Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index which is shown in Table 7
demonstrates a myriad of factors that comprise the overall characterization of a country’s
competitiveness. Two of the sub-indexes are considered as relevance to the Project’s PDO of
reducing the regulatory cost of compliance. The number of procedures to start a business may
have been positively impacted by the introduction of technical regulations for products and for
the safety of the facilities housing the business requires that simplified the process. The sub-
index of local supplier quality has also been positively impacted by the upgrading of testing
laboratories in the agri-business/food processing sector. For example, a producer of agricultural
inputs sold to a food processor has access to calibration and testing services that enhances the
quality of the products sold to the food manufacturer.

99.     The latest available survey for the BEEPS is for 2009. One of the findings of the 2009
survey was that concerns about business licenses and permits were noted by only 2.2 percent of
the firms responding to the survey. These results indicate that relative to other concerns, for
businesses the problems of licenses and permits are not as burdensome. The low percentage for
business licenses and permits may have already captured the initiatives supported by the project
of reducing the number of products subject to mandatory certification.

3.3     Efficiency

100. RTBET was efficient in its utilization of limited project resources (US$5 million in total),
as testified by the high level of disbursements, which reached 95 percent of the original Grant
amount, that led to substantial achievements. Notwithstanding the lack of economic analysis



                                                        24
during project appraisal, the project achieved substantial results during its implementation,
including a reduction in the cost of regulatory compliance for businesses and improvements in
quality systems for product safety and quality. On the other hand the impact of increased
competitiveness on growth of non-gold exports as explained in the PAD was established as a
medium-to-long-term outcome not intended to be captured within the duration of the project.

101. The net benefits of the project based on its three main components consist of the reduced
cost of regulatory compliance, although it is not possible to quantify the monetary amount of cost
reductions from available information. For example, the number of type products subject to
mandatory certification was reduced from 5,500 to 684 and the number of days required for
certification was reduced from 15 to seven; thus the financial benefits of these two outcomes are
considered significant. By building on the work previously done by other donors and which had
led to the passage of the Law on the Fundamentals of Technical Regulation, the project was able
to engage in a more efficient way by focusing on the development of the TRs already prescribed
in the new legislation. The twinning arrangements involving PTB and TurKak as well as the
quality of experts and consultants with extensive prior experience in the field of MSTQ
contributed to the more cost effective purchasing of scientific equipment that incorporated the
latest technologies available worldwide. By upgrading labs that provided calibration and
measurement services oriented towards agro-businesses/food processing companies the project
achieved a higher level of efficiency given the importance of this sector to the economy. By
increasing the accuracy of measurements, the high precision metrology equipment procured
under the project will also help reduce potentially costly measurement errors across sectors
ranging from electricity distribution to manufacturing and provision of health services.

102. The project however suffered from significant implementation delays due to the highly
technical nature thus complexity of activities (metrology, calibration, accreditation and testing)
as well as frequent disruptions from social and political events that affected the country as a
whole (upheavals in April and June 2010). These delays led to two project extensions of 23
months in total; however, without generating any cost overruns. By delaying the net benefits
from the project as explained in the case of KAC’s Full Membership in ILAC, the laboratories
and certification bodies, the longer duration of the project and still pending completion of
accreditation and supervision activities the present value of those benefits have accordingly been
materially reduced.

103. Another limitation on the Project’s efficiency is the small size of the operation. With only
US$5 million for support of the MSTQ infrastructure, the multiplier effect may fall short of its
targeted growth of exports. At the same time, in addition to the noticeable decrease in regulatory
burden on enterprises, the project introduced new Quality related services (broader range and
reliability of measurements in calibration and testing services) critical to production processes
and consumer safety that were not available in the country before.

104. Based on the experience of the project, particularly the longer than expected
implementation period, efficiency is considered to have been substantial.




                                               25
3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

105. The overall outcome rating, which incorporates the three rating sub-categories is thus
considered moderately satisfactory. The relevance of the project is considered high and both the
achievement of the PDOs and efficiency are considered as substantial.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not Applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

106. The project had a strong institutional building dimension as it supported the
establishment of an independent accreditation body (KAC) and also strengthened the capacity of
key institutions involved in the MSTQ reform, namely the Ministry of Economy and the Center
for Standards and Metrology (CSM). Specifically, the project supported these target institutions
through tailored technical assistance aimed at building internal capacity. In addition, the project
brokered twinning arrangements with internationally recognized peer technical agencies such as
the German Metrology Institute (PTB) and the Turkish Accreditation body (TurKak). These
twinning arrangements led to the establishment of excellent cooperation between these
institutions. The project enhanced the capacity for regulatory reform: RTBET provided extensive
capacity building support to the Ministry of Economy and other ministries and agencies in
Technical Regulation development. Throughout project implementation, approximately 200
public officials and technical specialists from various ministries and agencies were trained on the
various aspects of Technical Regulations and MSTQ. RTBET also increased the international
visibility and recognition of the Kyrgyz Republic as an active member of the WTO arena: at
project inception the Kyrgyz Republic was not represented in a systematic way in international
and regional fora on metrology, standards and accreditation; RTBET helped put the Kyrgyz
Republic “on the map” in the Quality infrastructure area.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not Applicable

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

107. While no beneficiary survey was conducted, on April 15, 2013 to mark the closure of the
RTBET project, a high-level workshop was organized in the presidential palace gathering all
project beneficiaries including all concerned government and MSTQ agencies, laboratory
operators, private companies that had acquired ISO certification in the water and confectionary
sectors, project implementation unit staff, Bank management, donors and the media. The
workshop presented the main project achievements and discussed the remaining agenda ahead to
strengthen the domestic Quality infrastructure and boost competitiveness. The workshop was
moderated by the Minister of Economy and was addressed by both the President of the Kyrgyz
Republic, who had served as Minister of Economy during project preparation and was a strong



                                                26
supporter of this operation, and the Prime Minister4. The project team is also currently preparing
a results story movie to better capture and disseminate the results of the project as well as broad
benefits of MSTQ reforms.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
108.    Risks to Development Objectives are considered as significant for the following reasons.

109. Political changes and volatility are still considered the principal risk factor as they were at
the time of Project preparation; although the likelihood of internal political conflict has
diminished. While the constitutional reforms implemented in 2010 bode well for continuity in
the political process, long-standing tensions still persist. Nevertheless, the possibility of political
changes that could adversely affect Government policies in those areas supported by the project
continues to be a significant challenge to sustainability of development outcomes.

110. Risks to the economic outlook either from a weaker global economy or from internal
factors that impede growth of domestic markets, such as other constraints to competitiveness as
demonstrated by some of the Doing Business and in the Competitiveness indicators as well as in
the Enterprise Surveys that were not addressed by the RTBET, and by other Bank and donor
projects may limit the ability of local enterprises to invest in quality improvements.

111. Since the Kyrgyz Republic's main trading partners in the Eurasian Customs Union are
either already members (Russia) or aspiring to become a member of the WTO (Kazakhstan,
which in anticipation also recently embarked on reforming its Technical Regulations
framework), the proposed adoption of the Customs Union in the Kyrgyz Republic does not
represent an obvious risk to the project outcome. However, it should be noted that the difference
in the pace of alignment of the various trading partners on WTO non-tariff barriers to trade
regimes may have an impact on the ease of cross-border trading as regulatory requirements and
standards differences persist.

112. The financial viability of the project could be compromised if budgetary support from the
Government is curtailed. Fee-generating opportunities from the principal agencies such as CSM,
KAC and the laboratories in the form of certification, inspection and other user fees will reduce
but not eliminate budgetary dependence on Government resources.

113. Proper follow-on operational and financial support from the Government is necessary in
order to continue building on the achievements of the Technical Regulation and Quality
infrastructure reforms. The MSTQ system still needs hand-holding in terms of financial support
and institutional development. The technical agencies - KAC and CSM - will require continued
support from the Kyrgyz Government in order to sustain their achievements in the sphere of
accreditation and metrology. Much of the progress achieved by these agencies to date has been
motivated by the existence of donor support channeled directly or through the RTBET project.
And as a result of the close collaboration between the Bank and the main donor agencies, their

support is expected to continue post-RTBET. If donor support were to wind down, the
Government would need to allocate additional resources to ensure the sustainability of its MSTQ
infrastructure and to maintain the human and technical capacity developed in these agencies over
the past six years of project implementation.

114. An important element of sustainability in the short- to medium-term following the closure
of the RTBET project will be the role played by donor assistance. Due to Government budgetary
constraints continuation of the key planned activities in supervision – Legal Metrology
Inspectorate, recalibration of metrology equipment, accreditation and upgrading of more
laboratories – may well hinge on the degree of donor support and on the ability of some of the
agencies to find revenue generating opportunities. The Center for Standards and Metrology is
currently being assisted by GTZ; but at this critical juncture in the modernization of the MSTQ
infrastructure continued donor support is essential.

115. Nevertheless, irrespective of any continued donor engagement, the sustainability of the
reforms will rest on the shoulders of the Government. While recent history showed that the
Kyrgyz Republic can be prone to political and social instability, the current Government and
President are supporters of the work accomplished to date which gives reasonable indications
that MSTQ reforms could be sustained over the medium term although foregoing potential
concerns about funding and capacity need to be kept in mind.


5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

116. As asserted by the QALP-2 assessment of June 2010, the preparation and appraisal
process appears to have been satisfactory on all counts, as were the management inputs. The
financial management aspects were assessed comprehensively and incorporated into the overall
project design. The task team considered all the pertinent risks and opportunities in designing the
project.

117. With respect to the project outcomes, Bank staff were somewhat ambitious in framing the
objectives. As discussed previously in this report, the third major objective of increasing
enterprise competitiveness based on the scope of the project was not realistic. The linkages of the
third component to the PDO of increased competitiveness were marginally relevant. The goal of
increasing exports was not expected to materialize until sometime in the medium-to-long-run,
however, by then it may be very difficult to identify the direct linkages to the project from
among all other possible factors that may impinge on the development of the country’s exports.
As described in the previous sections, the PDO indicator identified in the PAD – cost of
regulatory compliance based on the Doing Business data – cannot be closely linked to results
from the project interventions and thus provided an insufficient indicator by itself for measuring




                                                28
the outcomes. On the other hand, the intermediate outcome indicators measured appropriately the
project interventions.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

118. The Bank team brought special value to the borrower by bringing in internationally
recognized experts who had held top positions in the field of metrology and quality standards in
other countries and had considerable experience in the respective fields of expertise, to
recommend solutions drawing upon external experience and to persuade counterparts who were
resistant to reform. Also, the team arranged for twinning of CSM with the German Metrology
Institute (PTB), which led to a considerable transfer of know-how, and of KAC with TurKak to
twin the Kyrgyz agency for Accreditation. The team members in the field in particular made
exceptional efforts to deal with a complex undertaking that called for revamping the legal,
regulatory and institutional framework to move away from the mandatory approach, which was
susceptible to rent seeking to a demand-driven approach.

119. The continuity of a well-qualified Task Team leader and team members in place since the
beginning was instrumental in keeping the project on track in the face of the resistance to
reforms. Management attention was very good at the design stage and remained satisfactory
thereafter. Supervision reports and documents covered the situation adequately and regularly
reflected progress towards intermediate indicators. The Bank addressed implementation delays
through relevant actions, such as extensions and innovative ways to resolve procurement and
bidding problems.

120. Some concerns were expressed by the Borrower in terms of delays in the approval of
project expenditures on equipment and with the reallocation of funds. This partly was a
reflection of the highly technical nature of the type of equipment purchased. Nevertheless, the
implementing agencies were complementary of the prompt responses they received from the
project team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

121. Based on the two components of Bank performance as rated above, the overall rating is
deemed as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

122. The request for Bank financing of this project was initiated by the Government –
recognizing the need for external expertise. The project had strong champions at the highest
levels in the country including the Presidency, and relevant ministries, notably MITT / MoER.
However, significant staff turnover at high policy levels in the Ministry of Economic Regulation
presented a challenge to Project implementation.


                                                29
123. During the political events of 2010 the lack of a permanent Government and the lack of
clarity in the institutional structure of the Government disrupted the implementation of the
Project. The lack of a functioning Parliament halted the adoption of a number or pending
Technical Regulations; the volatile situation limited incoming travel of experts working on the
Project; and made it impossible to deploy some of the additional required technical assistance.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

124. After a slow start, the implementing agencies became more proactive in the
implementation of the project. All Directors of the Implementing Agencies were very vocal and
the technical staff was very well prepared.

125. Despite a high turnover of upper-level officials at MoER, the TR Department made good
progress with the regulatory framework. During project implementation CSM had three directors.
Initially, there was some resistance to the reforms supported by the project from CSM; however,
these differences of opinion by the Director were subsequently resolved and this project
component made good progress. The KAC Director was involved with the project from the start
and the Agency was very committed to supporting the accreditation component.

126. The PIU, which was established under the MoER developed excellent knowledge of
Bank procedures and acquired extensive practical experience in managing large and technical
complex contracts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

127. Based on the two components of Borrower performance as rated above, the overall rating
is deemed as Moderately Satisfactory.


6.     Lessons Learned
      Continuity of Bank staff in charge of project supervision is critical to the success of
       projects that operate in a challenging environment. The RTBET was a project whose
       small dollar size could have rendered it easily vulnerable to being crowded out by larger
       issues and projects in the country dialogue. The fact that it did not suffer this fate is due
       greatly to the dedication of the staff team. But the real systemic lesson is that it was the
       lasting continuity in the staff team – both the field office staff and the TTL who have
       remained with the project from the beginning – that made this dedication possible. At the
       same time, the high risk of the project makes it essential to have a strong field presence in
       such projects.

      The linkage between project components, outputs and outcomes needs to be clearly
       identified at project design stage to arrive at more realistic Project Development
       Objectives. The connection between the project components of reducing the cost of
       regulatory compliance, improving the MSQT infrastructure and an increase in the share
       of non-gold trade with existing WTO partners may not have been as strong or clearly


                                                30
       justified as implied in the PAD. In this regard the design may have also aimed a bit high
       in terms of development outcomes. Given the small size of the project and its focus on
       MSTQ a narrower scope of objectives could have been considered, for example, just
       reducing the regulatory cost of compliance.

      PDOs need to be supported by project components that are consistent with the
       results framework. In the case of the RTBET, the objective of enhancing enterprise
       competitiveness was supported by relatively small sub-components: the upgrading of
       laboratories that provided services to the agri-business/processed foods sector and
       establishment of a US$100,000 grant facility for companies that were seeking ISO
       certification to enhance the quality of their production process. Improving enterprise
       competitiveness is a very broad topic which did not fit with the very specific objectives
       of streamlining technical regulations and developing systems to enhance quality and
       safety of products.

      An effective mechanism to jump-start institutional development of newly-formed
       entities and to speed up the learning curve is to organize twinning arrangements
       with well-known institutions that are committed to the sponsorship of best practices.
       The brokered twinning arrangements with internationally recognized peer technical
       agencies such as the one between CSM and German Metrology Institute (PTB) and KAC
       with the Turkish Accreditation body (TurKak) led to the establishment of excellent
       cooperation between these institutions.

      Projects with complex technical components should be allowed more time for
       implementation or its principal components structured as separate consecutive
       projects. Given the high risk factor and technical complexity of the RTBET perhaps a
       longer period of implementation could have been considered as well as a larger amount
       of funding that would have provided the flexibility to finance additional equipment for
       laboratories that may not have been foreseen at the time of preparation such as in the case
       of the water laboratory, a natural resource with strong export potential, which was not
       considered until the second half of the Project.

                                    Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.       This annex provides a summary of the main activities financed by the RTBET.

Component 1: Technical Regulations

2.      This component strengthened the capacity of the public sector to develop new technical
regulations based on the Law of the Fundamentals of Technical Regulations approved in 2004 to
bring the country’s standards system in compliance with WTO standards.

3.       The principal activities financed by the Grant were:

Technical Regulations (TR):

        RTBET provided extensive capacity building support to the Ministry of Economy and
         other ministries and agencies in TR development. Throughout project implementation,
         approximately 200 public officials and technical specialists from various ministries and
         agencies were trained on the various aspects of Technical Regulations and MSTQ.
        An international consultant was retained as a long-term resource to advise the
         government on how to set up an institutional framework and procedures to develop
         Technical Regulations.
        Local consultants developed technical regulations (TRs) with emphasis on the food and
         agriculture sector. Based on the input provided by these consultants and other
         international experts the following TRs were produced:

         Note: each column depicts the status of the TRs across each industry. In addition to those
         approved, numerous TRs are in various stages of preparation and approval: those
         submitted to Government and/or Parliament for approval, those in the drafting stage;
         those under technical review; and those in other preliminary stages of preparation.

4.     These regulations address multiple technical issues associated with quality and safety
such as those noted in the examples below:

Food
    Requirements for production, storage, transportation, distribution and utilization of drinks
     made from fruits and vegetables, bread, bakery products, confectionary, pasta, and
     alcoholic beverages.
    Requirements for safety of raw materials for production of sugar, technological standards
     and environmental protection in the production of sugar.
    General requirements for safety of drinking water.
    Requirements regarding the safety of products made by public catering companies.

Medical/Pharmaceutical
   Establish obligatory standards for medicines produced in drugstores.
   Safety requirements for medicines produced by pharmaceutical companies and other
      healthcare providers operating in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Construction
    Minimum safety requirements for construction materials.
    General requirements for safety of design and construction of homes, buildings and other
       commercial and industrial structures.

Chemicals
    Safety requirements for production of chemicals.
    Safety requirements for production, storage, transportation, and utilization of poisonous
      substances and of toxic and highly toxic substances.

Legal Metrology

5.    Provided assistance with the spin-off of Legal Metrology Inspectorate from the previous
NISM into an independent regulatory agency.

6.     Introduction of Risk Based Inspection regime. Financed local and international
consultants to develop the basic principles of risk-based inspections and training in surveillance
techniques.

Integrated Information System

7.      Installed an Information System linking various regulatory and supervisory agencies in
support of TR development and enforcement. The IT system supports the documentation flow
between government agencies and ministries involved in the preparation and implementation of
TRs. It allows multiple agencies and stakeholders to collaborate on the drafting of TRs providing


                                                       35
a clear track of what was sent to whom and when. The IT system also consolidates data and
information on the implementation of the TRs such as supervisory activity and enforcement
actions.

WTO Enquiry Point

8.       Establishment of a fully functional WTO Enquiry Point to channel requests and
information to and from potential trading partners including purchase of hardware, software and
telecommunications equipment. Project resources facilitated the development of a website for the
Technical Regulation Authorized body with an interface with and support for the Technical
Barrier to Trade (TBT) Enquiry Point.

9.     The Ministry of Economy is now in full compliance with the TBT WTO notification
requirements thanks to the establishment of a WTO Enquiry Point designed to facilitate
information exchange and transparency amongst international WTO trading partners.

Training

10.     Participation of Experts in Relevant International and Regional Fora (e.g.: WTO, ISO,
FAO). Kyrgyz officials participated in meetings of the working groups of UNECE on policy
issues in the field of standardization and norm regulation, in special meetings of the TBT WTO,
and also in the various Commissions of EurAsEC, ISC, CIS, the scientific and technical
commissions on technical regulation, sanitary, veterinary and phyto-sanitary measures,
surveillance, accreditation, metrology and certification.

PHRD Grant

11.    The proceeds of the TA Grant were utilized to retain international experts to perform
needs assessment against international standards as well as training in the following areas:
      Legal Metrology
      Market Surveillance (inspection system) in consideration of the new Technical
       Regulations
      Microbiology: provided training to testing laboratories and industry on the microbiology
       and scientific aspects of food safety
      Information Technology: requirements and technical specification for the WTO Enquiry
       point
      Accreditation of Testing Laboratories: TA to testing laboratories and initial assessment of
       testing laboratories against international standards for accreditation.

Component 2: Metrology and Standards

12.   This component strengthened the capacity of the Center for Standards and Metrology
(CSM) to perform its functions in the area of metrology, standards and calibration.




                                               36
13.     Developed twinning arrangements between internationally recognized organizations such
as the German Metrology Institute (PTB) and CSM in order to maximize ongoing professional
coaching, training, and peer exchanges. PTB provided critical support to CSM in the definition
of technical specifications for the procurement of laboratory facilities. For example, PTB
presented to CSM the specification of the metrological equipment on temperature and mass, the
specification on construction works and the control system of the laboratory environment.

14.   A total of 56 standards were procured and translated in support of harmonization of the
Kyrgyz domestic standards system with international standards.

15.    Installation of metrology equipment for seven laboratories in the following areas: length,
volume, pH-meter, density, pressure, time & frequency, and viscosity. These laboratories will
house the national etalons or reference measurement units critically needed to develop the
country’s export potential. Resources accounting for about 40 percent of Grant funding were
used to purchase metrology and calibration equipment for the laboratories and to upgrade the
physical location to house the etalons.

Training

16.     Technical experts from CSM participated in meetings of СООМЕТ Committee on
etalons, in the various technical committees on questions of mass, flow-metry, standard samples,
physics-chemistry, thermometry and thermo-physics, and a quality forum.

17.    Technical experts also participated in laboratory inter-comparisons of national etalons.

Component 3: Accreditation and Quality Enhancement

18.    Development of a modern domestic accreditation, testing and certification infrastructure
capable of providing reliable and trusted services to companies and consumers.

Kyrgyz Accreditation Center

19.     An independent national accreditation body, the Kyrgyz Accreditation Center (KAC) was
established in November 2006. From its start, KAC drew on the technical competence and
knowhow of the former Accreditation staff of the NISM. Resources from the project were
utilized to establish the new entity, to purchase IT equipment and furniture for the KAA office
and development of its web-site, and to acquire Etalons and materials for inter-laboratory
comparisons.

20.     In order to facilitate its institutional development, KAC implemented a Twinning
Arrangement with TURKAK, the Turkish Accreditation Body. This arrangement provided
technical assistance in a number of areas including gap analysis and performance assessment;
training on various ISO procedures and requirements; and assisting KAC with the preparation of
internal guidelines and procedures.




                                               37
21.     In July 2009, KAC applied for full membership in the International Laboratory
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC)9. After completion of a pre-peer review process, an ILAC
expert delegation visited Bishkek in September 2012 for a full audit to assess the strengths and
weaknesses of the Kyrgyz Accreditation system. The KCA has been responding to the initial
findings of the ILAC mission and the results of the final ILAC audit are expected to be received
by the end of 2013.

Laboratories

22.    Out of approximately 80 laboratories that have been accredited according to national
requirements the project worked only with the Epidemiology center under the Ministry of
Health, where the project equipped three laboratories: microbiology, chemicals and radiology.
The selection of these labs was based on the list of targeted industries identified in the PAD. In
addition, at inception, the RTBET Project retained two international experts on testing
laboratories and certification bodies to run a nation-wide assessment so as to select those testing
laboratories and certification bodies that would have benefited the most from any technical and
financial assistance to be provided under the RTBET Project. The labs provide services to
agribusinesses such as those involved in production of fruits and vegetables, juices and drinks,
meat and meat-products, milk and dairy products.

23.     On international accreditation of selected testing laboratories and certification bodies,
two qualified international auditors were retained under the Project to carry out a pre-audit
readiness assessment against the relevant ISO standards for international accreditation, namely
ISO 17025 for testing laboratories and the new ISO 17065 for certification bodies. The
international experts assessed the readiness level of testing laboratories ranging from 90 percent
to 95 percent depending on the type of testing equipment and procedure. The identified gap lies
in the need to perform laboratory inter-comparisons to ensure consistency of test results.

Certification Bodies

24.     One certification body has applied for international accreditation. The project financed
the services of an international expert who assessed the readiness level to be at 75 percent with
the main gap lying in the translation into English of guidelines and internal documentation.

Matching Grant Facility for Quality Improvement by Private Sector Companies

25.     At present, 12 companies in a wide range of sectors did acquire international certification
of quality management systems (i.e. ISO). Of these, three only are in the agribusiness / foodstuff
sector, with the remainder in manufacturing (cement, bulbs) and services. Of these companies,
just two benefitted from the project’s Matching Grant Facility.



9
  Accreditation bodies around the world, which have been evaluated by peers as competent, have signed an arrangement that
enhances the acceptance of products and services across national borders. The purpose of this arrangement, the ILAC
Arrangement, is to create an international framework to support international trade through the removal of technical barriers. The
ultimate aim of the ILAC Arrangement is the increased use and acceptance by industry as well as regulators of the results from
accredited laboratories and inspection bodies, including results from laboratories in other countries. In this way, the free-trade
goal of ’product tested once and accepted everywhere' can be realized.


                                                               38
26.     The trend in acquisition of voluntary quality standards (ISO) by firms has been slow
suggesting that companies are not yet investing in quality or aiming to expand into new (quality
sensitive) WTO markets. Many Kyrgyz companies indeed appeared to have competing
investment priorities as the international economic crisis and domestic social upheavals required
companies, especially smaller ones, to focus on maintaining their internal market shares and
keep afloat as going concerns rather than investing in quality systems in support of market
expansion and exports. In addition, smaller yet high export potential enterprises (e.g.,
textile/apparel) tend to shy away from exploring new markets given their limited production
capacity.

Mr. Alexander Kremer
Country Manager
World Bank Country Office in the Kyrgyz Republic



Dear Mr. Kremer,

Let me use this letter to share details about draft Implementation Completion Report produced
under Reducing Technical Barriers for Entrepreneurship and Trade Project.

Project implemented the number of structural and institutional adjustment activities in the
technical regulation and metrology area, and improved government’s capacity to contemplate
technical regulations that serve as the basis of technical regulation in the market economy as per
the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Basics of Technical Regulation in the Kyrgyz Republic.”

To refine existing quality assurance infrastructure of Center for Standardization and Metrology
(CSM), Project refurbished and re-equipped laboratories performing physical, chemical, pressure,
length, radio, and electricity tests. In addition, Project procured and installed primary standards
and metrological equipment for mass and temperature laboratories. For the first time ever the
country commenced a laboratory for transmission and synchronization of standard time signals.
As a part of procurements, CSM acquired the Russian translation of International Standards.

Among other things, Project strengthened capacity of Kyrgyz Accreditation Center under
Ministry of Economy and assisted with accession to International Laboratory Accreditation
Cooperation (ILAC). An international audit was held in October 2012 and presently ILAC is
deciding on the full membership of Kyrgyz Accreditation Center under Ministry of Economy of
the Kyrgyz Republic that would allow foreign markets to recognize KR conformity assessments.

Therefore, World Bank’s Reducing Technical Barriers for Entrepreneurship and Trade Project
facilitated outstanding reforms in technical regulation and development of national quality
assurance infrastructure.

Project was successfully completed and Ministry of Economy has no comments or proposals
with regard to Implementation Completion Report.

Please note that MSTQ reforms require a follow-up in:




                                               47
- Adoption of technical regulations on implementing quality and safety product management
systems by KR enterprises;

- Further equipping metrological and testing laboratories;

- Modernization of quality infrastructure in the regions of the country;

- International accreditation of selected testing laboratories and certification bodies.

That being said, Ministry of Economy is cordially requesting to consider a new project or
RTBET project continuation.

Continuation of the project efforts would help further improvement of the quality infrastructure
in Kyrgyzstan and reinforce its export and economic capacities.

Let me express my warmest regards and hope to carry on our fruitful cooperation.

                                              Sincerely,

                                         Aidai Kurmanova,

                           Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Economy.
