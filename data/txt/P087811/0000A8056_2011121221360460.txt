                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective is to streamline the compulsory standards requirements for business, develop systems to enhance product quality
                         and safety, and increase enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors. The key project outcomes will be a decrease in the cost of regulatory compliance for
                         business and, in the longer term, an increase in the share of non-gold trade with WTO partners.

                         trend in acquisition of voluntary quality standards (ISO) however continue to be slow suggesting that companies are not yet investing in quality or aiming to break through into new

                         approximate aggregate amount of USD1.6 Million (or 32% of Grant funds) are currently being processed. Financial management performance is satisfactory with good internal
                         controls and there are no overdue audits.
