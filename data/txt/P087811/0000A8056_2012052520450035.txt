                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective is to streamline the compulsory standards requirements for business, develop systems to enhance product quality and safety,
                         and increase enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors. The key project outcomes will be a decrease in the cost of regulatory compliance for business and, in the
                         longer term, an increase in the share of non-gold trade with WTO partners.

                         (KAC) established under the Project continues to make steady progress towards international recognition by ILAC. The first ILAC pre-peer review of the KAC was completed in
                         November 2011. The KAC has since been working diligently to address the recommendations of the pre-peer review and prepare for the full recognition Audit scheduled for this
                         summer. Notwithstanding the above mentioned progress in the development of the Kyrgyz Republic's Quality infrastructure, the adoption of quality management systems by
                         enterprises remains slow, due to a combination of factors ranging from competing investment priorities for companies that continue to face difficult economic conditions to the
                         relatively low level of sophistication of local companies and buyers’ markets in which they operate. As of March 20, 2012 disbursement levels stood at 48% of Grant funds with a total
                         value of USD 2,394,193 with an additional 30% of Grant funds committed under signed contracts currently under implementation.
