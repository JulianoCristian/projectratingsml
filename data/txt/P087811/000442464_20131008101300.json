Kyrgyz\n            Republic were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: continuity of Bank staff in charge of\n            project supervision is critical to the success of projects\n            that operate in a challenging environment. The linkage\n            between project components, outputs, and outcomes needs to\n            be clearly identified at project design stage to arrive at\n            more realistic project development objectives (PDOs). PDOs\n            need to be supported by project components that are\n            consistent with the results framework. An effective\n            mechanism to jump-start institutional development of\n            newly-formed entities and to speed up the learning curve is\n            to organize twinning arrangements with well-known\n            institutions that are committed to the sponsorship of best\n            practices. Projects with complex technical components should\n            be allowed more time for implementation or its principal\n            components structured as separate consecutive projects."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
