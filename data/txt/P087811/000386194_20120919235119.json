The closing\n            date of the project will be extended for five months from\n            October 31, 2012 until March 31, 2012. This will be the\n            second project extension with a cumulated extension period\n            of 23 months. Overall implementation progress has been\n            encouraging despite a number of operational difficulties and\n            delays related to project activity disruptions caused by the\n            repeated domestic political and social unrests that took\n            place over the course of implementation. USD 3.1 million or\n            62 percent of total International Development Association\n            (IDA) grant funds have been disbursed to date. An additional\n            30 percent are committed under signed contracts currently\n            under implementation. PDOs are currently moderately\n            satisfactory with noteworthy results observed in the (i)\n            development of a significant number of new technical\n            regulations in replacement of outdated standards, (ii)\n            reduction in the burden of regulatory compliance for\n            businesses, (iii) upgrading of metrology infrastructure,\n            (iv) improved reliability of domestic laboratory\n            accreditation services, (v) harmonization of Kyrgyz\n            standards on international standards, and (vi) creation of a\n            World Trade Organization (WTO) enquiry point providing\n            updated information on the Kyrgyz regulatory framework to\n            prospective trade partners. The PDOs continue to be\n            achievable within the extended closing date. The Kyrgyz\n            Government is keen to advance its challenging reform and\n            institutional building program in the technical regulation\n            and Metrology, Standards, Testing and Quality (MSTQ) areas\n            initiated under RTBET. Completing the installation of this\n            equipment will allow the project to meet its PDOs more fully\n            by ensuring that the project indeed helped 'streamline\n            the national technical regulation and standards framework\n            for business, develop systems to enhance quality and safety\n            of products and increase enterprise competitiveness in pilot\n            sectors' as per the formal project development objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
