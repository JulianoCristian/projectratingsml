                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall project development objective is to streamline the compulsory standards requirements for business, develop systems to enhance product quality and safety,
                         and increase enterprise competitiveness in pilot sectors. The key project outcomes will be a decrease in the cost of regulatory compliance for business and, in the
                         longer term, an increase in the share of non-gold trade with WTO partners.

                         from food to environment quality based on the radiology and physics equipment procured under the Project. In parallel, the Kyrgyz Accreditation Center (KAC) established under the
                         Project continues to make steady progress towards international recognition by ILAC. An international audit by ILAC experts conducted in September assessed that the KAC is
                         almost ready for international recognition. Notwithstanding the above mentioned progress in the development of the Kyrgyz Republic's Quality infrastructure, the adoption of quality
                         management systems by enterprises remains slow, due to a combination of factors ranging from competing investment priorities for companies that continue to face difficult economic
                         conditions to the relatively low level of sophistication of local companies and buyers’ markets in which they operate. As of mid October, 2012 disbursement levels stood at 76% of
                         Grant funds with a total value of USD 3,8 million with an additional 19% of Grant funds committed under signed contracts currently under implementation.
