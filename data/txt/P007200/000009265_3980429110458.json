"Ratings for the Municipal Development\n            Project in Guatemala are as follows: overall outcome of the\n            project is rated as satisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower were also rated as satisfactory. Some\n            of the lessons learned from the project are: 1)\n            participatory development should be given a chance,\n            especially where governance is weak at the local level\n            Guatemala's experience in participatory development has\n            proved successful and might be applicable to one of more of\n            the following conditions in other countries too: (i) post\n            conflict situations; (ii) volatile political and\n            institutional environment; and (iii) local-level government\n            undermined or even non-existent because of excessive\n            centralism; 2) participatory development requires intensive\n            supervision on the ground of the kind that United Nations\n            Children's Fund (UNICEF) provided efficiently. In\n            addition to the Bank's own regular supervision,\n            participatory development operations require intensive\n            day-to-day management of the kind that UNICEF provided so\n            effectively under this project; and 3) participatory\n            development is not necessarily a final solution, but is an\n            important way station on the route to more solid local\n            institutional development. Participatory development should\n            not allow local government to relinquish responsibilities\n            toward its poorer constituents. Thus, participatory\n            development should be complementary to the long-term pursuit\n            of municipal l reform of the kind originally envisioned by\n            this project."}, "docdt": "1998-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
