The project got\n            off to a good start, and project performance continued\n            overall to be quite satisfactory throughout the\n            implementation period. Incentive policy reforms (exchange\n            rate, price liberalization, import liberalization and export\n            promotion measures) were fully implemented and the\n            Government continues to maintain these incentive reforms.\n            The industrial sector as a whole has also become more\n            efficient as a result of policy reforms associated with the\n            project. Most aspects of the institution building component\n            of the operation were greeted with enthusiasm by the\n            beneficiaries in the government agencies concerned. Some of\n            the lessons are as follows: The first is that good economic\n            and sector work leads to a good project   Second, is the\n            importance of having a project reinforce and supplement\n            ongoing reforms. Third, it is important for both the\n            borrower and IDA to be flexible and adapt to changes in the\n            policy environment.  Fourth, intensive supervision, which\n            was carried out in this case, greatly enhances project effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1993-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
