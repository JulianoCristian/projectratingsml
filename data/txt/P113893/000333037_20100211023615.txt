                              Government of Jamaica
            (First Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan)
Borrower:              Government of Jamaica
Implementing Agency:   MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE
                       IBRD Loan Amount: US$200 million
                       Terms: The Borrower has requested a US dollar commitment-linked IBRD Flexible
Financing Data:        Loan with a variable spread, with level repayment of principal payable in 30 years
                       (including 5.5 years of grace period). The Borrower wishes to maintain all risk
                       management options embedded in the loan and to finance the front-end fees out of the
                       loan proceeds. Front-end fee is 0.25 percent on principal amount.
Operation Type:        First in a series of programmatic single-tranche Development Policy Loans (DPL)
                       The proposed operation supports the Borrower's efforts aimed at: (i) enhancing fiscal
Main Policy Areas:     and debt sustainability; (ii) increasing the efficiency of public financial management
                       and budgeting processes; and (iii) further strengthening Tax Administration and
                       increasing tax revenue generation capacity.
                       (i) Increase in the primary budget surplus of the Central Government by 1.8 percentage
                       points of GDP by FY2010/11 (Baseline: 4.8 percent of GDP at end-FY2008/09);
                       (ii) No more deferred financing (Baseline: Average annual deferred financing from
                       FY2000/01 to FY2005/06 was J$497 million)
Key Outcome
Indicators (March      (iii) Fiscal savings of at least 1.5 percent of GDP generated due to Government's Debt
2011):                 Management Activities (Baseline: Interest paid by Central Government was 16.0
                       percent of GDP in FY2009/10)
                       (iv) Reduced losses of Public Bodies generate savings of at least 1 percentage point of
                       GDP by FY2010/11 (Baseline: Public entities balance was -2.8 percent of GDP in
                       FY2009/10)
                       The Program Development Objectives are to:
                       ·   Enhance fiscal and debt sustainability, by supporting reforms to increase control
                           on public spending and debt generation, reduce debt service burden and improve
                           debt management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, increase public spending
                           effectiveness, and fortify the country's ability to cope with the adverse
                           consequences of the on-going global economic downturn.
                       ·   Increase the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes,
                           by supporting efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and
Program Development        investment, and strengthen control of public finances and the effectiveness of
Objectives and             government budgeting practices.
Contribution to CAS:
                       ·   Further strengthen Tax Administration and increase tax revenue generation
                           capacity, through measures aimed at enhancing audit and control, improving client
                           services for tax payers, broadening tax base, simplifying tax payments, and
                           introducing greater uniformity in tax policy.
                       Given the decline in fiscal revenues under the current global environment, these efforts
                       are particularly important for improving the fiscal balance to create space for
                       productive expenditures and help foster growth in the medium term.
                       Contribution to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS): The proposed DPL is fully
                       consistent with the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy which has been scheduled

                                                 6
                   for Board discussion on February 23, 2010. The FY10-13 CPS further reflects the
                   government's focus on addressing fiscal and debt challenges, especially given the
                   impact of the global crisis on Jamaica.
                   There are four significant risks to the program supported by the proposed DPL
                   including:
                   Economic: The current global financial crisis and economic downturn have led to
                   significant contraction of GDP, added to high borrowing needs, and a large
                   depreciation of the currency. GDP declined by 1.6 percent in FY08/09 and is projected
                   to decline further by about 3.5 percent in FY09/10. Public debt went up from 124 to an
                   estimated 139 percent of GDP between FY08/09 and FY09/10. There is further
                   downside risk if the global environment does not improve as envisaged. Mitigation:
                   Since Jamaica is vulnerable to external shocks, prospects for mitigation are limited.
                   Development partners have put together resources for on-demand technical assistance
                   in support of the government's fiscal and debt sustainability program. To mitigate
                   liquidity risks and ease financing constraints, the GoJ has sought a multilateral
                   package of support from the World Bank, the IMF (US$1.25 billion or 300 percent of
                   Jamaica's special drawing rights quota), the IDB, and the CDB.
                   Political risk to implementation capacity: The current government came into power
                   in the fall of 2007, but has had a narrow majority in Parliament, making the
                   government's program vulnerable to special interests. Political opposition may delay
                   progress in implementation of reforms. This concern has been amplified in the context
                   of the decline in economic activity due to the global crisis, which may also cause social
                   unrest and weaken political will. Mitigation: The risk is reduced by the Government's
                   consultative approach to reform implementation and the facilitation of dialogue on
                   fiscal and economic costs of inaction among country stakeholders. IFIs and other
Risks and Risk     donors are heavily focused on building consensus for advancing critical public sector
Mitigation:        reforms to improve fiscal and debt sustainability. The Government's communication
                   strategy over the next two years should focus on both explaining the benefits of reforms
                   and the costs of postponement.
                   Institutional capacity and reform implementations: The Government has embarked
                   on substantial public sector reforms which require changes in institutional structures
                   and significant enhancement in institutional capacity for an effective implementation.
                   The reform process might be delayed as institutions try to adjust to the changes and
                   enhance their capacity. Mitigation: Jamaica has well established institutions. The
                   development partners have been providing technical assistance for institutional
                   capacity building and advancing public sector reforms.
                   Natural Disasters: Jamaica is highly vulnerable to natural disasters--droughts, floods
                   and hurricanes--that threaten economic growth and poverty reduction, and direct
                   government resources away from long-term investment plans. Mitigation: The damage
                   to major private sector enterprises is partly covered by insurance. The GoJ
                   participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. The Bank is
                   assisting Jamaica through investments in natural disaster risk mitigation with the
                   Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery Loan and technical assistance for its safety net
                   program to mitigate adverse consequences on poverty. In January 2009, the National
                   Water Sector Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action to address climate change were
                   established with Bank assistance and provide recommendations on key investments to
                   mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in the water sector. In addition, the
                   GoJ has presented a draft National Disaster Management Act to Parliament for
                   enactment.

                          TO JAMAICA

                                   I. INTRODUCTION
1.      This program document describes the proposed single-tranche First Programmatic
Fiscal Sustainability DPL (FS DPL1) in the amount of US$200 million for Jamaica. The
proposed operation builds on the progress made under the Bank's previous Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability DPL (January 2009) and supports the Government of Jamaica's (GoJ) reform
program aimed at improving management of public finances and reducing the debt burden on
the economy. This reform program is critical to the GoJ's strategy to create fiscal space for
priority social and investment spending and increase the growth potential of Jamaica. The FS
DPL1 will also support the maintenance of macroeconomic stability while the GoJ adjusts to the
deterioration in the global environment while continuing to implement the longer term reform
agenda for fiscal and debt sustainability. The FS DPL1 supports actions to (a) promote fiscal
sustainability through control of overall public sector balances and debt generation, and
rationalization of Public Bodies; (b) improve the efficiency of public financial management and
budget process; and (c) strengthen the Tax Administration capacity, reduce tax distortions and
enhance the efficiency of the tax system. The Government has made progress on these key
components of its reform program, even in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis.
2.      While current global conditions have added to existing challenges, the Government
has remained committed to the long term reform agenda. Jamaica has been severely hit by
the global economic crisis and the impacts are likely to persist over the medium term. Output
declined by 1.6 percent in FY2008/09 and is projected to decline by another 3.5 percent in
FY2009/10, largely due to the near collapse of the bauxite industry and reductions in
remittances and tourism receipts. Unemployment is on the rise and poverty implications of
declining economic activity are considerable. The GoJ is fiscally constrained and has no room
for adopting countercyclical policies. Nonetheless, the Government has responded by expanding
the conditional cash transfer program, PATH, limiting the growth of public sector wages, easing
liquidity conditions, and trying to stabilize the exchange rate. However the sharp decline in
growth has led to an increase in the fiscal deficit and in the debt to GDP ratio, though the latter
is projected to decline in the medium term, due mainly to improvements in the Central
Government and public sector balances as the fiscal and debt management reforms start to have
an impact.
3.      The GoJ recognizes the importance of achieving and maintaining medium and long
run sustainability. The Government has developed a well articulated medium-term economic
program to improve fiscal sustainability, reduce the debt overhang and put the economy on a
high growth path, while maintaining and even expanding social spending to protect the most
vulnerable groups. As part of this program, the Government announced a debt exchange offer
on January 14, 2010 with the objective of reducing the interest rate on, and extending the
maturity profile of a portion of, outstanding domestic debt. The Government estimates that
fiscal savings from the debt exchange will be at least 3 percent of GDP during FY2010/2011.
The offer does not involve any hair-cut in principal. Following the announcement of the debt
exchange, Jamaica's credit ratings were downgraded by rating agencies. However, the same

                                                8
rating agencies also highlighted that upon successful completion of the debt exchange, credit
ratings for Jamaica would be upgraded since the debt exchange would reduce the debt service
burden and improve the prospects for sustainability. Nonetheless, the downgrading presents
short-term challenges and the debt exchange itself may reduce the liquidity in domestic
markets--making it harder for the Government to secure financing in the short term. To
maintain macroeconomic stability and ensure resources are available to support the longer run
fiscal and institutional reform program, the GoJ has adopted the strategy of seeking financing
from the international financial institutions (IFIs).
4.      The proposed DPL supports the GoJ's efforts to improve fiscal balances and
reduce costly public debt in a sustainable fashion. These efforts will mitigate the impact of
the crisis and help maintain macroeconomic stability, while providing the means to generate
additional fiscal space necessary to accelerate growth and address social challenges in the
medium run. The Government aims to cut by half the central government's budget deficit and
achieve an overall public debt to GDP ratio of less than 120 percent by 2014/15, based on the
latest projections of the global economic environment by IFIs. The proposed loan will
contribute to the financing necessary for Jamaica to minimize the effects of near-term global
financial market volatility. It will also support the GoJ's active debt management operations to
reduce the net present value of public debt in a manner consistent with the GoJ's fiscal and debt
management objectives.
5.      The GoJ's program is the basis for support from international financial institutions
and donors, including the World Bank, the IMF, the CDB, the EU, and the IDB. These
operations will provide financial support to Jamaica as it implements difficult policy actions in
an adverse global environment. There is a significant level of donor coordination and fiscal and
debt sustainability has been the centerpiece in all donors' programs. The financial support from
the IFI's for the Government's reform program is expected to reach extraordinary levels, nearly
20 percent of GDP. The proposed operation is thus part of a significant effort by multilaterals to
help the GoJ sustain its long-term development agenda.
6.      The Government has agreed with the IMF on a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) to
manage short term difficulties and support the longer term reform agenda. The authorities
and the IMF have reached an agreement on a set of policy measures to credibly reduce fiscal
deficits and debt service burden and improve fiscal and debt sustainability. The SBA, in the
amount of US$1.25 billion, will cover a period of 27 months and was approved by the Board of
Executive Directors of the IMF on February 4, 2010.
7.      The Government launched a Debt Exchange on January 14, 2010, with a view to
reducing debt servicing on and improving the maturity profile of its outstanding domestic
public debt. As of February 3, the government has estimated a participation rate of above 95
percent in the debt exchange ­ reflecting wide acceptance by bond holders. The multilateral
package of support from the IFIs will also provide market liquidity and reduce risks to
participants in the debt exchange, should any arise, while supporting the Government as it
implements its medium-term reform program. The Bank proposes to synchronize disbursement
with that of the IMF's SBA, which is to be front-loaded with approximately US$650 million
made available upon approval on February 4, 2010.
8.     The IFI's have coordinated closely on their support for the GoJ's reform program.
The policy actions supported by this DPL are complemented by those in the proposed IMF SBA

                                               9
for Jamaica, which also focuses on structural fiscal reforms aimed at supporting the GoJ's
objective of longer-run sustainability, as well as in the public sector reform programs (PBLs) of
the IDB and CDB. All these institutions are supporting measures to improve fiscal and debt
management, rationalize Public Bodies, and strengthen tax administration and policy. The
World Bank is also coordinating with the IMF and the other IFIs in the phasing of
disbursements and in the sequencing of the policy actions. This coordination is important to
ensure that the Government's financial needs are met in a timely manner while reform
momentum is maintained.
9.      The Government is aware of the importance of forging political consensus for the
reform program and has worked to create strong, broad-based support among
stakeholder groups. The Government has been consulting with the social partners for about
two years, lately chaired by the Prime Minister. Participants in this consultation are senior
leaders of the main political opposition, leading business personalities, trade unionists, and
university professors. Together with a carefully crafted communication strategy for targeted
groups, the Government received a broad acceptance of its reform program. In particular, when
it offered a debt exchange program in mid-January 2010 with longer maturity and significantly
lower coupon rates on the same face value, it received over 95 percent acceptance as of
February 3, 2010. The high level of participation, as well as the broad support in the media,
reflects the Government's efforts to build ownership and consensus on key reforms. Indeed, in
discussing the debt exchange in the Parliament, the opposition party highlighted that the debt
exchange is just the first step and would not be sufficient on its own and that the Government
needs to have a more broad-based reform program. During the same discussion, the opposition
questioned the equity of increased tax measures but not the need for it, reflecting the broader
acceptance of the reforms by the opposition. The Government is continuing to deepen the social
partnership efforts to foster consensus and build wider ownership of the reform program.
10.    The proposed operation is rooted in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) of the Jamaica and the World Bank. The FY10-13 CPS includes fiscal and debt
sustainability as a main component for macroeconomic stability. This DPL is envisaged in the
CPS as the first in a series of programmatic single tranche operations designed to support the
government's reforms aimed at fiscal and debt sustainability.

                                II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

   A. Political Context
11.    Jamaica has a history of stable political institutions. Since its independence in 1962,
Jamaica has had a Westminster-style parliamentary democracy with two main parties: the
Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) and the People's National Party (PNP). After 18 years in the
opposition, the JLP won the 2007 general election and holds 32 seats compared with the PNP's
28. The country is characterized by a high degree of personal freedom, freedom of expression,
and vibrant free press; with respect to the latter, Jamaica consistently ranks in the top 10 percent
globally, ahead of many developed democracies.
12.    The new administration has prioritized reducing poverty, combating crime and
violence, jump-starting the economy, and strengthening the governance framework,
particularly in relation to combating corruption. The Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has

                                                10
embarked on an ambitious reform program aimed at achieving higher growth and addressing
social challenges. The Government has prepared and tabled in Parliament its comprehensive
long-term development plan, Vision 2030. The GoJ has also developed a Medium-Term Socio-
Economic Framework to achieve more near-term goals.
13.     The GoJ recognizes that without reducing debt and controlling the debt generating
process, public investment and social needs, such as improving health, education and
addressing crime and violence, will not be met. It has outlined critical priorities to lower
debt, including the establishment of a comprehensive Fiscal Responsibility Framework,
rationalization of public enterprises, comprehensive tax reform, improving public sector
efficiency, and improving the business climate as a means for placing the country on a more
sustainable fiscal and growth trajectory. These priorities have become even more pertinent in
the context of the current global financial market crisis. Therefore, the GoJ has recognized the
need to undertake liability management and is fully committed to doing so.
      B. Economic Context
14.     Jamaica is a lower middle-income country with high life expectancy and relatively
low poverty. Jamaica's per capita GNI was approximately $4,870 in 2008 (latest available
year) and it is the largest English-speaking country in the Caribbean. Jamaica enjoys the
advantages of proximity to its largest trading partners, language, time zone, and natural resource
endowments. The population, of about 2.7 million, enjoys relatively high life expectancy (73
years), and the country has achieved a marked reduction in poverty from 28.4 percent of the
population in 1990 to 9.9 percent in 2007. Although poverty reduction has been more
pronounced in the urban areas, rural poverty has also come down by more than half in the same
time period.

15.        Jamaica's growth has been low and the country has underperformed vis-à-vis the
region. The average real GDP growth rate over the past 30 years amounted to 1 percent per
year; excluding the exceptional growth years in the run-up to the 1996 crisis, the economy has
                                                   on average stagnated. Between 2005 and

17.                                On the measurement side, low growth performance in the last decade can also be

                                                                                                                           11
    largely attributed to problems arising from increasing informality in the Jamaican
    economy. The actual growth rates could be higher once rising informality is accounted.
    Productive capital stock might have also been overestimated as a non-negligible part of the
    investment could be toward crime protection which is a sunk cost to the economy 12. Similarly, a
    part of investment could be just the replacement of the capital eroded by the hurricanes.
    18.    Adverse external factors, weak financial regulation and the resulting banking crisis
    in the second half of the 1990s, the loss of competitiveness due to real exchange rate
    appreciation and rising real wages, increasing costs associated with rising crime, and an
    increasing burden of government consumption have all contributed to low growth in the
    past decade. The low total factor productivity that might be caused by debt overhang has also
    been a major driving factor behind poor economic performance. The quality of education may
    not be supportive of productivity gains although schooling ratios are high and education is
    widespread.
    19.    The large share of public resources devoted to debt service and the wage bill are
    additional constraints on Jamaica's growth. The public debt-to-GDP ratio averaged 135
    percent of GDP over the past decade and bound 38 percent of total government expenditures, or
    13 percent of GDP, to debt servicing. Over the past ten years, wages and salaries featured on
    average 31 percent of total expenditure, or 10 percent of GDP. Combined, these factors diverted
    resources from strongly needed investment in education and infrastructure and aggravated other
    growth constraints.
    20.     Another important driver of poor growth is low total factor productivity (TFP).
    TFP has declined by 0.5 percent a year from 1960 to 2000, while the LAC average has
    increased by 0.2 percent per year and the global average by 0.9 percent. This is linked to several
    factors, including poor educational outcomes -- two-thirds of the labor force has never received
    any formal training and Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) Pass rates in math and English
    are low compared to their Caribbean peers -- large emigration of skilled workers, a large
    informal sector, labor market rigidities that have limited the expansion of formal employment,
    and high unemployment rates.
    21.     Finally, high private investment rates in Jamaica are yet to translate into high
    growth. Investment rates were as high as 30 percent of GDP on average over the past decade
    but the share of public investment spending has been low, typically below 4 percent of GDP in
    recent years. Given the complementarity between public and private investment, countries with
    very low public investment, such as Jamaica, appear to grow more slowly, even if private
    investment remains high. These issues will be more fully explored in the Bank's forthcoming
    CEM on Growth in Jamaica. Additionally, the country's vulnerability to climate variability and
    change and high incidence of natural disasters required investment into replacement of the
    capital stock. Low productivity, high incidences of crime, as well as high energy costs,
    particularly electricity, further hampered investment efficiency.
    22.    Growth has been strongly driven by services which account for 70 percent of total

      value added. Services and construction accounted for more than 100 percent of growth in the
      past decade, while both agriculture and manufacturing had a negative contribution of around 13
      percent each. The service sector is dominated by tourism, finance and insurance services.
      23.    Jamaica's growth has been mainly driven by domestic demand with only a modest
      contribution from exports. Consumption and investment on average accounted for more than
      100 percent of GDP growth in Jamaica over the past decade (Figure 2). Some of the weakness
      in export performance can be explained by real exchange rate appreciation since 2002, but other
      reasons include concentrated product mix consisting primarily of tourism and bauxite and
      dependence on the US as primary export destination.

government budget process is weak, as
evidenced by spending commitments
outside the budget. There has also Source: Statistical Institute of Jamaica (for the CPI), the Bank of
                                           Jamaica (for the food CPI)
been inadequate control over scores of
insufficiently transparent off-budget public entities that both help finance, and are financed by,
the central government. Although the entities' accounts are published, they are not present ed
consistently in a way that is amenable to formulating and assessing the overall direction of fiscal
policy. Furthermore, fundamental reform of public employment management has been lacking,
resulting in periodic upward spikes of the wage bill. The government's ongoing efforts to
develop and implement fiscal responsibility legislation are targeted at addressing these issues.
26.    The Government is among the largest employers in Jamaica, providing work for
nearly 120,000 persons (4.5 percent of the population). Teachers and support staff at schools
represent about a third of the total public sector workforce, followed by central government
administrative employees (18 percent) and employees from statutory bodies (15 percent). The
number of established positions within the Central Government has remained relatively constant
since 2004. Permanent civil service posts, authorized by the Civil Service Establishment Act,
have remained close to 41,000 employees for the last five years.
27.     At 10.8 percent of GDP in FY2008/09, Jamaica's central government wage bill was
in line with international standards, but increased significantly in the past year, and
absorbs a considerable amount of government resources. Jamaica's wage bill is only slightly
above the average for Caribbean states (10.7 percent of GDP). However, while expenditures on
salaries and wages have remained relatively constant at about 31 percent of GDP, they have
increased as a percentage of total tax revenues from 41 to 45 percent. This increase in the wage
bill was due to salary increases negotiated with more than 70 bargaining units of public sector
employees. Some of these units are included under the Joint Confederation of Trade Unions,
which has signed three biennial Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the Government
since 2004 with the objective of moderating the growth of the public wage bill. In the latest
MOU--MOUIII (2008-2010)--the agreed wage increases were 15 percent in year 1 and 7
percent in year 2, but year 2 increases have not been implemented due to the government's
fiscal challenges.

    28.    Jamaica has a high public sector debt burden with a debt to GDP ratio of 124
    percent of GDP at the end of FY08/09. Total public debt increased from 84 percent of GDP in
    1997 to 123.3 percent of GDP by 2003 following the financial crisis of the mid-1990s.
    Although, the debt ratio decreased to 113.5 percent by FY07/08, it rose again to 124 percent in
    FY08/09. Government guaranteed debt and external debt of PetroCaribe were important sources
    of increase in the total debt stock since FY2006/07 (Figure 3). High debt servicing on both
    domestic and foreign debt was also an important source of deterioration in the debt ratio.
    Additionally, the recent exchange rate depreciation caused external currency debt to increase in
    value.
    29.     Stronger control of Public Bodies--whose debt is about 19 percent of GDP--is critical
    for reducing the public debt ratio. Despite high primary surpluses of the central government,
    debt levels hardly fell. This was partially because of materialization of contingent liabilities of
    some public bodies 3. Despite the risk of having to service the public bodies' non-guaranteed debt,
    which is mostly owed to the domestic private sector, the GoJ's debt management strategy focuses
    on direct and Central Government guaranteed debt only. With the consolidation of public bodies
    into the central budget, a process that is supported by this proposed loan, the non-guaranteed debt
    portfolio will be integrated into the Debt Management Unit's mandate.

    30.     The composition of Jamaica's public debt indicates exposure to currency, interest
    and roll-over risks. Although the share of debt indexed or denominated in foreign currency has
    come down from about 90 percent in FY1990/91, it was still more than half of public debt as of
    FY2008/09. Nonetheless, debt from multilateral or bilateral creditors amounts to 36.7 percent, a
    significant ratio, and this provides some stability in debt dynamics. The exposure of public debt
    to changes in interest rates is also significant: as of November 2009 variable-rate instruments

assumed by the Central Government is referred to as other debt accumulating flows.

most of the external debt has a maturity longer than 5 years, nearly three quarters of the
domestic debt matures in five years or less.

31.     The Jamaican financial system is dominated by the commercial banking sector.
The banking system is comprised of commercial banks, building societies, merchant banks
(licensees under the Financial Institutions Act), and credit unions. In terms of assets (deposits),
as of June 30 2009, commercial banks and building societies represent 71 (69) and 19 (21)
percent of banking system assets (deposits), respectively. The commercial banking system has
not been a source of risk to the domestic financial system during the crisis. Commercial banks
have been able to tap international capital markets for funds to maintain their liquidity and
capital positions during the crisis and prudential ratios ­ non-performing loans to capital, loan
loss provisions, liquidity to liability ratio ­ have all shown steady improvement.
32.      Heavy exposure of the domestic financial system to government securities is an
important source of vulnerability. As of September 2009, domestic investors held an
estimated J$961.4 billion in government debt. In contrast, loans at depository institutions totaled
J$379.5 billion. Insurance companies and pension funds--the largest institutional investors in
the market--hold 60 and 39 percent of their assets, respectively, in government securities.
Banks are required to maintain more than a quarter of their deposits and borrowings (prescribed
liabilities) in government and liquid assets. Securities dealers, many of which are affiliated with
commercial banks, are the largest single holders of government securities, and they finance their
inventory by borrowing directly from retail investors who are thus exposed to the risk of dealer
balance sheets.
33.     The main source of risk is the combination of high government debt brokered by
securities dealers and the fact that these dealers carry highly liquid and largely dollar-
denominated liabilities. Approximately 46 percent of securities dealers' repurchase agreements
(repos) are US$ denominated, and most of these are collateralized by government securities
originally issued outside of Jamaica. Thus, dealers dominate the market for liquid liabilities


                                                      16
which is heavily weighted toward US$ assets. Starting October 2008, there was a large increase
in Central Bank loans to domestic securities' brokers. These loans were financed by heavy
borrowing at US overnight rates, leading to an increase in the cost of issuing domestic debt and
financing the fiscal deficit. Thus, the spike in domestic interest rates and depreciation of the
Jamaican dollar in the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009 were at least partially caused
by these higher financing costs. Although interest rates have returned to near pre-crisis levels,
the vulnerabilities illustrated by these developments remain.
34.     In terms of business environment, Jamaica ranks among the mid-performers,
though its ranking has deteriorated in the past year. Jamaica fell to 75th place--compared to
67th (out of 181 countries) a year ago--in terms of the overall ease of doing business. Despite
the overall deterioration, however, some improvements have been recorded in simplifying tax
payment procedures and property registration due to the ongoing reforms in tax administration.

   C. Recent Economic Developments, Impact of the Crisis, and Macroeconomic
      Outlook
35.     The impact of the global crisis on Jamaica has been substantial and is likely to
continue over the medium-term. In FY 2007/08, real GDP growth decelerated to 0.6 percent
from 3.2 percent the prior year due to the adverse impacts of Hurricane Dean and the food and
fuel price crisis. GDP grew by -1.6 percent in FY2008/09. The estimate for FY2009/10 is -3.5
percent, with growth being projected to recover to 1.9 percent by FY2011/12 (Table 3). The
crisis affected Jamaica through four main channels: decline in tourism, lower export demand
and remittances from the US, worsening financial conditions, and decline in domestic demand
and credit growth. The assumption on growth in the medium-term is partly a reflection of the
recovery after the sharp contraction due to the global crisis and is also based on the assumption
of improved domestic demand as a result of projected global recovery and improved quality of
public expenditures following fiscal adjustments and borrowing from the multilaterals. The
cumulative decline in real GDP is estimated to be around 5 percentage points during FY2008/09
and FY2009/10. The real GDP is projected to recover gradually and reach the pre-crisis level by
FY2013/14. This gradual recovery will be supported by the improving global economic activity,
rising FDI inflows and related increase in construction activity, fall in interest rates following
fiscal consolidation, recovery in international aluminum prices and gradual increase in
aluminum production, rise in tourism activity and increase in agricultural production. Domestic
credit growth is also projected to increase by 11 percentage points between 2009/10 and
2010/11 as interest rates soften.
36.     The financial sector has been adversely affected by the crisis, though it weathered
the turmoil in global markets well. As of June 2009, the solvency indicator was adequate as
reflected by the CAR of the banking system, which was 15.4 percent, similar to that observed in
June 2008 (15.6 percent), and higher than that observed in December 2008 (13.9 percent).
Between June 2008 and June 2009, the rate of credit growth was 20 percent, which was funded
partially by deposits, borrowings (including repos), and a shift in bank portfolios away from
investments. The return on assets remained largely unchanged over the same period. However,
there are signs that the Jamaican financial sector has suffered from the effects of the
international financial crisis. The Non-Performing Loan ratio (NPLs over Total Loans) has
increased from 2.2 percent in June 2008 to 3.6 percent in June 2009. Over the same period, the
ratio of provisions for loan losses over NPLs declined from 120 percent in June 2008 to 91

                                               17
    percent.
    37.     The heavy reliance of the financial sector on government debt implies increased
    sensitivity to the pressures faced by the Government due to the external environment. The
    crisis has revealed vulnerabilities in some Jamaican financial institutions, which have used
    government bonds as collateral for external credit lines. As markets discounted Jamaican bond
    prices, due to greater perceived risk, and the value of the collateral dropped, institutions needed
    to present more assets to maintain the minimum value of the collateral or close their line of
    credit. In addition, as the global financial crisis continues, there is a greater risk of contagion
    from foreign markets to local markets through the presence of foreign banks, which represent
    35 percent of total bank assets in Jamaica as of June 2009.
    38.     The Central Bank has acted to increase liquidity and ease credit constraints to the
    banking sector. Credit to the private sector is expected to increase from J$33 billion to J$49
    billion between FY2008/09 and FY2009/10. In addition, the central Bank has provided an
    emergency credit line to financial firms that were suffering dollar liquidity constraints due to a
    drop in the value of collateral, from which $168 million was drawn. The Government has also
    accessed the IDB's Growth Stability Fund for $200 million for on-lending to commercial
    financial institutions to support credit to firms that suffer financing constraints from the loss of
    suppliers' credits.
    39.     A key challenge facing the authorities is to reduce external vulnerabilities while
    maintaining internal balance and recovering reserves. The Jamaican dollar depreciated
    against the US dollar by around 15 percent (from J$76.93 to J$88.06) from December 2008 to
    February 2009, but since then the exchange rate has been close to J$89 (averaging at J$89.6 in
    December 2009). In order to contain exchange rate depreciation between August 2008 and July
    2009, the Bank of Jamaica raised interest rates on 90 and 180 day certificates of deposit (CDs)
    to 17.5 and 19.0 percent, respectively. Interventions by the Central Bank have resulted in a
    year-on-year decrease of 2.1 percent in net international reserves, which now account for about
    thirteen weeks of imports of goods and services.
    40.     The Government is constrained in how much it can increase priority expenditures
    by limited fiscal space. The Government introduced a mini stimulus package favoring mostly
    the tourism sector through a temporary reduction in the general consumption tax in December
    2008 and, as a Christmas bonus, tax-free small gifts from abroad. To mitigate the impact of the
    crisis on the poor, the Government increased benefit levels and expanded the coverage of the
    conditional cash transfer program (PATH) from US$30 million at the end of 2008 to US$34
    million in FY2009/10. However, further increases have been limited by the lack of fiscal space.
    The Government has issued a circular freezing public sector salaries in April 2009, followed by
    the Prime Minister's announcement of a two year wage freeze in December 2009. Nonetheless,
    in the FY09/10 budget 56.5 percent of the appropriation is dedicated to interest payments on
    outstanding government debt and another 22.5 percent is for civil servants pay, leaving just 21
    percent for office maintenance, supplies and service provisions.4 Debt reduction is therefore a

  The government issued Circular No. 12, on April 17, 2009, as a temporary measure to contain the wage bill in
2009/2010. The circular suspended the implementation of the second phase of salary increases for public sector
employees (including those from government companies and public bodies) as agreed under MOU III. The
government later agreed with teachers and nurses retroactive wage settlements through the Supplementary Estimates
to the Budget, in September 30, 2009.

key component of the Government's strategy to expand fiscal space.
41.     Inflation is falling from its 2008 highs and is expected to continue to moderate over
the medium term following a temporary rise in FY2010/11. Fueled by high food and fuel
prices, inflation rose to more than 20 percent in FY2008/09. However, with lower energy prices
and falling domestic demand, consumer prices are expected to ease to 9.0 percent in
FY2009/10. Inflation is expected to pick up temporarily in FY2010/11 mostly due to rise in
taxes and recovering commodity prices. In the medium term, inflation is expected to average at
7.8 percent over FY2010/11-FY2013/14.
42.    Tourism revenues and remittances have declined but are expected to recover with
the global economy. Tourism receipts are expected to increase from 14.3 to 16.0 percent of
GDP between FY2008/09 and FY2009/10, while net private transfers--mainly remittances--
are expected to average 15.9 percent of GDP between 2009/10 and 2013/14 during the global
recovery.
43.     The goods trade balance improved markedly in the second half of 2009. The goods
trade balance recorded a deficit of US$2,271.6 million, an improvement of US$1,592.1 million
when compared to the corresponding period in 2008. This resulted primarily from a reduction in
imports of US$2,824 million (or 46 percent), which was significantly influenced by a reduction
in imports of mineral fuels of US$1,910 million. The improvement observed in the goods
subaccount was partially offset by a US$1,232 million (or 54 percent) decline in exports,
stemming mainly from a reduction in alumina exports of US$698 million. However, this decline
was more than offset by the fall in imports due to reduced domestic economic activity and
falling international commodity prices. The resulting narrowing of the current account deficit
mitigated the impact of the global crisis on Jamaica's external financing needs.
44.    On the capital account side, flows from official and private sources were sufficient
to finance the current account deficit. Consequently, the net international reserves increased
by US$160.3 million during January-September 2009.
45.     In the medium-term, current account deficit is expected to narrow from 18 percent
of GDP in FY2008/09 to 9.4 percent in FY2009/10 and 5.0 percent in FY2013/14. The
medium-term dynamics are linked closely to the projected global recovery and stronger export
revenues. Higher interest payments on external debt and a projected decline in the imputed
profit remittances from private direct investment are expected to reduce net foreign income.
Foreign direct investment flows are projected to fall even further over the next two years, but
pick up in FY2011/12.
46.     Central government revenues are estimated to have improved to 28.3 percent of
GDP in FY 2009/10 from 27.3 percent in FY2007/08. This improvement has been
underpinned by stronger tax collection efforts, which have yielded a reduction in tax arrears on
interest, income, and corporate profits by virtue of the tax amnesty this fiscal year. Revenues
have also been boosted by the introduction of a series of tax packages introduced over the
course of FY 2009/10. However, these positive developments have been somewhat offset by
lower receipts on the bauxite levy and consumption taxes amid the slowing pace of economic
activity (Table 2).

    47.    Rising debt service costs as well as higher spending on wages, salaries, and capital
    goods have been the main drivers of overall deficits in recent years. Between FY2005/06
    and FY2008/09, revenues increased by 0.4 percentage points of GDP while expenditures
    increased by 4.5 percentage points of GDP. Spending increases have mainly been driven by
    higher interest payments (which averaged 12.2 percent of GDP between FY2005/06 and
    FY2008/09), capital expenditure (which increased by 2.3 percentage points of GDP), and wages
    and salaries (which increased by 2.0 percentage points) over between 2005/06 and 2008/09).
    Consequently, the primary surplus deteriorated from 9.9 to 4.8 percent of GDP between
    2005/06 and 2008/09.
    48.     To contain spending growth, increases in interest expenditures and the wage bill
    have been offset somewhat by cuts in capital spending. The cost of debt service is projected
    to increase from 12.2 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to 16.0 percent of GDP in FY2009/10. The
    latest settlements with teachers and nurses, agreed before a general wage freeze for all public
    sector employees was announced, have contributed to an increase in the wage bill as a
    percentage of the GDP to 11.8 percent in FY2009/10 from 10.8 in FY2008/09, although the
    wage bill is expected to decline to 10.9 percent in FY2010/11. 5 To partially offset these
    increases, the GoJ had to reduce capital spending from 4 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to 3.3
    percent in FY2009/10.
    49.     The consolidated fiscal deficit is expected to worsen in the short term to above 12
    percent of GDP but narrow again in the medium term to 0.5 percent in FY2013/14. This
    projection takes into account government reforms (supported by this DPL) to improve fiscal
    balances and reduce debt generation through stricter control of fiscal spending and Public Body
    rationalizations to stem ongoing losses. It also takes into account expected increases in tax
    revenues due to reforms implemented in tax administration and the three tax packages
    introduced in FY2009/10 (See Annex 6 for details). For instance, the government's most recent
    tax package announced in December 2009 is expected to produce 2 percentage points of GDP
    additional tax revenues--thereby increasing the primary budget surplus. The Government
    implemented a wage freeze in April 2009, which was extended for another two years in
    December 2009. The wage freeze is meant to be a temporary measure to control fiscal spending
    and contain the increase in wages as a ratio to GDP while the Government is preparing a reform
    action plan for wage and human resources management in the public sector.

 The third Memorandum of Understanding, not fully implemented due to the wage freeze, specifies a nominal wage
adjustment of 15 percent in FY2008/09 and 7 percent in FY2009/10.

50.     At the central government level, primary surpluses are projected to increase from
4.8 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to 9.1 percent in FY 2013/14 due to fiscal reforms and
expected global recovery. Consequently, the overall central government deficit would decrease
in the medium term from a projected 10.0 percent for FY2009/10 to 0.7 percent in FY2013/14.
Likewise, Public Bodies' deficits would decrease from a deficit of 2.5 percent in FY2008/09 to
a slight surplus of 0.2 percent in FY2013/14. However, the impact of fiscal reforms would be
lower if global conditions were to deteriorate further or if the growth in the Jamaican economy
were to recover slower than anticipated (also see Annex 5 for a detailed discussion of the impact
of shocks to growth and fiscal balances). On the positive side, the IMF SBA and the financial
support by the key development partners should help the Jamaican economy recover quickly
along with the global economy. Nonetheless, while fiscal balances are expected to improve over
the medium-term, the impact of the global external environment implies that the Government
may not be able to balance its budget as quickly as anticipated prior to the global slowdown.
51.     After the initial rise reflecting the adverse impact of the crisis, the debt to GDP
ratio is expected to decrease in the medium term to 115.6 percent in FY2013/14, compared
to 124.1 percent in FY2008/09 (Figure 6). The baseline scenario of the debt sustainability
analysis (seen Annex 5 for details) indicates that, given the global external environment and
even with the implementation of the government reform plan, the public debt ratio is unlikely to
fall below 100 percent of GDP by FY2011/12 as originally anticipated by the government. Even
under the most favorable scenario, total debt is not expected to fall below 110 percent of GDP
in FY2013/14. At the same time, however under the most extreme scenario of no reform, debt is
expected to increase from 140 percent to 143 percent of GDP over the same period.
52.     Refinancing and interest risks are substantial, but affect primarily domestic debt.
In FY2010/11, nearly 9 percent of total debt will be due for repayment, representing 12.2
percent of GDP. Although this represents a significant maturity concentration, the risks are
limited to domestic debt, which accounts for 86 percent of the total due for repayment. The
maturity exposure is likely to increase in the medium term, rising to 23.1 percent of GDP in
FY2012/13. Combined with interest payments, the total debt service obligations could reach 34
percent of GDP in that year. However, this assessment does not account for the impact of the
Debt Exchange launched January 14, 2010 (Box 1). Successful completion of the debt exchange
­ current participation rates are estimated to be over 95 percent ­ will reduce roll-over risks
significantly.
53.     The gross financing needs of Jamaica are estimated to increase in FY2009/10 and
reach 19.8 percent of GDP, equivalent to US$2.39 billion (see Annex 5, Table B2). The
increase is due to higher interest payments (up from 12.2 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to 16.0
percent of GDP in FY2009/10) while principal repayments are estimated to decrease to 9.9
percent of GDP (from 10.2 percent in FY2008/09). Out of J$735.6 billion of domestic debt,
more than J$200 billion will mature within the next twelve months. More specifically, J$14.6
billion will mature between February and March 2010, while J$208.9 billion (representing 29.8
percent of total domestic debt) will mature in FY2010/11. In contrast, just 0.6 percent (US$38.9
million) of total external debt will mature within the next twelve months.

54.    Financing requirements are projected to be covered mainly by multilateral
financing in the short term. The largest inflows are projected to be from the IMF's front-
loaded SBA of US$1.25 billion of which US$650 million is to be disbursed in FY2009/10
(Annex 5, Table B2). However, in the longer run, reducing the gross financing needs to
sustainable levels will depend on Jamaica's ability to increase foreign exchange earnings and
reduce the fiscal deficit.

                          Box 1: Jamaica Debt Exchange Offer


On January 14th, 2010 the Government of Jamaica announced a domestic debt
exchange program that involves J$701 billion, virtually all its domestic debt. The
debt exchange involves the consolidation of over 350 securities into 23 new benchmark
bonds, the conversion of some securities from callable to non-callable, and the
introduction of inflation-indexed bonds. The debt exchange attracted over 95 percent
participation, as of February 5, 2010, with no hold-out groups, and is expected to
generate significant fiscal savings, of at least 3 percent of GDP in FY2010/11. Interest
expenditures-to-revenue ratio is expected to decline to about 45 percent from about 65
percent in FY2009/10.
Under the debt exchange offer the coupons were significantly lower and maturities
were extended. The offer is a par-for-par exchange of principal amounts with "no
haircut". However, it envisages substantial reduction in yields. The average interest rate
on J$ instruments is expected to decline to near 12 percent from an average of 19
percent, while interest on US$ fixed instruments is expected to fall to 7 percent from
about 9 percent. The program implies the minimization of the initial variable exposure
through temporary fixing of all variable rate instruments for 3, 6 or 12 months. The
focus is on short term instruments since they represent a majority of the total domestic
debt. In order to spread maturity concentration of short-term bonds, instruments with a
maturity lower than three years are packaged in one single group and are offered to be
exchanged with longer maturity instruments. The program also gives flexibility to
variable rate bondholders to exchange their securities with either variable rate or fixed
rate or CPI-Indexed instruments. The debt exchange finally ensures that the US$
instruments will be payable in US$. The Government aims to obtain 100 percent
participation rate.
Three factors were crucial to the success of the debt exchange offer. First, the
probability assigned by bondholders to its operational success was large. Second, the
announcement that the failure of the program may cause the Government to "consider
measures that no one, citizens or creditors, would find at all agreeable." Investors
seemed to have perceived a high probability that a low level of participation and failure
of the debt exchange would have triggered unwanted implications for bond holders.
Third, the perceived probability that the government would adopt unconventional
measures to put non participating investors in a significantly disadvantaged position
relative to participating investors.

Sources: Jamaican authorities; IMF, and Bank staff estimates and projections.
Notes: 1. Fiscal years run from April 1 to March 31. 2. Calculation of overall balance includes debt issued to BOJ to cover its cash losses and, until
2007/08, debt related to off-budget projects financed initially by the private sector. 3. Public sector debt includes PetroCaribe debt. The baseline
projection is based on the IMF's assumptions (reform scenario), including fiscal adjustment consistent with primary balance targets and US$0.5
billion of fixed-rate high yield domestic debt is successfully placed as part of the GoJ's liability management operations.

55.     Current sovereign and corporate spreads reflect higher country risk. EMBI Global
Sovereign spreads are at 613 basis points for Jamaica as of February 1, 2010, and are over 200
basis points higher than the regional average. Spreads on Jamaican corporate loans above
US$300 million--CEMBI spreads--are almost double the LAC average (Figure 7). Moody',
Fitch and S&P downgraded Jamaica's long-term local currency debt several times and in more
than one step to their current levels, respectively Caa2 (from B1), C (from B) and SD (from B).
These downgrades reflect the belief that increased macroeconomic pressures and a sharp fiscal
deterioration have resulted in unsustainable debt dynamics, as well as agencies' reaction to the
GoJ's announcement of the domestic debt exchange described above. S&P classified the offer
as a selective default while Fitch considers it as a coercive debt exchange (CDE). However,
S&P underlined that: "Overall, the domestic efforts, together with the ongoing multilateral
support (including the expected IMF stand-by program of $1.25 billion), should help Jamaica
manage its long-standing fiscal and structural problems going forward." In this context,
Standard & Poor's expects to assign a 'B-' sovereign credit rating and 'B-' debt ratings to the new
bonds upon the completion of the debt restructuring and issuance of the new bonds, which is
scheduled for Feb. 16, 2010. Markets reacted rather calmly to the event, as evidenced by the
slight narrowing of the EMBBI Global spread by 9 basis points and the increase in the CEMBI
Broad of 19 basis points on January 14th, compared to the day before.

56.      Overall, the macroeconomic policy framework is assessed as being adequate for the
proposed DPL, as further evidenced by the approval of a US$1.25 billion Stand-by
Arrangement with the IMF on February 4, 2010 (See Annex 4). Progress continues with the
fiscal reform, in spite of challenges imposed by the global crisis. Monetary policy has remained
prudent and oriented towards containing inflationary pressures and exchange rate depreciation,
while attempting to stimulate growth of credit to the domestic sector. External balances remain
stable in spite of the sharp decline in exports of goods. Tourism, remittances, and international
reserves are recovering. The IMF's Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) of $1.25 billion was approved
by the IMF Board on February 4, 2010, which would provide additional support to balance of
payments.

          III.    GOVERNMENT PROGRAM: FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
    52.     The government's fiscal sustainability reform program is part of its medium-term
    socio-economic policy framework. The framework sets out the broad package of policies,
    strategies and programs proposed by the Government for implementation over the period 2009-
    2012, and is focused on fiscal and debt sustainability, establishment of an efficient and equitable
    tax system, financial system stability and price stability. It supports the overall vision, goals and
    outcomes of Jamaica's long term development plan, Vision 2030, and is the vehicle that
    transforms these long term goals and outcomes into medium-run priorities, strategies, programs
    and measures.
    53.     The fiscal and debt sustainability component of the government's reform program
    aims to contain and reduce debt, enhance revenues, and increase the efficiency of public
    sector spending and investment. This component rests on three pillars:
·     Pillar I: Promoting Fiscal Sustainability Through the Control of Public Sector Balances
      and Debt
       Reforms include the establishment of a Fiscal Responsibility Framework, consolidating
      the budget (Central Government and Public Bodies), rationalizing the functions of Public
      Bodies, divesting loss making commercial Public Bodies, and containing the growth of the
      public sector wage bill.
·     Pillar II: Increasing the Efficiency of Financial Management and Budget Processes
       Reforms include improving the prioritization of investment of the public sector, and
      enhancing the monitoring, evaluation and performance of public spending and procurement.
      This pillar also supports improving accounting and financial reporting, as well as
      mechanisms to control spending.
·     Pillar III: Reducing Distortions and Enhancing the Efficiency of the Tax System
       Reforms include improvements in both tax policy and administration that are geared
      toward greater uniformity in the tax code with a view to reducing distortions, and improving
      compliance.
    54.    The government is taking bold steps to address the root causes of the problem to
    ensure medium term fiscal and debt sustainability. The government is aware of the fact that
    without addressing the root causes of the problem, short term solutions would not be sufficient
    to permanently reduce the debt overhang and put the economy on a high growth path. Therefore
    the government's program includes measures to fundamentally change the public expenditure
    management structure and control the process that led to a large debt accumulation in the past.
    Public bodies' rationalization plan, introduction of Fiscal Responsibility Framework and
    improvements in fiscal discipline, better management of wage bill and human resources in the
    public sector, improvements in debt management practices and tax reforms are all expected to
    increase medium term fiscal sustainability and put the debt to GDP on a declining path.




                                                    26
    A. Pillar 1: Promoting Fiscal Sustainability through the Control of Overall
       Public Sector Balances and Debt

Finalization and Approval of the Fiscal Responsibility Framework
55.     Containing the growth of public debt and reducing the overall debt burden is
critical to establishing fiscal solvency, flexibility, and space. Given that Jamaica is a low-
growth economy and must cope with volatility and the uncertainty associated with frequent
external shocks, the expansion of fiscal space is necessary both for development spending and
for providing the GoJ with a cushion in the event of necessity. High debt servicing greatly
complicates fiscal management and targeting of development objectives. As described in the
previous section, high rollover and interest risk introduce further uncertainty into the fiscal
planning process and contribute to higher costs of credit. Constrained financial markets, during
and post-crisis, only highlight the urgency of Jamaica's need to reduce the public debt ratio.
56.     Considerable progress has been made in debt management over the past decade,
and further reforms continue. Jamaica's debt management practice has undergone significant
transformation since the transfer of debt management responsibilities from the Bank of Jamaica
(BOJ) to the Ministry of Finance and the Public Services (MOF). Core debt management
functions are consolidated in the Debt Management Unit (DMU) under the Economic
Management Department. Debt management strategy is developed and has been reviewed on an
annual basis since 2000. It is published on the MOF web site, as are periodic statistics on debt
stock and its composition, as part of a strategy to improve transparency of debt management
operations. Control of government guarantees has been strengthened, new domestic debt is
mostly marketable, and international markets have been accessed regularly since 2001.
Nevertheless, further efficiency gains can be obtained. For example, the authorities are currently
undergoing organizational reform that will replicate market practice in financial institutions and
advanced debt management office practices, by creating a structure with front, middle and back
offices organized by function, rather than by sources of funding. This reform will reduce
duplication of functions, diminish operational risk, and enable comprehensive analysis of the
total debt portfolio.
57.    Despite the progress, two important challenges remain on Jamaica's path to fiscal
solvency:
·  Improving the credibility of the public sector's fiscal framework: This is a prerequisite for
an adjustment process that will gradually reduce the heavy debt burden in order to create
additional fiscal space for development priorities.
·  The fiscal environment has suffered from a range of weaknesses, which the GoJ is
addressing through its medium-term fiscal reform program. These include:
    Absence of allocation of fiscal responsibilities across governance bodies;
    Budget and financial management characterized by poor control of public enterprises,
   which have contributed to high deficits and debt;
    Financial Administration and Audit Act gave authority to the MoF to permit deferred
   financing (which authority has been revoked);
    An ad hoc wage bargaining process, involving several bargaining unions, that has led to
   rapid increase in wages;



                                               27
    Lack of transparency, consolidation, and coordination in budget reporting and
   accounting; and
    Financial legislation is fragmented and thus difficult to follow. This is exacerbated by
   the inclusion of many provisions that more properly should be included at the level of
   regulations or even financial instructions.
58.     The Government has commenced the development of the Fiscal Responsibility
Framework (FRF), designed to strengthen the budget process by enhancing the
mechanisms for transparency and establishing clearer goals, targets, and limits for public
spending, deficits, and debt. The Government issued a paper in November 2008 that
authorized the MoF to initiate a consultative process with stakeholders and legal experts in
order to prepare a draft FRF for Cabinet submission and then for submission to Parliament. The
FRF would introduce the principles of responsible fiscal management (Box 2) through
amendments to the FAA (Financial Administration and Audit Act) and the PBMA (Public
Bodies Management and Accountability Act) and also improve fiscal transparency through
detailed reporting requirements and greater parliamentary oversight over the expenditures of all
public bodies. It is important to note that the Government has reviewed and proposed
amendments to all financial legislation to make it more manageable and to combine the various
pieces into a comprehensive public financial management act.
59.     The FRF specifies that the Minister of Finance will be responsible for the
development and implementation of a fiscal policy framework, supervision and
monitoring of public financing, and coordination of international and intergovernmental
fiscal relations. Each year the MOF will table in Parliament a fiscal policy paper, including the
Fiscal Responsibility Statement (FRS) and the Fiscal Management Strategy (FMS). The FRS
specifies an acceptable overall fiscal balance and level of total public debt and sets out the fiscal
policy measures necessary to achieve these targets. The FMS assesses current and projected
financing needs and presents a three year plan for the development of the economy, including
the level of public expenditure as percentage of GDP. In addition, the FMS will establish targets
over a set of fiscal indicators, e.g., annual public borrowing, the overall balance, and the
primary balance. The MOF will also provide an explanation to Parliament in the event of any
deviation from these targets and the Minister will have to inform Parliament of any changes in
policy.
60.    The ultimate objective of the FRF is the promotion and enhancement of prudent
fiscal management, accountability and transparency towards the achievement of explicit
targets for public debt, public sector wage bill, and the overall fiscal balance. A central
feature of the FRF is the emphasis on greater transparency in the preparation of annual
estimates of revenue and expenditure and any changes in policies or practices. The Auditor
General will review the fiscal policy paper to ensure that it complies with the principles of
prudent fiscal management. These principles are specified in the FRF as prudent management of
contingent liabilities, maintenance of debt at sustainable level, gearing of borrowing towards
productive purposes, and management of expenditures at levels consistent with revenues.

                  Box 2: Good Principles for A Fiscal Responsibility Framework
Experience from a range of other countries with fiscal responsibility rules suggests that Jamaica
needs to consider the following in the design of the framework:
  · Fiscal rules need to be meaningful, but flexible enough to cope with uncertainty and volatility. It
    will take time to establish fiscal credibility and to strengthen the framework gradually. Overly
    ambitious objectives at the outset of the program could undermine the credibility of the framework if
    they are immediately missed. This is why the initial focus of many responsibility laws is increasing
    transparency, with targets being gradually strengthened as experience and capacity develops. The
    framework should look to set multi-year fiscal parameters, targets or objectives for key parameters, as
    does the Jamaican FRF ­ but in addition could also aim to spell out possible adjustment mechanisms
    and processes in the event of shocks (while being clear about what constitutes such a "shock").
  · Fiscal responsibility rules require widespread political/public support. The political environment
    needs to be prepared for the introduction of fiscal rules. Introducing a framework that will be broken
    at the first cyclical downturn may do more harm than good to budget credibility. The dissemination
    and (often public) consultation process is therefore extremely important. It should help to develop
    support for realistic, but stretchable, initial targets. To this end, the GoJ has been engaged in a long
    process of consultation that has led to widespread recognition of the need for fiscal reform to achieve
    debt sustainability.
  · The fiscal framework strategy should be comprehensive, with strict controls over exceptions. A
    fiscal strategy that does not explicitly cover all of the public sector, especially public enterprises in
    Jamaica, will not have much benefit, as it will be too easy to subvert the rules--for example by
    providing guarantees/debt to public enterprises and financial institutions. While exceptions can be
    made for special cases, such as natural and economic disasters, institutions should be in place to
    discourage abuse and ensure that these are genuine e.g. approval for any exception should be done in
    a highly transparent manner, possibly through a requirement to explicitly and publicly inform
    parliament, and with a clearly specified transition path back to the targets. The proposed Jamaican
    FRF does specify exceptions and could be further strengthened through the specification of transition
    paths back to targets consistent with the medium-term objectives, in the event of a deviation.
  · The institutional "rules of the game" should encourage compliance. Formal penalties for non
    compliance with fiscal rules may be weakened because they are largely self-policing. Nonetheless,
    the presentation of a fiscal policy document with the budget can be useful in itself, as is the reporting
    and political accountability over the previous year's fiscal policy aims. The process must encourage
    politicians to take ownership for setting targets--they must have incentives to make these
    commitments (that obviously entail some risks). Techniques include more shared decision making
    with parliament or independent agencies auditing the fiscal/macro economic assumptions. The
    Jamaican FRF provides for reporting by the Minister of Finance to Parliament for example, as
    discussed in Paragraph 59, without including sanctions for non-compliance.
  · Transparency is of central importance to the achievement of fiscal discipline. The GoJ is fully
    aware that this involves making available sufficient information on plans and outcomes to enable a
    judgment on their adequacy through independent verification of the information and the FRF has
    provisions for presentation of information in this context. The FRF as submitted to Parliament also
    entails enhancing the role of Parliament and the Auditor-General in this process.
  · The new framework should consist of nominal, rolling multi-year targets for public sector
    spending and debt. Fiscal rules need to be easily understood and put in to a credible medium-term
    context, to ensure that problems are not simply being deferred to a future budget (including the
    generation of future liabilities) and that the transition path is clearly established. Fiscal rules with
    embedded expenditure targets tend to be associated with larger and longer adjustments, and high
    success rates. The Jamaican FRF sets medium-term targets on the debt to GDP ratio and overall
    deficit and specifies that the Fiscal Management Strategy presented to Parliament include a 3 year
    plan with targets for various fiscal indicators and annual borrowing.



                                                     29
61.    Following the submission of the FRF to Parliament on February 2, 2010, the
Government will have completed the drafting of all necessary legislative changes to pave
the way for the FRF to be in place for the FY2011/12 budget process. The FY2011/12
budget, prepared in the last three months of 2010, will be bound by the medium-term fiscal
targets--including debt creation and the overall deficit--specified in the FMS. With the FRF
underpinning the FY2011/12 budget, the Government's commitment to fiscal discipline will
gain in credibility as the targets and the policies necessary for their achievement would be
announced ahead of time. The implementation of the FRF will also aid the Government in the
preparation of the next Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework 2012-2015.
62.    The Government has set out to improve debt sustainability with both short-term
and medium-term policy actions. The short-term policy actions include the conclusion of a
Debt Exchange Program with high participation (above 95 percent as of February 3, 2010),
while the medium-term actions include preparation and implementation of a strategic plan to re-
organize the Debt Management Unit (DMU) in accordance with international best practice and
enactment of a new Public Debt Law with a clear focus on strategic debt management
63.     As part of its strategy to reduce the net present value of debt, the Government of
Jamaica launched a Debt Exchange Program on January 14, 2010. The purpose of the
exchange offer is to reduce the high debt burden through reducing the interest rate on a portion
of outstanding debt and improving the maturity profile of the debt. The exchange is supported
by a US$1.25 billion IMF Stand-by Arrangement approved by the IMF's Board of Executive
Directors on February 4, 2010. The key features of the Debt Exchange Program are summarized
in Box 1. The savings under the broadly successful debt exchange are estimated by the
Government to amount to 3.2 percent of GDP during FY 2010/11.
64.    The Government's medium-term strategy for improving debt management hinges
on the successful transformation of the DMU into a new organizational structure involving
a front, middle, and back office. The current structure--based on sources of funding--
involves duplication and higher operation risk, and is not in line with international best practice.
The Government is planning to prepare a strategic plan to re-organize the DMU, which would
include the design and implementation of a training program for all DMU staff, in particular of
middle and front office staff in risk identification, quantification and management of the
aggregate debt portfolio, and in debt management strategy design and implementation.
65.     The establishment of a middle office DMU function will be an important first step
towards the formulation and implementation of a formal medium-term debt management
strategy (MTDS). In the re-organized DMU, staff with analytical responsibilities would be
expected to manage a cost-risk model for quantifying trade-offs and obtaining a better
understanding of the potential impact of alternative debt management strategies on the budget
under different economic and financial scenarios. This would allow the DMU--and in broader
term, the Government--to take into account, among others, cost-risk trade-offs, monetary and
fiscal policy constraints, the characteristics of BOJ's primary debt issuance and constraints of
the domestic debt market. Furthermore, the middle office would have a control function that
examines and monitors compliance to established processes and procedures.
66.   Preparation and subsequent submission to Parliament of a new Public Debt Law is
another important component in the Government's reform program. The current

                                                30
framework is fragmented and dated: there are several Acts which focus more on ceilings to
borrowing through instrument-types, rather than specifying the overall objectives of debt
management, the requirement to develop a strategy and to report on its implementation, and
specified purposes for borrowing. The planned legislative changes may specify limits as part of
the proposed fiscal rules, in the context of the overall budget ceiling, and in the debt
management strategy in line with the fiscal framework.
67.      Actions Supported by the Bank under the First Programmatic FS DPL:
      · The Borrower, through MoFPS, has submitted to the Borrower's legislature on February
      5. 2010, for approval thereby, a bill containing the proposed amendments to the Borrower's
      Financial Administration and Audit Act and the Borrower's Public Bodies Management and
      Accountability Act, for purposes of introducing into said legislation a fiscal responsibility
      framework.
      · The Borrower, through MoFPS, has officially announced on January 14, 2010 a domestic
      debt exchange offer to reduce the Borrower's net present value of its public debt.
      · The Borrower's legislature has enacted the Act to Amend the Financial Administration
      and Audit Act of 2010 dated January 29, 2010 which eliminated MoFPS' authorization to
      approve any deferred financing.
68.      Expected Outcomes from the First Programmatic FS DPL (FY2010/11):
      · Increase in the primary budget surplus of the central government by 1.8 percent of GDP
      by FY2010/11 (Baseline: 4.8 percent of GDP at end-FY2008/09).
      · Fiscal savings of at least 1.5 percent of GDP generated due to GoJ's Debt Management
      Activities (Baseline: Interest payments by Central Government was 16.0 percent of GDP in
      FY2009/10).
      · No more deferred financing (Baseline: Average annual deferred financing from
      FY2000/01 to FY2005/06 were J$497 million).
69.   Actions Expected to be Supported by the Bank under the Second Programmatic FS
DPL (Indicative Triggers):
      · Amendments to Financial Administration and Audit Act and the Public Bodies
      Management and Accountability Act have been enacted and the Fiscal Responsibility
      Framework (FRF) is being fully implemented.
      · The Government has started implementing a time bound action plan for strengthening
      institutional and technical capacity of the Debt Management Unit, including the
      establishment of (a) a new functional organization structure with front, middle and back
      offices (b) the development of a Medium Term Debt Management Strategy and (c) the
      enactment of a Public Debt Law that provides a unified framework for strategic debt
      management.
70.      Expected Outcomes from the Second Programmatic FS DPL (FY2011/12):
      · The FY2011/12 budget process, which commences in the final quarter of CY2010, is
      developed within the FRF and is bound by the FRF's medium term targets for debt creation
      and the overall fiscal deficit.
      · (a) A detailed borrowing plan is published by the Debt Management Unit, which fully

                                                31
       operationalizes the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy; and (b) Quantitative limits
       on instruments and lenders are established in line with the overall budget ceiling established
       by the FRF.


    Rationalization of Public Bodies
    71.    The Government's public sector rationalization plan supports the objectives of
    achieving fiscal sustainability and growth by creating a transformed cohesive public sector
    that is performance-based, efficient, cost effective, and service oriented. Public Bodies,
    comprising Statutory Bodies, Statutory Authorities and Government owned companies, are an
    important segment of the public sector in terms of revenues, expenditures, and employment.
    Public bodies would generate an estimated deficit of around 5 percent of GDP in the absence of
    reforms in 2009/2010 as opposed to the current estimate of a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP.
    72.     Nonetheless, public bodies have played an important role in employment and
    investment in recent years. The FY2009/10 budget reported that investment in infrastructure
    and development by 12 of the main Public Bodies amounted to 1.8 percent of GDP per year
    over the last five years. For FY2009/10 the Government intends to direct part of its fiscal
    stimulus efforts through increasing the investment of public entities. Projections for the fiscal
    year ending March 2010 suggest that the Public Bodies will have gross total assets of around
    J$427 billion, equivalent to around 40 percent of GDP. Based on the government's estimates
    from 2007, Public Bodies would employ approximately 17,829 employees, or about 15 percent
    of the total public sector workforce. However, this data is not systematically collected and may
    not be up-to-date.
    73.     There were approximately 200 Public Bodies registered with the Public Enterprises
    Division (PED) of the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (MOF) at the end of FY
    2008/09. Of these, 95 or 47.5% are characterized as self-financing--these are entities that have
    some authority to collect revenue, borrow and spend outside of the central government budget,
    but in most cases with MOF and/or line ministry approval--while the remainder is included in
    the central government budget and financial reporting, submitting monthly reports to the Public
    Expenditure Division. The budgeting, control and reporting requirements for all public entities
    is set out in the 2001 Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act (PBMA)6. However,
    both types of entities create contingent liabilities for the central Government, which can go
    unreported.
    74.    Sixty-five of the self-financing Public Bodies are subject to close monitoring by the
    PED while the corporate plans and budgets of 54 of these self-financing Public Bodies
    were summarized in the FY2009/10 annual report, Jamaica Public Bodies Estimates of
    Revenue and Expenditure.7 The number of entities reported in the annual estimates was down
    from the previous year, following the exclusion of some key entities, such as Air Jamaica and
    the Sugar Company of Jamaica (SCJ) that had been expected to have been privatized during the

 The annual reports, along with the list of registered entities and their parent ministries, can be found on the PED
webpage: http://www.mof.gov.jm/programmes/frm/ped/default.shtml. The Report includes actual financial data (t-2)
an estimate for the preceding year (t-1) and a budget projection for the upcoming year (t).

    year. 8 In FY2009/10 only 12 public bodies were required to companies submit accounts in the
    "Statement A" format that enables consolidation with the cash based central government
    accounts. This limits the ability to assess and formulate fiscal policy.
    75.     A strategic action plan has been submitted to Cabinet with a view to facilitating the
    establishment of an efficient, responsive and cost effective framework of operations for the
    Public Sector, consistent with good governance, and in line with the GoJ's development
    objectives. This action plan was developed by the Public Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU),
    launched by the Prime Minister and has been fully operational since November 2009. The
    PSTU's recommendations are to be implemented through transition teams in each Ministry. The
    scope of work of the PSTU will include: (i) prior reviews of all Ministries, Departments and
    Agencies, including Public Bodies, to determine what functions should be retained, privatized,
    contracted out, abolished or be merged with other sector entities; (ii) the development of a
    master rationalization plan with milestones and cost estimates; (iii) the implementation of a
    Government Wide Network (GovNet) including establishment of integrated IT systems; and
    (iv) the implementation a Strategic Human Resource Management Structure/System.
    76.     Implementation of reforms suggested by the PSTU will be conducted by transition
    teams during the PSTU's 18-months operational mandate and will continue after the
    PSTU has completed its work by May 2011. The PSTU is working with a Consultative
    Monitoring Group, fully functional since December 2009, including representatives from the
    private sector, universities and trade unions, to ensure extensive consultations and engagement
    in social dialogue with stakeholders at all levels.
    77.     As noted above, the FRF also includes measures aimed at improving the
    governance of public entities. Critical amendments to the PBMA have been submitted for
    Parliamentary approval as part of the FRF. The key features of these amendments include: (a)
    prohibiting Public Bodies from entering into negotiations to issue debt without prior approval
    by the Minister of Finance; (b) requiring Public Bodies to submit corporate plans and any
    modifications to the Minister of Finance for endorsement and the Parliament for approval; (c)
    requiring the Minister of Finance to prepare an annual report to Parliament of estimates of
    revenue and expenditure for all Public Bodies; and (d) requiring Public Bodies to submit
    information on their financial operations to the Financial Secretary. These amendments also
    include regulations to strengthen the Financial Distribution Policy, Acquisition of Shares, Code
    of Conduct for Directors, and Code of Audit Practices. Additionally, the MOF is providing
    training in corporate governance to the leadership of Public Bodies.
    78.     Most important, the FRF includes a provision for submission of public bodies'
    accounts to Parliament for approval ­ unprecedented in Jamaica ­ which will directly
    support the PSTU's strategy to improve public sector governance. An annual Budget
    Memorandum in FY2010/11 will include a discussion of the movements of the consolidated
    public sector with a summary table showing at least the main aggregates for the consolidated
    public sector. The inevitable data gaps and discrepancies would be acknowledged and addressed
    over time, but such consolidated budgeting and reporting should help to support the measures
    proposed under the FRF. Clear targets would also be set for expanding the coverage and quality

  The divestment program has inevitably been adversely effected by the global financial crisis, delaying the
proposed schedule.

                                                    33
of reporting in the annual Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure report for public entities. The
Government is aiming to increase the coverage of entities reporting in the "Statement A"
format. Milestones in producing consolidated fiscal accounts (consistent with international
Government Financial Statistics standards) will also be established. The winding-up of inactive
Public Entities would be completed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g. end-2010). The costs
and benefits of the program should be evaluated, including any fiscal savings, and published on
the PED webpage.
79.     The program for the rationalization and restructuring of public bodies is also
continuing, although progress has been slow. The Rationalization Plan developed in
FY2008/09 identified 74 inactive Public Bodies to be wound-up, 35 to be merged and 21 to be
privatized. According to a December 2009 Cabinet note, of the 74 inactive public bodies
identified for winding-up, 20 have actually been wound-up, 11 will not be wound-up because
they are either still active or the process has been terminated or suspended, 3 are slated for
divestment, and 2 are unknown and may not be public bodies. Of the remaining 38 inactive
public bodies to be wound-up, 6 are nearly completed (with facilitating documents already filed
with the Companies Office of Jamaica), the status of one entity is `uncertain', while the winding
up of 31 entities is at various stages in the process. Of the 35 entities to be merged, the
regulatory functions of 3 bodies have been proposed for merging: the Port Authority of Jamaica,
Airports Authority of Jamaica, and the Maritime Authority of Jamaica. A feasibility study has
determined that the Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority should remain an independent body. Steps
have been taken by the Ministry of Agriculture to merge the operations of the Agricultural
Support Services Projects Limited, the Agricultural Development Corporation and the
Agricultural Marketing Corporation into one entity: the Agricultural Investment Fund.

80.     The Government's divestment program remains a priority, though progress has
slowed down mainly due to the financial crisis. The Government has divested their interests
in two of the five sugar estates slated for divestment. The divestment of lands of the former
Cotton Polyester Textile Company Ltd. and Ariguanabo Co. Ltd. are at an advanced stage.
Other major assets in the process of divestment include the Wallenford Coffee Company, the
Urban Development Corporation's shares in the hotel industry and the remaining three sugar
estates. However, other divestments, including that of Air Jamaica, have experienced delays. In
regard to Air Jamaica, the Government has received a proposal from Caribbean Airlines and is
presently negotiating the terms of the agreement. While negotiations proceed, a number of
measures have been taken to improve the operational efficiency of the body, including the
reduction of the workforce by 500 employees and the exiting from loss making routes. This has
led to a decline in losses by 61 percent between end-2008 and end-2009.
81.     The Government's medium-term priorities include winding up of all remaining
inactive public bodies by the end of FY2011/12 as well as the completion of privatization of
public bodies scheduled for divestment. The completion of winding-up of Public Bodies
identified in the Rationalization Plan--38 of which (out of original 74) remain to be wound-up
as of December 2009--will proceed simultaneously with the work of the PSTU, allowing the
Government to take advantage of synergies across the two work programs. As the global
economy recovers, the divestment proceedings are expected to advance quicker than in the
recent past.

Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness of Public Service Compensation and
Incentives
86.      Significantly fragmented pay negotiations represent an obstacle for managing a
sustainable wage bill. While managing a sustainable wage bill is a major challenge during a
fiscally difficult period for the government, the fragmented pay negotiation process, involving
more than 70 bargaining units, exacerbates the situation further. The Government has attempted
to start addressing this issue through the development of a point-factor job evaluation system for
the public sector. The system was applied to all health sector positions, with the objective of
simplifying wage negotiations with the sector's 27 bargaining units and improving the attraction
and retention of qualified personnel on this area. While the proposal is in its final stage after a
lengthy consultation process with unions, the fiscal costs associated with the reclassification
exercise needed impede its implementation in the medium term. The Government acknowledges
that pay reform is a priority but that additional analytical work, expert advice and a better fiscal
position to finance one-time costs are required for its implementation.
87.     Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector compensation will
require a stronger control of compensation in statutory bodies. The payroll of statutory
bodies is not factored into the central government's wage bill. Given that many of these bodies
contribute to the government's deficit, the central government's wage bill represents only a
partial picture of the actual proportion of public sector compensation in the government's

                                                35
finances. The absence of strong control by the Government of workforce size and compensation
policy of statutory bodies represents a considerable challenge for managing a sustainable wage
bill.
88.    The Government is taking measures to contain the wage bill both in the short and
medium-term. A temporary wage freeze for all public sector employees, including those from
public bodies, was introduced in April 2009 as a temporary measure to contain the wage bill
during a challenging period for Jamaica from a fiscal perspective. As a follow up measure, the
Prime Minister has announced in December 2009 that no salary increases will take place for the
following two years. While some unions have started to request for salary increases, such as
Jamaica's Teachers Association (JTA), the Government remains committed to avoid increasing
the wage bill.
89.     The PSTU's action plan for improving public sector efficiency and effectiveness
through the development of a Human Resource Management (HRM) system is expected to
contain the wage bill in the medium-term. The HRM System to be developed by the PSTU
includes the following components: (a) Rationalization of the Services Commissions; (b)
Development of a Framework for the consolidation of strategic human resource management
functions; (c) Development of a Framework to facilitate the free movement of staff throughout
the Public Sector; (d) Development of a Framework for Succession Planning and Leadership
Development; (e) Development of a Framework for Knowledge Management; and (f) Review
of existing legislation pertinent to Human Resource management. The Government expects the
HRM system to be applicable to all public sector employees and fully functional by the end of
FY2011/12.
90.     The launching of employment surveys by the Public Sector Establishment Division
(PSED) for all Ministries/Departments/Agencies (MDAs) in July 2009 represents an
important effort toward ensuring the collection of basic information on public
employment across the Central Government and is a key input in the rationalization
effort. The Government has completed the censuses for the five so called "strategic ministries"
(Education, Health, National Security, Finance and Agriculture), covering 38 percent of the
established positions in December 2009 and is currently organizing and analyzing the data
obtained. The censuses include information on qualifications and age group, and will be
entered in the government's public employment database currently under construction. This
information will strengthen workforce planning as it will help to reassess needs, track the
growth in the size of the public sector more accurately and avoid overstaffing. It is expected that
statutory bodies will be included in the next phase of the data collection effort by the PSED.
91.     The plan for restructuring the public sector, initiated by the Prime Minister and
including consultation with the private sector, universities and unions, represents a
commitment by the Government to undertake a serious and holistic rationalization
exercise to improve the use of government resources in wages and salaries. The wage freeze
in place since April 2009 will contain the wage bill in the short-term and will allow the PSTU's
18-month public sector restructuring exercise to take place and implementation of more stable




                                               36
    measures to contain the wage bill. 9 By the end of FY2011/12, the implementation of the PSTU
    Strategic Project Plan in at least 10 MDAs is expected to reduce the wage bill to below 10
    percent of GDP, therefore bringing it in line with fiscal sustainability. These efforts will be
    further aided by the expected completion of employment surveys for all MDAs, allowing the
    transition teams to work more efficiently.
    92.    Actions Supported by the Bank under the First Programmatic FS DPL:
      · The Borrower has completed: (a) a separate employment survey of all employees in each
      of the following sectors: (i) health; (ii) national security; (iii) finance; and (iv) agriculture;
      and (b) a separate employment survey of administrative employees in the education sector;
      said surveys aimed at establishing the number of employees in the respective sectors.
      · The Borrower, through MOFPS, has issued Circular No. 6 ref. 59/33, dated February 2,
      2010 approving a wage/salary freeze for all of the Borrower's public sector employees until
      March 31, 2012, and said resolution is in full force and effect.
    93.   Expected Outcomes from the First Programmatic FS DPL (FY2010/11):
      · Information is available on the number and posts of public sector employees in the five
      strategic sectors, which represent almost 40 percent of total public sector workforce, laying
      the groundwork for the public sector workforce restructuring being undertaken by the Public
      Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU) (Baseline: No employment surveys processed as of FY
      2008/09).
      · The Centralized Human Resource Management (HRM) database is fully functional and
      has updated and accurate information on public employment in the five strategic sectors,
      including age and qualifications of individual employees (Baseline: No data published as of
      FY 2008/09).
    94.   Actions Expected to be Supported by the Bank under the Second Programmatic FS
    DPL (Indicative Triggers):

      · Employment surveys (censuses) for all non-self-financing Public Bodies have been
      completed.
      · Recommendations identified by the PSTU to restructure the public sector are
      implemented by transition teams in at least 10 ministries, departments and agencies.
    95.   Expected Outcomes from the Second Programmatic FS DPL (FY2011/12):
      · A centralized HRM database covering total public employment is fully functional.
      · The wage bill as a percentage of GDP is at or below 10 percent (Baseline: 11.8 percent of
      GDP by end- FY2009/2010).
      · Transition teams are in place in at least 10 ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs)
      to implement the recommendations of the Public Sector Transformation Unit.

  "The Prime Minister articulated the achievement of a major goal for this restructuring, as a reduction of the cost of
the Public Sector to below 10% of GDP, whilst simultaneously addressing the imperatives of a leaner more efficient
responsive and accountable Public Sector"(PSTU Strategic Project Plan, page 3).

   B. Pillar 2: Increasing the Efficiency of Financial Management and Budget
      Processes
Achieving Fiscal Discipline and Strategic Allocation of Resources
96.    The annual budget is not yet bound by a medium term fiscal perspective that could
help to connect the annual budget to longer-term policy and sustainability objectives, and
enhance the ability of the Government to adjust to shocks. It is also important to have a
medium-term perspective to support the selection, planning, design and execution of multi
annual investments.
97.     Adopting a Medium-Term Framework (MTF) for fiscal policy can strengthen risk
analysis in countries like Jamaica that are highly vulnerable to external shocks.
Establishing a sustainable long-term fiscal framework is particularly important given the high
level of public debt in Jamaica. However, the current planning practice is subject to
considerable uncertainty (measures of sustainable spending may vary over time) and budgets
often respond to short-term policy considerations. Therefore, a well-designed, rolling MTF
should help clarify fiscal policy choices, considering both immediate and longer-term objectives
and their likely consequences.
98.     Adopting a Medium-Term Framework (MTF) for fiscal policy can strengthen risk
analysis in countries like Jamaica that are highly vulnerable to external shocks.
Establishing a sustainable long-term fiscal framework is particularly important given the high
level of public debt in Jamaica. However, the current planning practice is subject to
considerable uncertainty (measures of sustainable spending may vary over time) and budgets
often respond to short-term policy considerations. Therefore, a well-designed, rolling MTF
should help clarify fiscal policy choices, considering both immediate and longer-term objectives
and their likely consequences.
99.     Although Jamaica had developed a Medium Term Socio-Economic Framework for
2004-07, links to the annual budget, the prioritization of investment plans, and the
incorporation of recurrent cost implications of investment were not well developed. The
Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) also did not develop the framework into a rolling
instrument to aid budget management, nor has the 2004-07 exercise been updated since its
expiration. Consequently, the annual budget is not yet anchored by a medium term fiscal
perspective.
100. The simplest form of MTF is a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) that entails
a comprehensive statement of fiscal policy objectives, against which fiscal performance
can be assessed, with integrated medium-term macroeconomic projections, and (aggregate)
fiscal targets based on macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal sustainability considerations (a
top-down approach). The FRF should provide the impetus for developing such a rolling MTFF.
Even a simple MTFF can help incorporate longer-term perspectives into budget planning
processes and promote predictability, fiscal discipline, transparency, and accountability. It may
also help bolster support for prudent fiscal policies among policymakers and the public, and get
the political debate to span longer horizons.
101. More sophisticated MTF stages involve deepening the link between the macro fiscal
aggregates and sector spending allocations. The introduction of sector plans and a multi-year
investment budget, which also incorporates recurrent cost implications, is a common starting

                                              38
point for more widespread reform. The proposed framework in Jamaica for capital investment
prioritization and management should help to better establish this link between government
policy, planning and budget allocations.
102. Under the Public Sector Modernization Vision and Strategy 2002-2012, the
Government intends to introduce a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The
MTEF is designed to improve inter/intra sectoral resource allocation and provide greater
budgetary predictability for ministries and agencies, which should contribute to improved
macroeconomic performance (2009/10 Budget Memorandum). The Government is gradually
implementing the MTEF through the following measures:
   · The Government has set a target for Ministries/Departments/Agencies (MDAs) to spell
   out integrated three-year plans and budget proposals. Around 40 percent of MDAs have
   produced the requisite prioritized plans. The Cabinet Office and the MOF are considering
   whether to enact legislation to increase compliance for the submission of Corporate and
   Operational Plans, similar to the annual budget.
   · The Government is in the process of developing a methodology to improve the system for
   evaluating and managing public investments. With technical assistance from the IDB, the
   Government has developed a tool to standardize the evaluation/appraisal of investment
   projects. The tool is based around a set of indicators to ensure that projects meet specified
   criteria, including consistency with government priorities, sector strategies and technical
   processes that include feasibility studies, cost-benefit analysis, and the elaboration of future
   recurrent cost implications of investments. Each project will be given an overall rank. The
   target is to ensure that eighty percent of projects are approved based on a strictly technical
   weighting, while twenty percent would be based on political discretion (though this would
   be subject to the technical evaluation). The authorities are hoping to have the tool in place
   for end-October along with a Manual for Investments to help guide line ministries in the use
   of the tool. Some training has already been undertaken in line ministries, although the tool
   will not be in place for the 2010/11 budget preparation process.
   · The Government is also developing an information management tool to record capital
   spending--it will enable the Government to run various scenarios (e.g. for differing
   financing levels) and to act as a "project bank". It is intended that the new system be
   expanded in the future to capture the life cycle costs of projects, and in this way can form
   the basis for the proposed medium-term fiscal framework. Training has already been
   conducted for staff on the development of an MTEF and further technical assistance and
   capacity building has been proposed.
103.   The Government is planning to continue to build on the above reform program by:
   · Piloting the medium-term budget perspective, in 10 ministries, using the new investment
   management systems, for the 2011/12 budget. This will entail careful costing of the projects
   capital including future recurrent costs.
   · The methodology for evaluating project proposals should, where appropriate, be piloted
   in selected Public Entities through their parent Ministries for the 2011/12 budget. While the
   evaluation might not be applicable to purely corporate investment decisions made by a few
   of the public entities, all fiscal and quasi-fiscal operations should be assessed using similar
   standards.

                                               39
Improving Public Financial Management
104. An assessment of the Public Financial Management (PFM) arrangements of
Jamaica was carried out in 2007. This assessment was based the Public Expenditure and
Financial in Accountability (PEFA) framework. It examined five key dimensions of the PFM
system: budget credibility; policy based budgeting; predictability and control in budget
execution; accounting, recording and reporting; and external scrutiny and audit.
105. The legal and regulatory framework for PFM in Jamaica is well defined. While the
constitution sits at the pinnacle of this framework, the key instrument for PFM is the Financial
Administration and Audit Act (FAA). This framework provides for a clear definition and
allocation of duties and responsibilities for implementing the processes through which public
finances are managed. Moreover, the Government has recently prepared and presented to
Cabinet a framework for fiscal responsibility that will define the boundaries of authority for
public managers. There is a clear process that guides the elaboration of the budget, and the
country has a budget classification system that is effective in facilitating the recording and
availability of information on budget execution transactions. The Government also maintains a
comprehensive system of centralized bank accounts that facilitates management of the
Government's cash balances. Whereas significant delays were registered in the past with respect
to the preparation of financial statements, considerable progress was registered for the
preparation of the financial statements in 2009. The rate of completion within stipulated
deadlines increased substantially amongst the reporting entities, with the five biggest ministries
(approximately 60% of budget expenditures) all reporting within the deadline. Lastly, the
Government has moved to strengthen the Office of the Auditor General in recent years through
the implementation of a strategy that seeks to strengthen its operational capacity. The
Government has also commenced work on the elaboration of guidelines and manuals for the
consolidation of public bodies. There has been some progress in the enhancement of
institutional arrangements within the agency that is responsible for oversight of public bodies.
In this respect, the job descriptions of staff have been defined and the Government has
embarked on an exercise to fill existing vacancies. Lastly, the Office of the Auditor General has
completed its operational plan, which will ensure more independence and effectiveness of the
audit function. It calls for staff training and a new focus on performance and IT audit
approaches.
106. There exist significant challenges for strengthening the financial management
environment in Jamaica. While the Government continues to take measures to introduce a
Medium Term Economic Framework in order to strengthen budget preparation, significant
intermediate building blocks that are required to ensure the success of this introduction are still
not fully in place. These include institutional foundations such as staff resources, training and
guidelines on the preparation and costing of sectoral strategies, and ensuring the proper
appraisal of investment projects. In addition, while the introduction of accrual accounting is
advancing, challenges persist in ensuring the correct sequencing of the intermediate steps
required to introduce the appropriate levels of staffing resources and knowledge. At the same
time, there is a challenge in ensuring the proper sequencing of these reforms together with the
development of the information systems. In addition, more attention needs to be given to
ensuring that the current cash accounting basis is properly understood and that accounting
practices are sufficiently strong to form a proper basis for the introduction of the accruals basis.
Lastly, it is imperative that the GoJ hastens the introduction of procedures to ensure that the

                                                40
fiscal results of publicly owned enterprises, on which sufficient information already exists, are
consolidated with those of the rest of the public sector.
107.   The Government has initiated reform measures for strengthening financial
management and budget processes. The key measures that the Government has been taking or
planning to take include:
  · Improving accounting and financial reporting through training of its staff in order to
  enhance their capacity to implement accrual accounting. The Government will also complete
  its review of the accounting classification, and the implementation of the IFMIS.
  · Enhancing the internal and external control systems through the strengthening of the
  Internal Audit Directorate and expanding the scope of work of the Government's Internal
  Audit Units
  · Implementing the Auditor General's operational plan by undertaking further training of
  its staff, making reviews of financial statements timelier and expanding the scope of audits to
  include performance audits.
108.   Actions Supported by the Bank under the First Programmatic FS DPL:
  · The Borrower's Auditor General has continued to implement an annual operational plan
  within the framework of the five-year strategic corporate plan including relocation of its staff
  to updated physical facilities, and completion of 90 percent of planned audits.
109. Expected Outcomes from the First Programmatic FS DPL (FY2010/11):
  · The timeliness of annual appropriation accounts submission of selected Ministries,
  Departments, and Agencies to Auditor General has improved, as indicated by a decrease in
  accounts outstanding by 20 percent (Baseline: 158 accounts outstanding in December 2008).
110. Actions Expected to be Supported by the Bank under the Second Programmatic FS
DPL (Indicative Triggers):

  · The Government has fully implemented the new methodology for evaluating capital
  investments in all line Ministries.
  · All MDAs have submitted and published their MTEFs.
111. Expected Outcomes from the Second Programmatic FS DPL (FY2011/12):
  ·    New investment management system is in use in 10 Ministries.
  ·    All MDAs have implemented their MTEFs for the FY2011/12 budget cycle.



   C. Pillar 3: Reducing Distortions and Enhancing the Efficiency of the Tax
      System
112. The Government of Jamaica plans to reform its tax regime with a view to improving the
efficiency of tax administration and revenue generation. Highly variable rates with many
exemptions, special regimes, and zero-rating reduce tax revenue by an estimated 30 percent and
also distort and hinder growth of the economy. Tax administrators also face barriers to getting
information and pressing enforcement, making tax evasion and avoidance relatively easy. For

                                              41
 taxpayers who seek to comply, the complexity of the system makes it difficult to do so.

 Tax Policy Reforms
 113. Progress continues despite the impact of the ongoing global crisis on the tax base.
 Although major personal income tax (PIT) and corporate income tax (CIT) simplifications were
 postponed due to the impact of the global crisis on Jamaica, the Government has taken measures
 to broaden the tax base and improve efficiency by reducing tax exemptions and introducing
 three packages of tax measures over the past year. 10 The first package was introduced as part of
 the FY 2009/10 budget. The Government raised the excise tax on gasoline by J$8.75 per liter,
 and broadened the General Consumption Tax (GCT) base by eliminating exemptions on several
 items. The second package was introduced on October 1, 2009 and included increasing the GCT
 rate on telephone services from 20 percent to 25 percent and increasing the departure tax to
 J$1,800. The third package was introduced on January 1, 2010 and included the following
 measures:
       · General Consumption Tax (GCT). The GCT rate was raised from 16½ percent to 17½
       percent. In addition, residential electricity consumption above 200 kwh and
       commercial/industrial electricity consumption are subject to the GCT at 10 percent; the rate
       of GCT applicable to the tourism sector has been increased from 8.25 percent to 10 percent;
       and commercial importers are now required to pay a 5 percent advanced GCT payment on all
       taxable imported goods.
       · Personal income tax. Tax rates for income over J$5 million but below J$10 million and
       for income over J$10 million have been adjusted from 25 percent to 27.5 percent and 35
       percent respectively, until March 31, 2011. The yield is estimated at 0.1 percent of GDP.
       · Fuel tax. An ad valorem fuel tax of 15 percent was applied. It is expected to generate
       revenue equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP on a full-year basis.

 Tax Administration Reforms
 114. Progress has been achieved in improving Tax Administration. The Government has
 been implementing a major Tax Administration reform to increase the tax base, enforce
 compliance, increase efficiency and effectiveness of the Tax Administration and Customs
 Department, and thereby boost government revenues. In FY09/10, the government's tax reform
 efforts focus on: improving compliance, improving information and communication technology,
 and improving enforcement. 11
 115. In the context of tax administration reform, a number of important steps have been
 undertaken: i) a large taxpayer office was established on April 15, 2009 with two offices in
 Kingston and Montego Bay. As of end-December 2009, the 205 largest taxpayers were covered
 and the authorities are aiming at taking 200 more companies into the scope of the Office by end
 FY2009/10; ii) a Customer Care center was established on April 1, 2009 with the objective of
 improving customer service, standardizing the response to tax related inquiries by tax payers,
 and keeping tax payers current with their taxes. The Center covers the entire country and all


10
     See Annex 6 for additional details on the tax measures introduced.
11
     The authorities have received support from the World Bank, US Treasury, IRS, CARTAC and USAID.

                                                      42
types of taxes; iii) a Forensic Data Mining Unit was established in June 2009. The Unit is
increasing tax compliance and enforcement by making use of forensic techniques to gather
information about the tax obligations of tax payers and check this against the actual filing of
taxes so as to prevent tax evasion. Through November 2009, the Unit has identified 11,000 new
taxpayers who were subsequently presented with new assessments; iv) a High Intensity Team
was established in June 2009. The team is comprised of auditors and collectors and--as a field
extension of the Forensic Data Mining Unit--puts forward a combined effort to improve
collections; v) a Special Enforcement Team was established in July 2009. The Team is
comprised of 6 people and focuses on enforcing compliance after other efforts have failed.
116. The Government continues its efforts to improve the efficiency of tax collection by
offering tax payers new and improved ways of filing and paying taxes. In October 2009, the
Tax Administration made it possible for taxpayers to electronically file and pay the GCT,
PAYE (Pay As You Earn), and HEART (Human Employment and Resource Training/National
Training Agency) taxes. Testing for electronic filing and payment of individual and corporate
income taxes is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of February 2010. Over
the course of CY2010, the Government expects to extend electronic filing and payment to all
taxpayers and all types of taxes.
117.   Actions Supported by the Bank under the First Programmatic FS DPL:
  · The Borrower has implemented three tax packages dated May 6, 2009, September 29,
  2009 and December 23, 2009, respectively, for purposes of: (a) improving efficiency and
  uniformity of tax policy by reducing the number of items excluded from taxation; and (b)
  improving revenue generating capacity through increasing excise tax rates on several items.
  · The Borrower has continued to implement its tax administration reform project, which
  commenced on January 12, 2009, as evidenced by the establishment of a large tax office, a
  customer care center, a forensic data mining unit, a high intensity unit and a special
  enforcement team.
118. Expected Outcomes from the First Programmatic FS DPL (FY2010/11):
  · Increased number of corporate (CIT and GCT) and (non-PAYE) individual tax payers on
  the tax roll reflected in 15 percent increase of the number of tax payers for 2008/09 compared
  to 2007/08 (Baseline: 58,655 of taxpayers in 2008/09).
119. Actions Expected to be Supported by the Bank under the Second Programmatic FS
DPL (Indicative Triggers):
  · (a) The GoJ has continued progress on implementation of a uniform tax code; (b) the
  GoJ has established a one-stop shop for all tax payments to ease cost of paying taxes; and (c)
  E-filing extended to all taxpayers and to all types of taxes.
120. Expected Outcomes from the Second Programmatic FS DPL (FY2011/12):
  · Improved PEFA rating of "Collection of tax payments" to B in FY2010/11 from a
  baseline of: D+ in 2007/08.

    D. Prior Actions and Indicative Triggers for the Programmatic Fiscal
       Sustainability DPL Series and Progress since the Previous Fiscal and Debt
       Sustainability DPL

 121.     The current operation is proposed as the first in a series of single-tranche
 programmatic DPLs and builds on the progress achieved since the previous DPL (January
 2009). The Government's reform agenda is part of a well-specified, medium-term program
 designed to support macroeconomic stability and fiscal and debt sustainability with a view to
 further longer-run development objectives. The reform program is ambitious and substantive,
 and is expected to be completed over a period of two years due to the perception within the
 country that the need for fiscal and debt management reform is urgent. Therefore, the Bank's
 support to the Government's program is proposed as a series of two programmatic development
 policy operations. The policy actions and outcome indicators supported by the proposed
 programmatic series are sequenced to match the GoJ's phased approach to reforms, which is
 necessary in the context of the specific conditions and procedures that prevail in Jamaica, and
 build on progress achieved since the previous DPL (January 2009).
 122. The Government has made noteworthy progress in key reforms since the previous
 Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL approved in January 2009. During the twelve months
 preceding the FS DPL1 operation the Government has continued working on the different areas
 covered by the previous DPL achieving key policy reforms. For example, the GoJ completed
 proposed amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility Framework submitted in draft to Cabinet
 based on extended consultations with IFIs, including the IMF, and other key stake holders. The
 objective of these consultations was to ensure that the legislative changes sent to Parliament in
 February 2010 incorporated lessons learned from international good practice and reflected a
 broad level of debate and consensus. Box 3 provides more detailed information on the
 connection between closely related policy actions supported under previous DPL and those
 supported by the current proposed operation.

123. The forward looking nature of the Bank's proposed support through the Second
Fiscal Sustainability DPL is aligned with the planned phases of the Government's
medium-term structural reforms. The summary of the Government's reform program
provided above in this section includes a brief description of the next phase of reforms under
each pillar. For convenience, the substantive policy actions of the Government's program that
are supported by the proposed series ­ both the current and the next operation ­ are listed
below. Box 4 presents prior actions for the First Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL (FS
DPL1) and Box 5 lists the indicative triggers to be supported by the Second Programmatic
Fiscal Sustainability DPL (FS DPL2).

       IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

     A. Link to the Country Partnership Strategy
123. Economic stability ­ particularly fiscal and debt sustainability ­ is a key component of
the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with Jamaica and is the rationale for the
proposed loan. The proposed DPL for US$200 million is the first in a series of programmatic
DPLs envisaged in the FY10-13 CPS. The Government of Jamaica expressed keen interest in
maintaining and deepening the country's strategic dialogue with the Bank when it took office
during the previous CPS period. The CPS further reflects the government's focus on addressing
fiscal and debt challenges, especially given the impact of the global crisis on Jamaica.
124. The focus of the DPL is on supporting continued progress with the strategy and
design of policies and legislative reforms for achieving improved efficiency of government
spending and sustainable debt reduction. As described in Section III, considerable progress

                                                     46
has been made on these fronts. The Government's efforts are based on three critical and
interrelated development challenges in Jamaica under the Economic Stability Pillar of the CPS.
  ·  First, promoting fiscal and debt sustainability by consolidating overall public sector
  balances, rationalizing public bodies, and containing the wage bill. Controlling the debt
  generating process in Jamaica requires enhanced debt management and accountability of
  Central Government and Public Bodies' as laid out in the proposed Fiscal Responsibility
  Framework, rationalization and restructuring of public entities, and improved efficiency of
  management of public sector salaries.
  ·   Second, the importance of improving transparency and efficiency of public financial
  management and budget processes. While the legal and regulatory framework for
  effective budgeting and transparent financial management exists, a more forward-looking
  process for prioritization of expenditures is needed to ensure effective allocation of
  resources. This requires timely preparation of financial statements, continued efforts in the
  transition to accrual accounting framework, further improvements in auditing and operational
  capacity to improve the efficiency of budget allocation.
  ·   Third, reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system. Jamaica's
  complex tax system is characterized by variable tax rates and many exemptions which distort
  economic incentives and reduce tax revenue in an already tight fiscal environment. To reduce
  distortions, raise fiscal revenues, and improve equity, the Government is taking measures to
  broaden the tax base, reduce the number of special tax regimes and exemptions, simplify tax
  payment processes, and increase tax compliance. The Government is also taking actions to
  directly reduce the tax burden on low earners by raising income tax thresholds, particularly
  for the elderly.

      B. Collaboration with the IMF and other donors

125. The Bank has consulted with the IMF, the IDB and the EU delegation in Jamaica
during the preparation of this operation. Consultation with the IMF has been particularly
close in the context of preparing the macroeconomic assessment and the debt projections. The
policy actions supported by this operation complement the IMF SBA approved on February 4,
2010 as well as the IDB PBL programs, which are also focused on structural reforms aimed at
maintaining fiscal sustainability in the longer run. The main synergies between the policy
reforms supported by the Bank, the IMF, and the IDB are:
        (a) Development and submission to Parliament of a Fiscal Responsibility Framework
            with a view to implement fully by 2010/11;
        (b) Public Sector Rationalization;
        (c) Improving Efficiency of Public Expenditure Management and of Tax Policy and
            Administration; and
        (d) Strengthening of Debt Management.

126. The GoJ has negotiated a package of support from the IMF (to support
international reserves) and the Bank and IDB (budgetary support). This will also provide
market liquidity and reduce risks, if any should arise, in the context of the debt exchange
launched on January 14, 2010 ­ as of February 3, participation rate is estimated to be above 95

                                             47
 percent. In particular, support under the IMF's SBA will be helpful to the GoJ in this context,
 since it will disburse on a front-loaded basis (approximately US$650 million on approval on
 February 4, 2010). The IFI's are coordinating with each other as well as with other lenders such
 as the CDB to provide timely support under difficult circumstances.

                                   Box 6: Donors' Activities in Jamaica
     A total of eighteen International Development Partners 12 (IDPs) are active in twelve sectors
     with most support directed to the social sector (39%), followed by budgetary support (30%)
     with strong support for growth and competitiveness. In 2008, ongoing development partner
     support amounted to US$2.1 billion, of which 18.6 percent was grant. As of end-2008, the largest
     development partner was IDB with US$673 million, followed by Venezuela 13 with US$410
     million, CDB with US$314 million, the EU with US$257 million and the World Bank with
     US$120 million (Table 5). In addition, Japan provides significant amount of PHRD and JSDF
     grants through the World Bank.
     Two bilateral IDPs (CIDA and DFID) have regional strategies while USAID, IDB and the
     World Bank have country strategies. All strategies and sectoral support are provided in line
     with government priorities articulated through the PIOJ and in the MTF.
     The depth of coordination among international development partners has increased,
     particularly since the 2008 upgrading and strengthening of the Bank country office. The
     Bank participates in the annual retreat between the Government and development partners, and it
     chairs the thematic group on Debt and Growth. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) co-
     located with the World Bank in August 2009. This will strengthen coordination and increase
     access to its advisory services, public-private partnerships work, and foster deeper private sector
     development.
     IDB: As identified in the recently completed and the upcoming Country Strategy for Jamaica, key
     areas of IDB support include public financial management and private sector development, where
     the IDB specifically supports improvements in the incentive framework and the business
     environment. Specific reforms include reducing the transaction costs for titling and registering
     land, increasing access to credit for sole proprietors and small businesses, and improving
     incentives for informal businesses to become formal.
     EU: EU support to Jamaica is anchored in the 10th EDF Country Strategy Paper and National
     Indicative Program for 2008-2013. With a total allocation of 110 million for programmable
     resources and 12.9 million for emergency assistance, the EU is the most important grant donor in
     Jamaica. The country strategy aims to assist Jamaica in its macroeconomic reform program as
     presented in the government's Medium Term Framework and to support the Government in
     reducing crime and violence and supporting human rights. The resources available under the
     program are allocated as follows: 55 percent for general budget support, 30 percent for sector
     budget support; and 15 percent for national capacity building. Apart from EDF funding, other
     instruments of EU involvement in Jamaica include projects by the European Investment Bank
     (EIB), activities financed under the Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) for the Caribbean, and
     the Banana Support Programme.

                                                     48
 USAID: The USAID program of assistance to Jamaica is rooted in the 2010-2014 Country
 Assistance Strategy, which focuses on social and economic issues that contribute most directly to
 crime and violence. Under the new CAS, programs in Jamaica are organized around four priority
 goals: reducing crime and corruption through efforts in law enforcement restructuring and reform,
 promoting economic development by supporting trade, investment, and agricultural
 competitiveness, investing in human capital by improving quality and equity of primary and
 secondary education, and HIV/AIDS prevention.
 DFID: DFID's involvement in Jamaica is conducted under the DFID Caribbean regional umbrella,
                         13
 with annual spending of million in 2010/11. In Jamaica, the DFID program is focused on
 strengthening security and justice. Active programs include the Commonwealth Debt Initiative
 (CDI), which has benefitted Jamaica since 1998, police reform and police capacity building, the
 Jamaicans for Justice initiative, Community Security Initiative (a two1 million program),
                                                                           year,
 and rehabilitation of Jamaican offenders. Another important activity over the last five years has
 been the Jamaica Social Policy Evaluation (JASPEV) project, which supports the government's
 strategic plan for a more effective social sector delivery system by the year 2015.
 UNDP: UNDP activities in Jamaica are based on the 2007-2011 Country Programme Action Plan.
 The Action Plan identifies three thematic areas as the focus of the UNDP program: poverty
 reduction through improved economic planning, debt management, tax reform, and more efficient
 public spending; crisis management through conflict prevention, justice and security sector reform,
 and disaster risk management; energy and environmental security.
 CIDA: CIDA's development assistance program focuses on three main areas: improving
 governance, strengthening the private sector, and improving environmental management. Through
 Canadian Partnership Branch, CIDA co-finances projects in Jamaica by Canadian non-
 governmental organizations and institutions working in areas such as cooperatives, education,
 family planning, youth and community development. Since 1989, CIDA's Industrial Cooperation
 Program has financed 24 initiatives by Canadian businesses seeking to develop partnerships with
 Jamaican companies. CIDA's priorities include strengthening of key central agencies responsible
 for the environment and supporting HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.
 CDB: Since assuming office in 2007, the current government has benefitted from nearly US$200
 million in CDB loans, which have supported educational and community development projects,
 agricultural support, and natural disaster recovery. In February 2009, CDB disbursed the first
 tranche of a two-year, US$100 million policy-based loan to the government. Furthermore, citizens,
 especially from rural areas, have been beneficiaries of the CDB's Caribbean Technology
 Consultancy Service (CTCS), a program that supports the development of small businesses
 throughout the region.


   C. Relationship with Other Bank Operations
127. The proposed operation would be the first in a programmatic series of two single-
tranche loans focused on fiscal sustainability and builds on a previous Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability DPL approved in January 2009.
128. The actions supported by the proposed operation are part of a longer standing
policy dialogue that has been supported through both AAA and lending activities. The
most recent of these operations, as well as operations in the pipeline, are the Energy Investment
Loan and Technical Assistance (P112780, FY2011), Employment generation Investment Loan
(P116993, FY2010), Education Transformation Capacity Building (P107407, FY2010), Rural
Economic Development Initiative (P105122, FY2010), Community-based Landslide Risk

                                                 49
Reduction (P116471, FY2010), Debt Market Development Project (P114298, FY2009), and
Addressing the Debt Problem (P106757, FY2009). The overarching themes in the Bank's
Jamaica program have been the focus on economic stability and on promoting inclusive and
sustained growth through four sub-pillars: (i) strengthening human capital; (ii) strengthening
non-labor competitiveness; (iii) reducing crime and violence; and (iv) promoting rural
development and reducing vulnerability.
129. The DPL is also designed to complement the ongoing and planned investment
lending program under the CPS by supporting the government's efforts to provide a
stable macroeconomic framework and improved public sector effectiveness to stimulate
growth and fund priority social and investment programs.

   D. Lessons Learned
130. The Bank has maintained an active engagement with the authorities in Jamaica
through the program support outlined in various Country Partnership Strategies, and
several key lessons have been learned that have informed the design of the proposed
operation. Key lessons relevant in the context of lending operations were that lending activities
should (i) take into account fiscal constraints and avoid lumpy disbursements, such as those
associated with civil works or infrastructure projects and (ii) consider the implementation
capacity of government agencies, which restricts the effectiveness of investment lending in
some cases. Bearing these lessons in mind, the previous Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL
(January 2009) was aligned with the Government's policy reform program, its current
institutional capacity, and its liquidity needs. The proposed programmatic series will build on
the success of the first operation.

   E. Analytical Underpinnings
131. The DPL supports the Government's medium-term development strategy, and
draws upon a large body of analytical work, including the Poverty Assessment, Country
Economic Memorandum, Public Expenditure Review, PEFA, and the CFAA/CPAR.
Within this framework, it focuses on policies and institutional aspects related to fiscal and debt
sustainability. The policy actions supported by the DPL and expected medium-run outcomes
are outlined in the policy matrix in Annex 1. Box 6 presents the links between prior actions and
various AAA work.

   F. Poverty and Social Impacts and Country Consultation
132.    The Government has consulted extensively with country stakeholders, including
the cabinet and members of Parliament on fiscal reform, Public Body rationalization
proposals, and tax reform issues. Through the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), the
Government has undertaken a broad consultation process on its long-term development plan--
Vision 2030--which incorporates many of the reforms supported by this DPL and was tabled in
Parliament in May 2009. Vision 2030 was publicly announced and consultations have taken
place throughout the country including consultations with various target groups.
133. In addition, the Public Sector Transformation Unit, which is implementing the
Public Bodies rationalization program, has a well-structured consultative process. The
governance structure of the transformation project includes a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet
chaired by the Prime Minister, to approve, give direction and oversight to the restructuring of
the Public Sector, and the Consultative Monitoring Group (CMG) comprising representatives of
Government, private sector, trade unions, academia and the Opposition to review the strategies

                                               52
being pursued by the PSTU and monitor their implementation. Implementation and change
management "transition" teams will be formed in each ministry and department, and will
include Human Resource Practitioners, Communication Specialists, Information Technology
Specialists, Union representatives and staff at all levels of the organization. These Teams will
be kept fully abreast of changes taking place in their organizations, and will be able to assist
their colleagues to grasp all of the critical issues. They will be able to direct staff to the various
support services provided to facilitate the transition within and across Ministries and Agencies.
134. The Bank has been closely working with other donors to put in place grant
resources for technical assistance to support the government's debt and growth agenda.
The Bank's development partners include DFID, UNDP, CIDA, USAID, the IDB, the CDB,
and the IMF. DFID and UNDP have committed financing resources to support the
implementation of the reforms. CIDA support would be in kind whereas USAID support will be
conducted in parallel. The IDB has a long relationship with the Ministry of Finance, the Office
of the Prime Minister and the Planning Institute of Jamaica providing technical assistance in
public financial management, budget processes, central government operations, and investment
prioritization. The IDB has a companion technical assistance to their PBL. The IMF, directly
and through CARTAC, has been providing technical assistance through advisory services on tax
issues and topical issues such as investment schemes and the stability of the financial system.
135. The actions supported by this DPL are expected to have a positive overall
distributional impact, although some groups may experience adverse impacts in the short-
run. The distributional impacts of the Government's reform program are not straightforward to
assess: they will vary among different groups; different elements of the program will have
different impacts; some of the impacts will be direct and others are likely to be indirect; the
timing of those impacts will vary; and finally it is difficult to separate impacts due to the
reforms from those due to the financial crisis. To the extent that the measures supported by the
DPL play a role in the government's ability to lower inflation, reduce the income tax burden for
lower income groups, improve prioritization of public expenditures, and enhance the efficiency
and fairness of the tax system, their overall impact on poor people's income and access to
services is expected to be positive. This is confirmed by the Poverty Assessment and the Public
Expenditure Review, which indicate that the high debt has adversely impacted the poor by
reducing fiscal space for priority social spending and investment programs, while
macroeconomic volatility and inflation have had a disproportionately negative impact on the
poor. In particular high inflation in the past has eroded the purchasing power of the main social
safety net program PATH and thus diminished its contribution to short term poverty alleviation
and reduced the incentives for human capital accumulation. To address this issue, the
Government had to adjust the benefits by almost 40% in 2008. Likewise, the distributive impact
of reducing the number of favored tax exemptions and raising the income threshold for income
taxes is expected to be pro-poor, as is improving expenditure efficiency and strategic allocation
of public spending.
136. The package of tax reforms supported by the DPL series is likely to have large and
direct distributional impacts. Accordingly, the Bank plans to initiate a study on full Social and
Poverty Impact Analysis of the tax reforms supported by the DPL series, provided the data for
this analysis is available, and otherwise to support the production of such data.
137. Poverty and social impact analysis has been completed for the Sugar Industry, due
to its size and employee characteristics, and further analysis is planned to assess the

                                                 53
 distributional impact in other sectors. The divestiture of the Sugar Industry is, by far, the
 most important in terms of its potential impact on the poor. The industry employs over 30,000
 people, mostly unskilled, and has a significant amount of land under cultivation. The
 divestiture is designed to improve productivity in this sector and bring new technologies so that
 farmers can increase yields. Even if divestiture were not to take place, there would likely be a
 significant impact on the industry in the coming years as the EU trade preferences for Jamaican
 sugar expired in September 2009 (with a six-year transition period). Economic and social
 impact analyses were completed in 2006, with the assistance of the EU, for the Sugar
 Transformation Strategy, inclusive of the sugar privatization. The studies' recommendations,
 including the need for a better government communication strategy and assistance for displaced
 workers, has helped to guide the divestiture process. The GoJ has expanded its communication
 strategy through consultations on its development plan and is taking actions to minimize the
 impact on the poor (including, providing severance payments to farmers that exit the industry as
 well as support and training for alternative employment).
 138. The poverty and social impacts due to Public Body rationalizations, particularly
 due to employment dislocation, are routinely addressed as part of the rationalization
 process. While the aggregate impact of the fiscal savings and debt reduction associated with
 the rationalization of Public Bodies will be to create a more efficient and transparent allocation
 of public spending and investment, some groups may be adversely impacted in the short-term.
 The Development Bank of Jamaica, through its Privatization Unit, which supports Government
 appointed enterprise teams, has the overall mandate to divest specifically assigned public
 assets/entities. As a part of that process, the Development Bank of Jamaica evaluates impacts of
 the prospective investors' development plans, which must include an evaluation of employment
 and social impacts, and propose mitigation measures.
 139. In other areas of the reform program, the government strategy is to identify the
 poverty and social impacts of the reform program and the economic downturn, and
 provide remedial measures. On December 14, 2008, the GoJ announced that it had set up a
 special program through the HEART Trust/National Training Agency to retrain laid-off workers
 in order to assist them to gain alternative employment. The Bank is also supporting the
 strengthening of the PATH program, which provides conditional cash transfers for the poor.
 The program is well targeted and also helps the poor during periods of natural disasters with
 additional payments, which occurred after Hurricane Ivan. In 2008 the benefit level was
 adjusted for inflation and further increased to provide additional incentives for students to
 complete secondary school. This represents a substantial increase in PATH budget from 2007
 levels (reaching 14 percent of the population).14 PATH is also piloting a "Steps to Work"


14
   PATH or Program for the Advancement through Health and Education is a conditional cash transfer (CCT)
program geared to provide cost effective social assistance to the extremely poor in exchange of them complying
with conditions that promote the development of their human capital. The largest proportion of beneficiaries is
drawn from the poorest quintile (poorest 20 percent), which is better targeting when compared to many similar
programs in the LAC region. The program's benefit level were adjusted twice in 2008: once to keep with inflation
and maintain its purchasing power (April 2008) and once to allow for higher incentives for secondary school kids
and boys at all grade level to encourage them to attend school and complete high school (December 2008). In
response to the financial crisis, the government has expanded coverage in 2009 by 10 % to reach 327,000
beneficiaries at the end of December 2009 with plans to reach 360,000 beneficiaries by March 2010. This roughly
corresponds to about 14% of the population. Despite deteriorating fiscal situation PATH is being considered a

                                                      54
 initiative aimed to help working able adults in PATH families to engage in activities that will
 help them find and retain gainful employment such as job search assistance, medical education,
 training, and small business assistance. While an economic crisis could result in budget
 constraints that limit the PATH CCT program, it is expected that the actions supported by the
 DPL will help reduce the likelihood of a crisis as well as protect priority social spending
 through supporting the government's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. Planned
 analytical work by the Bank, in the context of the upcoming CEM, to be completed by June
 2010, will explore the sequencing, sectoral, and distributional impacts of the Government's
 reform program.

     G. Environmental Aspects
 140. The specific policies supported by this DPL operation are not expected to entail
 likely significant impacts on the environment, forests or other natural resources.
 However, Jamaica has the arrangements to assess and manage such effects. In April 2001, the
 National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) was formed as a means for conducting
 environmental impact assessments under acceptable international standards. In 2003, a
 Strategic Environmental Assessment Policy was drafted and presented for approval in Jamaica
 as a means to better facilitate the integration of environmental sustainability into the
 development objectives of the country. While the policy has not been fully implemented, the
 implementation of key aspects of the SEA Policy starting in 2006 was the first of its kind in
 CARICOM. In addition, the Development Bank of Jamaica and other investment promotion
 agencies (e.g., Jamaica Trade and Invest, formerly JAMPRO) require that all proposed projects
 conform to the environmental laws of Jamaica and must comply with the regulations stipulated
 by the National Environment and Planning Agency. Depending on the size and importance of
 the public entity/asset, a formal Environmental Impact Analysis may be required. An Integrated
 Environmental Assessment was completed in April 2009 for the divestiture of the Sugar
 Company by the Sugar Industry Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture has already taken
 steps to initiate the process of Strategic Environmental Assessment in January 2009. GoJ
 recognizes the vulnerability of the country's economy to climate variability and change.
 Consequently, in January 2009, Jamaica completed a National Water Sector Adaptation
 Strategy and Plan of Action to address climate variability and change. The Strategy and Plan of
 Action makes explicit recommendations on key measures (capacity, institutional, policy and
 legislative, etc) aimed at mitigating climate-related shocks and disasters.


                           Box 8: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

   Principle 1: Reinforce ownership.
   The operation was developed within the objectives of the Government's Medium-Term Socio-
   Economic Policy Framework and 25-year National Development Plan ­ Vision 2030, which is being
   widely consulted with stakeholders and broader civil society and which will establish clear



priority program and adequate budgetary allocation has been made for FY 2009/20010. In parallel the government,
with support from a World Bank investment operation, is in the process of improving targeting of PATH through a
continuous process of recertification of beneficiaries and improvements in the proxy means targeting mechanism.


                                                      55
  development priorities. The priority legislative agenda is developed in consultation with the
  Parliamentary leadership on an ongoing basis. The Bank support focuses on (1) promoting fiscal
  sustainability through controlling overall public sector balances and debt generation; (2) increasing
  the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes; and (3) reducing distortions
  and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system. These focus areas, including the rationalization of
  Public Bodies, have all benefitted from broad political support. The DPL is strongly underpinned
  by prior and ongoing analytical and fiduciary work, including the Country Economic Memorandum
  (2010), Poverty Assessment (2006), the CFAA/CPAR (2006), and PEFA (2007), as well as non-
  Bank AAA, including the Matalon Report on Tax Reform (2004) and the IMF/CARTAC report on
  Tax Incentives (2008).
  Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
  accountability framework.
  The Bank's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix. It is expected, that the
  Bank, the CDB, and the IDB will be providing support in the form of loans or contingent credit.
  The IMF Board approved a SBA for Jamaica on February 4, 2010. The Bank, the IMF, and the IDB
  draw on the country's development plan, thereby ensuring coordination among them and
  consistency of support. All three institutions have been supporting measures to improve fiscal and
  debt management, rationalize Public Bodies, and strengthen tax administration and policy.
  Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
  circumstances.
  The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), completed in 2006, indicates that the
  fiduciary environment in Jamaica is generally adequate, stating that the treasury management is
  solid and the internal control has in place a legal framework and independence, which are the basis
  for a sound Public Financial Management (PFM) system. The funds from the proposed DPL-DDO
  would be handled through this system.

  Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement.
  The Bank's policy matrix has only 10 prior actions (Annex 1). They address key development
  policies prioritized in the CPS including actions in promoting fiscal and debt sustainability to
  enhance growth and reduce poverty and inequality.
  Principle 5. Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
  based financial support.
  As agreed with the government, this DPL is the first in a series of two programatic operations, timed
  to meet the country's financing needs, and is to be evaluated and monitored for results. Monitoring
  and evaluation of the program will take place within the government's own processes. The policy
  matrix contains a range of outcome indicators (10), which are assessed as part of the operation
  implementation and are closely linked to the supported policy actions.


141. As measures supported by the DPL program are expected to improve the potential
for attracting new investment in the future (including in infrastructure), there will be a
need to strengthen Jamaica's national institutional capacity to identify and address
environmental policy and regulatory issues. Indeed the successful implementation of this
DPL program would create the fiscal space needed for GoJ to invest in critical environmental
public goods such as protection of watersheds and forests, protection and management of
coastal resources, zoning and flood prevention, better integration of institutional mandates, and
stricter/effective enforcement of physical planning and environmental laws and regulations.
With this in mind, GoJ and partners continue to support initiatives geared toward the proper


                                                  56
management, conservation and protection of the environment and natural resources for
sustainable development.

    H. Fiduciary Aspects

Public Financial Management System
142. The 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial in Accountability (PEFA) built on the
assessment of Jamaica's PFM environment during a joint Country Fiduciary Assessment
(CFAA/CPAR) that was conducted in 2006. The two assessments provide an indication of
strengths and weaknesses in the management of public finances.
143. Generally, the fiduciary environment in Jamaica is adequate, principally as a result
of the strong legal and regulatory foundation outlined in the Financial Administration and
Audit (FAA) Act. This framework provides for the basic principles for efficient management of
public resources. The PEFA Assessment identified a number of areas where the system was
performing adequately, including in the area of revenue forecasting, budget classification, and
oversight of fiscal risk. However, it also identified some areas where improvement is required.
These included multiyear fiscal planning, expenditure policy, quality and timeliness of the
preparation of annual financial statements, external audits payroll controls and controls for non
salary expenditure. Significant delays were noted in the preparation and submission of financial
statements for audit.
144. The Country Fiduciary Assessment identified some key recommendations that
were adopted by the Government to address existing weaknesses. These included the
following: strengthening the link between policy, planning and budget allocation through the
introduction of an MTEF and costing Corporate Plans; improving the quality and timeliness of
financial reporting; improving cash predictability by defining a transparent mechanism for
warrant releases that maintain budget consistency with Government priorities; strengthening the
capacity of the Internal Audit directorate and increasing the financial independence of the
Auditor General's office. The GoJ continues to implement these measures to improve
management of the public resources to further mitigate fiduciary risks.

Foreign exchange system
145. A Financial System Stability Assessment was carried out in 2006 jointly by the IMF
and the World Bank. Its conclusion was that the control environment in the Central Bank
within which foreign exchange is managed is satisfactory. It also established that the Bank of
Jamaica (BoJ) has well established procedures that ensure the integrity of its operations, with an
effective internal audit department. Its financial statements are audited by an international firm
of accountants and are published on the BoJ's website. Any findings and recommendations
issued as a result of the audit exercises are considered by an Audit sub-committee of the Board.
146. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy support. Loan proceeds will be disbursed once effectiveness has been
declared. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed into an account designated by the Borrower
that is part of the country foreign exchange reserves account at the Central Bank of Jamaica.
The administration of this loan will be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
Given that the Borrower's current public financial management system is satisfactory and the

                                               57
fiduciary environment at the Central Bank of Jamaica is adequate, no specific audit of the
deposit account will be required.

      I. Loan Administration
147. The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account of the Central Bank of
Jamaica denominated in US dollars. The Central Bank of Jamaica will immediately credit the
disbursed amounts to the account of the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service, thus
becoming available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of this funds transfer, the
Ministry will accordingly provide the Bank with a written confirmation.

      J. Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
148. The Ministry of Finance and the Public Service will play the primary role in
coordinating monitoring and evaluation of program implementation. The Government and
the Bank will take advantage of several important data sources to assess progress of the DPL,
including:
  ·     Central and nonfinancial public sector budget monitoring from the Ministry of Finance
        and the Public Service
  ·     Statistical Institute of Jamaica
  ·     Central Bank of Jamaica reports and analysis
  ·     Reviews and analyses of laws and implementing regulations by the Bank and other
        stakeholders
  ·     Data from key Government agencies such as PIOJ and the Auditor General
  ·     Financial audits and follow up of CPAR and CFAA recommendations
  ·     Bank, CDB, IDB and IMF supervision missions and reports. Jamaica is under intensified
        surveillance from the Fund which produces a bi-annual staff report that assesses its
        economic and financial stability. The World Bank has been closely coordinating with the
        Fund on its monitoring of the economic and financial situation.

      K. Risks
149. The Jamaican program, to be supported by the proposed DPL, faces four types of
significant risks: economic, political, institutional and natural disasters. Risks and
mitigation measures are summarized below.
150. Economic: The current global financial crisis has severely impacted the Jamaican
economy through falling exports of services and goods--tourism, bauxite/alumina, and light
manufacture--and declining remittances. The sizeable depreciation of the nominal exchange
rate has increased the government's cost of servicing its variable rate debt and raised the cost of
rolling over existing debt. Output declined by 1.6 percent in FY2008/09 and is projected to
decline by another 3.5 percent in FY2009/10, largely due to the near collapse of the bauxite
industry and reductions in remittances and tourism receipts. The central government's overall
budget deficit has widened, despite the Government's strong efforts to contain it, mostly due to
fall in tax revenues and increased debt service burden. Unemployment is on the rise with
possible significant social implications. The full impact of the crisis has not been documented
yet, but its social implications look worrisome as seen from the police reports of increased

                                               58
property crimes. A lagged recovery and further deterioration in economic conditions may stall
or reverse reform actions and put strain on debt sustainability. In addition, measures such as the
public sector wage freeze may not be sustainable for a period of two years.
Monitoring and mitigation: Since Jamaica is vulnerable to external shocks, prospects for
mitigation are limited. The Central Bank continues to target low inflation while also focusing
on financial stability. The GoJ is continuing with its fiscal reform program to support debt
sustainability in the medium-term. Other development partners have put together resources for
on-demand technical assistance in support of the government's fiscal and debt sustainability
program. To mitigate liquidity risks and ease financing constraints, the GoJ has sought a
multilateral package of support from the World Bank, the IMF (US$1.25 billion or 300 percent
of Jamaica's special drawing rights quota), the IDB, and the CDB. In addition, the proposed
operation supports actions to improve fiscal balances and address the debt generating process,
and, thus, reduces financing vulnerabilities. There is ongoing macro-monitoring and country
dialogue and the Bank program would be adjusted to mitigate risks as much as possible if
critical risks emerge. The wage freeze is being viewed in Jamaica as an urgent but temporary
measure necessary to provide bridge support to the country while it implements its medium-
term fiscal reforms. The idea is that the wage freeze will help control fiscal spending and
contain the increase in wages (as a ratio to GDP) while the Government is preparing an action
plan for human resources management in the public sector.
151. Political: The current government came into power in the fall of 2007, but it has had a
small majority in Parliament, making the government's program vulnerable to special interests.
The risk is that some MPs could object to, and block, specific policy reforms supported by the
DPL. For instance, the Government has submitted a Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) to
Parliament and achieving concrete results would depend on enactment and implementation of
the legislative changes envisaged under the FRF, which in turn could potentially be affected by
the political stability. Similarly, reforms to rationalize the Public Bodies, and improve the tax
code may face resistance, as various interest groups seek to maintain the status quo. While the
growth contraction and pressing financial needs may exacerbate political concerns, it may also
spur consensus on the need for near-term actions. Social unrest due to difficult economic
circumstances may also threaten the political will to implement reform.
152. Mitigation: The political risk is reduced by the Government's consultative approach to
reform implementation and the dialogue among country stakeholders on the fiscal and
economic costs of inaction. The IFIs and other donors are also heavily focused on building
consensus for critical public sector reforms in the country. To mitigate risk from social unrest,
the Government would have to develop a communication strategy focused both on explaining
the benefits from the fiscal reforms and the cost of postponement.
153. Institutional capacity and reform implementations: The Government has embarked
on substantial public sector reforms which require changes in institutional structures and
significant enhancement in institutional capacity for an effective implementation. The reform
process might be delayed as the institutions try to adjust to the changes and enhance their
capacity. For instance, consolidation of all public sectors may require substantial adaption in
public entities. Similarly, moving to MTEF would require investing significantly in capacity
building and aligning the orientation of the institutions towards medium term planning.
154.   Mitigation: Jamaica has well established institutions. The development partners have

                                               59
been providing technical assistance for institutional capacity building and advancing public
sector reforms.
155. Natural Disasters: Jamaica is highly vulnerable to multiple natural disaster risks--
particularly droughts, floods and hurricanes. The cumulative damage from the last three major
storms-- Ivan (2004), Dean (2007), and Gustav (2008)--was over US$1 billion. Natural
disasters have the potential to derail economic growth and poverty reduction. They also pose a
heavy fiscal burden, increasing indebtedness and redirecting public resources away from long-
run development plans.
156. Mitigation: The damage to major private sector enterprises is partly covered by
insurance. The GoJ participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. The
Bank is assisting Jamaica through investments in natural disaster risk mitigation with the
Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery Loan and technical assistance for its safety net program
to mitigate adverse consequences on poverty. In January 2009, the National Water Sector
Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action to address climate change were established with Bank
assistance and provide recommendations on key investments (capacity, institutional, policy and
legislative, etc) to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in the water sector. In
addition, the GoJ has presented a draft National Disaster Management Act to Parliament for
enactment.

157. Jamaica, which became a member of the IMF on February 21, 1963, has a current IMF
quota of SDR273.50 million (about US$ 434 million). The IMF conducts regular Article IV
consultations with Jamaica and the latest one was completed by the IMF Executive Board on
April 21, 2008. The most recent IMF mission to Jamaica took place during October 27, 2009 -
November 6, 2009 to head discussions toward a Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. On
February 4, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a
27-month Stand-By Arrangement with Jamaica in the amount of SDR 820.5 million (about
US$1.27 billion) to support the country's economic reforms and help it cope with the
consequences of the global downturn. A disbursement of SDR 414.3 million (about US$ 640
million) will become available to Jamaica immediately.


                                    Press Release No. 10/24
                                       February 4, 2010
158. The key objectives of the Stand-By Arrangement are to support the Jamaican
authorities' ample reform program to address deep-seated structural weaknesses in the country's
economy, increase its growth potential, and make it less vulnerable to external shocks. To
achieve these goals, the program focuses on a three-pronged strategy:
       1) An ambitious plan that puts public finances on a sustainable path that includes much-
needed public sector reform;
       2) A debt strategy to lower exceptionally high interest costs and help address the problem
of the debt overhang , and raise the productivity of public spending;
       3) Financial sector regulatory reform to reduce systemic risks.
159. The Jamaican authorities are already implementing many of these actions, which are
expected to improve the public sector fiscal balance by over 5 percent of GDP in FY 2010.
Among them, a debt exchange aimed at generating interest savings of at least 3 percent of GDP
and a 65 percent reduction in the amount of maturing debt over the next three years have been
successfully carried out, with an acceptance level of almost 95 percent of bondholders. A tax
package has already been enacted and is expected to produce an increase in revenues of around
2 percent of GDP. Loss-making public entities are being divested.
160. At the same time, the government's economic program is designed to ensure a
significant increase in social spending for targeted programs. Spending will increase by at least
25 percent (equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP) in the school feeding program and the cash
transfer Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH). The administration
will also be pursuing efforts to expand the social safety net to assist persons below the poverty
line who do not qualify for PATH assistance and improve their employability.
161. Approval of the Stand-By Arrangement is expected to generate about US$1.1 billion in
funding from other international financial institutions. Part of the first disbursement will be used
to establish a Financial Stability Support Fund, which will also include funds from other
multilaterals and will help support the country's financial sector.
162. Following the Executive board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:

                                                81
163. "Jamaica's large debt burden has magnified the fallout of the global crisis by limiting
the scope for a counter-cyclical domestic policy response. Fundamental economic reforms are
needed to restore fiscal sustainability, safeguard economic and financial sector stability, and
enhance Jamaica's growth potential. The ambitious economic program demonstrates that the
authorities are committed to meeting these challenges."
164. "The authorities are to be commended for the strong measures taken to maintain
economic stability. These include introducing a third tax package this fiscal year and extending
the public sector wage freeze for two years. The 2010/11 budget provides for increased social
spending while reducing recurrent expenditures. The government has successfully completed a
domestic debt exchange operation, which has contributed to a more equitable sharing of the
burden of the overall fiscal adjustment. The exchange has also struck an appropriate balance in
terms of delivering necessary cash flow savings while taking appropriate account of the need to
ensure financial sector stability."
165. "In addition to these near-term measures, the Jamaican authorities have committed to a
comprehensive agenda of structural reform to help address the root causes of the deep economic
imbalances. The swift passage of fiscal responsibility legislation and adoption of a central
Treasury management system are necessary to enhance budget control and bolster fiscal
transparency and accountability. Rationalization of the public sector, including through
compensation and employment reforms and the divestment of public entities, aims to secure
durable fiscal savings."
166. "The planned legislative and regulatory reforms will help reduce systemic risks to the
financial system and strengthen the overall resilience of the economy to shocks. Key measures
include the adoption of an omnibus banking law, an amendment to the Bank of Jamaica Act,
and reforms of deposit-taking institutions and the securities dealer sector."
167. Recent economic developments. Jamaica has been strongly impacted by the global
economic slowdown. Real GDP declined by 1.6 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2008/09 (April 1-
March 31), with economic conditions deteriorating sharply in the second half of the year.
During the current fiscal year, real GDP contracted further, registering a decline of 3 percent
during the first half of the year.
168. Bauxite and alumina production and exports fell by about 60 percent, while
remittances--a traditional source of balance of payments support--suffered a sharp decline.
Tourism has also been negatively affected, although it has proven to be far more resilient than
in the rest of the Caribbean.
169. In FY2009/10, the external current account deficit is expected to narrow from 18 percent
of GDP to 9.5 percent, as the contraction in imports exceeds by far that of exports. Inflation fell
steadily from 26.5 percent in August 2008 to 9 percent in November 2009, reflecting weak
domestic demand and a decline in global commodity prices from their mid-2008 peaks.
170. Government finances have deteriorated, constraining the authorities' ability to respond
to the global shock with countercyclical policies. The public sector deficit is projected to reach
almost 13 percent of GDP in FY 2009/10. The interest bill rose by 38 percent, reflecting the
effects of the depreciation and a steep rise in interest rates. The deficit of public entities
remained large, at close to 3 percent of GDP. As a result of these combined shocks, concerns
about economic prospects and the sustainability of Jamaica's debt have placed significant


                                               82
pressure on the currency over the past year and a half.
171. Main program goals. Growth: Economic growth is projected to shift from a
contraction of 3.5 percent in FY2009/10 to an expansion of 0.5 percent in FY2010/11 and a
further increase of 2 percent thereafter.
172. Inflation: While one-off tax measures are expected to result in a temporary spike in
inflation to just over 12 percent by end FY2009/10, in the absence of strong demand or foreign
exchange market pressures, inflation is projected to fall to an average of 11 percent in
FY2010/11 and further to 6 percent over the medium term.
173. Balance of payments: The external current account deficit is projected to continue to
narrow gradually from 9.5 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 to 5 percent over the medium term,
based on the recent depreciation of the currency in real effective terms and the expected
increase in national saving as a result of fiscal consolidation.
174. Tax Reform: The organization of the tax administration and improving tax compliance
is expected to be modernized. The authorities are committed to implementing rapidly the
recommendations of a 2008 Fund Technical Assistance mission, including by unifying domestic
tax administration and enhancing compliance through streamlined administrative procedures
175. Public Sector Reforms: The organization of the public sector will be streamlined, with
a view to reducing the wage bill as a share of GDP. A committee has been appointed to review
the existing structure of the public sector which is characterized by many entities with unclear
or overlapping functions. The committee will present recommendations on a new structure by
December 2010.
176. Financial sector reforms: Vulnerabilities in the financial system will be addressed,
particularly the high exposure of securities dealers to government risk. The Jamaican
government is committed to improving financial sector companies' ability to withstand shocks,
by enhancing capital adequacy and margin requirements. The Bank of Jamaica will take explicit
responsibility for overall financial system stability.

       Annex 5: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

           A. Debt Sustainability Analysis
177. This annex presents a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted using Monte
Carlo simulations. First, a baseline scenario is constructed using the latest projections for the
Jamaican economy by the IMF. Several alternative scenarios are constructed to analyze the
impact of different shocks on the path of debt to GDP ratio and to understand the sensitivities of
the debt dynamics to changes in baseline assumptions. A combined shock scenario is also
presented to test the medium term evolution of Jamaica's public debt. We estimate
FY2009/2010 figures and project the following ten years. The key assumptions for the baseline
scenario are summarized below.

178. The baseline scenario assumes fiscal consolidation. In the baseline, Jamaica is
expected to post a 6.2 percent primary surplus in FY2009/10 and to further consolidate the
fiscal position in the following four years (8.0 percent primary surplus on average). The key
variables are then kept constant, with primary surplus of 9.1 percent of GDP through

 FY2019/2020. In the baseline, the debt to GDP ratio is estimated to be 139.7 percent of GDP in
 FY2009/2010 and peak the following year at 140.2 percent of GDP before decreasing and
 eventually reaching 115.5 percent of GDP by FY2013/14 and 65.4 percent of GDP by 2019/20.
 The evolution of the debt to GDP ratio is driven by the assumptions embedded in the baseline
 scenario. First, a large fiscal consolidation that generates an improvement in the primary
 balance starting with the base year (2009/10). Second, GDP growth is projected to be higher
 than its average of 1.5 percent between 2003 and 2008. Third, the real interest rate remains
 below its level in FY2009/10 throughout the period.

 179. In order to capture uncertainty regarding the evolution of macro variables in the
 medium run, Monte Carlo simulations based on 20,000 replications were also
 implemented under the baseline assumptions. Probability bands were constructed under the
 assumption of normal, independent and identically distributed shocks with zero mean and
 standard deviations at their four-year averages for the growth, inflation, and real interest rate
 variables. The results indicate that with a very high probability, debt ratios will be falling over
 the medium term. For instance, with 95 percent probability, the debt to GDP ratio will be below
 130 percent by FY2013/14 and below 110 percent by FY2019/20.

Alternative Scenarios
180. Additional scenarios were constructed to explore debt sensitivity to key macro
variables and to reforms aimed at reducing the overall public debt. Debt dynamics and
sensitivity to key variables are illustrated below. Six additional scenarios and eight sub-
scenarios are presented below with comparisons to the baseline scenario.
181. The first alternative scenario (A1) assumes three key variables at their historical
(2003-07) averages: the GDP growth rate, the real interest rate, and the primary balance.
This assumption entails a consistent primary surplus of 8.7 percent of GDP for the fiscal years
after 2010/11, a GDP growth of 1.8 percent and an average real interest rate of 1.4 percent and
is thus more optimistic than the baseline. In this scenario, public debt is estimated to be 139.7
percent at the end of FY2009/10, and decreases steadily during the projected period to reach
111.6 percent of GDP by the end of FY2013/14 and 58.0 percent by the end of FY 2019/20.

182. The sensitivity of debt to fiscal assumptions is highlighted by the second alternative
scenario (A2). A2 is divided in two sub-scenarios A2a and A2b. A2a assumes no fiscal reform
and thus a smaller primary fiscal surplus of 4.0 percent of GDP, constant in FY2010/11 ­
FY2019/20. On the other hand, A2b assumes a larger fiscal consolidation than the baseline
(constant primary balance of 9.5 percent of GDP in the period FY2010/11 ­ FY2019/20). Under
A2a the debt to GDP ratio would peak in FY2010/11 at 149.3 percent and eventually decrease
to 143.0 percent by FY2013/14. However, as shown by Figure A4, the debt to GDP ratio is
higher than its initial level even at the end of FY2019/20. A2b is the most favorable scenario for
debt dynamics. Under A2b the debt to GDP ratio is projected to decrease in every year and
reach 52.9 percent by the end of the considered period. The results highlight the importance of
maintaining a sizeable primary budget surplus for reducing the debt to GDP ratio over the
medium term.
183. Jamaica's public debt is highly sensitive to exchange rate dynamics. This is explored
in the third alternative scenario (A3). This scenario includes two sub-scenarios according to the
type of exchange rate shock. The first sub-scenario (A3a) assumes a 30% depreciation in
FY2010/11 while the second sub-scenario (A3b) assumes a constant 10% depreciation in each
FY of the considered period. In both sub-scenarios the debt to GDP ratio would peak in

                                                               89
FY2010/11 at much higher levels than the baseline (182.2 percent under A3a and 160.8 percent
under A3b) but in both cases it is projected to decline over the entire period given the large
primary surplus and the positive rate of growth assumed in the baseline scenario.

184. The sensitivity of Jamaican public debt to exchange rate movements is a direct
consequence of its composition. As of January 2010, roughly 50 percent of the total public
debt is denominated in foreign currency. The great majority (84.5 percent) of domestic debt is
denominated in local currency while the rest is either indexed to US$ (4.1 percent), issued in
US$ (11.4 percent), or in Euro (0.1 percent). The external debt is mostly in US$ (77.56 percent),
with the rest in Euro (17.84 percent), Yen (2.45 percent), GBP (0.34 percent), and other
currencies (1.81 percent). Jamaica has 11 outstanding bonds issued on international markets, all
of them with a fixed coupon. Figure A6 summarizes the characteristics of Jamaica's external
debt.
185. The public debt dynamics of Jamaica are also sensitive to shocks to GDP growth.
This is explored in the fourth alternative scenario (A4) which assumes a negative (-0.6 percent)
rate of growth in FY2010/11 (A4a) and a more pessimistic growth (1 percent less than the
baseline) for the entire period FY2010/11 ­ FY2013/2014 (A4b). Under A4a and A4b the debt
to GDP ratio is projected to peak at (respectively) 145.8 percent and 141.8 percent before

186. Jamaica's public debt shows a lower degree of sensitivity to the interest rate. In the
fifth alternative scenario (A5) we shock the interest rate in FY2010/11 (2 standard deviations).
The debt to GDP ratio remains close to the baseline scenario and decreases to 73.4 percent by
the end of FY2019/20.

187. In the last alternative scenario (A6) we combine a one-time depreciation (10%
depreciation in FY2010/11) with a small negative shock to growth of -0.4 percent in
FY2010/11. The effects are substantial with the debt to GDP ratio exceeding 151.0 percent in
FY2010/11 before eventually decreasing to 118.7 percent in FY2013/14 and to 66.7 percent by
the end of FY2019/20.

188. The composition and structure of public debt in Jamaica are important indicators
of debt sustainability. The proportion of public debt denominated in local currency has
declined from 78.1 percent of GDP in FY2001/02 to 49.69 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 as
shown in Figure A6a. Most of foreign currency denominated debt is in US$ while a large
proportion of the remainder is in Euro.

         B. Financing Requirements
189. The gross financing needs of Jamaica are estimated to increase in FY2009/10 and
reach 19.8 percent of GDP, equivalent to US$2.39 billion. The increase is due to an increase
in interest payments (from 12.2 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to 16.0 percent of GDP in
FY2009/10) while principal repayments are estimated to decrease to 9.9 percent of GDP (from
10.2 percent in FY2008/09).
190. External financing requirements are projected to be covered mainly by multilateral
financing. The largest inflows are projected to be from the IMF's front-loaded SBA of US$1.25
billion, of which 650 million is to be disbursed in FY2009/10.
191. The debt maturity profile presents challenges to debt management. As shown in
Table B2 and Figure B1, out of J$735.6 billion of domestic debt, more than J$200 billion will
mature within the next 12 months. More specifically J$14.6 billion will mature between
February and March 2010, while J$208.9 billion (representing 29.8 percent of total domestic
debt) will mature in FY2010/11. Less concern is raised by external debt since only 0.6 percent
(US$38.9 million) of total external debt will mature within the next twelve months.

        Annex 6: SUMMARY OF NEW AND REVISED TAX REVENUE MEASURES

192. In an effort to broaden the tax base, increase the uniformity of the tax system, and
boost fiscal revenues, the Government of Jamaica introduced three sets of amendments to
existing tax measures during the current fiscal year. The proposed measures span a range of
tax instruments and include significant changes to the rates and structure of income taxes,
general and specific consumption taxes, license fees, customs exemptions, and import tariffs
(Table C1).
193. The first package, introduced in April 2009, lowered income tax thresholds while
simultaneously removing some income tax preferences, broadened the GCT base, imposed
a tax on dividends, and increased the specific tax on petrol and petroleum products. The
revised GCT listings were published in a separate communication from the Ministry four days
after the announcement of the revenue measures. The combined revenue impact of the new
measures was estimated by the Ministry of Finance to surpass J$18 billion. The most important
of these--accounting for nearly three quarters of the total--was the imposition of an additional
tax of J$8.75 per liter of petrol, which was the first increase in the fuel tax in ten years. At the
same time, a number of items in this package were expected to have negative consequences for
revenue. For example, the increase in the general income tax threshold as well as the income tax
threshold for pensioners was estimated to result in the narrowing of the tax base by 136,500
individuals. Similarly, a reduction in stamp duty and transfer taxes--designed to stimulate the
real estate market--was estimated to reduce revenues by J$644 million.
194. In May 2009, the GoJ revised the first package measures by re-introducing some of
the GCT exemptions and offsetting the revenue impact by increasing and restructuring
the SCT on cigarettes and alcohol. The list of items which were awarded exempt status
included printed matter, salt, rolled oats, syrup, soups, motor spirit, and lubricating oils for
commercial fishing. The harmonization and increase in the SCT rate for alcohol and the
increase in the SCT rate for cigarettes were estimated to more than compensate for the revenue
loss associated with putting the above sensitive items back on the exclusion list. Furthermore,
20 percent of the additional revenues expected from the increase of the SCT on cigarettes were
designated to be remitted to the National Health Fund.
195. The second package, introduced in September 2009, increased the departure tax
for tourists and the GCT rate on telephone calls and instruments. The departure tax, which
has remained unchanged since July 1999, was increased from J$1,000 to J$1,800 to reflect the
depreciation of the Jamaican dollar vs. the US dollar since that time. Thus, the departure tax
was restored to its original value of approximately US$20. The increase in the GCT rate on
telephone equipment follows the introduction of the first package of tax reforms (April 23,
2009), which removed this category from the GCT exemption list.
196. The third and final package, introduced on December 17 and revised on December
23, implemented a number of measures including increases in GCT and SCT rates,
broadening the GCT to include the supply of electricity, increases in income tax rates for
high earners, removal of customs exemption, and increases in license fees and customs
duties for certain luxury items, including vehicles. More than half of the estimated revenue
impact of these measures--valued at nearly J$22 million, or 2 percent of GDP in 2009--is
expected to come from the increase in the standard rate of the GCT from 16.5 percent to 17.5

percent and the re-introduction of the ad valorem component of the SCT on fuel (15 percent).
Other measures include further increases in taxes on cigarettes and the tourism sector, higher
income taxes for individuals earning more than J$5 million annually, higher license fees for
motor vehicles with engine size of three liters or more, and substantial increases in the Common
External Tariff (CET) on flat screen televisions over 30 inches, large motorcycles, guns,
pleasure boats, and jewelry.
