increase the efficiency of public\n            financial management and budgeting processes, by supporting\n            efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and\n            investment, and strengthen control of public finances and\n            the effectiveness of government budgeting practices. This\n            reform program is critical to the Government of Jamaica\n            (GoJ) strategy to create fiscal space for priority social\n            and investment spending and increase the growth potential of\n            Jamaica. The FS DPL1 will also support the maintenance of\n            macroeconomic stability while the GoJ adjusts to the\n            deterioration in the global environment while continuing to\n            implement the longer term reform agenda for fiscal and debt\n            sustainability. The FS DPL1 supports actions to: (a) promote\n            fiscal sustainability through control of overall public\n            sector balances and debt generation, and rationalization of\n            public bodies; (b) improve the efficiency of public\n            financial management and budget process; and (c) strengthen\n            the tax administration capacity, reduce tax distortions and\n            enhance the efficiency of the tax system. The Government has\n            made progress on these key components of its reform program,\n            even in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis."}, "docdt": "2010-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
