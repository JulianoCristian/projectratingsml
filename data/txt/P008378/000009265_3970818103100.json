Some lessons learned included: the full\n            realization of the institutional objectives, and in\n            particular of the sector reform, was made possible by the\n            involvement of the Government authorities and company\n            managers in the changing process. Bank's procurement\n            guidelines may be difficult to follow by a company with\n            private sector participation in its management-ownership due\n            to the delays introduced and the need to award to the lowest\n            responsive Bidder after following an ICB process. Some of\n            the traditional Bank's legal covenants may prove\n            constraining to a newly privatized company with an ambitious\n            development program, and even when the Bank may amend the\n            legal covenants (as opposed to the procurement guidelines\n            which are more permanent), the time and processing required\n            to amend those covenants add to the non-attractiveness of\n            the Bank's loan."}, "docdt": "1997-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
