"The Telecommunications Project will\n            support the digitalization and expansion of the core network\n            to:  (a) reduce congestion on key network elements; (b)\n            rapidly provide modern digital communications for\n            businesses; and (c) provide a sound foundation for future\n            modernization and expansion of the entire network.  The\n            project will also focus on institutional and policy\n            improvements aimed at: (a) increased efficiency in\n            telecommunications investment and operations; (b) improved\n            quality of service; and (c) transition to full commercial\n            operation. The project will support the Sprava Post a\n            Telekomunikaci (SPT) Telecom's development program for\n            1993-1995 and consists of two main elements:  (a)\n            construction of a digital overlay network focussing mainly\n            on long-distance facilities but with appropriate\n            complimentary international and local network improvement;\n            and (b) technical assistance and training to support\n            institutional improvements, especially in financial\n            management, human resource management, and market orientation."}, "docdt": "1993-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
