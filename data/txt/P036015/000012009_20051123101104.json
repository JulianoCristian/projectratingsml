Many lessons,\n            nonetheless, are drawn from this experience, some among them\n            follow. Projects such as this one should be framed primarily\n            as initiatives designed for the reform of expenditure\n            management systems, rather than merely accounting systems\n            reform. If reform measures are framed in terms of resolution\n            of an accounting problem (such as non-conformity with\n            international accounting standards, use of an archaic chart\n            of accounts, lack of timely reporting etc.), the danger is\n            that it will be focused only on the reform of the\n            organization, and processes related to the accounting\n            function. Thus, lack of commitment should be foreseen, and\n            an active support from the Ministry of Finance (MOF)\n            pursued. Moreover, the scope of the system should be also\n            foreseen, namely, extending the central system to\n            sub-national levels: if the central government is the\n            sponsor of the project, then the project should be\n            restricted to central government payments, and receipts. If\n            the central government wants to extend its control to\n            provincial level payments, then it should have some\n            financial leverage and control over provincial finances.\n            Controls would be part of any budgetary control system, be\n            it central or provincial. Particular care should be taken,\n            so that the agency exercising the payment control function\n            does not exceed limits. Specifically, use of the central\n            system for provincial payments should not result in any\n            additional interference from the center. Further lessons\n            address issues such as lack of adequate project management\n            capacity; resistance to change; orientation and training;\n            the importance of getting more emphasis on change\n            management, and the human side of reforms; and, on policy changes."}, "docdt": "2005-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
