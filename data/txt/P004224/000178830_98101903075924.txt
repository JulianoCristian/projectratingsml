INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECO01ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR A
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to US$3.6 million to Malaysia to
finance the foreign exchange cost of a project to improve and expand
the water supply facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       In May 1967, Malaysia applied to the Bank for a loan for the
Kuala Lumpur water supply system. Upon receipt of background information
the project was appraised in October/November 1967. Negotiations took
place between July 29 and August 2, 1968. The Government of Malaysia was
represented by lMessrs. Rastam Hadi (Manistry of Finance), Hashim bin Yeop
Abdullah Sani (Deputy Parliamentary Draftsman) and Abdul Aziz Zakaria
(Ministry of Works, Posts and Telecommunications). The State Government
of Selangor was represented by Messrs. Haji Megat (State Secretary),
Osman Ali (Financial Officer) and Rozario (State Public Works Department).
3.       The proposed loan would be the ninth for Malaysia.  An eighth
loan of US$4.4 million for a telecommunications project is also being
presented (P-630).  The Bank made a loan of US$6.8 million in February
1965 to the Public Utilities Board of Singapore under the guarantee of
Mlalaysia, of which Singapore was then a part. Malaysia remains the
guarantor of this loan.  The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans to i'alaysia as at July 31, 1968.

*Effective August 12, 1968
4.        The rate of disbursement of these loans has been satisfactory,
with the exception of Loan 348-MA to the Malaysian Industrial Development
Finance Berhad (MIDF); however, the balance of this loan is expected to
be committed by the end of 1968. New loans to Malaysia are under con-
sideration for an education and a power project.
5.        IFC invested US$818,000 in MIDF in conjunction with Loan 348-MA
and in addition has taken part in two financing operations with MIDF; in
March 1966 IFC made a loan of US$1,275,000 and an equity investment of
US$284,000 in Tasek Cement Ltd., and in May 1967 it made a loan of
US$2,451,000 and an equity investment of US$1,016,000 in Malayawata
Steel, Ltd.



PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
6.        Borrower:           Malaysia
Beneficiary:        State of Selangor
Amomut:             Various currencies, equivalent to
US$3.6 mlllion.
Purpose:            Improvement and expansion of water supply
facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area.
Amortization:       In 20 years with a 4 year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments commencing
September 15, 1972 and ending September 15,
1988.
Interest Rate:      6-1/2% per annum.
Commitment Charge:  3/4 of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the Kuala Lumpur Water Supply
Project - Selangor State, Malaysia" (TO-636a) dated August 20, 1968.
8.        The borrower would be the Government of Malaysia, which would
relend the proceeds of the loan to the Selangor State Government. The
project would be carried out and operated by the Water Division of the
Public Works Department of Selangor State. The Water Division operates
all public water systems in Selangor including the Kuala Lumpur area, and
the waterworks are satisfactorily maintained.
9.        The project is included in the water supply and sewerage
program of the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70) which has been reviewed by
the Bank and found generally acceptable. Demand for water in the Kuala
Lumpur area, which is the main center of population, commerce and industry
in West Malaysia is expected to exceed reliable capacity of the present
sources by 1970. The project would provide additional capacity sufficient
to meet estimated demand until about 1978.
10.       The project would comprise the first stage of a long-range
program to use the Langat River as a major source of water supply to
the Kuala Lumpur area. It would include intake works on the river, raw
water pumping station, and pumps and a raw water pumping main to a new
treatment plant where the water would be filtered and chlorinated. The
project also provides for transmission mains from the treatment plant



to the Kuala Lumpur area, termilnal storage reservoirs, and additional
distribution mains needed to strengthen the existing distribution system
and to extend the areas of supply. The total cost is estimated at
US$7.7 million equivalent.
11.       The foreign exchange component would be financed by the loan
and is estimated at about US$3.6 million equivalent, including interest
during construction. Local currency costs would be financed by funds
generated from internal operations. The project is technically sound,
estimated costs are reasonable, and the PWD is capable of carrying out
the work and operating the system.
12.       The items to be financed by the proposed loan would be procured
through international competitive bidding except for consulting services.
Certain goods required for the project are made by local manufacturers,
and if contracts are awarded to them the Bank would reimburse only the
foreign exchange component of such goods. It is intended to allow a
margin of preference of 15% or the rate of customs duty whichever is the
lower.
13.       At present the PWD, including the Water Division, operates under
the general government accounting system; in addition, it passes all cash
receipts into the State Treasury and meets its expenditures out of annual
budget appropriations. Selangor agreed to reorganize and maintain the
Water Division on the basis of a management consultants' study as a
financially separate unit with its own system of accounting and financial
management, and to make all water supply revenues available for the use
of the Water Division to the extent necessary for the conduct of its
operations.
14.       The tariff of water charges adopted by the State Government
is at present set at a level sufficient to make water supply operations
in Selangor financially remunerative and is estimated on the basis of
information presently available to provide for 1968 and subsequent years
a satisfactory return on the average net fixed assets in operation in the
Kuala Lumpur area. Selangor has undertaken to maintain the tariff at its
present level and, upon completion of the study by management consultants
referred to above, to make any adjustments that may prove necessary on
the basis of the study to preserve this satisfactory return. Selangor
has also undertaken to maintain charges in the outlying areas of the State
at a level not less than within the Kuala Lumpur area, as well as to review
with the Bank annually its investment program for future expansion of the
Water Division's facilities.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMiENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
draft Project Agreement between the State of Selangor and the Bank and
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
16.       The draft Agreements follow substantially the pattern of other
agreements used for water supply projects. In addition, the draft Project
Agreement provides that: (i) the State of Selangor shall reorganize its
Water Division as a financially separate unit with its own system of
accounting and financial management /gection 2.02(c)7; (ii) the State of
Selangor shall review annually with the Bank the program of investments
for future expansion of the facilities of its Water Division /section
2.02(d27; and (iii) water charges outside the Kuala Lumpur area shall
not be lower than the charges for similar categories of consumers in
the Kuala Lumpur area /Section 2.08(c27.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
17.       The most recent  economic report on Malaysia (AS-127) was
circulated to the Executive Directors as follows: Volume I (Main Report)
on May 29, 1967 (R67-72) and Volume II (Agriculture in West Malaysia) on
July 19, 1967 (R67-110). A memorandum updating the information in the
Economic Report was attached to the President's Report (P-589) on the
Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project, dated March 28, 1968. An
economic mission visited Malaysia in July/August 1968, and its report is
expected to be distributed to the Executive Directors in November.
18.       The rapid rate of economic growth experienced by Malaysia during
the five years up to 1966 slowed down significantly during 1967. The
principal cause for this was the decline in the price of rubber by over
20% between late 1966 and the end of 1967. Malaysia's export earnings
as a consequence declined in 1967 by US$43.0 million or 3.4%, despite
the offsetting influence of the timber export boom. This development
in turn was largely responsible for a decline in the growth rate of
Malaysia's GNP from an average 7.5% in the preceding three years to
about 4% in 1967. There has been no significant recovery in exports up
to mid-1968; prospects are for only a modest acceleration of GNP in 1968.
19.       Domestic savings continue at the relatively high level of 17.5%
of GNP, and gross investments in perennial crops has been going down
since 1963, and this movement is still continuing. Investment in commerce
and industry, after a five-year period of rapid growth, declined somewhat
in 1967, but for 1968 a slight pickup is expected. Institutional improve-
ments and the recently enacted Investment Incentives Act should, in the
longer run, help improve Malaysia's already generally favorable private
investment climate.



- 6 -
20.      Public development expenditures under the First Malaysia Plan
(1966-70) have by and large been on target so far. Expenditures in 1966
through 1968 are likely to reach 56% of the five-year target with
relatively faster advances to date in housing, transport and social
investment, and a somewhat slower implementation in agriculture and
education. The latter sector has received an increasing share in the
total budget through a rapid expansion of current expenditures. In the
case of agriculture and land development, Central Government investment
is making satisfactory progress but shortfalls have occurred in schemes
carried out under the authority of independent and State agencies.
21.      With the additional tax effort in recent years, Malaysia's
performance in raising revenue continues to be satisfactory, but the
economy drive in recurrent expenditures envisaged in the Plan has been
only partly successful. This, together with the weakening of the tax
base due to the adverse external factors in 1967, has led to a situation
in which the Government is faced with a difficult financing problem.
Considerable scope remains for extending domestic market borrowing by
the Government, but there has been disappointing progress in the absorp-
tion of external project assistance. Disbursements of bilateral project
assistance in 1967 amounted to only about US$12 million, equivalent to
1.3% of total imports, and renewed efforts are required both in project
preparation and in the simplification of procedures if efficient use is
to be made of existing credit offers.
22.      Malaysia continues to be an open, market-oriented economy.
Encouragement of private enterprise and free convertibility are important
conditions for economic strength. Recent events have brought about a rate
of external reserve drawdown that was faster than contemplated, partly
because of extraordinary factors such as the repatriation of short-term
government securities caused by changes in Singapore's banking regulations,
and the devaluation of sterling. This trend continued in the first half
of 1968, but there are reasons to expect some recovery during the second
half. Total reserves remain at the rather comfortable level of US$580
million or about six months' imports. External debt outstanding in May
1968 was US$276 million, and debt service payments for 1968 will be about
2.5% of merchandise exports. Malaysia continues to be creditworthy for
substantial additional amounts of external borrowing on conventional terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMNT
23.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
24.      I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
