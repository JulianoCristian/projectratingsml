(i) taking incremental steps towards the\n            reestablishment of a sound basis for growth and development,\n            and (ii) strengthening efforts to protect social programs,\n            thereby helping to mitigate the adverse effects of the\n            economic crisis on the poor in Argentina. The operation is\n            part of a concerted effort by multilateral institutions to\n            help Argentina during the transition period and lay the\n            groundwork for a more comprehensive reform program to be\n            developed and implemented with the new administration\n            scheduled to take office at the end of M a y 2003. The\n            transition loan will help strengthen Argentina's\n            ability to resume growth and protect its human capital\n            through a series of initial reform steps taken by the\n            current Government. These steps support (i) the continued\n            deficit reduction efforts by the provinces, (ii) the\n            elimination of quasi-monies, (iii) measures to ensure that\n            social protection programs respond adequately to the\n            economic and social crisis, and (iv) measures to ensure\n            coverage of basic health services to the most vulnerable\n            through increased budget allocations to priority programs\n            and improved access to pharmaceuticals."}, "docdt": "2003-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
