The 
proposed 
loan 
would 
support the 
country 
by 
(i) 
taking 
incremental 
steps 
towards 
the  reestablishment 
of 
a 
sound 
basis 
for  growth 
and 
development, 
and 
(ii) 
strengthening 
efforts 
to 
protect 
social 
programs, 
thereby 
helping 
to 
mitigate 
the 
adverse 
effects 
of 
the economic crisis 
on 
the 
poor 
in 
Argentina. 
The 
proposed operation 
is 
part 
of 
a 
concerted 
effort 
by 
multilateral 
institutions 
to 
help Argentina 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
and 
lay 
the 
groundwork 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
reform 
program 
to 
be 
developed 
and 
implemented 
with 
the 
new 
administration 
scheduled 
to 
take 
office 
at 
the 
end 
of 
May 
2003. 
Description 
The 
proposed 
transition 
loan 
would 
help 
strengthen 
Argentina’s 
ability 
to 
resume 
growth 
and 
protect 
its 
human 
capital through 
a 
series 
of 
initial 
reform 
steps 
taken 
by 
the current 
Government. 
These 
steps 
support 
(i) 
the 
continued 
deficit 
reduction 
efforts 
by 
the 
provinces, 
(ii) 
the 
elimination 
of 
quasi-monies, 
(iii) 
measures 
to 
ensure 
that 
social protection 
programs 
respond 
adequately 
to 
the economic 
and 
social 
crisis, 
and 
(iv) 
measures 
to 
ensure 
coverage 
of 
basic 
health 
services 
to 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
through 
increased 
budget allocations 
to 
priority 
programs 
and 
improved 
access

Benefits 
Risks 
The 
transition 
program 
will 
contribute 
to 
the consolidation 
of 
the 
incipient 
economic 
recovery 
and 
set 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
longer-term 
reform 
program 
with 
the 
new 
government. 
First, 
improved provincial 
finances 
will 
directly 
contribute 
to 
the attainment 
of 
a 
primary 
surplus 
in 
the 
consolidated 
public 
sector, 
thus 
contributing 
to 
the 
resumption 
of 
sustainable 
growth, 
which 
is 
crucial 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
poverty. 
Second, 
the 
elimination 
of 
quasi-monies 
will 
have the 
following 
benefits: 
(i) 
provincial 
governments 
have 
committed 
to 
stop 
any 
new 
issuance 
of 
quasi-monies; 
(ii) 
it 
would 
accelerate 
the 
return 
to 
a 
normal 
payment 
system 
based 
on 
the 
peso, 
thereby strengthening the 
ability 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank 
to 
conduct 
monetary 
policy, 
(iii) 
it 
would 
help lower 
income 
families, 
including 
retirees, 
who 
often 
were 
forced 
to 
accept these 
quasi- 
monies 
as 
payments, 
(iv) 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
normalizing 
federal 
provincial 
fiscal 
relations, 
and 
(v) 
reduce perverse 
incentives 
to 
economic 
activity 
towards 
the 
informal 
sector, 
and 
improve 
inter-provincial 
trade, 
thus 
promoting 
overall 
economic 
growth. 
Third, 
the social 
safety 
net 
measures 
are 
helping 
the 
poor 
in 
meeting their 
basic 
social 
needs. 
In 
addition, the 
Heads 
of 
Household program 
has 
contributed 
to 
calm 
down 
the 
high 
social 
tensions 
that 
existed 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002 
as 
well 
as 
to 
provide 
temporary 
and 
part-time employment opportunities. 
The 
risks 
to 
this 
program 
are 
high. 
Sustainability 
of 
the 
program 
could 
be 
undermined 
by 
the 
upcoming 
presidential 
elections 
which may 
not 
result 
in 
a 
government 
that 
is 
willing 
andor 
able 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
a 
comprehensive economic 
and 
social 
reform 
program. 
This 
may 
undermine 
the 
incipient recovery 
and 
increase 
economic and 
political 
uncertainty, 
with 
possible 
negative 
consequences 
for 
the on-going efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
at 
both 
the federal 
and 
provincial 
levels. 
Beyond 
these 
risks, 
a 
slower 
than 
expected 
level 
of 
economic 
activity, 
including 
the 
impact 
of 
the general 
world 
economy, 
would 
also present 
serious 
risks 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
program. 
Attaining 
higher 
primary 
fiscal 
surpluses 
- 
as 
required 
for 
dealing 
with 
the 
debt 
problem 
and 
the 
current default 
status 
-will 
demand 
political 
leadership 
and 
cohesion. 
The 
social 
depth 
of 
the 
crisis 
- 
unemployment and 
poverty 
- 
and 
the 
rapidity 
of 
the 
required 
reforms, 
including 
the 
strengthening 
of 
seriously 
deteriorated 
institutions 
may 
challenge the 
new 
government’s 
ability 
in 
building 
a consensus 
approach 
to 
policy 
making. 
Adherence 
of 
individual 
provinces 
to 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
program 
depends 
on 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
the 
distribution 
of 
costs 
of 
that 
exchange, 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
future 
changes 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
program, 
which 
could be 
affected 
by 
the 
imminent 
presidential 
elections, 
and 
provincial 
elections 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2003. 
vi 
Page  7
Another potential 
risk 
is 
that the 
social 
safety 
net 
measures, 
implemented 
during 
the 
emergency, are 
not 
followed 
up 
by 
deeper 
structural 
and 
programmatic 
reforms 
the 
enable 
both 
sustainable 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
efficient 
social 
protection. 
Should 
such 
risks 
materialize, 
the 
country 
risks 
falling 
back 
into 
recession 
and 
confronting 
an even 
deeper 
social 
crisis. 
Mitigating 
these 
risks 
is 
the 
commitment 
by 
the 
provinces 
to 
reduce the 
overall 
provincial deficit 
zind 
produce 
primary 
surpluses, 
their 
commitment 
to 
unify 
the 
national 
currency, 
and 
Congressional 
approval 
of 
the 
national 
budget. 
The 
much 
better 
than 
anticipated 
fiscal 
performance 
in 
2002 
by 
the 
provinces 
and 
their 
commitment 
to 
implement 
the 
2003 
targets 
are 
hopeful 
signs 
that 
the 
provinces 
will 
carry out 
the 
2003 
bilateral 
fiscal 
agreements. 
In 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
area, 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
strongly committed 
to 
implement 
these 
social programs 
and 
there 
is 
general 
support 
in 
Argentina, 
including 
among presidential 
candidates, 
for 
the continuation 
of 
those 
programs.

INTRODUCTION 
1. 
The 
proposed 
Economic 
and 
Social 
Transition 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Loan 
for US$500 
million to 
the 
Argentine Republic 
would 
strengthen 
an 
ongoing program 
in 
support 
of 
the 
incipient 
economic 
recovery 
in 
Argentina. 
It 
would 
help 
facilitate 
ongoing reforms 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
of 
the 
administration 
of 
President 
Duhalde 
to 
a 
new 
administration 
scheduled 
to 
take 
office 
on 
May 
25,2003. 
This loan follows 
up 
on 
an 
investment 
loan 
approved 
in 
January 
of 
2003, 
which 
provides 
support 
to 
the country’s 
largest 
emergency 
program 
for 
unemployed 
heads 
of 
households.

IRIECENT 
ECONOMIC 
AND 
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
A. 
Recent 
Economic Developments 
2. 
The 
Argentine 
economy 
is 
emerging 
from 
the 
deepest 
recession 
in 
generations, 
with 
its 
GDP 
having 
fallen 
by 
20 
percent 
in 
the 
last 
four 
years 
and 
by 
10.9 
percent 
in 
2002 
alone. 
Per 
capita 
income 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2002 
stood 
at 
an 
estimated 
US$2,695, 
down 
from 
over 
8,000 
in 
the 
1997/98 period’. 
Poverty 
has 
increased 
to 
58 
percent, 
with 
indigence 
levels affecting 
28 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
or 
about 
9 
million. 
3. 
which 
extracted 
an 
increasingly 
and 
finally 
unsustainable 
high 
social 
and 
economic 
costa2 
Compounding 
this 
was 
the 
declaration 
of 
default 
on 
Argentina’s 
public 
debt, 
the 
ill-prepared 
devaluation, 
and 
the 
asymmetric 
pesification 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
all 
of 
which 
have 
had 
damaging 
effects 
on 
macroeconomic 
management, 
viability 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
credibility 
of 
government 
action, 
and 
the 
rule 
of 
law. 
The culmination 
of 
this crisis 
is 
associated 
with 
the collapse 
of 
the 
Convertibility 
Plan, 
4. 
Argentine 
economy displayed 
signs 
of 
bottoming 
out 
around the 
middle 
of 
2002.  Since 
then 
indications 
of 
an 
incipient 
recovery 
based 
on 
improved 
consumer sentiment 
and 
import 
substitution have 
multiplied, 
with 
positive 
developments 
becoming 
clearer 
and 
stronger 
in 
recent 
months. 
These 
were 
reflected 
in 
the 
trend 
of 
the 
quarterly 
GDP 
in 
2002 
which 
contracted 
by 
over 
16 percent 
during 
the 
first 
quarter compared 
to 
the 
same 
period 
of 
the previous 
year, 
but 
improved 
about 
equally, 
on 
a seasonally 
adjusted quarter 
to 
quarter 
basis, 
by 
0.7 
percent 
in 
each 
of 
the three 
subsequent 
quarters3. Consequently, 
economic 
growth 
in 
2002 declined 
by 
10.9 
After 
an 
initial 
period 
of 
heightened 
economic, 
social, 
and 
political

The 
current Government 
has 
made 
important 
strides 
towards 
reverting 
some 
of 
the 
negative 
impact 
of 
the 
crisis 
under 
very difficult 
social 
and 
political 
conditions. 
Key 
to 
this 
achievements 
have 
been 
the 
controls 
over 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
as 
well 
as 
the 
pursuit 
of 
a 
restrained 
monetary 
policy. 
There 
is, 
however, a 
broad 
and 
substantial 
agenda 
for 
structural 
reforms 
that 
remains 
to 
be 
tackled 
in 
order 
to 
insure 
that the recent 
signs 
of 
economic 
improvement can 
be 
sustained 
and 
accelerated. 
Reforms 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
the 
financial 
sector, 
corporate restructuring, 
public 
utilities 
services, 
public 
sector 
management, 
reform 
in 
fiscal 
relations 
with 
the provinces, 
extemal 
debt restructuring, and 
investment 
climate 
will 
have 
to 
wait 
until 
a 
new 
administration 
takes 
office. 
6. 
With 
regard 
to 
fiscal 
policy, the Government 
tightly 
controlled 
expenditures, 
especially 
of 
wages 
and 
pensions, 
but 
relied 
on 
export 
taxes 
and 
the 
financial 
transaction 
tax 
to 
collect 
more 
than 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
revenues. 
Average 
monthly 
revenues 
rose 
from 
Arg$3.4 
billion 
in 
the 
first 
four 
months 
of 
2002, 
coinciding 
with 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
recession, 
to 
Arg$5.2 
billion 
in 
the 
following 
eight 
months, 
marking 
an 
average 
increase 
in 
revenues 
of 
53 
percent, 
which 
surpassed 
the rate 
of 
inflation, 
and 
reflects 
the 
gradual 
improvement 
in 
economic 
activity 
and 
tax 
collection 
efforts. 
As 
a result, 
the 
primary 
deficits 
of 
the 
first 
four 
months 
of 
2002 
turned 
into 
surpluses 
in 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
year, 
generating 
a 
primary 
surplus 
of 
0.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
for 
the 
year 
as 
a 
whole. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
overall 
cash 
balance 
of 
the Federal Government remained 
in 
deficit 
(- 
1.6 
percent 
of 
GDP), 
despite 
the 
non-payment 
of 
interest 
obligations 
because 
of 
the 
default 
conditions. 
7. 
reducing 
the combined 
provincial deficit 
by 
60 
percent 
during 
2002. 
The 
outcome 
of 
the 
agreement has 
been better 
than 
expected, 
with 
the 
combined 
provincial deficit 
having 
been 
cut 
by 
74 
percent 
from 
Arg$6.8 
billion 
in 
2001 
to 
Arg$1.8 
billion 
by 
eliminating 
a 
primary 
fiscal 
deficit 
of 
0.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
during 
2002. 
For 
2003, 
it 
is 
planned 
that the 
provincial 
deficits 
will 
be 
cut 
firther to 
Arg$l 
.l 
billion. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Government 
has 
already 
signed 
agreements 
with 
eleven 
provinces 
representing 
95 
percent 
of 
the 
overall 2002 
provincial 
deficit. 
Further 
improvements 
in 
provincial 
fiscal 
performance 
are 
needed 
to 
obtain fiscal 
sustainability 
of 
the 
consolidated 
public 
sector, 
and 
reform 
of 
the federal-provincial 
fiscal 
agreement 
(coparticipacion) 
is 
a 
challenge 
for 
the 
immediate 
future. 
On 
provincial 
finances, 
the 
Central Government 
signed 
agreements 
with 
the 
provinces 
on 
8. 
Monetary 
policy 
has 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
the 
improvement 
in 
the 
macroeconomic 
situation. 
Key 
to 
this 
has 
been 
the 
change 
in 
rediscount 
policy, 
which 
increasingly sterilized 
the 
liquidity 
support extended  towards 
banks 
in 
response 
to 
the 
judicial 
rulings 
in 
favor 
of 
liberalizing blocked 
deposits, 
so 
called 
“amparos”. 
The 
decline 
of 
intemational 
reserves 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002 
was another source 
of 
monetary 
absorption. 
The 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
policy 
stance 
have 
resulted 
in 
a 
significant 
lowering 
of 
the 
monthly inflation 
rate 
from 
about 
4 
percent 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002, 
to 
1.3 
percent 
during 
the 
second 
half 
year, 
to 
about 
1 
percent 
during 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2003. 
Interest 
rates 
have 
also 
fallen 
significantly 
since 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
year, 
with 
fixed 
term 
deposit 
rates 
having 
declined 
from 
about 
80 
percent 
in 
July 
2002 
to 
15 
percent 
in 
January 
2003 
and 
the 
prime 
rate 
from 
90 
percent 
to 
27 
percent 
during 
the 
same 
period.

established 
following 
the 
temporary 
introduction 
of 
multiple 
exchange 
rates. 
The 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
policies 
together 
with 
capital controls 
that 
were re-introduced extensively 
in 
2002, 
supported 
an 
exchange 
rate 
policy 
that 
resulted 
in 
a 
relatively 
stable exchange 
rate 
of 
Peso 
3.66 
per 
US$1 from 
June 
through November 
2002. 
Towards 
the 
end 
of 
2002, 
the 
incipient 
recovery 
and 
the 
increasing international 
reserves 
position, 
in 
part 
due 
to 
the 
accumulation 
of 
payment 
arrears 
and 
a 
large 
trade 
surplus 
started 
to 
exert 
appreciating 
pressures 
on 
the 
exchange 
rate. 
To 
arrest 
a 
too 
quick 
of 
an 
appreciation, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
has 
increasingly 
lifted 
capital controls 
since 
the 
end 
of 
last December. 
At 
mid-April, 
the 
exchange 
rate 
stood 
at 
around Arg$2.9 
to 
US$1 
, 
and 
foreign 
reserves 
had 
reached 
US$10.5 
billion. 
Progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
other 
areas 
as 
well. 
A 
flexible 
exchange 
rate 
has 
been 
10. 
The 
external 
financing 
crisis 
and 
recession was 
reflected 
in 
the 
swift 
reversal 
in 
the 
external 
accounts. 
With 
a 
precipitous decline 
in 
imports 
of 
55.8 
percent, 
and 
despite a 
lackluster 
export 
performance, 
the trade balance 
in 
goods 
and 
services 
improved 
from 
a 
US$3.5 
billion 
surplus 
in 
2001 
to 
US$15.4 
billion 
last 
year, 
helping 
generate 
a 
US$13.5 
billion 
swing 
in 
the 
current 
account. 
The 
traded 
goods 
balance 
continued 
to 
be 
in 
large 
surplus 
in 
January 
2003, 
when 
it 
reached 
US$1.3 
billion 
compared 
to 
US$970 
million 
in 
the 
same 
month 
of 
2002. 
A 
similar 
surplus 
was 
obtained 
in 
the 
month 
of 
February.

its 
recovery 
path. 
By 
March 
2003, 
industrial production 
was 
21.4 
percent 
higher 
than 
a year 
ago, 
albeit 
from 
levels 
that characterized the 
trough 
of 
the economic crisis. 
Inflation 
remained 
moderate, 
and 
trade balances 
exhibited 
large 
surpluses. 
Fiscal 
performance 
improved 
further, 
principally 
from 
improved 
income 
tax 
collections, 
with 
revenues 
coming 
better 
than 
expected 
in 
the 
Fund’s 
program.  Exchange controls were further 
eased, 
and 
banking 
deposits 
were 
liberalized.  Commitments 
to 
improve 
fiscal 
performance 
in 
the 
provinces were 
reached, 
and 
the 
Government 
launched 
a 
program 
for 
the monetary 
unification.  Between 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
year 
and 
mid-April, 
the peso  appreciated 
by 
15 
percent, 
and 
international 
reserves 
continued 
to 
build 
up. 
To 
summarize 
positive 
developments 
in 
thefirst 
months 
of 
2003, 
the economy 
stayed 
on 
12. 
These 
impressive 
achievements however 
remain 
fragile 
as 
long 
as 
important 
issues 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
resolved. 
The 
Argentine 
banking 
system 
has 
been 
significantly 
weakened, 
first 
by 
the 
massive 
withdrawal 
of 
deposits 
in 
2001, 
and 
second 
by 
the loss 
of 
confidence 
resulting 
from 
the 
partial 
freeze 
of 
bank 
accounts, 
the 
forced 
conversion 
of 
dollar 
deposits, 
and 
associated 
policy 
decisions 
(asymmetric 
pesification, 
preferential 
treatment 
of 
debtors, 
etc.). 
With 
about 
50 
percent 
of 
bank 
assets 
currently 
held 
in 
the 
form 
of 
govement 
bonds, 
the 
future 
viability 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
depends, 
among 
other 
factors, 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
public 
debt 
workout, 
and 
valuation 
of 
such bonds. 
Depositors 
have 
suffered significant 
losses, 
and 
access 
to 
the 
remaining 
deposits 
were 
circumscribed. 
Important 
economic dislocations 
occurred 
with 
the 
imposition 
of 
restrictions 
on 
access 
to 
banking 
deposits.  Nevertheless, 
gradually, 
sight 
and 
savings deposits 
and 
more 
recently 
time 
deposits 
have 
been 
liberalized. 
But, 
the 
financial intermediation 
process 
has 
been 
severely disrupted. 
No 
credible resolution 
to 
the 
banking 
crisis 
has yet 
been 
defined, 
and 
the 
future 
of 
the 
banking 
system 
is 
uncertain. 
Confidence 
on 
the 
banking 
system 
has 
plummeted, 
as 
banks 
suffered 
high 
operational 
losses 
and 
a 
sharp 
increase 
in 
their non- 
performing 
loans. 
The weakening 
of 
the 
banking 
system, 
and 
the 
continuous decline 
in 
credit 
associated 
with 
significant contraction 
of 
investment, 
are 
limiting 
factors 
to 
a sustained 
economic recovery. 
While 
cautious 
measures 
are 
being 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
the 
banking 
system, 
3 
Page  12
the 
redollarization 
of 
deposits 
(ruled 
by 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
in 
one 
case 
only, 
but 
opening 
the 
door 
for 
more 
widespread 
application) remains 
a 
risk to 
the 
banking 
system, 
as 
it 
could 
increase 
its 
losses, 
and 
dependence 
on 
public 
transfers. 
13. 
Private 
contracts 
have 
been 
breached 
- 
for 
example, 
all 
private 
contracts 
denominated 
in 
dollars were converted 
into 
Argentine 
pesos 
at 
the 
old 
exchange 
rate 
of 
one-to-one 
and 
mortgage 
executions 
were 
suspended 
- 
and 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
their 
renegotiation 
has 
been 
undermined 
through 
inopportune 
legislation (only recently 
new 
bankruptcy legislation 
established a 
minimum 
acceptable 
legal 
framework 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
creditors 
and 
debtors). 
Utility 
rates 
have 
been 
frozen, 
threatening 
the 
future 
provision 
of 
public 
services 
(recent 
minimal 
price 
adjustment 
in 
utilities 
have 
been 
suspended 
by 
a 
court 
decision). 
Property 
and 
creditor 
rights 
have 
been violated 
in 
a 
wholesale 
manner, 
and 
unless 
such 
rights 
are 
credibly 
reestablished, 
economic recovery 
will 
be 
curtailed. 
14. 
Consequently, 
Argentina 
has 
no 
access 
to 
the 
international 
financial 
markets.  Currently, the 
authorities 
have 
began 
the 
long 
process 
or 
reaching 
out 
to 
intemational 
creditors. 
However, the 
process 
of 
debt 
renegotiation 
promises 
to 
be long 
and 
arduous, 
and 
some 
creditors have 
initiated 
legal action 
to 
attach 
Argentine 
assets 
abroad. 
In 
the 
process 
of 
pesification, 
massive 
wealth 
transfers 
from 
creditors 
to 
debtors 
and, 
in 
particular, 
from 
the 
state 
to 
debtors 
have 
occurred. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
compensations 
to 
banks 
and 
depositors 
the 
state 
has 
already issued sizable 
amounts 
of 
new 
debt, 
thereby increasing 
difficulties 
for 
the 
future servicing 
of 
debt 
in 
default. 
The 
Government 
has 
defaulted 
on 
various domestic 
and 
most 
international 
obligations. 
15. 
and 
the maintenance 
of 
the fiscal 
and 
monetary stability 
reached 
over 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2002. 
The 
prospects 
for 
output recovery 
reflect 
the 
depth 
of 
the output decline 
of 
the last 
four 
years, 
and 
the 
opportunities 
provided 
by 
the 
sharp 
devaluation 
of 
the currency. 
The 
recovery 
in 
consumption, 
and 
import 
substituting activities 
could 
be 
leading 
the recovery, 
with 
real 
GDP 
growth 
projected 
to 
reach 
about 
4 
percent. 
However, 
significant uncertainty 
accompanies 
any 
such expectations, 
given 
the 
need 
to 
address 
urgently 
fundamental structural reforms. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
normalization 
of 
relations 
with 
the 
international financial 
community, 
which 
would 
require 
both 
a 
debt 
restructuring 
and 
a sustainable 
fiscal 
framework, 
the reestablishment 
of 
a 
functioning financial 
system, 
and 
renewed 
credibility 
to 
public 
institutions, 
the 
ongoing 
economic 
recovery 
is 
unlikely 
to 
translate 
into 
sustained 
economic 
growth. 
Argentina’s 
prospectsfor 
2003 
are 
for 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
current 
recovery 
in 
output

IFIs, 
covering 
the January 
to 
August 
2003 
period. 
The 
Government 
estimates 
that 
the 
total 
external 
financing 
gap 
during 
this 
period 
is 
in 
the 
order 
of 
US$l 
1.6 
billion.  This 
financing 
gap 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
met 
by 
new 
disbursements 
of 
the 
IMF 
of 
about 
US$2.9 
billion 
and 
the extension 
of 
repurchase expectations 
amounting 
to 
US$3.7 
billion 
as 
well 
as 
by 
disbursements 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
IDB 
in 
the 
order 
of 
US$2.2 
billion 
each. 
In 
February 
2003  the 
Paris 
Club 
agreed 
to 
a 
rescheduling 
of 
debt service 
amounting 
to 
about 
US$0.7 
billion. 
In 
the meantime, 
an 
interim 
economic 
and 
financing 
program 
has 
been 
agreed 
with

The 
economic 
crisis 
has 
had 
a 
strong 
negative impact 
on 
the 
access 
and 
use 
of 
education 
and 
health 
services 
and 
there 
is 
growing 
evidence 
of 
the deterioration 
in 
service 
delivery 
and 
key 
indicators 
of 
well-being. 
19. 
the 
destruction 
ofjobs 
in 
the 
formal 
sector. 
Roughly 
12 
percent 
of 
individuals 
with 
fomal 
health 
insurance either 
discontinued 
(60 
percent 
of 
the 
total), 
or 
reduced 
their 
coverage. 
The 
trend 
has 
contributed 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
use 
of 
already 
financially 
strapped 
public 
hospitals, 
the 
traditional 
provider 
for 
the 
uninsured. 
The 
crisis 
has 
forced 
families 
to 
cut 
down 
on 
health 
services. 
More 
than 
one-third 
of 
households 
with 
children 
under the 
age 
of 
12 
reported 
having 
reduced 
the 
fkequency 
with 
which 
they 
take 
their 
children 
for 
medical 
checkups 
(roughly 
half 
of 
those 
households 
belong 
to 
the 
lowest 
quintile 
of 
the 
income 
distribution). 
There 
are 
concerns 
about 
the 
emergence 
of 
cases 
of 
child 
malnutrition. 
Coverage 
and 
financing 
of 
formal 
health 
insurance 
has 
dropped 
significantly, 
following 
20. 
due 
to 
the 
crisis. 
On 
the other 
hand, 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
households 
report that 
they have 
reduced 
school 
and learning material 
purchases. 
The 
most 
serious 
negative 
effects 
of 
the 
crisis 
on 
the 
education 
sector 
are 
linked 
to 
the 
fiscal 
provincial 
crisis. 
The lack 
of 
financing 
experienced 
by 
several 
provinces 
has generated 
difficulties to 
comply 
with 
payments 
to 
their 
employees, 
including 
teachers. 
Delays 
in 
wage payments 
has 
had 
an 
impact 
on 
the 
continuity 
of 
classes. 
While 
experiences 
have 
differed 
within 
the 
country 
due 
in 
part 
to 
the 
higher 
or 
lower 
solvency 
in 
each 
state, 
the 
2002 
school 
year was 
irreparably affected 
in 
some 
provinces 
(Sm 
Juan, 
Entre 
Nos), 
very 
seriously affected 
in 
others (Tucumhn, 
Jujuy, 
Rio 
Negro), 
and 
had 
partial 
scope 
in 
a 
third 
group 
of 
provinces 
(Misiones,  Formosa, Chubut). 
The 
difference among 
them 
is 
the 
number 
of 
school days 
lost, 
ranging 
from 
about 
a quarter 
to 
almost 
half 
of 
the 
school 
year.5 
In 
the 
education 
sector 
there 
are 
no 
indications 
of 
aggravated 
dropout 
and 
desertion 
rates 
21. 
2002 
has 
made 
the 
social situation 
even 
more 
difficult 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
and 
the 
need 
for 
action 
more 
urgent.  Discussions 
and 
reform 
proposals 
to 
correct the 
underlying 
problems have been 
ongoing 
for 
several 
years 
without 
reaching 
a 
conclusion 
as 
a 
result 
of 
insufficient 
political 
support 
and 
social 
consensus. 
The 
Government 
now 
faces 
a 
particularly 
difficult 
challenge: 
increasing 
demands 
for 
social 
assistance 
in 
the 
context 
of 
falling 
fiscal 
resources 
and 
extremely 
limited 
administrative capabilities 
to 
innovate 
and 
coordinate 
responses. 
Many 
of 
the 
social problems have existed before 
in 
Argentina. 
What 
is 
different 
is 
that

decisively

them 
and consolidating social programs around 
a 
smaller 
Nevertheless, 
recognizing 
the 
seriousness 
of 
the 
social 
situation, 
the 
Government 
has 
While 
there 
is 
no 
updated 
aggregate 
official 
data 
that 
would allow to 
determine the 
extent 
to which 
there has 
been 
a 
deterioration 
in 
infant 
mortality 
and malnutrition, 
evidence 
of 
serious 
child 
malnutrition 
(and 
a 
failure 
of 
existing 
programs 
to 
identify 
those 
cases 
in 
time) 
has emerged 
recently 
in 
several 
provinces 
raising 
the concern 
that, 
if 
left 
unattended, 
this 
could 
develop 
into 
a 
graver 
health 
emergency. 
The 
interruption 
of 
the 
educational 
process 
has 
a 
strong 
impact 
on 
students' 
learning 
processes. 
The 
abandonment 
of 
the 
"school routine", the 
fewer 
school 
days, 
the 
impossibility 
to 
consolidate and 
correct 
leaming, 
the 
tension 
in 
the 
relationship 
of 
schools 
with 
families, 
are 
all 
factors 
that seriously affect 
schooling 
attainments. 
The 
responses 
to 
these 
situations 
has 
led 
some 
school 
systems 
to 
lower 
academic requirements 
by 
promoting 
students 
who 
have 
not 
reached the 
minimum 
level 
for 
each grade/ 
year.

COUNTRY 
ASSISTANCE 
STRATEGY 
23. 
2000, 
and 
was 
subsequently 
updated6. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
dramatic 
events 
at 
the end 
of 
2001 
and 
their 
impact 
on 
economic, 
political, 
and 
social 
policy 
making, 
Bank 
staff 
have 
regularly 
briefed 
the 
Board 
on 
the 
latest 
developments 
and 
the 
Bank’s 
strategy 
in 
providing 
financial 
support 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
country 
during 
this 
period 
of 
transition. 
The 
last 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
was 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
September 
8, 
24. 
that 
is 
focused 
on 
a 
restoration 
of 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
a 
major 
reduction 
of 
poverty. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
recognition 
that 
comprehensive 
reform 
and 
its 
implementation 
will 
need 
to 
wait 
until 
the 
new 
administration 
takes 
office 
at 
the 
end 
of 
May 
2003, 
after 
presidential 
elections 
were 
held 
on 
April 
27, 
with 
a 
second 
round 
scheduled 
for 
May 
18. 
The 
key 
challenge 
for 
Argentina 
is 
to 
get 
back 
to 
a 
comprehensive development 
agenda 
25. 
Current 
Bank 
strategy 
is 
geared 
to 
helping 
Argentina 
tackle 
these 
challenges 
by 
(i) 
assisting 
efforts 
focused 
on 
the 
longer-term 
development 
agenda 
and 
also 
(ii) 
laying 
the 
ground 
work 
for 
a 
dialogue 
and 
program 
with 
the 
forthcoming 
administration. 
In 
addition, the 
Bank 
has 
been 
pro-actively 
responding 
to 
urgent 
needs 
to 
address 
the 
social 
emergency 
situation, 
and 
to 
requests 
by 
the 
Government 
for 
technical 
assistance 
in 
areas 
ranging 
from 
financial 
sector, 
corporate restructuring, 
and 
renegotiations 
of 
concession contracts 
in 
infrastructure 
and 
public 
services. 
26. 
The 
Bank’s 
response 
to 
the 
social 
emergency 
situation 
has 
included 
two 
major 
steps 
thus 
far, 
In 
2002, 
US$270 
million 
were 
re-allocated 
from 
existing 
projects 
to 
emergency 
social 
programs, 
including 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nutrition, 
health, 
and 
education. 
Second, 
in 
January 2003 the 
Board 
approved 
the 
Heads 
of 
Household 
loan 
for 
US$600 
million, 
which 
has 
already 
been made 
effective 
and 
is 
disbursing 
as 
pr~grmed.~ 
27. 
including 32 
investment 
loans 
and 
adjustment 
operations. 
Investment 
operations 
have 
undisbursed 
balances 
of 
about 
US$1.6 
billion. 
Within 
this 
category, 
the 
most 
recent 
portfolio 
review identified 
the 
potential 
of 
monthly 
disbursements 
of 
US$40 million, 
compared 
to 
US$14 
million 
in 
2002. 
We 
are 
currently 
working 
with 
the 
Government 
to 
expedite the 
implementation 
of 
this 
portfolio. 
To 
help 
support economic recovery, 
the 
Bank 
has 
been restructuring 
its 
adjustment 
and 
investment 
loans 
portfolio. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
joint 
portfolio 
review 
with 
the 
Government have 
clearly 
revealed 
how 
Bank 
projects 
and 
their potential 
disbursements 
could be 
helpfbl 
in 
addressing 
different 
aspects 
of 
the 
current 
crisis. 
It 
also 
underlined 
that 
the crisis 
has 
had 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
the performance 
of 
the 
portfolio, 
with 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
projects 
As 
of 
mid-March, 
2003, 
the

of

the need 
to 
redress 
this 
deterioration 
of 
the 
portfolio 
the 
Bank 
has 
made 
a series 
of 
concrete 
proposals, 
including 
appropriate 
levels 
of 
budgetary 
resources 
to 
accommodate the 
execution 
of 
Bank 
projects that 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
overall fiscal 
program. 
Particular 
emphasis 
was 
laid 
on 
the 
Bank’s 
potential 
support 
of 
the 
Government’s 
emergency 
program 
that 
seeks 
to 
deal 
with 
the serious 
poverty 
situation 
in 
the country.

With 
regard 
to 
the current 
adjustment

portfolio, 
a 
Structural 
Adjustment 
Loan, 
and 
three 
Provincial 
Reform 
Adjustment Loans 
to 
the 
provinces 
of 
Santa 
Fey 
Cordoba, 
and 
Catamarca are 
under implementation. 
The 
final 
tranche 
of 
the 
SAL 
disbursed 
in 
the 
third 
week 
of 
April 
2003, 
and 
the 
second 
and 
third 
tranches 
of 
the 
Cordoba 
reform 
loan 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
disbursed. 
The 
remaining 
tranches 
of 
the 
three 
provincial 
operations 
are 
expected 
to 
disburse 
during 
the 
next few 
months, subject 
to 
compliance 
with 
pending 
conditions. 
These 
loans 
are 
considered 
relevant 
in 
supporting 
the 
recovery 
of 
the 
national 
and 
provincial 
economies.

would 
help 
the government 
in 
addressing 
its 
large 
financing 
needs, 
including 
debt service

the 
World

Such 
disbursements 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
incoming 
Government’s 
ability 
to 
prepare 
in 
a 
timely 
fashion 
new 
operations, 
and 
implement 
the 
agreed 
actions 
of 
the 
new 
and

estimate 
that

could 
accelerate

authorities 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
the 
financial 
sector, 
corporate restructuring, 
and 
the 
renegotiation 
of 
public 
services contracts. 
For 
example, 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Argentina 
government, 
a 
joint 
Bank-IMF 
mission, 
led 
by 
the 
Bank, 
visited 
Argentina 
in 
February 
2003, 
to review 
progress 
in 
the 
renegotiation 
of 
public 
service 
concessions, 
assess 
the current 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
which 
the renegotiation 
is 
being 
conducted, 
and 
to 
assess 
the 
key 
financial 
indicators 
of 
the 
concessionaires, 
the 
social 
impact 
of 
changes 
in 
tariffs, 
and 
the 
application 
of 
social tariffs. 
In 
addition 
to lending 
operations, 
the 
Bank 
has 
remained actively 
engaged 
with

Beyond 
such 
technical 
assistance, 
and 
in 
anticipation 
of 
a 
dialogue 
with 
the 
forthcoming 
administration, 
the 
Bank 
is 
preparing 
economic 
and 
sector 
work 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas, 
focusing 
primarily 
on 
the 
themes 
of 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Reports 
currently 
under 
preparation 
include 
those 
on 
the 
Sources 
of 
Economic 
Growth, 
a 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review, 
a 
Health 
Sector 
strategy, 
and 
a 
Poverty 
Update. 
All 
these 
reports 
will 
be 
contributing 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
Policy 
Notes, 
which 
we 
intend 
to 
share 
and 
discuss 
with 
the 
new 
administration 
upon 
assumption 
of 
power. 
Furthermore, 
this 
work 
is 
expected 
to 
guide 
the 
Bank’s 
future 
strategic 
direction 
in 
Argentina. 
32. 
Charting 
the 
road 
beyond this transition 
period 
will 
have 
to 
be 
discussed 
with 
the 
incoming 
administration 
in 
the 
context 
of 
preparing 
a 
new 
CAS. 
The 
challenges 
ahead 
are 
significant, 
and 
the 
Bank 
is 
expected 
to 
remain 
actively 
engaged 
in 
Argentina’s 
stabilization 
and 
recovery 
phases, 
through 
ES

provision 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
adjustment

operations. 
Key 
areas 
for 
reform 
under the 
new 
administration, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
areas 
just 
mentioned, 
would 
include reforms 
supporting 
an 
enhanced 
investment 
climate, 
comprehensive 
debt 
restructuring,

group 
of 
investment 
officers, 
based 
in 
Buenos 
Aires, 
with 
strong expertise 
in 
the 
financial 
sector, 
privatized 
service companies 
and 
workouts 
to 
handle 
the 
crisis 
proactively 
from 
the 
field. 
Under 
the leadership 
of 
this 
team, 
IFC 
is 
working 
closely 
with 
all 
the 
clients 
to 
help 
them 
overcome the 
crisis. 
IFC 
has 
been 
asked 
to 
take 
a 
lead 
role 
in 
some 
important 
restructurings 
as 
chair 
of 
the 
creditors committee. 
As 
the 
renegotiation 
of 
utilities 
contracts 
and 
reform 
of 
the 
banking 
sector 
progress, 
IFC 
expects 
to 
be 
actively 
involved 
through 
its 
important 
exposure 
in 
the 
banking 
and 
utilities 
sector 
to 
seek 
fair 
outcomes 
in 
the ensuing 
restructuring 
process. 
As 
of 
end 
February 
2003, 
IFC’s 
total 
disbursed 
loan 
portfolio 
amounts 
to 
US$S59 
million 
and 
the 
equity 
exposure 
amounts 
to 
US$138 
million. 
Early 
in 
2002, 
IFC’s 
Management incorporated 
the 
Argentina Recovery 
Team, 
a 
small 
34. 
sector 
to 
take 
full 
advantage 
of 
the devaluation. 
While 
IFC 
has 
in 
other crisis 
countries 
traditionally 
sought 
to 
leverage 
its 
trade 
financing 
lines 
by 
channeling 
these 
through 
the 
financial 
sector, 
the 
uncertainty 
and 
in 
definition 
of 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Argentine financial 
sector has 
prevented 
similar 
structures 
to 
be 
set 
up 
for 
Argentina. 
IFC 
has 
therefore sought 
to provide 
immediate 
relief 
to 
some 
key 
exporters 
and 
client 
companies, 
closing 
a 
first 
operation 
in 
June 
2002 
for US$60million 
(consisting 
of 
a 
US$30m 
A 
loan 
and 
a 
US$30m 
B 
loan) 
with 
Argentina’s 
largest 
local 
exporter 
of 
oilseeds 
and 
its 
byproducts. 
It 
should 
be 
highlighted 
that 
this 
was 
the 
first 
new 
extemal financing 
for 
an 
Argentine 
company 
since 
the 
devaluation. 
IFC 
also 
obtained 
board 
approval 
in 
January 
and 
in 
February 
2003 
for 
two 
similar 
pre-export 
financing facilities 
for 
gross 
amounts 
of 
US$120 
million, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
an 
increase 
of 
US$50 
million 
for 
the 
first 
facility 
closed 
in 
June 
2002. 
IFC 
will 
also 
seek 
other 
innovative forms 
of 
providing 
support 
to 
Argentine 
large 
companies 
exporting their 
services 
abroad 
such 
as 
providing 
performance 
bonds. 
IFC 
will 
also 
continue 
to 
focus 
on 
alleviating 
the 
credit 
crunch 
that 
prevents the 
export 
35. 
IFC 
will 
also 
seek 
to 
carry out 
few 
select 
equity 
investments, 
that 
may 
or not 
be 
combined 
with 
A&B 
loans, 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
sound, 
export-driven 
companies 
with 
the 
necessary 
capital 
and 
balance 
sheet 
strength 
to 
increase 
their 
export oriented capacity 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time offering 
IFC 
upside 
potential 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
high 
risk 
of 
carrying 
such 
investments. 
Finally, 
IFC 
will 
seek 
to 
advance, 
in 
close cooperation 
with 
other 
multilaterals 
on 
the design 
and 
set-up 
of 
a 
restructuring 
fund 
to help 
restore 
the 
health 
of 
illiquid 
but 
solvent 
Argentine 
companies, 
considered 
blue 
chip 
companies 
before the 
devaluation. 
36. 
It 
should 
be 
highlighted 
that 
in 
order 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
activities 
and 
operations 
listed 
above, 
IFC 
will 
look for 
strong 
assurances 
that the 
incoming 
administration 
will 
ensure 
that 
IFC’s privileges 
and 
immunities 
continue 
to 
be 
respected 
and 
that 
any 
challenge thereto that 
might 
affect 
its 
operations 
in

will 
be 
solved 
promptly 
and satisfactorily.

In 
FY02, 
under Specific Claims 
Reserves, 
MIGA 
introduced 
a 
new 
account 
named 
Special 
Reserves, 
for 
contracts 
in 
countries 
that 
are 
experiencing heightened 
risk 
and 
for 
which 
MIGA 
Management believes 
that 
claim notification 
may be 
imminent.  Various Argentina 
contracts 
were 
considered 
for 
such 
an 
account, 
so 
that 
at 
the 
end 
of 
FY02 
this 
reserve account 
stood 
at 
US$44.4

and 
stood 
at 
US$39.7

at

of

(including 
one 
formal

mentioned 
below).

and 
other developments 
in 
Argentina, 
and 
has 
maintained 
contact 
with 
guaranteed 
investors 
as 
well 
as 
with 
pertinent 
Argentine 
authorities. 
Out 
of 
24 
guarantees 
issued 
before 
the 
crisis 
started, 
MIGA 
received 
notification 
of 
only 
one 
claim, 
with 
a 
maximum liability 
of 
US$5 
million 
for 
an 
infrastructure project. 
The 
claim, 
based 
on 
expropriation, was 
filed 
on 
July 
18,2002. 
According 
to 
MIGA’s 
contract 
of 
guarantee, 
payment 
of 
a 
claim 
may be 
made 
by 
MIGA 
after 
a 
waiting 
period 
(365 
days 
in 
cases 
of 
expropriation) 
has 
elapsed, 
and 
MIGA 
has 
determined 
that 
it 
is 
liable 
to 
pay 
a 
claim. 
In 
addition, 
MIGA 
has 
a 
60-day 
period 
to 
pay 
a 
claim 
since 
its 
determination 
of 
liability. 
To 
date, 
no 
claims have been 
paid 
by 
MIGA. 
Since 
December 
2001, 
MIGA 
has 
been 
closely 
monitoring 
all 
relevant 
legal 
measures 
40. 
Up 
until 
the 
present, 
four 
contracts 
of 
guarantee 
have been 
cancelled. 
Thus, 
MIGA’s 
portfolio 
currently 
is 
comprised 
of 
20 
projects.  Some investors 
have 
communicated 
to 
MIGA 
that 
they have suffered 
losses 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
measures 
implemented 
by 
the Government 
of 
Argentina 
since 
December 
2001, 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
MIGA 
may 
receive 
other 
claims 
through 
the 
course 
of 
this 
calendar year. 
41. 
MIGA 
remains 
open 
for 
projects 
in 
Argentina 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
issue 
guarantees 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis. 
MIGA 
has 
received 
preliminary 
indications 
from 
investors 
that 
are 
exploring 
opportunities 
in 
various 
sectors 
such 
as 
mining, 
services 
and export oriented agro-industry 
and 
industry.

THE 
GOVERNMENT’S 
TRANSITION 
PROGRAM 
42. 
3), 
the 
Government detailed 
its 
short-term 
transitional 
program 
aimed 
at 
maintaining 
macroeconomic stability,  strengthening economic 
recovery 
and 
monetary policy, 
and 
dealing 
with 
the 
social 
emergency, 
during 
the 
upcoming 
political 
transition. 
The 
transition program 
seeks 
to 
build 
a 
bridge 
to 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
fimdamental 
reforms 
that 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
developed after the elections 
and 
that 
is 
needed 
to 
tackle 
the 
deep 
structural 
problems 
that 
confront 
Argentina. 
According 
to 
the 
Government, 
the 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
transitional 
program 
are 
to 
ensure 
fiscal, monetary, 
and 
banking 
soundness 
and 
to 
rebuild 
domestic 
and 
foreign investor 
confidence 
by 
maintaining 
equal treatment 
of 
all 
parties, 
protecting 
contract 
rights, 
and 
defending 
the 
rule 
of 
law. 
This 
short-term 
transition program 
has 
been 
endorsed 
by 
the 
IMF. 
In 
addition, 
the Government 
designed 
an 
Emergency Social Program 
in 
response 
to 
the 
increasing 
poverty 
situation. 
The 
main 
interventions have

and 
(iii) 
provision 
of

in 
the 
health 
sector. 
43. 
The 
main 
components 
of 
the 
transitional 
program 
are: 
(i) 
the 2003 
budget, 
which 
seeks 
to 
keep 
the 
federal 
deficit 
under 
control; 
(ii) 
implementation 
of 
the 
federal-provincial 
bilateral 
pacts; 
(iii) 
a 
monetary program 
to 
maintain 
inflation 
at 
a 
low 
level; 
(iv) 
preparatory 
steps 
toward 
structural 
measures needed 
to 
strengthen 
the 
fiscal 
position 
over 
the 
medium 
term; 
(v) 
progress 
toward 
debt restructuring; 
(vi) 
a strategy 
to 
restore the 
health 
of 
the 
banking 
system; 
and 
(vii) 
ensuring 
full 
respect 
for 
the 
rights 
of 
creditors, 
restoring 
legal 
certainty, 
and 
making 
a 
start 
on 
corporate 
restructuring.

finances since 1998. 
The 
consolidated 
fiscal 
deficit 
increased 
from 
2.0 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1998 
to 
6.8 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001, 
before changing 
political 
leadership 
resorted 
to 
a 
default 
on 
Argentina’s 
internal 
and 
external obligations. 
While 
revenues, 
over 
that 
period 
leading 
to 
the 
crisis remained 
relatively 
constant 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP, 
non-interest 
expenditures 
increased 
by 
1.9 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(all 
in 
the 
pre-electoral 
period 
of 
1999), 
while 
interest payments increased 
significantly 
by 
2.8 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP, 
as 
both 
interest 
spreads 
and 
indebtedness 
grew. 
Both 
national 
and 
provincial 
finances 
faced 
similar 
difficulties. 
While 
federal 
deficits 
increased 
from 
1.3 
percent 
to 
4.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
between 
1998 
and 
2001, 
over 
the 
same 
period 
provincial 
deficits increased 
from 
0.8 
percent 
to 
2.5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
45. 
Following 
the 
default and devaluation 
of 
2002, 
in 
that 
year 
the 
consolidated 
deficit 
grew 
to 
10.3 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
but 
on 
a 
cash 
basis that 
deficit 
was 
limited 
to 
2.5 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
due 
to 
the 
non-payment 
of 
interest. 
However, 
it 
was 
not only 
the 
sharp 
increase 
in 
interest 
obligations 
that 
led to 
that 
fiscal 
outcome. 
In 
2002, 
there was a 
severe 
adjustment 
in 
non-interest 
expenditures, 
which 
fell, 
at 
the 
federal level, 
from 
18.6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
the year before, 
to 
17.1 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
in 
a 
federal 
primary 
surplus 
of 
0.7 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
and approximate 
balance 
in 
fiscal 
primary 
accounts. 
On 
the revenue 
side, 
following 
a 
precipitous decline 
in 
tax 
revenues 
in 
the 
first 
four 
months 
of 
2002 
(the 
height 
of 
the 
crisis), 
revenues 
recovered 
on 
average 
by 
a 
nominal 
52 
percent 
in 
the 
remaining 
eight 
months 
of 
the 
year. 
This 
adjustment, 
more 
than 
compensated 
for 
the 
decline 
in 
revenues, 
resulting 
46. 
Fiscal 
targets for 
2003 
aim 
to 
a further 
improvement 
in 
the 
fiscal 
accounts, 
with 
the 
federal 
primary 
surplus 
expected 
to 
increase 
to 
2.1 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
and 
provincial 
primary 
surpluses 
to 
0.6 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
For 
the 
first 
two 
months 
of 
2003, 
primary 
expenditures 
in 
real 
terms 
declined 
by 
a 
real 
22 
percent 
fiom 
the 
same 
period 
in 
2002, 
and 
a 
37 
percent 
real 
decline 
from 
January-February 
of 
200 
1. 
Nevertheless, 
to 
attain 
fiscal 
sustainability, 
Argentina’s 
primary 
surpluses 
would 
need 
to 
increase further 
in 
the 
coming 
years, 
with 
greater 
effort 
needed 
to 
improve 
revenues 
both 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
an 
economic 
recovery, 
and 
tax 
reform 
measures.

the 
lack 
of 
financing 
options 
since 
mid-200 
1 
led 
the provinces 
to 
issue quasi-monies 
(addressed 
below). 
As 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
effort 
to 
rebuild 
the 
bases 
for 
fiscal 
sustainability, 
during 
the

focused 
on

those 
of 
the

These

at 
the 
provincial 
level 
are 
being 
implemented 
via 
bilateral 
fiscal

between the Federal

For

of 
the 
PFOs 
is 
to 
secure 
a 
consistent 
improvement 
in 
fiscal 
and 
15 
Page  24
that 
purpose, 
these 
orderly financing 
agreements 
commit 
the Federal 
Government 
to 
finance 
provincial 
deficits 
(on 
a cash 
basis), 
amortizations, 
and 
in 
exceptional 
cases 
the 
payment 
of 
arrears. 
In 
turn, 
the 
provinces 
commit 
on 
specific 
targets 
for 
the 
improvement 
in 
their fiscal 
performance, non-recurrence 
to 
new 
indebtedness, 
and the 
nom-issue 
of 
quasi-monies. 
Additionally, 
provinces 
are 
subject 
to  information 
reporting 
requirements, 
and 
regular 
monitoring 
by 
federal 
officials.  Financing 
to 
the 
provinces 
would 
be 
provided 
at 
interest 
rates 
that 
range 
between 
a 
real 
2-4 
percent 
(depending 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the deficit), 
and 
will 
be 
amortized 
in 
3 
years 
with 
one 
year 
of 
grace. 
49. 
The 
PFOs 
incorporate 
penalties 
for 
non-compliance 
of 
their 
conditions. 
In 
case 
of 
non- 
compliance 
with 
quarterly 
fiscal 
targets, 
leading 
to 
the 
issue 
of 
quasi-monies, 
federal 
financing 
to 
that 
province 
is 
suspended, 
and 
additionally 
coparticipated 
funds 
are 
withheld 
to 
the amount 
of 
quasi-monies 
issued. 
If 
the 
province 
issues 
new 
debt, 
federal 
financing 
is 
again 
suspended, 
until 
the 
province 
reaches 
the 
agreed 
fiscal 
deficit 
levels. 
Should 
the 
province 
fail 
to 
provide 
required financial 
information 
on 
a 
timely 
basis, 
federal 
financing 
is 
suspended,

sixty 
percent 
of 
the 
2001 
deficits. 
In 
2002, 
17 
provinces 
signed 
PFO 
agreements, 
accounting 
for 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
2001 
deficit 
(the 
remainder 
provinces 
did 
not 
require 
financing). 
Actual 
provincial 
fiscal 
performance 
in 
2002 
was 
better 
than 
anticipated, 
with 
provinces 
broadly 
achieving 
primary 
balance 
(deficit 
of 
129 
million 
pesos), 
compared 
to 
a 
projected 
primary 
deficit 
of 
0.5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
reduction 
in 
provincial 
consolidated 
deficit 
in 
2002 
amounted 
to 
72 
percent 
of 
the 
2001’s 
deficit, 
compared 
to 
the targeted 
decline 
of 
60.5 
percent. 
The improvement 
in 
primary 
fiscal 
performance 
was 
mainly 
attributable 
to 
three 
factors, 
each 
of 
about equal 
importance 
- 
an 
increase 
in 
provincial 
own 
tax 
revenues 
(reflecting 
the 
impact 
of 
inflation), 
an 
increase 
in 
royalties 
from 
oil 
and 
hydroelectric 
production 
(reflecting the 
impact 
of 
devaluation), 
and 
a 
decline 
in 
capital 
expenditures. 
In 
addition, 
the provinces benefited 
from 
lower 
interest 
costs 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
Federal 
government 
restructuring 
most 
of 
their 
debts 
with 
commercial 
banks. 
Taking 
interest 
expenses 
into 
account, 
the 
consolidated 
overall 
provincial 
deficit 
declined 
from 
2.4 
to 
0.6 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
In 
2002, 
the 
PFO 
agreements 
included 
deficit

that 
ranged 
from

to

new 
performance 
targets 
and 
bilateral 
agreements 
for 
2003. 
The 
agreements 
would 
be 
similar 
in 
structure 
to 
the 
2002 
agreements, 
but 
the 
overarching 
fiscal objective 
for 
2003 
to 
reduce 
the 
overall 
deficit 
to 
about 
1.1 
billion 
pesos, 
by 
generating 
a 
primary 
surplus 
of 
2.1 
billion 
pesos. 
AS 
of 
April 
1 
1,2003, 
eleven 
provinces signed 
such 
bilateral 
agreements, 
accounting 
for 
95 
percent 
of 
last 
year’s 
deficit 
of 
the provinces 
with 
deficit 
(1 
10 
percent 
of 
2002 
consolidated 
fiscal 
deficit). 
These 
provinces 
are: 
Buenos 
Aires, 
Cordoba, 
Chaco, 
Formosa, 
Jujuy, 
Misiones, 
San 
Juan, 
Tucuman, 
Rio 
Negro, Mendoza, 
and 
Entre 
Rios, 
of 
which 
the 
first 
seven 
have 
already 
ratified 
these agreements 
in 
the 
local 
legislatures. 
Preliminary 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
results 
for 
2002, 
and 
targets 
for 
2003 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
following 
tables. 
On 
the basis 
of 
the 
new 
agreements, 
the eleven 
provinces 
will 
cut their overall deficits 
for 
2003 
by 
an 
additional 
5 
1 
percent, 
principally 
by 
eliminating 
their 
primary 
deficits 
(surplus 
of 
5 
10 
million 
pesos).

by 
a 
more 
fundamental 
reform 
in 
the 
federal-provincial fiscal 
relations, 
called 
coparticipacion. 
A 
new 
coparticipacion 
agreement 
will 
normalize 
on 
a 
permanent 
basis 
fiscal 
relations 
with 
the 
provinces, 
and 
will 
be 
part 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
program 
to 
be 
reached 
with 
the 
new 
administration 
following 
the 
elections 
and 
change 
in 
government. 
D. 
Addressing 
the 
Quasi-Monies Challenge 
54. 
the 
issue 
of 
quasi-monies. 
Provinces 
used 
such 
monies 
to 
pay 
wages, 
pensions 
and 
other 
expenditures, 
and 
the 
Federal 
government 
to 
settle 
minimum 
guaranteed 
revenue 
sharing 
obligations 
with 
the 
provinces. 
Quasi-monies 
are 
used 
as 
a means 
of 
exchange 
in 
various 
degrees 
according 
to 
the 
province 
of 
issue. 
Federally 
issued 
quasi-monies 
and 
those 
from 
the 
province 
of 
Buenos 
Aires 
are 
accepted 
for 
the 
settlement 
of 
federal 
tax 
obligations, 
and 
other 
financial 
transactions, 
and 
hence 
have 
greater acceptance 
as 
a means 
of 
exchange 
with 
their 
market 
value 
retaining 
approximately 
their 
nominal 
value.  Those 
of 
other 
provinces 
are 
accepted 
as 
payment 
of 
provincial 
tax 
liabilities, 
and 
hence 
their 
use 
as 
means 
of 
exchange 
are 
limited 
to 
the 
province 
of 
issue. 
Their 
limited 
use, 
and 
amounts 
issued 
by 
respective provinces, 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
trading 
of 
some 
of 
those quasi-monies 
at 
significant 
discounts. 
For 
example, 
quasi-monies 
in 
the 
province 
of 
Corrientes traded 
at 
end-February 
at 
5 
1 
percent 
of 
face 
value, 
and 
those 
of 
Entre 
Rios 
at 57 percent 
of 
face 
value 
(see 
Table 
7). 
Since mid-2001, 
12 
out 
of 
the 
24 
provinces 
and 
the Federal 
government have 
resorted 
to 
55. 
broadly 
understood, 
and 
consequently, 
with 
some 
normalcy 
returning 
in 
fiscal 
affairs, the 
authorities 
have 
expressed 
an 
interest 
in 
eliminating 
them. 
Among 
the 
drawbacks 
created 
by 
the 
issue 
of 
quasi-monies 
are 
limits 
to 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank 
to 
conduct 
monetary 
policy. 
Quasi-monies 
also create 
difficulties 
in 
fiscal 
management 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
government. 
Additionally, 
quasi-monies 
contribute 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
informal 
economy 
and 
tax 
evasion, 
and 
affect 
negatively inter-provincial 
trade. 
Finally, 
quasi-monies 
may 
unduly 
penalize 
low 
income individuals 
who 
receive 
salaries 
and 
pensions 
in 
currencies that trade at 
a 
discount. 
While 
initially 
quasi 
monies were 
issued 
to 
help 
sustain 
levels 
of 
economic 
activity, currently, 
with 
the gradual 
normalization 
of 
conditions, quasi-monies 
are 
perceived 
as 
detrimentally 
affecting 
the 
economy. 
While 
emergency 
conditions 
led 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
quasi-monies, 
their 
drawbacks 
are 
56. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2002, 
Arg$7.7 
billion 
have been 
issued 
in 
the 
form 
of 
quasi-monies, 
accounting 
for 
a 
third 
of 
currency 
in 
circulation 
(including 
quasi-monies 
in 
a 
broader 
definition 
of 
currency 
in 
circulation). 
While 
special 
banking 
accounts 
can 
be 
opened 
with 
quasi-monies, 
banks 
are 
prohibited 
from 
lending 
in 
such 
currencies, 
thus 
limiting 
their 
monetary 
impact.

The 
Program 
of 
Monetary 
Unification 
(the redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
program) 
57. 
The 
Government 
has announced a 
Program 
of 
Monetary 
Unification, through 
the 
elimination 
of 
all 
quasi-monies. 
The intent 
of 
this program 
is 
to 
redeem 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
quasi-monies 
circulating 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
forbid 
the 
fktwe 
issues 
of 
quasi-monies, 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
that the 
Central 
Bank 
will 
have 
the 
means 
of 
controlling 
more 
effectively 
the 
money 
supply, 
and preserving the value 
of 
the 
currency, 
which 
is 
the 
primary 
mission 
of 
the Central 
Bank, according 
to 
its 
Charter 
(Carta Organica). 
Additionally, 
the 
elimination 
of 
quasi 
monies 
would 
have 
positive 
distributional 
consequences, 
as 
low 
income 
pensioners 
and 
public 
employees 
are 
the 
main primary 
recipients 
of 
quasi 
monies trading 
at 
a 
discount.

March 
28,2003 
(Decree 
No 
743) 
creating the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program, 
authorizing 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
of 
ten 
provinces: 
Buenos 
Aires, 
Catamarca, 
Cordoba, Corrientes, 
Chaco, 
Entre 
%os, 
Formosa, 
La 
Rioja, 
Mendoza, 
and 
Tucuman. 
These 
provinces have 
approximately 
4.5 
billion 
quasi-monies 
in 
circulation. 
Subsequently, 
on 
April 
1 
1 
, 
the Federal 
Government 
published 
the 
regulatory note 
on 
this 
decree 
(Resolution 
266), 
clarifying 
procedural 
steps 
for 
its 
implementation. 
As 
of 
April 
29,2003, 
according 
to 
the 
Government, 
the 
provinces 
of 
Cordoba, Santa 
Fey 
and 
Formosa 
had formally 
adhered 
to 
the 
redemption 
program.  Other 
provinces 
(including Tucuman 
and 
Chaco) 
were 
in 
the 
process 
of 
obtaining 
the 
necessary 
legal 
authorization 
for 
adhering 
to 
the 
program 
as 
well. 
The 
Federal Government 
has 
issued 
an 
emergency 
decree 
(carrying 
the force 
of 
Law) 
on 
19 
Page  28

266) 
The 
exchange 
of 
pesos 
for 
provincial 
quasi-currencies 
will 
generate 
a 
debt 
to 
the 
provinces 
with 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
with 
the 
latter 
extending 
pesos 
in 
exchange 
for 
a 
loan 
to 
the 
provinces. 
In 
tum, 
the 
Federal Government 
will 
borrow 
the 
pesos 
from 
the 
Central 
Bank 
to 
execute 
this 
operation, 
in 
exchange 
for 
new 
bonds 
to 
be 
issued 
for 
that 
purpose 
(peso 
BODEN 
2007, 
and 
dollar 
BODEN 
2012). 
According 
to 
the 
issued 
decree, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
will 
receive 
such 
bonds 
at 
market 
value, 
as 
prescribed 
in 
the 
Central Bank’s 
charter, 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
net 
worth 
of 
that institution. 
According to 
the issued 
decree, 
the cost 
of 
that exchange/program 
will 
be 
bome 
by 
the 
provinces exclusively 
and 
in 
its 
entirety. 
Provinces 
will 
assume 
the 
servicing 
and 
amortization 
of 
their 
assumed 
loan 
from 
the Federal 
Government 
for 
the 
same 
amount 
and 
in 
the 
same 
terms the Federal Government issued 
BODENs 
to 
the 
Central 
Bank. 
Redemption Mechanism 
for 
provincial 
quasi-monies 
(under 
Decree 743 
and 
Resolution 
60. 
obligatory 
bullet 
provincial 
bond 
maturing 
in 
2006 
which would 
not 
pay 
interest 
and 
cannot 
be 
used 
as 
a means 
of 
exchange 
(Le. 
cancel 
provincial 
taxes 
or 
become 
another 
form 
of 
quasi- 
monies). 
The 
inferior quality 
of 
this 
bond 
is 
a 
key 
incentive 
for 
quasi-money 
holders 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
exchange. 
The 
issue 
and servicing 
of 
the 
BODENs to 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
new 
loans 
to 
the provinces, 
and 
the 2006 
residual 
bond, 
will 
affect the 
finances 
of 
the 
Federal 
and 
provincial 
governments, 
and 
authorities 
will 
need 
to 
make 
appropriate 
budgetary 
allocations. 
For 
holders 
of 
quasi-monies 
not 
participating 
in 
the 
exchange, 
they 
will 
be 
issued 
an 
6 
1. 
auction 
mechanism 
to 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
Central 
Bank 
but 
managed 
by 
and 
under 
the 
full 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy. 
This 
mechanism 
- 
is 
detailed 
in 
Resolution 
266 
issued 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
) 
The 
auction 
for 
all 
quasi 
monies 
in 
a 
province 
will 
take 
place 
the 
same 
date, 
and 
each 
provincial 
bond 
will 
carry 
its 
own 
price 
of 
exchange. 
The 
exchange 
value 
of 
quasi-monies 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
marketplace, 
through 
an 
62. 
January 
2003 
market 
price 
&e. 
prior 
to 
the 
announcement 
of 
this 
program). 
While 
a 
reference 
price 
will 
determine 
the 
ceiling price 
for 
the 
auction, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
used 
as 
the 
exchange 
price, 
since 
it 
is 
not 
a 
price 
established 
in 
an 
organized 
exchange (such 
as 
a 
stock 
exchange), 
and 
therefore 
the 
authorities 
believe 
that a 
market 
price 
needs 
to 
be 
established 
through 
an 
auction. 
With 
an 
initial 
ceiling 
in 
the 
value 
of 
quasi-monies 
(the 
reference 
price), 
the authorities 
will 
restrict 
the 
quantity 
of 
quasi-monies 
that 
can 
be 
redeemed 
through 
the 
auction 
to 
60 
percent 
of 
the outstanding stock 
of 
quasi-monies 
- 
this 
is 
expected 
to 
prevent the 
price 
from 
reaching 
the 
reference 
price/ceiling.  Once 
the 
price 
and 
quantity offers 
are received, 
the authorities 
will 
establish the 
cut-off 
price, 
taking 
into 
account 
market 
indicators 
and 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
of 
the 
province. 
All 
offers 
below 
the 
cutoff 
price 
- 
as 
long 
as 
total 
offers 
of 
each 
quasi-money 
don’t 
exceed 
60 
percent 
of 
the outstanding stock 
of 
the 
respective quasi-money 
- 
will 
be 
accepted. 
Offers 
that 
were 
rejected 
can 
still 
be 
exchanged 
for 
pesos 
at 
a 
price 
set 
to 
be 
5 
percent 
below 
the 
cutoff 
price 
of 
the auction. 
Public 
institutions 
and 
minority 
holders 
will 
be 
allowed 
to 
redeem 
the 
quasi-monies 
at 
the 
cutoff 
price 
of 
the 
auction. 
Only 
holders 
of 
public 
sector salaries 
and 
pensions 
paid 
in 
January, 
2003 
will 
be 
able 
to 
exchange 
their 
quasi-money 
holdings 
at 
par. 
Before 
the 
auction, 
a 
reference 
price 
will 
be 
set 
for 
these currencies,  i.e. 
that

of 
the 
outstanding stock 
of

To 
sum 
up, 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
will 
consist 
of 
the 
following

a

where the

price 
will 
be 
set 
at 
5 
percent 
lower 
than 
the 
price 
established 
in 
the 
first 
auction; 
a 
tranche 
established 
for 
the 
federal, 
provincial, 
and 
municipal 
authorities 
holding 
quasi-monies, 
where 
the 
redemption 
price 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
that 
established 
in 
the 
auction; 
a 
tranche 
for 
minority 
holders 
who 
did 
not 
participate 
in 
the 
auction, 
but 
could 
exchange 
up 
to 
500 
pesos 
at 
the 
price 
established 
in 
the 
auction; 
and 
a 
tranche 
for 
small 
holders 
who 
received 
public 
sector salaries 
and 
pensions, 
who 
will 
be 
able 
to 
exchange 
their 
holdings 
of 
quasi-monies 
at 
nominal 
value 
(100 
percent 
of 
face value). 
The 
amounts 
in 
this 
last 
tranche exchanged 
at 
nominal 
value, 
will 
have 
to 
be 
deposited 
in 
special 
quasi-monies 
accounts, 
and 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
the last 
monthly 
payment received 
by 
these 
individuals 
in 
such 
bonds.

Procedural 
steps 
in 
the implementation 
of 
this 
program: 
Decree 
743 
establishing the 
Program 
of 
Monetary 
Unification 
has 
been issued 
on 
March 
28,2003. 
Regulatory note 
(Resolution 
266)of 
this 
decree 
has been 
published 
on 
April 
1 1 
, 
2003. 
To 
participate 
in 
the program, 
provinces 
will 
have 
up 
to 
ten 
working 
days (that 
is, 
to 
April 
29th 
) 
following 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
regulatory note 
to 
issue a 
provincial 
norm, 
ratified 
by 
local 
legislatures 
(if 
required 
by 
the 
province) 
to 
adhere 
to 
the federal 
decree 
in 
all 
its 
requirements. 
The 
norm 
will 
also 
provide 
all 
relevant 
information for 
this 
exchange 
(from 
outstanding amounts 
of 
quasi-monies, 
special 
accounts 
available 
etc.), 
approve 
the 
guarantee 
of 
the 
loan 
to 
be 
extended 
by 
the Federal Government 
by 
coparticipated 
funds, 
and 
commit 
to 
the 
issue 
of 
a 
provincial 
bond, 
maturing 
in 
2006, 
for 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
remaining 
quasi-monies 
that 
may 
not 
be 
exchanged 
through 
the 
auction 
process. 
Subsequently, 
the 
Federal Government 
will 
have 
to 
issue a 
presidential 
decree 
accepting the 
provincial 
agreement, 
establish 
the 
maximum 
amount 
to 
be 
exchanged 
per 
province, and 
authorizing 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
to 
adjust 
its 
budgetary 
allocations 
to 
accommodate 
this 
transaction. 
The auction 
will 
also 
have 
to 
take 
place 
within 
the 
following 
ten 
working 
days 
after 
the 
provincial 
norm 
was 
send 
for 
approval 
by 
the Federal 
Government. 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
subsequently 
exchanges 
its 
bonds 
with 
pesos 
with 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
signs 
agreements 
between 
the 
Federal government 
and 
the 
participating 
provinces 
for 
the 
repayment 
of

On 
the 
first 
week 
of 
April 
2003, 
the 
Federal Government submitted 
to 
the 
National 
Congress 
draft legislation 
expanding 
the 
coverage 
of 
the 
Program 
for 
Monetary Unification 
to 
its 
own 
quasi-monies 
instrument, LECOPs, thus 
completing 
the 
coverage 
of 
this 
program 
to 
all 
quasi-monies. 
The 
same 
legislation 
proposed 
the 
easing 
of 
financing 
terms 
to 
the provinces, 
by 
changing 
the 
Central Bank’s 
Charter, 
in 
order 
to 
allow, 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
its 
acceptance 
of 
BODENs 
at 
nominal 
value, 
thus 
simultaneously 
reducing 
the 
cost 
to 
the 
provinces, 
which 
will 
be 
servicing their 
loans 
to 
the 
Government 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
carrying 
BODENs. 
So 
far 
the 
Law 
has 
only 
received 
a general 
approval 
by 
Congress 
but 
with 
the 
specifics 
not 
yet 
approved 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that the 
required approval 
would 
occur over the 
coming 
weeks. 
66. 
will 
be 
delayed 
in 
Congress, 
the 
Government 
issued 
a decree 
- 
Decreto 
de 
Necesidad 
y 
Urgencia 
No. 
957/03(with 
virtually 
the 
same 
legal 
status 
as 
a 
law) 
-which 
allows 
the 
Government 
to 
rescue 
all 
the 
LECOPs 
at 
par 
without 
need 
to 
go 
through 
an 
auction 
process. 
The 
LECOPs 
will 
be 
rescued 
through 
the 
tax 
agency, 
AFIP, 
as 
it 
is 
estimated 
that every 
month 
about 
Arg$500-600 
million 
of 
LECOPS 
are 
used 
to 
pay 
national 
taxes. 
Since 
about Arg$2,800 
million 
from 
a 
total 
outstanding stock 
of 
Arg$3,300 
million 
of 
LECOPs 
were issued 
by 
the 
Federal 
Government 
for 
direct 
expenditures, 
and 
the remainder 
were 
provided 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
loan 
to 
provinces, 
the 
decree 
authorizes the 
rescue 
of 
the direct 
issue.

the

will 
be 
made 
with

which 
will 
be 
obtained 
from 
the Central 
Bank 
in

for 
BODENs

It 
is 
estimated 
that

about 
6

by

may

Guaranteeing 
the 
future 
non-issue 
of 
quasi-monies. 
This 
is 
likely 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
aspects 
of 
this 
operation. 
To 
secure 
that 
outcome, 
the authorities 
are 
seeking 
bilateral 
agreements 
which 
commit 
provinces 
not 
to 
issue quasi 
monies. 
In 
case 
of 
non-compliance, 
under 
the 
proposed 
agreement, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
will 
impose 
sanctions 
by 
withholding 
the 
equivalent amount 
of 
issue 
from 
coparticipacion 
transfers. 
Additionally, 
provinces 
participating 
in 
this 
exchange 
will 
have 
also 
signed 
PFO 
agreements 
(described 
above), 
securing 
a 
fiscal 
performance 
that obviates 
the 
need 
for 
fiscal 
deficits 
which 
lack 
financing 
(see 
Table 
8). 
Assessment 
68. 
they 
are 
secured 
with 
guarantees 
that 
no 
new 
quasi-monies 
will 
be 
issued 
in 
the 
hture. 
The 
benefits 
of 
monetary 
unification 
include 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
ability 
of 
the Central 
Bank. 
to 
conduct 
monetary 
policy. 
It 
would 
also 
eliminate 
the deleterious 
impact 
on 
commerce 
between 
provinces 
(since quasi-currencies 
are 
not 
exchanged 
among 
provinces), 
and 
reduce 
newly 
created 
incentives 
for 
economic 
activity 
to 
be 
conducted 
in 
the 
informal 
sector. 
The 
enhancement 
of 
formal 
activities 
would 
improve 
fiscal 
performance 
at 
the 
provincial 
at 
the 
provincial 
and 
Federal 
levels, 
impacting positively 
the 
overall 
level 
of 
economic 
activity. 
The 
varying 
discount 
at 
which 
some 
quasi-monies trade 
impairs 
the 
attribute 
of 
money 
as 
a 
store 
of 
value, 
and 
thereby 
increase 
transaction 
costs 
and 
uncertainty. 
The 
elimination 
of 
quasi-monies 
would 
have 
a 
beneficial distributional 
impact, 
since, 
in 
cases 
where 
they 
were 
trading 
at 
a 
discount, 
it 
was 
usually 
low 
income 
pensioners 
and 
public 
employees 
who 
received 
payment 
in 
such 
debased 
currencies. 
Finally, 
since 
some 
quasi-monies 
amortize over 
the short 
term, 
their 
rescue 
and 
replacement 
by 
a 
bond 
of 
lengthier 
maturity 
eliminates 
a 
substantial 
and 
potentially 
costly 
debt 
refinancing 
risk. 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
proposed monetary 
unification 
are 
well 
recognized, 
particularly 
if 
69. 
the 
transaction assuming 
BODENs 
are 
valued 
at 
market 
prices. 
The 
Federal Government 
will 
be 
issuing 
debt, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
BODENs 
at 
market 
prices 
to 
purchase 
pesos 
from 
the 
Central 
Bank. 
Part 
of 
it 
is 
in 
recognition 
of 
existing 
federal debt 
(about 2.8 
billion 
of 
LECOPs), 
and 
the 
remainder 
would 
be 
debt issued 
to 
rescue 
the 
quasi-monies 
issued 
by 
the provinces 
(about 
4.4 
billion 
excluding 
Treasury holdings). 
Since the 
BODENs 
will 
be 
valued 
at 
market 
prices, 
and 
since 
the 
average 
discount 
on 
BODENs 
is 
higher 
than 
the 
average 
discount 
of 
quasi-monies, 
there 
would 
be 
an 
increase 
in 
overall public 
indebtedness 
estimated 
at 
about 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(assuming 
only 
the 
BODEN 
2012 
is 
accepted, 
that 
the 
market 
value 
of 
BODEN 
is 
54 
percent, 
and 
the

discount 
of

is

Debt 
implications 
of 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
LECOPs, 
since 
they 
will 
be 
rescued 
at par, 
if 
the 
BODENs 
issued 
carry 
an 
average 
50 
percent 
discount, a 
total 
of 
6.6 
billion 
pesos 
of 
BODENs 
will 
have 
to 
be 
issued 
to 
rescue 
3.3 
billion 
pesos 
of 
outstanding 
LECOPs. 
Assuming 
that 
quasi-monies 
are 
trading 
on 
average at 
95 
percent 
of 
face value, 
and provinces 
accept 
only

denominated

the 
equivalent 
debt 
to 
be 
issued 
would be

approved, gross 
federal 
debt 
will 
increase 
only 
by 
the 
amount 
of 
pesos 
exchanged 
for 
quasi-monies (around 
1.6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
since 
in 
this 
case 
only 
peso 
BODENs 
201

will 
be 
issued). 
In 
addition, 
however, 
there 
might 
be 
additional liabilities 
to 
the Federal 
Government, 
as 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Cordoba 
supplementary 
agreement 
(Convenio 
Compkmentario) 
to 
the general 
agreement 
for 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies, 
attests. 
That 
agreement 
indicates that 
should the 
Law 
mentioned 
above 
is 
not 
approved, 
the 
Federal Government 
could be 
extending 
terms 
to 
Cordoba 
for 
the 
repayment 
of 
its 
loan, 
with 
the 
Federal 
Government 
thus 
sharing 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
redemption 
program 
with 
the 
province.  Should 
such 
agreements 
extend 
to 
other provinces, 
the cost 
sharing 
of 
this program 
with 
the Federal Government 
would 
increase. 
70. 
Regarding 
interest 
service, 
for 
the Federal 
Government 
the 
net 
servicing 
of 
debt 
corresponding 
to 
the 
redemption 
of 
provincial 
quasi-monies, 
would 
be 
zero, 
since debt 
servicing 
of 
equivalent 
BODENs to 
the 
Central 
Bank 
should 
be 
matched, 
under 
the terms 
of 
the issued 
decree, 
by 
the 
servicing 
of 
the loans 
issued 
to 
the provinces 
(loans 
to 
the 
provinces 
carry 
the 
same 
terms 
as 
BODENs). 
However, 
the 
Federal Government 
will 
need 
to 
service 
BODENs 
for 
the equivalent 
of 
2.8 
billion 
of 
its 
own 
LECOPs 
( 
while 
BODENs 
carry 
interest 
coupons, 
the 
LECOPs 
do 
not). 
71. 
prices 
in 
exchange 
for 
the 
issue 
of 
pesos, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
would 
not be 
incurring 
any 
costs 
with 
this 
transaction, 
and 
could 
benefit 
from 
the seignorage 
from 
the 
new 
issue 
of 
pesos created. 
Its 
net 
worth 
can even 
improve 
if 
the 
market price 
of 
BODENs 
increases 
(or 
decline, otherwise). 
In 
case 
the 
Law 
authorizing 
the 
Central 
Bank’s 
acceptance 
of 
BODEN 
at 
face 
value 
is 
passed, 
the 
Central 
Bank 
will 
incur 
as 
an 
accounting 
cost 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
market value 
of 
BODEN 
issued 
and 
the amount 
of 
pesos issued. 
In 
such a 
case, 
based 
on 
standard 
accounting 
practices, 
the 
net 
worth 
of 
the 
Central 
bank 
could 
be 
impacted 
negatively,  even 
if 
the 
Law 
authorizes 
the 
Central 
Bank 
to 
recognize 
BODENs 
at face 
value. 
The Central 
Bank 
estimates 
that 
any 
such 
once 
and 
for all 
loss 
would 
be 
more 
than 
fully 
compensated 
by 
extraordinary 
profits 
generated 
in 
2002 
from 
the 
revaluation 
of 
their 
international 
reserves 
(following 
the 
peso’s devaluation). 
On 
the other 
hand, 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
would 
enable 
them 
to 
regain 
full 
control 
of 
monetary 
policy. 
Regarding 
the 
finances 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
with 
the placement 
of 
BODENs 
at 
market 
72. 
For 
the provinces, 
financial 
consequences 
could 
be 
significant. 
Given 
that 
BODENs 
are 
trading 
at 
deep 
discounts 
(in 
mid-April 
the 
dollar 
BODEN 
2012 
was 
54 
percent 
of 
face 
value, 
and 
the 
peso 
BODEN 
2007 
was 
80 
percent 
of 
face 
value), 
and 
under the 
scenario 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank 
receiving 
BODEN 
at 
market 
value, 
the 
nominal 
cost 
to 
provinces 
could be 
significant, 
with 
their 
new 
debt 
in 
BODEN 
exceeding the 
nominal 
value 
of 
issued 
quasi-monies 
(except 
in 
the 
few 
provinces 
in 
which 
the discount 
on 
their 
quasi-monies 
may 
exceed 
the discount 
of 
the 
BODEN 
chosen). 
In 
addition, 
since 
the 
quasi-monies bear 
no 
interest 
or 
carry 
a 
very 
low 
interest 
rate, 
the 
exchange 
of 
BODENs 
for 
quasi-monies 
will 
imply 
a 
sizable 
increase 
in 
interest 
payments 
(there 
is 
an 
interest 
effect 
and 
a 
higher-principal 
effect). 
One 
way 
of 
valuing 
the 
impact 
of 
servicing the 
new 
obligations 
by 
the provinces, 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
their 
share 
of 
coparticipated 
hnds 
received 
from 
the 
federal authorities, since the 
servicing 
of 
the 
new 
debt 
pesos. 
Given 
that 
LECOPs 
are 
already 
computed 
as 
public 
debt 
(whereas 
the 
other quasi-monies 
are 
not) the 
overall 
increase 
in 
indebtedness 
would be 
around 
10 
billion 
pesos, 
or 
2.7 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
24 
Page  33
will 
be 
guaranteed 
by 
the receipt 
of 
coparticipated 
hds. 
According to 
official 
estimates, 
the 
provinces 
of 
Buenos 
Aires 
and 
Cordoba 
will 
need 
to 
devote 
close 
to 
a 
third 
and 
a 
quarter 
of 
those 
revenues 
respectively over 
the 
next few 
years 
for 
the 
servicing 
of 
these 
new 
obligations. 
Other 
provinces 
will 
need 
to 
devote 
lesser 
but 
significant 
proportions 
of 
their 
coparticipated 
revenues 
for 
this 
operation 
(Corrientes 
about 17 
percent, 
Entre 
Rios 
between 
14 
and 
15 
percent, 
and 
others 
by 
declining 
shares). 
Given 
that 
coparticipated 
funds 
account 
the 
majority 
of 
fiscal 
revenues 
for 
most 
provinces, such 
costs 
could 
become 
a 
determining 
factor 
in 
their 
decision 
to 
participate. 
73. 
The monetary 
and 
inflationary 
consequences 
of 
the proposed 
redemption 
are 
of 
limited 
significance 
(a) 
because 
quasi 
monies 
are 
already 
part 
of 
the 
monetary 
base 
- 
the so-called 
expanded 
monetary 
base 
as 
agreed 
in 
the 
IMF 
program 
- 
, 
and 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi 
monies 
are 
contemplated 
to 
be 
done 
at 
market 
rates; 
and 
(b) 
under current 
market 
conditions 
-with 
virtually 
no 
new 
lending 
in 
aggregate 
- 
the 
multiplier 
effect 
which 
otherwise 
may 
be 
created 
from 
switching 
from 
quasi-monies 
which 
cannot 
be 
onlend 
in 
the 
banking 
system, 
to 
pesos, 
which 
can, 
is 
insignificant. 
Note 
that 
(a) 
implies 
in 
fact 
that 
some 
contraction 
of 
the expanded 
monetary 
base 
will 
occur 
since 
the discount 
implies 
that a 
smaller amount 
of 
pesos 
will 
replace 
the 
nominal 
value 
of 
quasi-monies 
- 
this 
is 
estimated 
at 
around 
$ 
300 
million 
assuming 
an 
average 
7 
percent discount 
on 
quasi-monies 
(excluding 
the 
LECOPS). 
It 
may 
be 
argued 
however 
that 
quasi-monies 
rescued 
at 
par 
may 
have 
some 
expansionary 
impact 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
are 
held 
involuntarily 
- 
as 
they can 
be 
rescued 
at 
par 
there 
could 
be 
an 
excess 
supply 
of 
base 
money. 
While 
parity 
may 
suggest 
that 
quasi-monies 
are 
not 
held 
involuntarily, 
the fact that 
some quasi- 
monies 
bear an interest 
coupon 
(like 
the 
Patacones) 
may 
indicate 
that 
true 
demand 
for 
money 
may 
be 
less 
than 
demand 
for 
the 
same 
nominal 
amount 
of 
quasi-monies. 
74. 
may be 
reluctant 
to 
subscribe 
to 
the 
exchange; 
so 
far 
one 
province 
(representing 
15 
percent 
of 
provincial 
quasi-monies) 
has 
firmly 
committed 
to 
the 
exchange. 
While 
the 
potential 
economic 
benefits 
for 
the 
provinces 
are 
large, 
so 
can 
be 
the 
financial 
costs. 
The 
enactment 
of 
the 
decree 
No. 
957/03 
authorizing 
the 
rescue 
of 
the 
LECOPs, 
however, 
would 
allow 
the 
redemption 
of 
45 
percent 
of 
quasi-monies 
in 
circulation. 
If 
the 
Law 
authorizing 
the Central 
Bank 
to 
take 
BODENs 
at 
face 
value 
is 
approved, 
the 
incentives 
for 
the 
provinces 
to

will 
be

enhanced.

social 
spending 
was 
not 
protected 
from 
cuts. 
Indeed, there 
was sizable co-movement, 
with 
indications 
that 
(if 
anything) 
social 
spending 
was 
more 
volatile 
than 
other types 
of 
spending. 
By 
contrast, 
non-social 
spending was better 
protected. 
There was 
actually 
a 
fall 
in 
the 
share 
of 
social 
spending 
during 
fiscal 
contractions. 
Both 
social 
assistance 
and 
work 
fare 
programs 
had 
a 
high 
elasticity 
to 
a 
fall 
in 
total 
spending. 
During 
this 
period 
targeted 
social 
spending 
was 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
fiscal 
contraction. 
So, 
the 
evidence 
is 
that 
in 
the 
past the 
poor 
were 
not 
protected 
from 
fiscal 
contraction. 
This 
changed 
in 
the 
period 
2002-3, 
during 
the 
sharp 
economic 
downturn 
that accompanied the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
convertibility 
plan 
in 
early 
January 
2002. 
This 
was 
a 
clear 
demonstration 
of 
the 
high 
priority 
the 
Government 
of 
Argentina 
gave 
to 
addressing 
a 
sharply deteriorating social 
situation, 
seeking 
to 
mitigate 
the 
immediate social 
costs 
of 
the 
crisis 
but 
also 
to 
minimize 
the 
potential 
for 
persistent 
or 
irreversible 
effects. 
This 
spending 
pattern 
reverses

observed

focus 
on 
expanding 
financial 
support 
to 
families 
in 
danger 
of 
economic 
deprivation. 
Through 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Jefes 
de 
Hogar 
Program, 
the 
Government 
of 
Argentina 
launched 
a 
large 
and 
ambitious 
safety 
net 
program 
very 
quickly 
and 
in 
order 
to do 
that, 
established 
budget 
priorities. 
Unlike 
the 
previous 
workfare program 
which 
rationed participation 
because 
of 
insufficient 
funding, 
all 
those 
eligible 
(unemployed 
adult 
in 
households 
containing 
minors 
under 
18 
years 
of 
age, 
not 
receiving 
a 
pension, 
unemployment 
insurance 
or 
other 
significant 
cash 
transfer) 
had 
guaranteed 
access. 
The 
Program 
provides 
a 
monthly 
stipend 
to 
those 
meeting 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
of 
150 
pesos 
(currently 
equivalent 
to 
roughly 
US$40) 
in 
return 
for 
participation 
in 
mainly 
workfare 
activities, 
but 
also 
training, 
completion 
of 
basic 
education 
and 
temporary private 
sector 
employment. 
The 
main 
reason 
for 
the 
increase 
in 
national 
spending was 
the 
Government’s 
decision 
to 
78. 
announced. 
The 
initial 
months 
of 
operation were 
particularly 
complex. There were 
serious 
difficulties 
in 
terms 
of 
registration 
of 
beneficiaries, 
controlling 
eligibility 
criteria 
and 
establishing 
a 
pipeline 
of 
projects 
and 
activities 
in 
which 
beneficiaries 
could 
participate. 
The 
latter 
part 
of 
2002 
saw a 
gradual 
improvement 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
program 
in 
all 
these 
dimensions. 
Currently 
approximately 
1.9 
million 
individuals benefit 
from 
the 
program. 
The 
program

operations 
in 
May 
2002

after

students 
and 
for 
a 
conditional 
transfer 
program 
targeted 
to poor 
families 
with 
numerous children, 
particularly 
female-headed 
households 
for 
whom 
workfare 
may 
not 
be 
suitable. 
Under 
the latter 
more 
than 
100,000 
poor 
households 
were 
reached 
in 
2002 
and 
500,000 
will 
be 
reached 
during 
2003.  Spending 
on 
feeding programs 
also rose. 
In 
2002, 
the 
Government 
established 
a 
new 
feeding 
program 
(Programa 
de Emergencia 
Alimentaria 
- 
Emergency 
Feeding 
Program) 
which 
has 
functioned 
as 
a 
block 
grant 
to 
provincial 
governments 
with 
flexible 
policy 
guidelines. 
Considering 
the 
dire 
fiscal 
situation 
of 
most 
provinces 
and 
the 
consequent 
reduction 
in 
funding 
of 
most 
other 
feeding 
programs 
(i.e. 
those 
run 
by 
schools 
and 
community 
organizations), 
the 
allocation 
of 
national 
resources 
oriented 
to maintaining 
service 
levels 
is 
a 
positive 
step 
in 
the 
emergency. 
The 
Government 
also 
expanded 
spending 
on 
feeding 
programs 
operated 
in 
schools 
and 
through 
community-based 
organizations. 
Congress 
has 
recently 
approved 
a 
Law

The 
Government

increased 
financing

80. 
The 
delivery 
of 
social 
assistance 
programs 
has 
been 
characterized 
in 
Argentina 
by 
their 
fragmentation 
and 
lack 
of 
coordination. 
To 
address 
these 
problems, 
through 
Decree 
357/2002, 
the 
Government 
established the 
National Council 
for 
the 
Coordination 
of 
Social 
Policies. 
The 
Council 
plays 
a 
key 
role 
in 
coordinating 
actions 
from all 
Ministries 
and 
Agencies 
involved 
in 
social programs 
at 
the 
national 
level. 
It 
has also 
concentrated some 
key 
support 
fictions 
(e.g. 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
social 
programs, overseeing 
the 
registry 
of 
beneficiaries 
of 
social 
programs)

Health. 
During 
the 
end 
of 
2001 
and the 
beginning 
of 
2002, 
priority 
programs 
such 
as 
immunizations, 
tuberculosis 
(TB), 
maternal 
and 
child 
health 
(MCH), 
and 
HIV-AIDS 
, 
were 
seriously hampered 
by 
the 
combination 
of 
political 
crisis, 
fiscal 
constraints 
at 
the 
national 
and 
provincial 
levels, 
price 
instability 
(with 
significant 
increases 
in 
imported 
inputs) 
and 
delays 
in 
the 
payment and 
provision 
of 
goods. 
For 
example, stocks 
of 
anti-TB 
medications 
in 
many 
provinces 
fell 
to 
zero 
for 
several 
months. 
The country 
was 
unable 
to 
provide fortified 
milk, 
a 
key 
element 
of 
its 
child 
health 
program. 
While 
antiretroviral 
therapy 
provided 
through the 
national 
program 
to 
its 
17,000 
patients 
was 
maintained, the 
MOH 
was 
unable 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
increasing 
demand. 
82. 
The 
Government 
initiated 
a 
series 
of 
emergency 
acquisitions 
(with 
the 
necessary 
increase 
in 
budgetary 
allocations) 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
for 
example, 
20.000.000 
doses 
of 
vaccines 
were distributed, 
increasing 
immunization 
coverage 
to 
87 percent. 
83. 
The 
national 
Government 
has 
continued reversing 
this 
situation 
during 
the 
first 
trimester 
of 
2003. 
The 
approved 
national 
budget 
guarantees 
enough 
resources 
for 
the effective 
functioning 
of 
the 
priority 
public 
health 
programs, 
including 
immunizations, 
HIV-AIDS 
, 
control 
and 
prevention 
of 
priority 
infectious 
diseases 
(TB, 
chagas 
and 
others) 
as 
well 
as 
infant and 
maternal 
health, 
which 
has 
important 
and 
very 
positive 
gender 
implications. 
Vaccines 
for 
the 
immunization 
program 
have 
been 
procured 
and 
a 
national 
vaccination 
campaign, 
to 
take 
place 
in 
April, 
should 
bring 
coverage 
back 
to 
levels 
above 
95 
percent. 
Antiretroviral 
therapies 
have 
been 
secured 
for roughly 
20,000 
HIV 
positive 
patients, 
maintaining 
the 
level 
of 
service 
provision 
prior 
to 
the

laboratory 
inputs 
for 
screening pregnant 
women 
at the 
public 
hospital 
network 
are 
in

medications have 
been

and 
the

Education. 
The 
current economic 
crisis 
has 
put 
the 
education system 
under 
stress. 
The 
challenge faced 
by 
Argentina 
is 
to 
continue 
to 
implement 
the 
educational 
reforms 
in 
the context 
of 
deteriorating social conditions 
and 
limited 
fiscal 
resources. 
One 
aspect 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Argentina’s 
response 
is 
to 
expand 
some 
critical 
compensatory 
programs 
to 
limit 
the 
negative 
consequences 
on 
education 
achievements 
of 
falling 
family 
incomes. 
The 
expansion 
of 
the 
existing 
scholarship 
program 
for poor 
secondary 
students 
(from 
110,443 
to 
350,000  students), 
the 
distribution 
of 
school 
materials 
to 
poor 
schools 
(covering 
about 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
students 
in 
public 
schools), 
as 
well 
as 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
program 
to 
upgrade 
facilities 
in 
poor 
localities 
constitute the 
key 
responses 
in 
this 
area. 
School feeding programs have 
been 
expanded 
in 
order 
to 
encourage 
attendance 
and 
are 
now 
covering 
1,200,000 
additional 
children 
throughout 
the 
country. 
86. 
As 
the 
2003 
school 
year 
starts, 
a 
key 
challenge 
the education 
sector 
faces 
is 
the 
accumulation 
of 
teacher salaries 
arrears 
and 
the 
consequent 
risk 
that 
strikes 
and 
work 
stoppages 
will 
result 
in 
many 
school 
days 
lost. 
The 
Government 
is 
addressing 
this 
challenge 
in 
a 
twofold 
28 
Page  37
manner. 
First, 
some 
provinces 
that 
lost 
school 
days 
due 
to 
strikes 
in 
2002 
either 
started 
the 
2003 
school 
year 
earlier 
(San 
Juan) 
or 
established 
special 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
recuperate the 
losses 
during 
the 
normal 
school 
year 
(Jujuy 
and 
Rio 
Negro). 
Secondly, 
the 
Government 
is 
promoting 
the 
reduction 
of 
salary 
arrears 
as 
part 
of 
the 
fiscal regularization 
plans 
agreed 
with 
provinces.

thereby 
helping to mitigate 
the 
adverse

of 
the economic

on 
the 
poor 
in 
Argentina. 
The 
proposed operation 
is 
part 
of 
a 
concerted 
effort 
by 
multilateral institutions 
to

creditors 
during 
the

by 
the 
international

In

requires that 
a

be

by 
an 
active 
IMF 
program. 
The

The 
Government 
has 
adopted 
a 
plan 
to 
retire 
the 
quasi- 
monies 
through 
buy-backs 
at 
the market-price. 
The 
ten 
provincial 
quasi-monies 
currently 
in 
circulation 
amount 
to 
about  Arg$4.5 
billion, 
and 
another 
Arg$3.3 
billion 
are 
in 
federally 
issued 
quasi-monies. 
Pesos 
will 
be 
exchanged 
for 
quasi-monies 
at 
a 
price 
determined 
in 
an 
auction. 
The 
exchange 
will 
be 
voluntary, 
but 
no 
provincial 
quasi-monies 
will 
subsequently 
be 
allowed 
to 
circulate 
in

that underwent

economy. 
The 
current 
transition 
economic program, 
which 
has 
brought 
a 
degree 
of 
economic 
and 
social 
stability 
following 
the 
dramatic 
events 
of 
early 
2002, 
is 
broadly 
regarded 
as 
a 
necessary 
step 
towards 
building 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
program, 
leading 
to 
a sustainable 
economic recovery, 
and 
sorely 
needed 
improvement 
of 
poverty 
indicators. 
The 
Bank 
remains 
committed 
to 
assist 
the 
stabilization 
and 
recovery 
of

Argentine

of 
2003 
have been 
associated 
with 
a 
transitional 
economic program, supported 
by 
the 
international 
financial 
institutions. 
The 
January 
2003 
Stand-By Agreement 
by 
the 
IMF, 
included 
a 
number 
of 
policy 
measures 
aiming 
to 
stabilize 
the 
fiscal and monetary 
conditions 
in 
Argentina, 
and 
provided, together 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
IDB, 
financing 
that 
would 
cover the 
transitional 
needs 
of 
the Federal Government 
and 
the provinces. 
The policies 
supported 
in 
this 
proposed 
loan, 
and, 
importantly, 
its 
financing, 
are 
an 
integral part 
of 
that 
transitional program. 
Policies 
supported 
by 
this 
proposed 
loan 
are 
complementary 
to 
those 
of 
the 
IMF 
and 
IDB’s 
programs. 
The 
proposed 
monetary 
unification 
program, 
included 
in 
the 
present 
loan, has 
the 
support 
of 
the 
IMF, 
as 
their 
program 
contemplated the 
eventual 
withdrawal 
of 
quasi-monies 
from 
circulation. 
The 
economic 
stabilization 
and 
early 
signs 
of 
recovery 
observed 
in 
the 
first 
few 
months

create 
conditions that 
would 
facilitate 
the 
subsequent 
reform 
program. 
The 
measures 
to improve 
the 
fiscal 
conditions 
in 
the 
provinces 
(PFOs) 
would be 
imperative 
as 
stepping 
stones 
in 
reaching

a 
consolidated 
fiscal 
performance that 
would 
secure sustainable 
growth. 
The 
redemption 
of 
quasi monies 
program 
would 
strengthen 
the 
Central 
Bank's 
ability to 
conduct 
monetary 
policy, 
as 
it 
eventually 
adopts 
inflation 
targeting 
rules. 
The 
transitional social 
protection 
programs 
alleviate 
the 
consequences 
of 
poverty 
and 
mitigate 
social 
tensions, 
while 
conditions 
for 
economic 
growth 
improve, 
and 
unemployment 
rates decline. 
Failing 
to 
secure 
further 
destabilization 
in 
any 
of 
these 
fronts, 
economic 
or 
social, 
would 
make 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
new 
economic 
program 
by 
the 
incoming 
administration 
much 
more difficult.

carried 
out 
by 
LCOAA. 
The 
CFAA 
concluded: 
"This 
assessment 
indicates that 
by 
and 
large 
the 
Federal Government 
of 
Argentina 
has 
the 
appropriate 
policies,

framework,

and 
procedures 
in 
place 
to 
provide 
reliable 
and 
timely 
information 
on 
public 
finances 
and 
has 
an 
appropriate 
control 
environment 
to 
insure 
compliance 
with 
this 
framework. 
The 
current 
situation 
owes 
much to 
the 
reforms implemented 
in 
1992 
with 
the 
passage 
of 
a new, 
modern Financial

Disbursement and 
Auditing 
101. 
The Borrower 
will 
open 
an 
account 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Argentina.  Once the 
Bank 
formally 
notifies 
the 
borrower 
that the 
single 
tranche 
is 
available 
for 
withdrawal, the 
borrower 
may 
submit 
a 
withdrawal 
application 
so 
that the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
tranche 
are 
deposited 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
this 
account 
to 
be 
used 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Loan 
Agreement.  Disbursements 
would 
not 
be 
linked 
to 
specific 
purchases, 
and 
supporting 
evidence 
for 
disbursements 
is 
therefore 
not 
required. 
The 
proceeds 
of 
the 
Loan 
would 
not 
be 
used 
to 
finance 
expenditures 
excluded under 
the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
Although 
a 
routine 
audit 
of 
the deposit 
account 
will 
not 
be 
required, the 
Bank 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
conduct

The focal 
areas

SAL 
do 
not 
directly 
increase 
public

that 
could 
lead 
to 
significant 
negative 
environmental

In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
health

in 
this 
operation, 
Argentina 
has adequate 
guidelines 
for

(Loan

The 
proposed

no 
direct 
linkages 
to 
trade

and 
policies 
in 
the 
productive 
sectors (energy, 
mining,

that 
could 
induce 
indirect 
environmental

The 
proposed

does 
not 
include, 
at 
this 
point, tax 
reforms 
that 
would 
change 
the 
structure 
of 
specific 
tax 
policies 
(e.g.,

extractive activities) that 
could 
induce indirect 
negative environmental

by 
changes 
in

On 
the

there 
is 
however 
the 
possibility 
that

provincial 
levels 
will 
affect 
the

There 
is 
no 
expectation, though, 
that 
these

will 
be

than 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the

RISKS 
104. 
Benefits 
The 
transition program 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
incipient 
economic 
recovery 
and 
enhance 
the 
conditions 
for 
the development 
of 
a 
longer-term 
reform 
program 
with 
the 
new 
government. 
First, 
improved 
fiscal 
policies 
in 
the 
provinces 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
overall fiscal 
situation 
of 
the 
country and 
macroeconomic 
stabilization. 
The 
improved 
provincial 
finances 
will 
directly 
help 
to 
attain the 
required 
primary 
surplus 
of 
the consolidated 
public 
sector. Second, 
the 
elimination 
of 
quasi-monies 
will 
have 
the 
following 
benefits: 
(i) 
provincial 
governments 
have 
committed 
to 
normalize their fiscal 
programs 
and 
stop 
any 
new 
issuance 
of 
quasi-monies; 
(ii) 
it 
would 
accelerate 
the 
retum to 
a 
normal 
payment 
system based 
on 
the peso 
and 
strengthen 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank. 
to 
conduct 
monetary policy, 
(iii) 
ease 
financial 
management constraints 
generated 
by 
the 
use 
of 
quasi- 
monies, 
(iv) 
it 
would 
help 
lower income 
families, 
including 
retirees, 
who 
often 
were 
forced 
to 
accept these 
quasi-monies 
as 
payments; 
and 
(v) 
reduce perverse 
incentives 
to 
economic 
activity 
towards 
the 
informal 
sector, 
improve 
inter-provincial 
trade, 
and 
thus 
promote 
overall 
economic 
growth. 
Third, 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
measures are 
helping 
the 
poor 
in 
meeting 
their 
basic 
social 
needs. 
The 
increased 
budgets 
to 
the social 
protection 
programs 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
poorer 
income 
groups have better 
access 
to 
immunizations, 
infant 
and 
maternal 
health 
care, 
and 
pharmaceuticals. 
Finally, 
the Heads 
of 
Household program 
has 
contributed 
to 
calm 
down 
the 
high 
social 
tensions 
that 
existed 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2002 
as 
well 
as 
to 
provide 
temporary 
and

Sustainability 
of 
the program 
could 
be 
threatened 
by 
the 
outcome 
of 
upcoming 
presidential 
elections 
(second 
round) 
which 
may 
not 
yield 
a 
strong mandate 
for 
the 
winner 
and 
may 
result 
in 
a 
government that 
is 
not 
willing 
andor 
able 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
a 
comprehensive 
economic 
and 
social 
reform 
program. 
A 
weak 
electoral mandate 
may 
undermine 
the 
incipient 
recovery 
and 
leave 
economic 
and 
political 
uncertainties 
with 
possible 
negative 
consequences. 
The 
new 
government 
may 
be 
unable 
to improve 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
at 
either 
the 
federal 
or 
provincial 
levels.

of 
the social

unemployment

poverty

and 
the 
pace

ability to 
build 
a 
consensus

Adherence 
of 
individual 
provinces 
to 
the

depends 
on 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
the 
distribution 
of 
costs 
related 
to 
that 
exchange, 
and 
the 
risk 
of future 
changes 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the program, 
which 
could be 
affected 
by 
the outcome 
of

to 
be 
treated 
as 
entitlements, 
and 
will 
crowd 
out 
better instruments 
for 
addressing 
poverty 
and 
unemployment. 
This 
is 
a 
risk 
which 
will 
be 
addressed 
through 
policy 
dialogue 
after 
the 
crisis 
abates 
and 
the 
program 
has 
served 
its 
purpose. 
A 
longer-term 
risk 
is 
that transitional 
measures, 
like 
the Heads 
of 
Household 
program,

half 
of 
the 
year 
could 
continue 
to 
undermine the 
overall 
macroeconomics 
reforms. 
The 
provinces have 
announced 
a 
commitment 
to 
reduce the 
overall 
provincial 
deficits 
and 
to 
produce 
primary 
surpluses, 
but 
their resolve 
could 
be 
tested 
if 
economic conditions 
deteriorate. 
Another 
major 
risk 
is 
at 
the 
provincial 
level, 
where

Mitigating 
these 
risks 
is 
much 
better 
than 
anticipated performance 
in 
2002 
by 
the 
provinces 
and 
their commitment 
to 
implement 
the 
2003 targets 
are 
hopeful 
signs that 
the 
provinces 
will 
carry out 
the 
2003 
agreements, 
with 
key 
ones 
already 
approved 
by 
local 
legislatures. 
Further, 
the 
measures 
contained 
in 
the 
program 
to 
redeem quasi-monies 
should 
help 
to 
reduce 
this 
risk. 
In 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
area, 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
strongly 
committed 
to 
implement 
the 
described 
social 
program 
and 
there 
is 
general support 
in 
Argentina, 
including 
among presidential 
candidates, 
for 
the 
continuation 
of 
those 
programs. 
Finally, 
whatever 
party 
wins 
the 
elections, 
the 
new 
leaders 
would 
benefit 
from 
the support 
of 
the 
international

are 
sufficient 
to 
cover obligations

All

during

focused 
on

2003. 
The 
expectation 
for

is 
that 
it 
will 
be 
succeeded 
by 
a 
multi-year

Ministry 
of 
Economy 
Buenos Aires, 
March 
26,2003 
Mr. 
James 
D. 
WOLFENSOHN 
PRESIDENT 
THE 
WORLD 
BANK 
Washiupton, 
D.C. 
Ref: 
Economic 
& 
Social 
Transition 
Program 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn: 
Since  the 
beginning 
of 
2002, 
the  Government 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Argentina 
has 
been 
confronting 
the 
enormous 
challenge 
of 
reconstructing social 
peace 
and 
the 
confidence 
in 
the 
institutions. 
The 
Government's 
primary 
commitment 
is 
to 
redesign 
a sustainable 
macro- 
economic  framework, 
capable 
of 
leading 
the  economy 
towards 
sustained 
growth 
in 
the 
medium 
term, guaranteeing 
an 
orderly transition 
and 
prioritizing 
social 
cohesion. 
We 
believe 
our 
country 
is 
facing 
a 
crisis 
which 
in 
actuality 
has 
social 
roots 
and 
it 
is 
that 
what 
makes 
it 
unprecedented 
in 
Argentina's  economic 
history, 
as 
well 
as 
different 
from 
other 
crises 
that 
have occurred 
internationally 
in 
recent times. 
The 
economic, 
political 
and 
social 
breakdown 
that 
our 
country 
has experienced, 
together 
with 
the 
breakdown 
of 
the 
contracts 
that 
were  derived 
from 
the 
previous 
model, 
continue 
until 
this day to 
test 
the 
responsiveness 
and 
reaction capacity 
of 
our 
democratic 
institutions. 
The 
Government 
has 
made tremendous 
efforts 
to 
mitigate 
the 
crisis, a 
crisis 
characterized 
by 
a  sharp  increase 
in 
poverty, 
unemployment 
and 
income 
distribution 
inequality. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
Social Emergency 
Plan 
and 
the 
start 
up 
of 
programs 
to 
provide 
unemployment 
protection 
demonstrate 
the 
absolute 
priority 
we 
have 
assigned 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
basic 
social 
safety net. 
Within 
this 
framework,  the 
Government 
request 
the 
financial 
support 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
in 
order 
to 
confront 
this 
crisis, 
seeking 
to 
consolidate the progress that 
has 
been 
achieved 
and 
to 
deepen 
the 
policy 
lines 
that 
have 
guided 
its 
actions, 
which 
are 
intended 
to 
bring 
relief 
to 
the 
most 
vulnerable households 
from 
the 
dramatic 
living 
circumstances 
in 
which 
this crisis 
has submerged them.

I. 
DIAGNOSIS 
OF 
THE ECONOMIC 
AND 
SOCIAL 
CRISIS 
1.1 
The 
macro-economic 
imbalances  generated 
by 
the 
policies 
pursued 
in 
the 
1990's 
explain 
the exorbitant 
indebtedness, 
the 
high 
fiscal 
deficits, 
the 
fall 
of 
production 
and 
the 
social 
crisis. 
The 
end 
of 
the 
model 
that 
prevailed 
for 
over 
ten 
years was 
the 
logical 
consequence 
of 
the 
application 
of 
an 
economic 
plan 
that, 
although 
successful 
as 
a short 
term 
stabilization 
program,  was 
erroneously 
sustained 
as 
a 
program 
for 
economic 
transformation 
and 
growth. 
1.2 
As 
extemal 
conditions 
changed, 
the 
limitations 
inherent 
to 
the 
Convertibility 
regime 
became 
rapidly 
evident. 
Its 
natural 
consequences 
have 
been: 
a regressive 
income 
distribution, 
growing 
structural 
unemployment, 
unprecedented 
insecurity 
and 
social 
fragmentation. 
1.3 
The 
extemal 
shocks, 
the 
profligate fiscal 
policy 
and 
the 
importation 
of 
a 
monetary 
policy 
alien 
to 
the 
local 
economic 
cycle, 
[all 
came  together] 
to 
deteriorate 
our 
currency. 
The 
massive tax 
exemption 
for 
the 
import 
of 
capital 
good 
introduced 
a 
huge 
bias 
towards  capital-intensive  investments that 
caused 
labor 
to 
be 
expelled, 
explaining 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
unemployment 
rate even 
in 
the 
initial 
years 
of 
strong 
growth 
of 
economic activities. 
The 
high 
public 
debt 
that 
was 
used 
to 
finance 
the 
expansion 
of 
current 
expenditures ended 
by 
setting 
fire 
to 
an 
explosive 
combination 
that 
was 
bound 
to 
burst 
sooner 
or 
later. 
1.4 
Argentine 
confronted 
an 
exit 
from 
the 
model 
with 
economic 
and 
social 
costs 
that 
were 
substantially 
higher 
than 
had 
the 
decision 
been made 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
The 
collapse 
of 
Convertibility 
was 
the 
unavoidable result 
of 
the 
limitations 
inherent 
to 
such a 
scheme, 
and 
it 
was encountered 
by 
this 
Government 
when 
taking 
office 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
severe 
political 
and 
institutional 
crisis. 
11. 
THE IMPACT 
OF 
THE 
CRISIS 
ON 
THE ECONOMIC 
STRUCTUlRE 
AND 
ITS 
SOCIAL 
PLAYERS 
2.1 
As 
at  December, 
2001, 
Argentina's 
economy  faced 
three 
and 
a 
half 
years 
of 
recession 
with 
a 
GDP 
drop of 
12% 
in 
real 
terms 
and 
a 
fall 
of 
16% 
if 
expressed 
per 
capita. 
Industrial production 
had 
shrunk 
by 
21% 
and 
construction was 
down 
36%. 
Investment 
fell 
43% 
as 
compared 
to 
pre-recession levels. 
2.2 
The 
Nation's 
fiscal 
deficit 
was 
in 
excess 
of 
$13 
billion 
in 
2001 
(in 
spite 
of 
the 
zero 
deficit 
policy) 
and 
climbed 
to 
almost 
$18 
billion 
if 
the 
provincial deficit 
is 
included. 
The 
rapid 
collapse 
of 
tax 
revenue 
levels 
caused 
the 
fiscal 
gap 
to 
increase, 
rather 
than 
decrease. 
2.3 
One 
of 
the clearest 
manifestations 
of 
these 
cumulative 
imbalances was the 
foreign 
currency 
over-indebtedness 
of 
both 
the 
public 
and 
the 
private 
sectors. 
The 
sudden 
drop 
in 
the 
level 
of 
activity 
generated 
a 
major 
increase 
in 
the trade balance 
surplus. 
However, 
the 
payment 
for 
real 
services 
- 
mainly 
tourism 
- 
interest 
payments 
and 
the 
40 
Page  49
2.4 
2.5 
2.6 
2.7 
2.8 
remittance 
of 
profits 
abroad 
caused 
the 
current 
account 
to 
continue 
being 
in 
the 
red. 
This, 
combined 
with 
an 
important 
capital outflow, 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
sudden 
drop 
of 
international 
reserves. 
The 
excessive 
financing 
of 
the 
Nation 
and 
the Provinces 
through 
the 
local 
financial 
system, 
intended 
to 
patch 
up 
the 
fiscal 
gap, 
leveraged 
the dynamics 
of 
the 
crisis 
by 
damaging 
the 
quality 
of 
bank 
portfolios. 
In 
effect, 
during 
2001, 
the 
financial 
system 
faced 
an 
outflow 
of 
deposits 
for 
US$ 
17.5 
billion, 
20% 
of 
the 
stock 
and 
liquid 
reserves 
for 
11 
billion, 
45% 
of 
the stock 
(US$ 
16 
billion 
including 
IMF 
fimds 
to 
reconstruct  the 
reserves). 
Under 
these 
conditions, 
the 
previous  administration 
applied 
a 
partial 
freeze 
on 
bank 
deposits 
via 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
so-called 
covralito 
restrictions 
on 
bank 
transactions 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
controls. 
The result 
of 
all 
this 
was a 
dramatic 
fall 
of 
economic 
transactions 
and 
a 
shattering 
impact 
on 
the 
credibility 
of 
institutions. 
Thus, 
this 
Administration took office 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
an 
unprecedented economic 
and 
social 
fracture, 
immersed 
in 
the 
extremely 
severe 
political 
crisis 
that stemmed 
from 
the 
resignation 
of 
the President 
elected 
at 
the end 
of 
1999 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
his 
successor 
for 
a 
scant 
seven 
days, 
which 
made 
it 
essential 
to 
recreate 
minimum 
conditions 
of 
governability. 
We 
were 
facing 
an 
extreme 
situation: 
a 
dramatic 
descent 
of 
production 
and 
employment, 
a 
default 
on 
domestic 
and 
international obligations 
and 
a 
collapsed 
financial 
system. 
Argentina 
currently 
confronts 
an 
actual 
impossibility 
of 
honoring 
its 
financial 
obligations, 
and 
requires the support 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
reestablish 
financial 
relations 
that 
are 
sustainable 
and 
compatible 
with 
internal 
economic 
growth 
and 
social equity. 
The 
Convertibility 
regime 
saw 
the 
beginnings 
of 
a 
growing 
precariousness 
of 
the 
levels 
of 
employment, even 
during 
the expansion 
phase 
of 
the 
economy. 
As 
at 
May 
2002, 
there 
were 
3 
million 
unemployed 
(21.5% 
of 
the active population) 
and 
2.2 
million 
underemployed. 
Such 
increases 
have 
been the determinant  factors 
for 
the 
rise 
in 
the 
number 
of 
people 
who 
are 
under 
poverty 
and 
indigence. 
The 
share 
of 
the 
population 
with 
labor 
problems 
has 
reached 
the 
rate 
of 
40% 
of 
the 
active 
population.' 
During 
2002, 
the 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
reached 
alarming 
proportions: 
20 
million 
poor 
- 
55.6% 
of 
the 
population 
- 
of 
which 
9.6 
million 
are 
indigent 
poor. 
This 
situation 
is 
not 
homogenous 
across 
the 
country: 
while 
in 
provinces 
such 
as 
Neuquh 
the 
poor 
represent 
47.5%, 
they 
are 
in 
excess 
of 
69% 
of 
the 
population 
in 
the 
last 
ring 
of 
the 
Greater 
Buenos 
Ares." 
There 
are 
also sharp 
differences 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
on 
various 
age 
groups: 
while 
41.6% 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
50-64 
is 
poor, 
in 
the 
age 
group 
up 
to 
5 
and 
6 
and 
12, 
over 
70% 
and 
74% 
of 
the 
total 
are 
poor, 
respectively.

in 
the country, 
11.6% 
have 
met 
basic

(687,000

and 
17.3% 
of 
the 
people, 
and 
there

this 
figure

above 30% (Jujuy,

Income inequality 
has 
increased 
considerably 
in 
the 
last 
decade: 
the 
10% 
richest 
households 
receive 
30.1% 
of 
the 
income, 
while 
the 
poorest 
10% 
only 
receive

The

gap 
between 
both 
groups 
is 
in

of 
39 
times.

THE 
STRATEGY 
OF

ECONOMIC 
AND 
SOCIAL 
CRISIS 
3.1

3.3 
a. 
b. 
C. 
This 
inherited 
context 
generated 
the 
inescapable 
responsibility 
of 
taking 
emergency 
measures, 
putting 
the 
economy 
on 
a 
realistic 
footing 
and 
taking 
decisions that 
had 
been 
stalled, 
in 
order 
to 
unblock 
the 
production 
process. 
The 
Economic 
Program 
is 
divided 
into 
three 
stages: 
1) 
Containment 
of 
the 
crisis; 
2) 
Rehabilitation 
of 
the 
basic 
operation 
of 
the 
economy; 
and 
3) 
Sustained 
reactivation 
of 
the 
economy. 
We 
are 
now 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
third 
stage. 
The 
'Action 
Plan 
has 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
gradually reorder 
the 
economy, 
taking 
the 
first 
steps 
in 
the 
right 
direction. 
Thus, 
this 
Administration 
has 
focused 
its 
efforts 
on 
the reestablishment 
of 
three 
pillars: 
the 
institutions, 
to 
guarantee 
political 
and 
social 
peace; 
a 
macro-economic 
reordering: 
and 
the 
restoration 
of 
foreign 
relations. 
Reconstructing 
the 
institutions 
The 
priority 
was 
to 
bring 
the 
institutions 
back 
into 
operation, 
creating 
stable 
and 
credible 
rules. 
Public 
Emergency 
law 
No. 
25.561 
and 
the 
new 
Organic 
Charter 
of 
the 
Central 
Bank 
(Law 
25.562) 
are 
the 
two 
hdamental 
pieces 
of 
legislation 
of 
the 
new 
economic 
policy. 
In 
parallel,  the 
Economic 
Subversion 
Law 
was 
repealed 
and 
the 
Law 
on 
Bankruptcy 
Proceedings was 
thoroughly 
reviewed 
and 
brought 
in 
line 
with 
international 
standards. 
In 
response 
to 
the 
social problems, the 
Government 
designed 
a 
Social 
Emergency 
Plan 
that 
has 
the 
following 
mainstays: 
(i) 
a 
subsidy 
paid to 
unemployed male 
and 
female heads 
of 
Household; 
(ii) 
emergency 
food 
care; 
(iii) 
the 
supply 
of 
basic 
health 
inputs 
and 
services; 
schooling 
support 
and 
habitat 
improvement 
in 
the 
most 
deprived 
settlements. 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
corralito 
restrictions: 
A) 
the 
decision 
was 
made 
to 
convert 
into 
Argentine 
pesos 
dollar 
denominated 
bank 
assets 
and 
liabilities. 
However, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
do 
this 
in 
an 
asymmetric 
manner 
to 
avoid 
the 
full 
effect 
of 
this 
measure 
on 
the 
depositors 
of 
the 
financial 
system. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
all 
those 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
had 
been converted 
to 
pesos 
were 
adjusted 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
l3

based 
on

with 
interest 
rate ceilings 
being 
set 
for 
those loans 
that 
had 
originally 
been 
denominated 
in 
foreign 
currency. 
B) 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
reschedule deposits above 
US$ 
5,000 
or 
Arg. 
$7,000, 
giving 
depositors 
the  choice 
between 
receiving 
a 
public 
bond 
denominated 
in 
Argentine 
pesos 
or 
in 
dollars 
or 
retaining their 
rescheduled 
deposit; 
C) 
measures 
were taken 
to 
progress 
towards a 
greater 
relaxation 
of 
the 
corralito 
and 
a free 
system 
has 
been 
set 
up 
for new 
deposits, 
with 
new 
legal 
frameworks 
being 
planned 
in 
order 
to 
rebuild 
the 
confidence 
in 
the 
Argentine 
banking 
system. 
Currently, 
80% 
of 
all 
deposits 
are 
free. 
Responding 
to 
the 
social 
demand 
for 
a 
clean 
up 
and 
reduction 
of 
political 
spending, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
and 
the Provinces  signed the Federal Agreement 
for 
the 
Reform 
of 
the 
Argentine 
Political 
System, 
setting 
guidelines 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
expenses. 
Reordering 
the macroeconomy 
On 
the 
fiscal 
front, 
the 
Budget 
bills 
for 
2002 
and 
2003 
were 
approved, based 
on 
the 
rule 
of 
not 
spending 
what 
cannot 
be 
genuinely 
financed, 
a 
strong 
austerity 
of 
expenditures 
and 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
deficit 
over  previous 
years. 
All 
this 
while 
protecting 
social 
spending. 
A 
fundamental 
progress was 
the execution 
of 
the 
Orderly 
Financing 
Agreements 
with 
the Provinces 
(Law 
25,570), 
insuring 
that 
they 
would 
be 
extremely 
responsible 
on 
fiscal 
matters. 
Regarding 
rate 
of 
exchange 
policy, 
a 
fimdamental  decision 
was 
liberalizing 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
market. 
It 
was also sought 
to 
design 
a 
prudent 
foreign 
exchange 
policy, 
consistent 
with 
the budget 
and 
the 
new 
foreign 
exchange 
regime. 
In 
parallel, 
progress 
was made 
in 
redefming 
the tax 
treatment 
of 
various 
sectors 
or 
transactions, 
seeking 
to 
increase 
the 
efficiency 
of 
tax 
administration 
and 
the 
renegotiation 
of 
the 
contracts 
with 
public 
service 
utilities 
has 
been 
instrumented, 
whereby 
tariff 
adjustments 
will 
be 
granted 
in 
a phased 
manner. 
Reestablishing 
foreign 
relations 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
foreign 
debt problem, the 
country 
was 
forced 
to 
resort 
to 
a 
process 
of 
deferral 
of 
the payments 
on 
the 
public 
debt, 
which 
does 
not 
imply 
a 
recanting 
from 
its 
commitments 
but 
rather 
stems 
from 
the exhaustion 
of 
its 
payment 
capacity under 
the terms 
and 
conditions 
that 
had 
been 
agreed 
with 
the creditors. 
The 
specific 
strategy was 
to 
reorder the 
relation 
with 
the 
IMF 
as 
a basic 
precondition 
to 
negotiate 
with 
foreign 
creditors. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
2002 
crisis, 
payments 
for 
US$ 
4.5 
billion 
were made 
to 
the 
multilateral 
and 
bilateral lending 
agencies. 
The 
new 
model 
seeks 
to 
introduce 
a 
strong 
export 
bias, 
to 
foster the 
recovery 
of 
the 
regional 
economies 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
the 
country's 
industrial 
base. 
This 
Government 
43 
Page  52
is 
committed 
to 
promoting 
commercial  integration 
to 
favor 
the 
insertion 
of 
our 
production. 
3.6 
Summarizing,  the Government 
has 
emphasized the 
recovery 
of 
the 
monetary 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
policy 
and 
strict  fiscal 
prudence 
as 
core 
tools 
to 
protect 
the 
economy 
from 
external 
shocks 
and 
to  provide 
competitiveness 
to 
domestic 
production. However, regaining 
the 
path 
of 
sustained 
growth 
is 
a process 
that 
will 
bear 
fruit 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
3.7 
This Administration 
is 
klly 
aware 
that 
a free 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
is 
a necessary 
but 
not 
sufficient condition to 
guarantee the 
reactivation 
of 
production 
in 
a sustained 
manner: 
a 
comprehensive 
coordination 
of 
policies 
and 
structural 
reforms 
are 
required. 
In 
any 
case, 
in 
an 
environment 
of 
social 
unrest, 
external 
isolation 
and 
political 
weakness, 
it 
is 
not 
feasible 
to 
consider 
a 
policy 
scheme 
with 
such 
characteristics. Consequently, 
the 
approach selected was one 
of 
gradualism. 
3.8 
During 
the 
first 
semester 
of 
2002, 
the 
pace 
of 
decline 
of 
the 
GDP 
continued along 
the 
2001 
lines, 
but 
three phenomena have 
been 
verified 
that 
set 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
recovery 
of 
the 
economy: 
a) 
the rate 
of 
exchange has stabilized; 
b) 
there 
was 
a 
low 
transfer 
of 
the 
devaluation 
to 
prices 
- 
controlled inflation; 
c) 
a 
floor 
was reached 
in 
the 
drop 
of 
the 
GDP 
and 
there was 
industrial 
reactivation 
in 
terms 
controlled 
for 
seasonality. 
3.9 
In 
spite 
of 
such improvements,  the Government 
understands 
that 
it 
has a 
limited 
capability 
to 
foster  expectations 
regarding 
an 
economic 
recovery 
in 
the 
short 
term 
that 
may 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
employment levels 
and 
wage income. 
This 
sets 
a 
difficult 
background 
for 
social 
policy 
actions 
and 
for 
the 
possibility 
of 
attending 
to 
the 
financial 
commitments 
undertaken. 
Therefore 
the need 
of 
counting 
with 
the 
financial 
assistance 
of 
the 
Multilateral 
Credit 
Agencies. 
IV. 
THE 
SOCIAL 
PROTECTION 
STRATEGY 
4.1 
The 
economic 
crisis 
that 
deepened 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2001 
had 
a 
strong 
impact 
on 
the 
population 
as 
a 
whole 
and, 
in 
particular, 
on 
the 
most 
vulnerable social 
sectors. 
The 
Government 
acted 
in 
this 
regard, 
designing 
and 
implementing 
the 
Social 
Emergency 
Plan 
(PES, 
in 
Spanish 
Plan 
de 
Emergencia 
Social). 
4.2 
Within 
the framework 
of 
the 
PES, 
the 
priority 
was 
assigned 
to 
a 
set 
of 
programs 
funded 
by 
multilateral 
credit 
agencies, 
instrumented 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
executive 
decrees 
designed 
to 
secure 
the 
budgetary 
items 
required 
for 
their 
execution. 
4.3 
It 
is 
projected 
that the 
total 
spending 
on 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
will 
be 
doubled 
fiom 
2001 
to 
2003, 
from 
0.6% 
of 
GDP 
to 
1.2%, 
respectively. 
4.4 
These 
programs 
are: 
(i) 
the 
Male 
& 
Female Heads 
of 
Household 
Program, 
which 
provides 
an 
economic 
assistance 
of 
Arg.$  150 
per 
month, 
against a 
labor 
counterpart 
in 
community 
targeted 
projects, 
as 
well 
as 
controlling 
the  school 
attendance 
of 
44

4.5 
4.6 
4.7 
4.8 
4.9 
children 
and 
their 
vaccination; 
(ii) 
the 
Food 
Emergency Program 
(PEA, 
in 
Spanish 
Programa 
de 
Emergencia 
Alimentaria), 
which 
distributes 
funds 
to 
the 
provinces 
to 
cover  the 
food 
requirements 
of 
poor 
families; 
(iii) 
the 
Participatory 
Social 
Investment 
Fund 
(FOPAR), 
which 
finances 
projects 
for 
comunity 
food 
services; 
(iv) 
IDH, 
granting 
monthly 
subsidies 
to 
poor 
families 
with 
children 
under 
the 
age 
of 
18, 
who 
in 
exchange 
have 
to 
submit 
to 
health 
and 
school 
attendance controls; 
(v) 
the 
Neighborhood 
Improvement  Program 
(PROMEBA), 
which 
funds 
basic 
social 
infrastructure 
projects, 
and 
(vi) 
the 
Mother 
& 
Child 
and 
VIGI-A 
programs, 
which 
supply 
medicines, vaccines 
and 
milk 
to 
the 
more 
deprived population. 
In 
order 
to 
start 
it 
up, 
a 
unified 
roster 
of 
beneficiaries 
was 
created, 
a 
system 
of 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
social 
programs  was  implemented, 
transparency 
criteria 
were 
defined 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
among  provinces 
and 
municipalities 
and 
the 
obligation 
of 
publishing 
information 
on 
the 
beneficiaries, 
the 
use 
of 
funds 
and 
procurement 
processes 
was mandated. 
Another 
fundamental 
measure adopted 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
social 
policy 
implemented 
by 
the  Government 
was 
setting 
up 
the 
National  Council 
for 
the 
Coordination 
of 
Social 
Policies 
(CNCPS), 
made 
up 
of 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance, 
Labor, 
Education, 
Health 
and 
Social 
Development. 
The 
CNCPS 
adopted concrete measures 
to 
reduce the 
fragmentation 
of 
social 
policy: 
importantly, 
the 
strategic 
planning 
of 
national 
social 
policies 
and 
programs, 
the 
coordination 
among 
agencies 
responsible 
for 
social 
policy 
and 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
arrangements 
that 
ensure 
social 
control 
over the 
use 
of 
public 
funds. 
The financial 
crisis 
which 
affected the 
country 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
some 
provinces 
more 
particularly 
worsened the 
delays 
in 
paying 
teachers' 
salaries 
with 
arrears 
that 
now 
amount 
to 
Arg. 
$ 
184 
million 
country-wide, 
with 
variations 
from 
province  to 
province. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Orderly Financial 
Plan 
(PFO), 
the 
National 
Government 
aims 
at 
preventing 
new 
delays 
in 
the payment 
of 
salaries 
as 
well 
as 
the 
elimination 
the 
existing 
debt. 
The 
basic 
principles 
that 
rule 
social 
protection policies 
are 
as 
follows: 
Social 
control 
over 
the 
use 
of 
public 
funds 
Civil 
society 
participation 
in 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
social 
policies

HEALTH 
SECTOR 
STRATEGY 
5.1 
The 
strategy 
defined 
by 
the 
Government 
for 
the 
health 
sector 
includes operating 
both 
in 
response 
to 
the 
emergency 
and 
at 
the 
level 
of 
a 
reform, 
with 
focus 
on 
the 
following 
issues: 
9 
Strengthening the 
level

governance 
in 
the 
sector 
and 
the

5.4 
5.5 
The 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
governance 
of 
the 
system consists 
of 
a 
two- 
pronged 
approach: 
on 
the  one 
hand, 
it 
comprises 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the Federal 
Health 
Council 
(COFESA, 
for 
the 
Spanish 
language acronym), 
to 
improve 
its 
operation. 
This 
is 
reflected 
in 
the application 
of 
COFESA 
indexes 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
milk, 
medicines 
and 
other 
national 
transfer 
funds 
and 
donations, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
consolidation 
of 
agreements 
to reform 
its 
framework 
of 
norms, 
including 
aspects 
of 
(i) 
organization 
and 
operation; 
(ii) 
legal 
framework; 
and 
(iii) 
definition 
of 
priority 
areas 
of 
public 
policy 
competence 
and 
interest. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
progress has 
been 
made 
in 
setting 
up 
and 
implementing 
a 
space 
for 
a 
plural 
dialogue 
on 
sectorial  policies. 
This 
is 
evidenced 
in 
the 
actions 
implemented 
within 
the 
flamework 
of 
the 
Argentine Dialogue 
and, 
in 
particular, 
in 
the 
agreements 
of 
the 
Health 
Dialogue, 
together 
with 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Crisis 
Committee. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
price 
of 
pharmaceuticals, 
in 
Argentina, 
during 
the 
last 
decade, 
they grew 
well 
excess 
of 
inflation; 
this 
situation 
became 
worse 
with 
the 
modification 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
exchange.  Consequently, 
in 
the 
first 
months 
of 
2002  the 
private 
consumption 
of 
pharmaceuticals 
fell 
around 
25%; 
faced 
with 
this 
situation, 
the 
Argentine 
Government 
designed 
as 
one 
of 
its 
priorities 
to 
promote 
the 
population's 
access 
to 
essential pharmaceuticals,  based 
on 
two 
premises: 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Generic 
Designations 
and 
Public 
Supply. 
The 
policy 
on 
the 
use 
of 
generic  designations 
began 
with 
the 
passing 
of 
Decree 
486/02, 
declaring 
a 
sanitary 
emergency 
in 
the 
national 
territory 
and 
basically 
mandating 
that the 
prescribing 
professional (medical 
doctors 
and 
dentists) 
had to 
indicate 
the 
generic 
name 
of 
the 
drug 
in 
their 
prescription, thus 
giving 
the 
pharmacy 
professional 
(and 
only 
such professional)  the 
choice 
of 
providing 
the 
commercial 
altemative 
chosen 
by 
the 
patient, 
provided 
it 
contains the 
same 
active principle, 
concentration, 
pharmaceutical 
form 
and 
quantity 
of 
units  per 
package. 
Also, 
46 
Page  55
legislation 
was 
promoted 
to 
implement 
the 
prescription 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
generic 
drugs 
in 
18 provinces. 
5.6 
Regarding 
the 
Public 
Supply 
of 
medicines, 
the 
most important 
initiative 
is 
the 
Remediar 
Program, 
that 
is 
supplying 
essential 
medicines 
to 
all 
provincial 
and 
municipal 
Primary 
Health 
Care Centers (CAPS, 
for 
the Spanish 
language acronym) 
throughout 
the 
country. 
The 
list 
is 
designed 
to 
cover 
between 
70% 
and 
80% 
of 
the 
most 
fkequent 
pathologies 
at 
this 
level 
of 
care. 
5.7 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
policy 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
pharmaceuticals, 
to 
support 
the 
prescription 
of 
generics, 
the 
National 
Administration 
of 
Drugs, 
Food 
and 
Medical 
Technology 
has 
made 
strides 
in 
verifying 
conformity 
with 
the 
Good 
Practices 
of 
Manufacturing 
and 
Control 
and 
with 
the development 
of 
standards 
leading 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
bio-equivalence 
and 
bio-availability 
studies 
in 
the country. 
5.8 
In 
the 
area 
of 
Mother 
& 
Child 
care, 
the 
National 
Government 
is 
working 
together 
with 
the 
provinces 
in 
creating 
a 
National 
Public 
Health 
Insurance 
Scheme 
for 
women 
of 
a 
reproductive 
age 
and 
children 
up 
to 
age 
5, 
under 
the 
principles 
of 
universality, 
solidarity 
and 
equity. 
Among 
the  actions 
initially 
implemented 
we 
should 
note: 
(i) 
a 
ministerial  resolution 
creating  the 
Mother 
& 
Child 
Health 
Insurance 
Scheme 
(SMI, 
for 
the 
Spanish language acronym); 
(ii) 
the proposal 
of 
setting 
up 
a 
National 
SMI 
Coordination 
Unit 
within 
the structure 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
(iii) 
the 
allocation 
of 
the 
budget 
appropriations 
required 
for 
FY 
2003; 
(iv) 
the 
SMI 
technical design 
proposal; 
and 
(v) 
its 
implementation 
plan. 
5.9 
By 
protecting 
priority 
programs, 
the 
aim 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
public 
spending 
on 
national 
programs 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
basic 
health 
services 
is 
maintained 
at adequate 
levels, 
including 
the 
actions 
needed 
to 
guarantee 
that 
each 
of 
these 
programs 
receives 
sufficient budgetary 
allocations 
and 
the 
execution 
of 
sufficient 
resources 
to 
achieve 
the 
physical delivery 
targets 
according 
to 
the 
plan. 
5.10 
The 
National 
Government 
has 
taken 
effective 
steps 
to 
guarantee 
the population's 
Sexual 
and 
Reproductive 
Health 
rights 
(SSR), 
including 
(i) 
passing 
Law 
25.673 
on 
Reproductive 
Health 
and 
Responsible  Procreation; 
(ii) 
the 
development 
of 
the 
National 
Reproductive 
Health 
Program; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
definition 
of 
its 
implementation 
plan. 
Among 
fbture 
actions 
to 
be 
implemented 
we 
note: 
the 
definition 
of 
administrative 
measures 
to 
guarantee 
(a) 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
SSR 
national program 
services 
and 
inputs 
in 
Social 
Security's 
Mandatory 
Health 
Care 
Program 
(PMO, 
for 
the 
Spanish language acronym) 
and 
b) 
the 
articulation 
with 
the education 
sector, 
through 
an 
inter-ministerial 
agreement.

VI. 
MACROECONOMIC 
ASPECTS 
6.1 
The 
Government 
has 
formulated 
a  short 
term 
transition 
program 
designed 
to 
maintain 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
strengthen  the 
recovery 
of 
the 
economy 
during 
the 
impending 
political 
change. 
The 
Presidential 
elections 
are 
scheduled 
to 
be 
held 
in 
April, 
2003 
and 
a 
new 
elected government 
will 
take 
office 
at 
the 
end 
of 
May. 
The 
transition program 
shall 
lay 
the 
foundation 
for 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
program 
of 
fimdamental  reforms 
that 
will 
be 
developed 
after 
the 
elections 
and 
which 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
address 
the 
accumulation 
of 
long 
years 
of 
mistakes. 
The 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
transition 
program 
comprise:  guaranteeing  fiscal, 
monetary 
and 
banking 
robustness 
and 
regaining 
the confidence 
of 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
investors 
while 
maintaining 
equal 
treatment 
for 
all 
parties, 
protecting 
contractual 
rights 
to 
uphold 
the 
rule 
of 
law. 
6.2 
The 
major 
components 
of 
the 
transition program 
are: 
I) 
the 
2003  budget, 
which 
seeks 
to 
maintain 
under 
control 
the federal 
fiscal 
deficit; 
II) 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
bilateral 
pacts 
between 
the 
national 
and 
the 
provincial 
governments; 
HI) 
a 
monetary program 
to 
maintain 
inflation 
at a 
low 
level; 
IV) 
preparatory 
steps 
for 
the 
structural 
measures 
that 
are 
required 
to 
strengthen the 
fiscal 
position 
in 
the 
medium 
term; 
V) 
progress 
towards 
a 
restructuring 
of 
the 
debt; 
VI) 
a strategy 
to 
reconstruct 
the 
banking 
system; 
VII) 
ensuring 
full 
respect 
to 
credits, 
restoring legal 
certainty 
and 
advancing 
towards 
corporate 
restructurings. 
6.3 
The 
macroeconomic 
framework 
for 
2003 
assumed 
that 
the 
real 
GDP 
will 
grow 
by 
approximately 
3% 
(with 
recent data 
opening 
up 
the 
possibility 
of 
attaining 
values 
slightly 
above 
4%) 
and 
that consumer 
price 
inflation for 
the 
12 
month 
period 
could 
be 
around 
22% 
at 
year 
end. 
A 
significant current 
account 
surplus 
is 
projected, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
US$ 
6.5 
billion, 
for 
2003. 
Gross 
intemational 
reserves 
will 
be 
maintained 
approximately 
unchanged 
during 
the 
term 
of 
the 
agreement. 
This 
is 
based 
on 
the 
assumption that 
the 
intemational 
lending 
agencies 
will 
extend 
loans 
to Argentina 
to 
cover the 
sums 
that 
will 
become due 
to 
said 
agencies 
during 
the 
period 
January 
- 
August, 
2003, 
including 
the 
regularization 
of 
arrears, 
a 
hypothesis 
stemming 
from 
the 
agreement 
with 
the 
MI?. 
VII. 
THE SITUATION 
OF 
PROVINCIAL 
GOVERNMENTS 
7.1 
The 
adjustments 
in 
the provinces 
are 
backed 
up 
by 
the Federal 
- 
Provincial 
Pact 
on 
temporary 
tax-sharing 
agreements 
signed 
in 
February 
2002, 
whereby the 
transfer 
floors 
to 
the 
provinces 
were 
suppressed 
and 
which 
sought 
to 
eliminate 
provincial 
deficits 
by 
203. 
The 
adjustments 
in 
the 
provinces 
are 
occurring 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
control 
of 
expenditures, 
administrative 
reforms, 
reporting 
standards 
and 
penalties 
for 
lack 
of 
compliance. 
48 
Page  57
7.2 
The 
provinces 
that  signed 
bilateral 
agreements 
have 
stopped 
the 
issue 
of 
new 
provincial 
treasury 
bills 
and 
quasi-monies 
and 
the 
Federal 
Government 
has 
likewise 
stopped 
the 
issue 
of 
LECOPs. 
7.3 
The 
governors 
of 
provinces 
representing 
80% 
of 
the 
2002 
consolidated 
provincial 
deficit 
have 
signed 
bilateral 
agreements 
for 
FY 
2003, 
undertaking 
to 
comply 
with 
fiscal 
targets. 
VIII. 
ORDERLY 
FINANCING 
PROGRAM 
8.1 
The 
collapse 
of 
the Gross 
Domestic 
Product, together 
with 
a 
pro-cyclical 
tax 
system 
both 
at 
the 
National 
and 
the 
provincial 
levels, 
lead 
to 
an 
important 
drop 
of 
tax 
resources. 
Towards the 
end 
of 
2001, 
Argentine 
had 
no 
access 
to 
extemal financing 
and 
the tax 
resources 
were 
falling 
at 
the 
pace 
of 
the crisis. 
8.2 
The 
provinces 
saw 
their 
tax 
sharing 
guaranteed 
income dwindle. 
In 
FY 
2001, 
the 
provincial 
deficit 
reached 
ARG. 
$ 
6.645 
billion 
and 
the 
stock 
of 
provincial 
debt was 
close 
to 
US$29 
billion. 
The 
economic 
and 
financial 
crisis 
triggered the 
institutional 
crisis 
that 
brought 
about 
a 
high 
level 
of 
social 
unrest. 
8.3 
Given 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
situation stemming 
from 
the 
financial 
imbalances 
of 
the 
provinces, 
the 
accumulated 
debts, 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
quasi-monies 
and, 
fkdamentally, 
the 
lack 
of 
financing 
for 
the 
public 
sector, 
the 
National 
Government 
instituted 
the 
Orderly 
Financing Program through 
Decree 
No. 
2263/02,  designed 
to 
provide 
financial 
assistance 
to 
the 
24 
jurisdictions, 
provided 
they 
demonstrate a 
fiscal 
and 
financial behavior intended 
to 
reduce the 
2001 
deficit 
by 
60% 
and 
balance 
their 
fiscal 
accounts 
by 
FY 
2003. 
8.4 
The 
guidelines 
of 
the 
program 
are: 
fleezingheduction 
of 
primary 
expenditures; 
refraining 
from 
resorting 
to 
new 
debt 
and 
not 
issuing 
new 
bonds 
outside  the 
program. 
The 
program 
finances 
financial deficits 
- 
on 
a 
cash 
basis, 
debt service 
(year 
2002) 
and 
justified 
cases 
of 
floating 
debt. 
8.5 
The 
program 
is 
based 
on 
two 
major 
pillars: 
transparency 
of 
provincial 
fiscal 
information 
and 
compliance 
of 
the 
agreed targets. 
8.6 
During 
the 
year 2002, 
the 
consolidated 
deficit 
of 
the 
24 
jurisdictions 
amount 
to 
1.77 
billion. 
Seventeen 
provinces 
adhered 
to 
the 
program,  representing 
100% 
of 
the 
deficit, 
with 
another 
7 
provinces 
remaining 
outside the 
PFO; 
those 
provinces 
that 
had 
a 
situation 
of 
balanced 
or 
surplus 
accounts. 
8.7 
The program 
contemplated a 
total 
financing 
close 
to 
ARG33.95 
billion, 
founded 
on 
the 
expectation 
of 
being 
able 
to 
rely 
on 
fkds 
from 
the 
multilateral lending 
agencies, 
with 
a 
prior 
agreement 
with 
the 
IhlF. 
But 
the 
year 
ended 
without 
said 
agreement 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
the 
PFO 
operated 
with 
own 
resources 
and 
at 
a 
scale 
lower 
than 
the 
49 
Page  58
agreed one. 
However, 
the 
results  obtained 
demonstrate  that 
the 
provinces 
over- 
performed 
against 
their 
targets 
since 
the 
deficit reduction 
was 
from ARG$ 
6.379 
billion 
in 
2001 
to 
ARG$ 
1.77 
billion 
in 
2002 
(a 72.3% 
drop). 
See 
annex. 
8.8 
In 
light 
of 
the 
agreement reached 
with 
the 
IMF 
in 
January, 
2003, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
during 
the 
current 
year 
the 
PFO 
will 
accelerate 
and 
the 
target 
of 
eliminated 
the 
consolidated 
provincial 
deficit 
will 
be 
met. 
IX. 
MONETARY 
UNIFICATION 
Redemption 
of 
Quasi-Money 
Bonds 
9.1 
9.2 
9.3 
9.4 
9.5 
9.6 
9.7 
9.8 
The 
creation 
of 
quasi-money 
was  a 
way 
of 
mitigating 
the 
financial 
crisis 
and 
its 
impact 
on 
the 
finances 
of 
the 
provincial public 
sector, 
especially 
as 
fiom 
the 
second 
half 
of 
200 
1. 
In 
fact, 
they 
would 
not 
have 
been 
created 
had 
there 
existed 
an 
orderly 
exit 
fiom 
the 
Convertibility 
law, 
and 
it 
prevented 
an 
even 
sharper 
downtum 
in 
the  levels 
of 
economic activity. 
This 
defensive 
response 
fiom 
the 
provincial 
public 
sectors 
was 
encouraged 
by 
the 
Federal Government 
in 
a 
last attempt 
to maintain convertibility. 
In 
fact, 
the 
LECOP 
bonds 
issued 
by 
the 
National 
Government 
for 
and 
on 
behalf 
of 
the  provinces, 
became 
the 
main 
quasi-money 
in 
circulation 
(approximately 
ARG$3.3 
billion). 
The 
use 
of 
quasi-monies, 
among 
other 
consequences, causes 
an 
erosion 
of 
the 
tax 
basis, 
since 
their 
greater 
use 
in 
the 
informal 
economy 
has 
devaluation 
and 
distortion 
effects 
in 
the 
local 
economies 
and 
their  quotation  under 
par 
directly 
affects  the 
sectors 
of 
the 
economy 
that 
have 
the 
lowest 
income 
and 
bargaining power. 
Therefore, 
the 
redemption of 
quasi-monies 
is 
strategically importance 
to 
attain 
fiscal 
balance, 
the 
orderly financing 
of 
the 
provinces 
and 
the 
nation 
and 
the 
reduction 
of 
inequity 
towards the 
more 
deprived 
sectors. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
will 
have 
a 
neutral 
effect 
fiom 
the 
monetary 
point 
of 
view. 
Both 
the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program 
and 
the 
Orderly Financing 
Program 
and 
the 
decision 
of 
reducing 
the 
provincial 
arrears 
with 
social 
sectors 
until 
their 
complete 
elimination, 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
agreement 
reached 
between the  Government 
of 
Argentina 
and 
the 
Intemational 
Monetary 
Fund. 
Also, 
these 
economic 
policy 
measures 
enjoy 
a 
political 
and 
social 
consensus. 
The 
main 
comments 
drawn 
fiom 
the document 
drafted 
by 
the 
IMF's 
expert 
panel 
in 
July, 
2002 
regarding 
quasi-moneys, are 
the 
following: 
50 
Page  59
The 
issue 
of 
quasi-moneys 
both 
at 
the 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
level 
represents a 
problem 
for 
monetary 
and 
fiscal 
policy 
because: 
I. 
They 
reduce 
the 
Peso 
demand 
for 
transaction 
purposes, 
contributing 
to 
an 
"overhang" 
of 
the 
Peso; 
II. 
the 
provincial 
quasi-moneys 
have 
a 
high 
circulation 
rate 
because 
in 
terms 
of 
value 
reserve 
they 
are 
inferior 
to 
the 
Peso 
(they have 
differing 
acceptability 
values 
in 
the 
jurisdictions 
where 
they 
circulate); 
and 
III. 
they 
are 
extensively 
used 
in 
the 
informal 
economy, 
contributing 
widely 
to 
tax 
evasion. 
Redemption 
Methodology 
9.9 
9.10 
9.11 
9.12 
9.13 
Article 
1 
of 
Law 
No. 
25.561 
provides 
the 
following 
basis: 
1) 
Proceed 
to 
the 
reordering 
of 
the  financial, 
banking 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
market 
system; 
2) 
reactivate the 
operation 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
improve 
the 
level 
of 
employment 
and 
income 
distribution, 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
a 
program 
for 
the development 
of 
the 
regional 
economies; 
3) 
Create  the 
conditions 
for 
a  sustainable 
economic 
growth 
that 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
public 
debt; 
4) 
Rule 
on 
the 
restructuring 
of 
those 
obligations 
[that 
are] 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
executed, 
which 
are 
affected 
by 
the 
new 
foreign 
exchange 
regime instituted 
by 
Article 
2. 
Article 
12 
of 
the 
same 
law 
establishes 
that 
within 
the 
term 
and 
in 
a 
manner 
to 
be 
duly 
determined 
by 
the regulations, 
the 
National 
Executive Power 
will 
create 
the 
necessary arrangements 
to 
proceed 
to 
a swap 
of 
the 
national 
and 
provincial 
securities 
that were 
issued 
as 
substitutes 
for 
the 
national legal 
tender 
throughout 
the 
country's 
territory, 
under 
a 
prior 
agreement 
with 
all 
provincial 
jurisdictions. 
The  provincial 
jurisdictions 
will 
have 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
swap 
instituted 
by 
the 
National 
Government 
with 
the purpose 
of 
materializing 
the 
agreement 
to 
which 
Article 
12, 
Law 
No. 
25.561 
refers 
and 
entrust the 
National 
Government 
with 
the 
respective 
swap, 
binding 
themselves 
to 
undertake  the 
whole 
of 
the 
debt 
arising 
therefrom 
and 
securing 
it 
through their 
Federal tax 
sharing 
resources. 
Once 
the 
program 
is 
finalized 
and 
in 
the assumption that 
a 
remainder 
of 
bonds 
are 
still 
in 
circulation, 
the 
provinces have 
to 
undertake 
to 
issue 
the 
necessary 
rules 
to 
revoke 
the settlement 
power 
of 
said remainder 
and 
to 
issue a substitute 
provincial 
secured bond, 
with 
due 
date 
on 
the 
year 
2006. 
Given 
that  the 
public 
bonds 
involved 
in 
the 
swap 
are 
atomized 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
private 
holders 
and 
financial  institutions 
throughout  the 
national 
temtory, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
instrument 
it 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
an 
effective 
and 
transparent 
procedure 
is 
guaranteed, 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
a 
short 
period 
of 
time. 
The 
decision 
has 
been 
made 
to 
carry 
it 
out through 
a 
system 
of 
public 
bids 
that 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Argentina 
or 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
the 
51 
Page  60
later 
will 
establish 
and 
implement 
a 
special 
procedure 
that contemplates 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
small provincial 
bond 
holders. 
9.14 
According 
to Article 
3 
of 
its 
charter, 
the 
B.C.R.A. 
(Central 
Bank 
of 
Argentina) 
is 
empowered 
"[the] 
primary 
and 
findamental 
mission 
of

of

of 
Argentina 
is

preserve 
the 
value 
of

and 
it 
has the 
power 
of 
regulating 
"the 
quantity 
of

... 
in 
the 
economy" 
and 
issuing 
"rules

exchange 
matters, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
legislation 
in 
force." 
9.15 
Article 30 
thereof establishes 
that 
Yhe 
bank 
is 
exclusively 
responsible 
for 
issuing 
the 
bills 
and 
coinage 
of 
the 
Argentine 
Nation 
and 
no 
other 
agencies 
of 
the 
national 
Government, 
Provincial 
or  Municipal 
govements, 
banks 
or 
other 
institutions 
whatsoever, 
shall 
be 
empowered 
to 
issue 
bills 
or 
metal 
coins 
or 
other instruments 
susceptible 
to 
circulate 
as 
currency. 
9.16 
Article 
18 
of 
the Organic Charter 
provides 
that the 
Bank 
shall have 
powers 
to 
"buy 
and 
sell 
at 
market 
prices, 
in 
cash 
and 
term 
transactions, 
public 
securities, 
foreign 
exchange 
and 
other 
financial 
assets 
for 
monetary 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
regulation 
purposes. 
9.17 
Within 
this 
framework,  the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
establishes, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
their 
internal 
use, 
the 
technical value 
and 
the reference cash 
price 
of 
each quasi-money. 
The 
indicative 
prices 
are 
set 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the prices 
prevailing 
as 
at 01/31/2003 
and 
the 
historical 
prices, 
in 
those 
cases 
where 
such 
information 
is 
available. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance can 
establish the 
indicative 
amount 
to 
be 
redeemed 
in 
each 
bid. 
To 
this 
purpose, 
the fiscal situation 
of 
the corresponding 
province 
shall 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
9.18 
The 
bidding 
process 
is 
fblly 
multi-price 
and 
multi-bond. 
That 
is 
to 
say 
that 
the 
bidding 
is 
for 
all 
bonds 
at 
the 
same 
time 
and 
there 
is 
a 
single 
cut-off 
price 
set 
per 
security 
and 
per 
province, 
since 
this redemption methodology 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
capture 
the best 
market 
conditions. 
9.19 
There 
is 
a 
redemption 
tranche 
called competitive 
where  the 
bidder 
indicates 
the 
amount 
with 
which 
it 
joins 
the 
redemption 
and 
the 
price. 
Then, 
a 
non-competitive 
tranche 
is 
opened 
at 
the 
same 
cut-off price 
as 
for 
the 
first 
tranche, 
or 
lower; 
and 
finally, 
there 
is 
a 
retail 
tranche  opened 
with 
an 
amount 
limit, 
at 
the 
same 
cut-off 
price 
as 
for 
the 
first 
tranche. 
9.20 
The 
cut-off 
date  establishes 
the 
maximum 
amount 
(in 
nominal 
values) 
to 
be 
swapped 
per 
Province, 
since 
the 
Treasuries 
have 
to officially 
report 
on 
their 
position 
in 
quasi-money 
as 
at 
said 
date 
prior 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Redemption 
Program. 
9.21 
The 
bids 
have 
to 
be 
submitted 
through 
the 
Electronic 
Open 
Market 
Trading 
System 
(MAESOP) 
or 
another 
electronic medium, 
and 
the 
bidders 
are 
liable 
for 
the 
validity 
and 
the 
authenticity 
of 
the 
bonds 
they 
offer 
for 
redemption.

ADDENDUM

THE LETTER 
OF 
DEVELOPMENT 
POLICY 
(translated 
from 
the 
Spanish 
original) 
MINISTRY 
OF 
ECONOMY 
Buenos 
Aires, 
April 
30,2003 
Mr. 
James 
D. 
WOLmNSOHN 
PRESIDENT 
THE 
WOIUD 
BANK 
WashinPton, 
D.C. 
Ref: 
Economic 
& 
Social 
Transition Program 
Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn: 
Given 
the 
time 
elapsed 
between the 
policy 
letter 
signed 
in 
the 
month 
of 
March 
and 
the 
progress 
made 
regarding 
the 
Redemption 
of 
Quasi-monies, 
I 
deem 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
introduce 
the 
following 
amendment: 
IX. 
MONETAFtY 
UNIFICATION 
9.1 
9.2 
9.3 
9.4 
9.5 
The 
creation 
of 
quasi-money was 
a 
way 
of 
mitigating 
the 
financial 
crisis 
and 
its 
impact 
on 
the 
finances 
of 
the 
provincial public 
sector, 
especially 
as 
from 
the second 
half 
of 
2001. 
In 
fact, 
quasi-monies 
would not 
have 
been 
created 
had 
there 
been 
an 
orderly 
exit 
from 
the 
Convertibility 
law, 
preventing 
an 
even 
sharper 
downtum 
in 
the levels 
of 
economic 
activity. 
This 
defensive 
response 
from 
the 
provincial 
public 
sectors was encouraged 
by 
the 
Federal 
Government 
in 
a 
last 
attempt 
to 
maintain 
convertibility. 
In 
fact, 
the 
LECOP 
bonds 
issued 
by 
the 
National 
Government 
for 
and 
on 
behalf 
of 
the provinces, 
became 
the 
main 
quasi-money 
in 
circulation 
(approximately 
ARG$3.3 
billion). 
The 
use 
of 
quasi-monies, 
among 
other 
consequences, cause 
an 
erosion 
of 
the 
tax 
basis, since 
their 
extended use 
in 
the 
informal 
economy 
has 
devaluation 
and 
distortionary 
effects 
on 
the 
local 
economies 
and 
their 
quotation 
under 
par 
directly 
affects the 
sectors 
of 
the 
economy 
that have 
the 
lowest 
income 
and 
bargaining 
power. 
Therefore, 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
is 
strategically 
important 
to 
attain 
fiscal 
balance, 
the 
orderly financing 
of 
the 
provinces 
and 
the 
nation, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
reduction 
of 
inequity 
towards 
the 
more 
deprived 
sectors. 
54 
Page  63
9.6 
9.7 
9.8 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
redemption 
of 
quasi-monies 
will 
have 
a 
neutral 
effect 
from 
the 
monetary 
point 
of 
view. 
Both 
the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program 
and 
the 
Orderly  Financing 
Program 
and 
the 
decision 
of 
reducing 
the 
provincial 
arrears 
with 
social 
sectors 
until 
their 
complete 
elimination, 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
agreement reached 
between the 
Government 
of 
Argentina 
and 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund. 
Also, 
these 
economic 
policy 
measures 
enjoy 
political 
and 
social 
consensus. 
The 
main 
observations 
drawn 
from 
the document 
drafted 
by 
the 
IMF's 
expert 
panel 
in 
July, 
2002 regarding 
quasi-moneys, 
are 
the 
following: 
The 
issue 
of 
quasi-monies 
both 
at 
the Federal 
and 
Provincial level 
represents a 
problem for 
monetary 
and 
fiscal 
policy 
because: 
I. 
They 
reduce the 
Peso 
demand 
for 
transaction 
purposes. 
11. 
The 
provincial 
quasi-monies 
have 
a 
high 
circulation 
rate 
because 
in 
terms 
of 
value 
reserve 
they 
are 
inferior 
to 
the 
Peso 
(they 
have 
differing 
acceptability 
values 
in 
the 
jurisdictions 
where 
they 
circulate), 
and 
111. 
They 
are 
extensively 
used 
in 
the 
informal 
economy, 
contributing 
widely 
to 
tax 
evasion. 
Redemption Methodology 
9.9 
9.10 
9.1 
1 
Article 
1 
of 
Law 
No. 
25.561 
provides 
the 
following 
basis: 
1) 
Proceed 
to 
the 
reordering 
of 
the financial, 
banking 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
market 
system; 
2) 
reactivate 
the operation 
of 
the 
economy 
and 
improve 
the 
level 
of 
employment 
and 
income 
distribution, 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
a 
program 
for 
the  development 
of 
the 
regional 
economies; 
3) 
Create 
the conditions 
for 
a 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
that 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
public 
debt; 
4) 
Rule 
on 
the 
restructuring 
of 
those 
obligations 
[that 
are] 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
executed, 
which 
are 
affected 
by 
the 
new 
foreign 
exchange 
regime instituted 
by 
Article 
2. 
Article 
12 
of 
the 
same 
law 
establishes 
that 
within 
the 
term 
and 
in 
a 
manner 
to 
be 
duly 
determined 
by 
the 
regulations, 
the 
National 
Executive Power 
will 
create 
the 
necessary 
arrangements 
to 
proceed 
to 
a swap 
of 
the 
national 
and 
provincial 
securities that 
were 
issued 
as 
substitutes 
for 
the 
national legal 
tender 
throughout the 
country's 
territory,  under 
a 
prior 
agreement 
with 
all 
provincial 
jurisdictions. 
Decree 
743  dated 
March 
28, 
2003 
created 
the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program 
with 
the 
purpose 
of 
redeeming 
those 
provincial 
public 
securities 
which 
meet 
the 
characteristics 
indicated 
in 
Article 
12 
of 
Law 
No. 
25.561 
and 
their 
replacement 
by 
the 
legal 
tender 
national 
currency. 
Due 
to 
the 
characteristics 
of 
their 
bonds, 
the 
Program 
is 
designed 
for 
the provinces 
of 
Buenos Aires, 
Catamarca, 
Cbrdoba,  Corrientes, 
Chaco, 
Entre 
%os, 
Formosa, 
La 
Rioja, 
Mendoza 
and 
Tucumh. 
55 
Page  64
9.12 
To 
participate 
in 
the 
Program, 
the 
provinces 
are 
required 
to 
issue 
the 
necessary 
provincial 
legislation 
to 
adhere 
to 
the Decree, assign 
the 
redemption 
of 
the 
bonds 
to 
the 
National 
State, 
for 
a 
par 
value 
equivalent 
to 
the 
stock 
outstanding 
as 
of 
January 
31, 
2003 
(cut-off 
date), 
assume 
with 
the 
National 
State 
the 
debt 
resulting 
from 
the 
redemption 
and 
secure 
the 
debt 
with 
the 
allocation 
of 
Federal 
Tax-sharing 
resources, 
as 
well 
as 
provide information 
on 
the 
quasi-monies 
as 
at 
the 
cut-off 
date. 
9.13 
They 
also 
have 
to 
undertake 
that, 
once 
the 
program 
has 
been 
finalized, 
should 
there 
remain 
a balance 
of 
outstanding 
bonds,  each 
Province 
will 
make 
the 
necessary arrangements 
to 
revoke 
the 
payment 
capacity 
of 
such 
remnant 
and 
issue 
a 
substitute 
book-entry 
provincial 
bond, 
with 
due 
date 
on 
2006. 
9.14 
The 
decree 
of 
reference authorizes 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
to 
issue 
Bonds 
of 
the 
National 
Government 
denominated 
in 
US. 
Dollars 
LIBOR 
2012 
and/or 
Bonds 
of 
the 
National 
Government 
denominated 
in 
Argentine 
pesos, 
2%  2007, 
with 
a 
par 
value  equivalent 
to 
AR$4.5 
billion 
to 
be 
used 
in 
the 
above Program, 
while 
authorizing 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
to 
agree 
with 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Argentina 
on 
the 
purchase 
of 
the 
provincial 
bonds 
acquired 
by 
the 
same 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the Program. 
9.15 
Since the 
public 
securities 
involved 
in 
the 
Swap 
are 
dispersed 
in 
the hands 
of 
individual 
holders 
and 
financial 
institutions  throughout 
the 
national 
territory, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
instrument 
it 
in 
a 
way 
that 
guarantees 
an 
effective 
and 
transparent 
procedure 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
a short 
time. 
It 
was 
decided 
to 
implement 
it 
through 
public 
tenders 
that 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Argentina 
together 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
The 
later 
will 
establish 
and 
implement 
a special procedure that 
takes 
into 
account 
the situation 
of 
small 
holders 
of 
provincial 
bonds. 
It 
also contemplates 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
direct  redemption 
in 
those 
cases 
where, 
through 
the  application 
of 
the 
tender 
mechanism, 
a 
parity 
is 
observed 
between 
the 
bond's 
par 
value 
and 
the national 
currency. 
9.16 
The 
cut-off 
price 
of 
each tender 
will 
be 
defined 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
using 
market 
references 
as 
at  01/31/03, 
while 
also 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
fiscal 
situation 
of 
the 
corresponding 
province. 
9.17 
Resolution 
No. 
266/2003 
regulating 
the 
Decree 
established that  the 
Program 
is 
to 
be 
implemented through 
public 
bids 
with 
the 
following 
guidelines: 
a) 
bids 
will 
be 
received 
from 
authorized 
financial 
institutions, 
for 
their holdings 
as 
well 
as 
for 
those 
holdings 
of 
third 
parties 
that 
designate 
them 
as 
agents, 
b) 
there 
will 
be 
a 
single 
tender 
per 
province. 
9.18 
The 
Central 
Bank's 
organic 
charter  authorizes 
it, 
in 
article 
3, 
"it 
is 
the 
primary

provides 
for 
a tranche 
of 
so-called

a 
non-competitive 
tranche, 
where 
the 
redemption 
price 
shall 
be 
the 
cut-off price 
defined 
in 
the 
main 
tranche 
with 
an 
additional 
discount 
of 
5%. 
A 
special  tranche  has 
been 
designed 
for 
the 
National, 
Provincial 
and 
Municipal 
Public 
Sector, 
where 
the 
redemption price 
will 
be 
defined 
by 
the 
main 
[tranche]. 
9.22 
There 
is 
also a 
retail 
tranche 
for 
holders 
of 
a 
par 
value 
equivalent 
of 
up 
to 
AR$500 
of 
the 
respective 
bond, 
in 
which 
the 
redemption 
price 
shall 
be 
defined 
by 
the 
main 
tranche 
and 
a 
special 
retail 
tranche 
reserved 
for 
those 
beneficiaries 
which 
effectively 
credit 
that 
they 
have 
received bonds 
as 
the result 
of 
a 
public 
employment 
or 
social security 
relationship, 
up 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
their 
holdings 
in 
accounts 
of 
the 
financial 
agent 
of 
the 
provinces 
as 
of 
the 
date 
of 
the 
tender, 
not 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
par 
value 
equivalent 
to 
the 
last payment received 
by 
them 
in 
bonds. 
Such 
tranche 
is 
to 
be 
redeemed at 
its 
par 
value. 
9.23 
Once 
the 
award 
has 
taken 
place 
and 
the 
National 
Government's 
bonds 
have 
been 
deposited 
with 
the 
Central 
Bank, 
the 
Bank 
will 
credit 
the equivalent 
in 
pesos 
of 
the 
total 
awarded 
in 
the 
current 
accounts 
of 
the 
bidding 
institutions 
that 
have been 
awarded 
in 
the 
tender process. 
Prior to 
that, 
the 
provincial 
bonds 
will 
have been 
annulled. 
9.24 
Decree 
957 
of 
April 
23,2003 
includes 
in 
the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program, 
the 
Provincial 
Obligations  Cancellation 
Bills 
(LECOP, 
for 
the  Spanish 
acronym). 
The 
provinces 
will 
assign 
the 
redemption 
of 
LECOPs for 
the corresponding 
amounts 
pursuant 
to 
Decree 
No. 
1261/02. 
The 
Treasury 
Secretariat 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
will 
provide 
for 
the 
redemption 
of 
those securities 
that 
are 
not 
comprised 
in 
the previous 
paragraph. 
9.25 
The 
above 
Decree 
authorizes  the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
to 
issue 
Bonds 
of 
the 
National 
Government  denominated 
in 
U.S. 
dollars 
LIBOR 
2012 
andor 
Bonds 
of 
the 
National 
Government 
denominated 
in 
Argentine 
pesos 
2% 
2007 
for 
a 
par 
value 
equivalent 
to 
AR$3.3 
billion 
to 
be 
used 
in 
said Program. 
9.26 
The LECOPs 
shall 
be 
redeemed 
directly 
at 
their 
par 
value 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
for 
an 
amount 
equivalent 
to 
the 
revenues 
received 
in 
LECOPs 
by 
the 
Federal 
Administration 
of 
Public 
Revenues 
in 
payment 
for 
national 
taxes. 
9.27 
On 
April 
3, 
2003, 
the 
provinces 
reaffirmed 
their 
will 
to 
achieve 
monetary unification, 
materializing 
the 
consent 
to 
which 
Article 
12 
of 
Law 
No. 
25.561 
refers 
through 
the 
Covenant 
on 
Monetary Reunification 
executed 
on 
said 
date, 
declaring 
that, 
for 
the purpose 
of 
preventing 
the 
Program 
from 
becoming 
excessively burdensome 
for 
the 
Provinces 
and 
57 
Page  66
for 
the 
National 
State, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
make 
some 
regulatory 
adjustments 
in 
order 
to 
allow for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Bonds 
contemplated under 
the 
same 
at 
their 
par 
value. 
9.28 
In 
that 
sense, 
a 
draft 
bill 
has 
been submitted 
to 
Congress, 
whereby the Central 
Bank 
will 
be 
authorized 
to 
receive 
from 
the 
National 
State, 
for 
the 
exclusive 
purpose 
of 
implementing 
the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program, 
the "Bonds 
of 
the 
National 
Government 
denominated 
in 
Argentine 
pesos 
2% 
201 
1" 
at 
their 
par 
value 
and 
for 
up 
to 
a 
par 
value 
amount equivalent 
to 
A.R$7.8 
billion. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
Program 
is 
independent 
from 
the 
approval 
of 
this 
bill 
and 
can 
be 
implemented 
immediately, 
as 
it 
is 
already 
the 
case. 
The 
law 
only 
modifies 
aspects 
connected 
with 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
Central 
Bank 
and 
the 
National 
State. 
9.29 
In 
case 
the 
National 
Congress 
introduces 
any 
modifications 
in 
the 
Monetary 
Unification 
Program 
or 
the instruments 
defined 
for 
its 
implementation,  the 
necessary adjustments 
will 
be 
made 
in 
the 
Program. 
Sincerely 
yours, 
Roberto Lavagna

of 
Economy)

Governments, 
as 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
evidence 
provided

This 
schedule 
is 
not 
the 
currently 
applicable 
schedule 
of 
payments 
to 
the 
IMF 
. 
Rather, 
the 
schedule presents 
all 
payments 
to 
the 
IMF 
under 
the 
illustrative 
assumption that 
repayment 
expectations-except 
for 
SRF 
repayment 
expectations-would 
be 
extended 
to 
their 
respective 
obligation 
dates 
by 
the 
IMF 
Executive 
Board upon 
request 
of 
the 
debtor 
country 
(see 
reDavment 
schedules 
and 
IMF 
lending 
for 
details). 
SW 
repayment 
expectations 
can 
be 
extended 
by 
a 
maximum 
of 
one 
year, 
to 
either 
a 
new 
expectation 
date 
or 
an 
obligation 
date. 
Therefore, 
SRF 
repayments 
are 
shown 
on 
their current 
expectation 
dates, 
unless 
already 
converted 
to 
an 
obligation 
date 
by 
the 
IMF 
Executive 
Board.
