The transfer of the operation and assets of\n            the Rio de Janeiro Subdivision of the Companhia Brasileira\n            de Trens Urbanos (CBTU-RJ) to the state of Rio de Janeiro,\n            the concession to the private sector, the completion of\n            rolling stock and track infrastructure modernization works,\n            and the reduction in fare evasion are factors that bolstered\n            project sustainability. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated satisfactory overall. Lessons learned\n            pertained to: the need for concession or substantial\n            involvement of the private sector in operating and\n            maintaining transport systems following the decentralization\n            of service delivery; the need for modal integration and\n            preventing delays in the delivery of rehabilitated trains,\n            and avoiding demand overestimates; the need to address the\n            problem of fare evasion as early as possible in project\n            implementation to establish the precedents necessary to\n            strongly discourage this behavior among regular riders; and\n            the need to factor in potential delays in train\n            rehabilitation and to avoid quality control problems caused\n            by locally manufactured components by resort to tightening\n            supervision, bolstering monitoring, and implementing penalties."}, "docdt": "2001-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
