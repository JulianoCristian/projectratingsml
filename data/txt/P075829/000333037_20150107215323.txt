 Synopsis

     Jordan has initiated comprehensive education reforms to capitalize on its strong record of education
     completion and adult literacy. Its reforms have strengthened education policy objectives and strategies,
     transformed education programs and practices, improved school buildings and learning environments,
     and enhanced equity in the poorer areas of the country.
