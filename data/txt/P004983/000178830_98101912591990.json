Lessons to be learned are: the absence of envelope\n            material could possibly lead to a shortened working life of\n            the drains as planned, and the flexibility shown by the\n            Government of Egypt and the Bank in accommodating drainage\n            needs as they arose and not rigidly adhering to areas\n            identified at appraisal was highly commendable. To give\n            definite conclusions about the successes and failures of the\n            project, despite the fact that it took four years longer to\n            implement the project than expected, project benefits\n            suffered very little because each drainage sub-area is in a\n            sense a discrete sub-project and benefits normally become\n            available immediately upon completion of each sub-project\n            and there can also be no doubt that the Bank made the\n            appropriate choice in selecting drainage for its first\n            lending activity in the agricultural sector."}, "docdt": "1982-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
