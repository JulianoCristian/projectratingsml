The project would provide tile\n            drainage for about 950,000 feddans. The proposed credit\n            would cover the total foreign exchange costs of US$26\n            million. The principal elements of the project would be: the\n            installation of tile drains by mechanized means; the\n            remodeling of open drains and structures to discharge the\n            greater drainage flows; the construction of eleven pump\n            stations; the construction of workshops and procurement of\n            transport for supporting services; and the employment of\n            consultants to advise and assist the project authority."}, "docdt": "1969-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
