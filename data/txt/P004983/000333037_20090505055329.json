The project would provide tile drainage for\n            about 950,000 feddans. The credit will cover the total\n            foreign exchange costs of US$26 million. The principal\n            elements of the project will be: the installation of tile\n            drains by mechanized means; the remodeling of open drains\n            and structures to discharge the greater drainage flows; the\n            construction of eleven pump stations; the construction of\n            workshops and procurement of transport for supporting\n            services; and the employment of consultants to advise and\n            assist the project authority."}, "docdt": "1979-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
