The project as a whole\n            can be considered a success, as it has met its main\n            objective of replanting the backlog of over-aged,\n            low-yielding smallholder rubber. The Bank's performance\n            during the project cycle was very satisfactory. The project\n            was generally well designed, and both the Bank, and the\n            Borrower performed well throughout the whole project.\n            Implementation suffered some delays due to lack of planting\n            material and adverse weather conditions. The following\n            recommendations were derived from implementation experience:\n            effective extension service must be provided, particularly\n            during the immature period, and early tapping years; timely\n            adjustment of subsidy rates to replanting cost is necessary\n            to maintain an adequate level of incentives for project\n            participants to carry out the essential operations; in\n            addition to the provision of adequate inputs, and technical\n            advice, market price of rubber must be re-numerated in order\n            to encourage farmers to replant and maintain their holdings\n            satisfactorily; and technical competence of staff needs to\n            be periodically upgraded through training, and study tours:\n            visits of mobile units to project areas should be adopted in\n            order to deal with land registration and farmers'\n            problems more expeditiously. The relationship between the\n            Bank and the Borrower during the project period was\n            satisfactory as indicated."}, "docdt": "1990-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
