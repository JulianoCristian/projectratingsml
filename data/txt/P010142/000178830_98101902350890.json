          Project aims to increase rubber production in Sri Lanka\n            through the acceleration of an ongoing program of replanting\n            over-aged, low-yielding smallholder rubber. It would\n            strengthen the agencies involved in smallholder rubber\n            production and provide adequate replanting inputs and\n            incentives. The project also includes improvement in rubber\n            processing standards, expanded training facilities and\n            technical assistance. The project faces no major risk. The\n            problem of constrained implementation capacity has been\n            addressed by building up replanting targets slowly over the\n            project implementation period."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
