7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by 
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses, by enhancing animal and human 
health infectious disease response and control capacities.  To achieve this, three areas will be supported by 
the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment.  Achieving 
these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden of disease and loss of productivity, limiting the 
regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and global 
levels.
