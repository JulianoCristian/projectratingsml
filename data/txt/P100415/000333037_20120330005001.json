           development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it stands to\n            reason that a small project such as this one could have\n            readily been integrated into an ongoing operation. The\n            emergency nature of these interventions, however, combined\n            with the complexity of the topics involving multiple\n            agencies and ministries as stakeholders require a high level\n            of coordination to avoid 'turf battles' and to\n            ensure the full ownership by all. Albeit expensive in\n            supervision proportionally to loan size these small stand\n            alone projects with dedicated implementation\n            responsibilities seem to have better outcomes and\n            cooperation across the sectors than merged operations. The\n            human and veterinarian health sectors need to come closer\n            and link on the basis of good cooperation, mutual trust and\n            benefit at all levels and resisting turf battles. These\n            sectors cannot function on their own in the areas of joint\n            interest, particularly in the resolution of problems they\n            have in common, such as zoonoses, but also to track\n            evolution of epidemic outbreaks and cross species infections\n            and monitoring."}, "docdt": "2011-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
