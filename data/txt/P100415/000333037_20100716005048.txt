SUMMARY
The proposed changes are:
(a) to reallocate the funds originally allocated to the Poultry Compensation Funds
(PCF), i.e. SDR200,000 per Entity, for the purposes of influenza prevention,
preparedness, and planning. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) has
requested to reallocate the funds to purchase respirators for intensive care units (ICU),
and the Republika Srpska to improve animal disease tracking systems, and purchase
personal protection equipment and seasonal vaccines; and
(b) to extend the Closing Date by six months, to provide additional time to carry out
civil works for the Sarajevo Veterinary Faculty Avian Influenza National Reference
Laboratory (Stup) and the Sarajevo Hospital's Kosevo Clinical Center Viral Laboratory
(Kosevo). This would be the first extension of the Closing Date.


PROJECT STATUS
The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the
poultry industry by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other
zoonoses, by enhancing animal and human health infectious disease response and control
capacities. To achieve this, three areas are supported by the project: (i) prevention, (ii)
preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. The mid-term review
mission (April 2010) found that most results have been achieved or are on the way to be
achieved. Taking into account that there has been no AI outbreak since 2006, but the
Global Influenza A H1N1 (H1N1) Pandemic was declared in 2009, project
implementation focused on prevention and preparedness and planning above while
planning for response and containment. The mission also recognized the need to extend
the Closing Date of the project and considers that a six-month extension should be
sufficient to finalize activities, instead of the twelve month requested by the client.

The project performance rating achieving the PDO is Satisfactory (S) because
implementation continues to accelerate and progress has been noted in several areas.
About 47% of the total funds have been disbursed and additional 22% committed. Most
of the project activities have been successfully completed, underway or scheduled to start
shortly. Bids for the rehabilitation of the animal health laboratory are being evaluated and
contract signature should follow soon. Implementation support has intensified and all
activities are being done more timely in a quality manner. Requested reallocation of the
compensation funds and extension of the project closing date for six months until June
30, 2011 will enable entities to procure urgently needed respirators and complete animal
health and human health viral clinic laboratory rehabilitation. The Government is committed
to provide for necessary resources to cover the compensation needs, should an outbreak arise in
the future. In that regard on October 19, 2009, the State Veterinary Office submitted, on behalf of

                                                 4
the entities, evidence of alternative compensation funds in Entity budgets that would be used in
the event of an outbreak, as well as risk analyses indicating low risks of AI outbreaks.
The performance rating for IP (Implementation Progress) is however, Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) because although Monitoring and Evaluation is expected to improve
with the hiring of new consultant, this has not yet happened. The communications
strategy, finally underway, is still delayed in launching survey.

There are no issues with Financial Management and audits are not yet due because the
FY2008 is being combined with FY2009 audit.



PROPOSED CHANGES

·   Results/indicators. Please see Annex 1. Changes reflect the fact that there were no Avian
    Influenza outbreaks since the initial ones in 2006.

·   Reallocations. For each Entity disbursement category (i.e categories 1 and 2 for
    FBiH, categories 3 and 4 for the RS), the category of disbursement related to the
    relevant Poultry Compensation Fund is zeroed out and the funds reallocated to the
    other Entity category. The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic resulted in some of the funds
    originally allocated to the Kosevo ICU rehabilitation to be urgently reallocated for the
    purchase of drugs against H1N1. Since the H1N1 season finally resulted to be
    relatively mild, the FBiH has requested to use now available PCF for buying ICU
    respirators. The Republika Srpska (RS) has prioritized prevention of at risk
    populations by reallocating funds to purchasing seasonal vaccines, personal protective
    equipment as well as building IT capacity to tracking and surveillance of animal
    disease. Annex 1 presents the status of Project Outcome and Intermediate Outcome
    Indicators. As the project is winding down, implementation focus should shift to
    address the so far delayed communications component and M&E issues.

·   Closing date . The Borrower has requested that the Closing Date be extended from
    December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. However, the team believes that the
    pending civil works can be finalized by June 30, 2011, given the fact that
    urbanization and construction permits have been obtained for Stup, as well as the
    urbanization permit for the Kosevo, and both institutions have presented evidence of
    having secured financing from the Sarajevo Canton. The Bids evaluation for Stup
    was done on June 9, 2010, and the Bid Evaluation Report was submitted to the Bank
    on June 18, 2010. No objection was issued on June 19, 2010. Contract signature is
    expected by July 5, 2010. Civil works are supposed to last about eight months. The
    design and supervision contract for Kosovo was signed on June 1, and civil works are
    expected to start in October and last six month.
