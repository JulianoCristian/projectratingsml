                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection
                         and other zoonoses, by enhancing animal and human health infectious disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be supported
                         by the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the
                         burden of disease and loss of productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and
                         global levels.

                         each of the components have been substantially delivered, in some cases adjusted to the prevailing institutional arrangements specific to the country.
                         - Activities under the strategic communications and public information component were substantially delivered including a communication strategy and based on it a final public
                         awareness campaign involving also information for other zoonoses is presently being delivered. While earlier surveys estimated public awareness at 40%, the final awareness
                         campaign is expected to increase that figure to the 50% estimated at appraisal.
                         - Activities related to Animal Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control, including the review and amendment of the regulatory framework, review and definition of
                         control and command functions within concerned agencies, upgrading of laboratory installations and accreditation and training and equipping of sector staff, well as improving animal
                         disease surveillance including selected sampling of wild fowls - were all undertaken.
                         - Under Human Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control - the chains of command were determined, staff were vaccinated and adequate stock of vaccines have been
                         acquired to protect health workers, upgrade diagnostic capacity and early intervention teams were formed and ICU facilities have been dedicated for isolation of critical cases in-line
                         with latest AI recommendations and operational safety procedures have been adapted.
                         - Support to the BiH Culling Compensation Scheme developed a set of procedures that have been adopted, and after reallocation of the funds, a commitment by both entity
                         government to set aside of financial resources for farmer compensation in case of an outbreak.
