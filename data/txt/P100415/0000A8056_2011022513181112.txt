                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection
                         and other zoonoses, by enhancing animal and human health infectious disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be supported
                         by the project: (i) prevention, (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the
                         burden of disease and loss of productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the national, regional, and
                         global levels.

                         The project is on its way to substantially achieve the objectives set out at project design. In both human health veterinary health, regulation, guidelines and procedures have been

                         developed and personnel trained to ensure appropriate response to handle an emerging epidemic. Hospitals have been equipped with isolation wards and diagnostic as well as
                         equipment for care of affected patients to help reduce contamination from possible epidemic outbreaks. The various agencies mandated to intervene have developed a
                         communications strategy that ensures rapid intervention, containment and the adequate dissemination of warnings and up to date information to the public at large.

                         Information on the disease has been widely disseminated to the public through schools and other public institutions and the media to help raise awareness and teach the proper
                         behavior by the population at large towards the find of a suspected infected animal. Civil Works on veterinary laboratories to improve diagnostic capacity and reduce response time
                         to an emerging pandemic are presently being completed.
