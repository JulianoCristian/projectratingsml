Second Growth Policy Reform\n            Credit Supplemental Credit Project for Republic of Niger\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: the\n            programmatic development policy operation approach proved\n            extremely helpful in maintaining dialogue and reforms in a\n            rapidly changing political environment. In particular,\n            having an agreed reform program in place allowed the Bank to\n            engage with the military transition government at a\n            technical level and to continue to support the\n            implementation of these reforms. It would have been unlikely\n            that a new reform program could have been developed and\n            agreed with the transition government. Close collaboration\n            with other partners in a complex political environment is\n            essential to come to a shared assessment of the situation\n            and to adopt a coordinated and coherent approach in dealing\n            with a de facto government. A programmatic development\n            policy operation (DPO) approach plays an important role in\n            keeping the reform agenda on track and mobilizing the\n            Government on cross-cutting issues in an environment of\n            frequent external shocks and instability. Most reforms would\n            have never realized or accelerated without bank support\n            through the growth policy reform series."}, "docdt": "2013-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
