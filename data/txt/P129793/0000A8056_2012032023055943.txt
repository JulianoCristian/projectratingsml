                         The financing agreement was signed on February 24, 2012, one day after Board approval. The team is now working with the authorities to complete the legal requirements for
                         effectiveness and to ensure that the credit can be disbursed as soon as possible and thus respond effectively to the unanticipated additional financing needs that arose in relation to
                         the fallout of the Libyan crisis and the poor harvest. The team is closely monitoring the situation, including new developments with regard to increased insecurity in Mali and Nigeria
                         and new refugee and returning migrant flows from these countries.

                         Progress in the implementation of GPRC-2 is satisfactory, as reported in the program document for this supplemental financing. The government is also continuing the
                         implementation of its crisis mitigation programs and the sale of subsidized food has started on January 31, 2012.
