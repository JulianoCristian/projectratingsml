(b) strengthening forestry research; (c)\n            strengthening information for subsectoral planning; (d)\n            improving the Ministry of Forest's (MOF) manpower\n            development planning and training capacity; and (e)\n            preparing investment projects consistant with subsectoral\n            strategy recommendations. It will also improve watershed\n            conservation measures in the Upper Solo (Wongiri) watershed\n            in Central Java, considered to be the most critical\n            watershed in Indonesia because of erosion and high\n            population density. Finally, it will strengthen management\n            of five existing nature conservation areas, including buffer\n            zone development to preclude exploitation by local\n            inhabitants and technical assisstance for developing models\n            for nationwide replication. Economic benefits expected are\n            longer-term production from the forestry sector, more\n            efficient and higher levels of output and incomes from the\n            sector, better sustenance of the natural environment, and\n            increased agricultural production, longer dam life, and\n            lower irrigation costs in Wonogiri.."}, "docdt": "1988-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
