Conservation Project for Indonesia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability was\n            uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: sustainability in a large forest resource can only\n            be developed over a long term, integrated and sequenced\n            involvement in the sector: to the extent possible, provision\n            should be made for this kind of long term Bank involvement\n            right from the beginning of the initial operation. Inputs to\n            enhance the technical and human resources capacity of\n            forestry agencies to deal with the fundamental problem of\n            long-term sustainability of Indonesia's forest will\n            have limited impact in the longer run if concomitant shifts\n            in policies and incentives are not introduced by the\n            governments. Project launch workshop should be organized to\n            train key project staff in Bank's practice and\n            procedures on procurement, management, particularly when\n            dealing with agencies that have had little experience in\n            Bank operations. Decentralization of watershed management\n            activities at the district level, and a highly competent\n            district level administration are important factors in the\n            successful implementation of such initiatives."}, "docdt": "1997-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
