It consists of: (a)\n            construction of a pipeline from the Castelo de Bode\n            reservoir to the Lisbon region and related pumping and\n            treatment facilities; (b) expansion of the Lisbon region\n            water distribution system and (c) studies for the\n            regionalization of sanitary services in the Lisbon area and\n            water supply and sewerage feasibility studies in the Porto\n            and Alxarve regions; and short period training abroad for\n            DGSB and EPAL senior staff. The beneficiaries would be 2.6\n            million people in the Lisbon region, currently including\n            some 300,000 urban poor."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
