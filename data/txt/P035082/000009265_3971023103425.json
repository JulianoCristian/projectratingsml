To this end, the project\n            pursues the following two inter-related objectives.  First,\n            it will provide long-term financial resources to commercial\n            banks for municipal lending in the infrastructure sector.\n            And second, it will help the banks identify and prepare a\n            sustained pipeline of viable investment projects, backed by\n            creditworthy towns or local utilities. The project will\n            consist of a single-currency loan to each of two selected\n            commercial banks.  The loans finance a program of long term\n            subloans issued by these banks to municipalities and\n            revenue-earning municipal service enterprises.  The project\n            will also promote the channeling of donor-provided technical\n            assistance resources (through the Municipal Development\n            Agency-MDA) to market participants including: 1)\n            municipalities, in the areas of project preparation and\n            financial management; 2) banks, for appraising municipal\n            credit and structuring robust loan security arrangements;\n            and 3) the MDA to strengthen its continuing role as a\n            facilitator of municipal investment."}, "docdt": "1997-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
