publicity generated from the preparation/launch of\n            the project and the training events led by the Municipal\n            Development Agency (MDA) did have some positive impact,\n            there is little firm evidence that the project fulfilled the\n            objective of creating and maintaining a pipeline of bankable\n            municipal infrastructure projects. Project sustainability is\n            rated likely. Overall, World Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, as is Borrower performance, based on the\n            performance of the two participating banks and the\n            Government during preparation and of the banks during\n            implementation. Lessons learned included the following: The\n            state of Poland's economy changed, pertinent laws and\n            regulation changed, and the banking/municipal sectors\n            changed. The availability of more flexible lending\n            instruments and more flexibility to switch from one\n            instrument to another could have enabled the Bank and the\n            Borrower to react more quickly to changing circumstances.\n            Although desirable from a developmental point of view,\n            requiring the banks to enter into complex cost recovery\n            computations or conditionality and require full cost\n            recovery was not workable in an environment where full cost\n            recovery for wastewater investments is currently rarely\n            achieved. Also, a commercial bank line of credit was an\n            inappropriate mechanism for requiring procurement procedures\n            that differed from those of the procurement law."}, "docdt": "2002-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
