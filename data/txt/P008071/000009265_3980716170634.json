The project\n            had two specific objectives: The physical objective was to\n            improve the reliability and long-term requirements for\n            potable water supply within the capital city of Castries and\n            the northwest region ofSt. Lucia. Completion of this\n            objective was highly successful. the institutional objective\n            was to strengthen the capabilities of the WASA management,\n            operation and maintenance, and to enhance resource\n            mobilization. Generally the findings are in keeping with\n            those of similar sector projects in theCaribbean. Physicalw\n            orks are usuallyc ompletedw ithout significant problems,but\n            thoserelated to institution building,and specificallyto\n            improved  financial performance aredifficult to achieve.\n            Specific findings and lessons learned are as follows: To\n            successfully execute large projects in small economies it is\n            essential to use experienced foreign consultants. Limited\n            local resources make it difficult to adequately address\n            implementation issues in a timely manner. The creation of a\n            strong project implementation unit and use of experienced\n            external foreign experts ensure project success. It is\n            difficult to judge at the time of project preparation\n            whether institutional changes mutually agreed upon during\n            negotiation will indeed be implemented. However during\n            project implementation there was minimal success.\n            Institutional change takes time and needs to be considered\n            in stages over a number of projects."}, "docdt": "1998-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
