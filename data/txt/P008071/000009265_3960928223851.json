) and the\n            Northwest part of the island; and b) to strengthen the\n            institutional and financial performance of WASA.  The\n            project will comprise the following four components : 1)\n            Roseau Dam water supply scheme which includes a reservoir on\n            the upper reaches of the Roseau River, raw water pumping,\n            transmission and treatment; 2) purchase of operation and\n            maintenance equipment ( computer hardware, software, leak\n            detection equipment, water meters etc ); 3) technical\n            assistance and training which includes consulting services\n            and manpower training programs; and 4) project management\n            and administration which will include the staffing of the\n            Project Management Unit and provision of consulting services\n            to the PMU."}, "docdt": "1990-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
