the Privatization and\n            Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC) Project for\n            Kyrgyz Republic were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the Privatization and Enterprise Sector\n            Adjustment Credit has served to confirm the lessons that\n            have been learned earlier with other adjustment operations\n            and also lessons that are being learned as Bank continues to\n            provide support to transitional economies. When and where an\n            enterprise was privatized through transferring a controlling\n            block of shares, the new owners have demonstrated their\n            capability to be efficient owners, contributing to the\n            corporate governance and efficiency. It will be important to\n            further closely monitor and explore the privatization\n            process in the Kyrgyz Republic and elsewhere in transitional\n            economies, to obtain more solid empirical evidence on the\n            impact of various privatization policies on the performance\n            of privatized enterprises. Pre-privatization restructuring\n            also helped greatly to enable or accelerate the\n            privatization of these companies: 15 out of 21 restructured\n            enterprises have already been privatized, and the remaining\n            6 are currently candidates for privatization."}, "docdt": "1997-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
