         regions at Jinhua, Jiujiang, and Baoji to experiment with\n            new ways to improve capability for planning and delivery of\n            health services by establishing policy criteria and systems\n            for financing investment in the regions and supporting\n            investments in the provincial capitals. The regional and\n            provincial project components are: (i) health planning,\n            management and reform; (ii) disease prevention and\n            surveillance; (iii) health education; (iv) maternal and\n            child health services; (v) emergency services; (vi) hospital\n            services; (vii) rehabilitative medical services; (viii)\n            medical education and training; and (ix) equipment\n            management. Medical education, health education, and\n            emergency service investments at the provincial level will\n            receive additional support beyond that needed to just\n            support the project region. A national component to\n            strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Public Health\n            to guide, assess and replicate the project and to begin to\n            deal with issues which transcend the provincial and local\n            levels is also being supported by the project."}, "docdt": "1989-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
