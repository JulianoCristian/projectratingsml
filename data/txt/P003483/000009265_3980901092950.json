Some of the lessons learned are: 1)\n            successful project design depends on adequate sector\n            analysis. In this project, timely presentation of relevant,\n            high quality sector work persuaded key government officials\n            of the importance and feasibility of the project's\n            basic concept and strategy; 2) flexibility in resource\n            allocation and activity scheduling, associated with clear\n            policy guidelines and a rigorous annual review, are key\n            strategies for successful sector improvement projects, and\n            contribute to sustainable management capacity; 3)\n            decentralization of the special account facility, financial\n            information and other progress data in the project areas can\n            streamline both implementation and monitoring and build\n            management capacity; and 4) the Government's high level\n            commitment to health policy reform and its attention to the\n            project experience enabled the project to contribute to\n            national policy and strategy for decentralizing health\n            planning and resource allocation."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
