                                  Restructuring Paper



1.     The closing date for Sudan, Emergency Transport and Infrastructure
Development Project (SETIDP) – MDTF-SS, TF056051, P095081 will be extended from
June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.       The Emergency Rehabilitation Works in Juba (ERWJ), Emergency Accessibility
Improvement Project (EAIP), the reconstruction of the Faraksika-Yambio road and
institutional development activities are completed. The design of priority trunk roads and
the design of 1,400 km of feeder roads are expected to be completed before June 30,
2011. The project development objective will be fully achieved upon completion of the
design activities. However, the contractors and consultants have submitted claims in the
amount of about US$60 million. Claims assessment is in progress, but completion of the
assessment and settlement of claims will extend beyond June 30, 2011.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to: (i) complete the claims assessment and
prepare final account, including compensations; (ii) conduct claims settlement
negotiations; and (iii) engage consultants that would support the implementing
institutions in conducting negotiations and additional claims review, as required. The
Recipient has submitted an acceptable implementation plan to complete the outstanding
activities within the proposed closing date of June 30, 2012.

4.     This will be the second extension of the project.
