                   DEVELOPMENT PROJECT – MDTF-SS

                                   Restructuring Paper



1.    The closing date for Sudan, SD- Emergency TRANSPORT AND
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SETIDP) – MDTF-SS, TF056051,
P095081 will be extended from December 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

2.      The Emergency Rehabilitation Works in Juba (ERWJ) and Emergency
Accessibility Improvement Project (EAIP) are completed. The reconstruction of the
Faraksika-Yambio road; the design of priority trunk roads; as well as institutional
development activities are near completion. However, the design of 1500 km of feeder
roads, and final account preparation and settlement of claims for the ERWJ may extend
beyond December 2010. The project development objective will be achieved upon
completion of the ongoing activities.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to: i) complete the feeder roads study that
was interrupted due to in securities in some of the project areas; ii) extend the sealing
works on limited critical sections (about 6 to 7 km) of the Farksika-Yambio road to avoid
premature failure of the road and reduce health and safety hazards, with the savings from
the road contracts; iii) resolve outstanding claims related to the ERWJ; and iv) to
continue with the provision of training and Technical Assistance (TA) services to further
strengthen implementation capacity. The Recipient has submitted acceptable
implementation plan to complete the project within the proposed closing date of June 30,
2011.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
