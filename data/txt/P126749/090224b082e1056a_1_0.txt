Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The loan became effective in December 2013, was fully disbursed, and closed on December 31st, 2014. The Municipal Government of Belo
 Horizonte (PBH – Prefeitura de Belo Horizonte) made steady progress in the implementation of policies under the three pillars of the DPL: (i)
 inclusive urban development; (ii) green and sustainable practices; and (iii) socially and fiscally sustainable urban governance. Notable advances
 include (i) 16,342 families benefited from land regularization, compared to the goal of 12,155 (indicator no. 1); (ii) the number of new low incoming
 housing units reached 13,575, exceeding the goal of 5,302 (indicator no.2); (iii) 98% of users are satisfied with the customer service that they receive
 from BH Resolve compared to a target of 90% (indicator no. 9); and (iv) 72% of projects decided by the community are included in the city’s multi-
 year plan, surpassing the goal of 25% (indicator no.14). However, five of the project’s 16 indicators were not met by the close of the project at the end
 of December 2014. Nevertheless, the project highlighted the strong technical capacity of the PBH and the policies developed can serve as examples
 of effective practices for other municipalities in Brazil and the region. Similarly, the project was only the Bank’s second Development Policy Loan at
 the municipal level and first focused on urban development, and yielded many valuable insights on development policy lending at the municipal level.
