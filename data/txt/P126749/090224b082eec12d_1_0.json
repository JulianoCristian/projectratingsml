"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Belo Horizonte Inclusive\n            Urban Development Policy Loan Project for Brazil were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: in the context of multi-sector operations, it is\n            important to ensure the coherence of the various PDOs. In\n            the case of this DPL, PDO 3 was less connected than the\n            other two PDOs and of a level of technical and political\n            complexity that was incompatible with that of an integrated\n            multi-sector operation. When there are substantial delays\n            between approval and effectiveness, reappraisal may be\n            warranted. In the case of this operation, almost two years\n            elapsed between approval and effectiveness. By then, the\n            baselines and many of the targets within the Results\n            Framework were obsolete. Sub-national operations offer great\n            potential for cross-fertilization and economies of scale. As\n            illustrated by this operation, successful innovations\n            supported under subnational operations can be easily\n            replicated in other states and municipalities. Likewise,\n            there is potential for vertical economies of scale and\n            homogenization by interacting with municipal, state and\n            federal actors simultaneously. When working at the\n            sub-national level, it is critical to maintain close\n            coordination with the federal government to ensure the\n            seamless integration of federally funded programs with\n            subnational policies. Ongoing changes in patterns in public\n            participation and service delivery may deserve a more\n            in-depth exploration. This operation points to an ongoing\n            shift away from traditional in-person forms of communication\n            (i.e., committees, assemblies, community meetings, in-person\n            customer service) to emerging forms of online communication\n            (i.e., on-line discussion boards and blogs, interest groups,\n            online customer service). This presents a good opportunity\n            for the Bank to review participatory and service provision\n            strategies under the new citizen engagement framework that\n            has just been set."}, "docdt": "2015-05-26T00:57:04Z"}
