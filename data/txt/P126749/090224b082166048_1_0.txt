                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Development Policy Loan was prepared in Fall 2011, approved on June 14, 2013, and was approved by the Senate on December 3, 2013. The project processing was delayed
                         due to the pending resolution of internal clearances within the client administration which took about a year to be finalized. Once these issues were addressed, the appraisal of the
                         project was updated.

                         The loan remains based in the Prior Actions that continue to guide municipal policy in Belo Horizonte, as evidenced by the passing of relevant legislation pertaining to each of the
                         Actions. The indicators designated in the original loan also remain unchanged. The key changes are the extension of project targets from 2012 to 2013, as well as the closing date
                         from June 2013 to December 2014 due to the delay in loan approval.

                         The Prior Actions and the ongoing progress of the PBH in advancing these actions include the following:

                         Prior Action 1. The PBH a) strengthened its urban legislation by incorporating several innovative instruments in matters of land use, management and urban planning to reduce social
                         exclusion; and (b) supported the expansion of private sector provision of low-income housing to its population, as evidenced by passing the Land Use Law (updated in 2010) and
                         Land Donation Law (2010) . The PBH remains committed to the implementation of these acts of legislation, and continues to advance in this area by undertaking a study to expand
                         the adoption of the land use instruments put forward by the legislation, which will in turn be the basis for the proposal of a new law.

                         Prior Action 2. The PBH enhanced resident ownership in its low-income housing program by developing and implementing a model for social inclusion and sustainable livelihood,
                         which was evidenced by the institution of the Pré and Pós Morar program as well as its management team. The PBH has continued to support ownership in its low-income housing
                         program by improving access to improved living conditions and basic service provision.

                         Prior Action 3. The PBH launched a program to identify the most vulnerable families in its territory and has enabled the development of a vulnerable family-dedicated plan with
                         tailored assistance,as met by the implementation of the Família Cidadã Cidade Solitária program, which has continued to define its manual of operation and methodology. The PBH
                         has continued to advance in this area by elaborating a budget for 2013 to continue the program’s activities.

                         Prior Action 4. The PBH improved its service delivery by establishing a functioning single point of access for comprehensive delivery of all municipal services, known as BH Resolve.
                         The activities surrounding this program have increased progressively since the negotiations, as evidenced by the increase in the number of citizens attending the “one-stop-shop”
                         offices created by the program (from 4,674 daily in 2010 to 5,069 daily in 2012).

                         Prior Action 5. The PBH strengthened its legal and institutional framework for climate change mitigation and promotes sustainable growth policies through the passing of the Climate
                         Change Law and support for the elaboration of a Municipal Climate Change Plan, which involved the implementation of the Rapid Assessment of City Energy (TRACE). The PBH has
                         continued to advance in this area by presenting the TRACE assessment at the Local Governments for Sustainability World Congress, which was hosted by Belo Horizonte in June
                         2012.

                         Prior Action 6. The PBH established a disaster management strategy and has put into operation a monitoring and alert system for high rainfall events in critical areas of its territory.
                         This was carried out through the establishment of the Strategic Plan of the Civil Defense, the creation of a Contingency Plan for an early alert system, and ongoing activity reports
                         from the system. Annual contingency plans have continued to be prepared under the guidance of an overall sectorial strategy. At the time of negotiations the 2012 Contingency Plan
                         was already in effect, and the 2013 Plan was scheduled to be approved in July of this year.

                         Prior Action 7. The PBH promoted long-term sustainable city development by establishing a results-based management model for long-term governance. met by the establishment of
                         the BH Metas e Resultados, a permanent secretariat responsible for issuing the 2030 Vision plan. The first phase of BH Metas e Resultados achieved its stated goals for 2012,
                         coinciding with the end of the last Administration. The new Administration is choosing to continue the program and is currently in the process of preparing new goals for the following
                         administrative cycle.

                         Prior Action 8. The PBH strengthened urban governance by broadening participatory mechanisms for budget execution, carried out through the formal recognition of the city’s 40
                         territories and the institutionalization of the Committee for Participatory Planning. The Committee’s efforts have resulted in 2,500 proposals from the territories as part of the
                         participatory cycle which ended in June 2012. The PBH has continued to advance in this area by setting up a working group to assess proposals to be included in the 2013 budget.

                         Prior Action 9. The PBH improved long-term fiscal sustainability by reforming its civil servant retirement and pension system, which involved contribution to the pension fund
                         (BHPREV) by new civil servants. New civil servants have already begun to contribute to BHPREV.
