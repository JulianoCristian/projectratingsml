Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The loan became effective in December 2013 and is fully disbursed. The Municipal Government of Belo Horizonte (PBH – Prefeitura de Belo
 Horizonte) has made steady progress in the implementation of policies under the three pillars of the DPL: (i) inclusive urban development; (ii) green
 and sustainable practices; and (iii) socially and fiscally sustainable urban governance. Notable advances include (i) 16,342 families benefited from
 land regularization, compared to the goal of 12,155 (indicator no. 1); (ii) the number of new low incoming housing units reached 13,575, exceeding
 the goal of 5,302 (indicator no.2); (iii) 98% of users are satisfied with the customer service that they receive from BH Resolve compared to a target of
 90% (indicator no. 9); and (iv) 72% of projects decided by the community are included in the city’s multi-year plan, surpassing the goal of 25%
 (indicator no.14). These experiences have highlighted the strong technical capacity of the PBH and can serve as examples of effective practices for
 other municipalities in Brazil and the region. However, six of the project’s 16 indicators have not been met and are unlikely to be achieved by the
 close of the project on 31 December 2014.

               This pilot program for housing rehabilitation did not achieve the results expected, as only 24 houses out of a goal of 250 were rehabilitated.
               A further 14 houses are being repaired as of December 2014 and are expected to be completed by the project closing date. Land tenure
               issues among the target population complicated the process, as did a lack of interest on the part of contractors to undertake small-scale

               The indicator target was established based on the planned opening of two additional in-person service centers; however, these centers are
               now not expected to open until 2016 due to delays in determining the optimal siting within two municipal regions. BH Resolve also provides
               customer service via telephone and the internet which may have resulted in some users switching away from in-person services.

               the service provider for maintenance and data transmission expired and were not renewed. It is expected that the contracts will be renewed
               and the database will be again operational by March 2015. The disaster events database is working as of December 2014.

               Civil society participation fell 75 percent from 36,457 in 2011 to 8900 in 2013. This is due to an over-optimistic estimation of participation at
               the time the indicator was established of the capacity of the PBH to promote public participation, as well as an uncharacteristically high
               baseline in 2011.
