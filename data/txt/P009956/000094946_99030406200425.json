The key lessons learned include: a)\n            Desirable macro-economic policy change can sometimes\n            adversely impact on the stated objectives of ongoing Bank\n            operations designed under a sub-optimal policy framework. b)\n            The Bank's involvement at the subsector level can be a\n            desirable complement to macro-economic policy dialog. c) The\n            project demonstrates that not only the borrowers, but the\n            Bank also needs to be responsive to market forces. Two years\n            before the terms of Bank lending were altered from currency\n            pool to single currency loans, at the borrower's\n            option, this project exhibited such a requirement. d) The\n            collaboration with Swiss Agency for Development and\n            Cooperation was not as smooth as it could have been. If an\n            explicit project launch workshop was conducted early on, at\n            which respective roles were clearly defined and a framework\n            for project supervision and monitoring put in place,\n            collaboration with cofinancier could have been more amicable\n            and effective. e) Early involvement of the implementing\n            agencies with the project preparation activity would reduce\n            time required to bring the implementation unit up to speed\n            with project design and avoid gestation lags. f) The scope\n            of pilot scale projects should include a design for\n            evaluation of the pilot-scale activity."}, "docdt": "1997-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
