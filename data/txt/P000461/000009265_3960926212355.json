for addressing key\n            macroeconomic and sectoral issues facing the C.A.R over the\n            medium term. The basic elements of the program strategy are:\n            (1) promotion of agricultural-led growth based on\n            comparative advantage and a progressive opening of the\n            economy to market forces; (2) retrenchment of the public\n            sector and stimulation of private sector initiatives; and\n            (3) mobilization of sufficient financial resources to\n            support the program on concessional terms and in directions\n            dictated by the priorities defined in the plan. This\n            strategy will be implemented through a coherent set of\n            policies for macroeconomic management, agriculture, mining,\n            public enterprises and through the implementation of a far\n            reaching civil service reform."}, "docdt": "1988-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
