The unexpected lesson was that the productive\n            subprojects dealing with production/marketing chains,\n            irrigation, and resource conservation, which were on a\n            completely separate track from the other components, turned\n            out to have important catalytic effects for capacity\n            building. The very high demand for scarce grant financing\n            overshadowed the interest in capacity building. Nonetheless,\n            there was a catalytic effect on the incentives for\n            cooperation and collective action. Productive subprojects\n            energized the demand for capacity enhancement and in the\n            case of existing but stagnant organizations, provided them\n            with a renewed purpose. The significant lesson is that a\n            well-integrated amalgam of 'hard' and\n            'soft' resources is needed for effective capacity\n            building. The experience of PROLOCAL calls for a rethinking\n            of how best to provide ongoing technical and institutional\n            support for the organizations that have been launched by a\n            given project intervention toward more solid high performing\n            entities, but need continuous and affordable support. For\n            the future, this points to the creation of central service\n            centers, linked to existing second-level or umbrella\n            associations. Such centers could be financed initially by\n            the project but on a declining share, as the proportion of\n            national and local co-financing increases. In the case of\n            productive enterprise development, as the income of the\n            members grows, the capacity of payment for services\n            increases. The public subsidy portion can be justified as\n            'software' investments, necessary to ensure the\n            success of the supply of productive infrastructure and inputs."}, "docdt": "2008-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
