F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document):

PROLOCAL's development objective was to support local empowerment, improve
quality of local services, and increase access to productive assets by the rural poor in six
poor micro-regions of the country. To address these issues, PROLOCAL emphasized the
importance of (i) social capital development based on local organization, (ii) human
capital formation based on education and services, and (iii) access to productive assets
based on sustainable use of natural resources, value-added chains, and off-farm economic
opportunities linked to peri-urban activity.

Benchmark indicators of project performance included: (i) 60,000 households take active
role in elaborating own local development plans; (ii) 150 local governments collaborate
with beneficiaries in generating development plans at the parroquia (sub-municipal
government) and cantón (municipal territory, formed by group of parroquias) levels; (iii)
80% of expected counterpart contributions are made available by local organizations; (iv)
30% of individuals participating in community development planning process are
women; (v) 80% of beneficiaries are poor; (vi) beneficiary households improve access to
productive assets; (vii) beneficiary households improve access to quality rural
development services; (viii) income level of subproject beneficiaries improves by 15%;
and (ix) under-employment among beneficiaries households decreases by 20%.

Comments         Actual value achieved was 140% of the target value. Since the level of
(incl.         % participation is a partial indicator of local empowerment, this PDO element
achievement)     was successfully achieved.

Comments         Achievement of less than the originally planned number of development
(incl.         % plans (84%) does not reflect reduced project efficiency but the fact that
achievement)     some local governments decided to elaborate or update their development
                 plans at the cantón level which covered several parroquias within their
                 jurisdictions. Indeed, 84,000 households participated in local planning
                 processes which surpassed the component target of 60,000. Given current
                 levels of institutionalization reached by local development plans and their
                 demonstrated effectiveness and likely sustainability as partnership
                 agreements between local governments and civil society in setting
                 development priorities, this PDO indicator was largely achieved.

 Comments            The formulation of less than the originally planned number of subproject
 (incl.          % profiles is not an indication of reduced project efficiency or increased costs
 achievement)        per beneficiary. Instead, the average subproject scale that was co-financed
                     by PROLOCAL was larger than expected at project appraisal, and the actual
                     number of beneficiary families (38,000) surpassed original targets. The
                     adjustment in project scale was justified in order to avoid internal conflicts
                     within communities, as community cost ceilings were found to excessively
                     constrain the number families able to participate in the subprojects. In light
                     of this, the concept of community subprojects was changed to subprojects
                     involving one or more communities and groups organized around the same
                     objectives, while maintaining the cost ceiling per beneficiary family within
                     the levels estimated at appraisal. Overall project investment in subprojects
                     was also much greater: US $37.2 million instead of the expected US $20.2
                     million due to larger beneficiary contributions that surpassed appraisal
                     expectations providing 46% of total investments (target was 20%).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At project appraisal, poverty in Ecuador was widespread and income inequality was
pronounced. In 1998, the incidence of poverty in the country was estimated at almost
63%, up from 56% in 1995. Similarly, extreme poverty during the same period increased
by more than 30%, from 20 to 27%. Poverty was higher in rural areas, characterized by
lack of education, lack of access to land by the poor, and few non-agricultural
employment opportunities. The poor, but particularly women, had more limited access to
the formal labor, land, and credit markets and lacked effective political participation.

Institutional instability in Ecuador, reflected by high leadership turnover, was a serious
problem. Regional jealousies and fragmented political parties made any consensus
reached hard to sustain. Public regulatory and administrative institutions were weak and
inefficient. At the same time, the economic crisis had severely reduced government
resources to finance public services, and the shrinking banking system was unable to
provide formal credit to finance an expansion in economic activity.

Growth of most rural activities had been based on increased agricultural land expansion,
but this trend required the poor to cultivate less productive land in forested and
mountainous terrain, with negative impacts on the country's biodiversity and
environment. As a result, Ecuador was losing rainforests and coastal wetlands at an
alarming rate. Soil and water resources were poorly managed, especially in the Sierra, the
central region of the Country.

To address these issues, in August 2000 the Government released a comprehensive policy
document Plan de Gobierno 2000-2003, which emphasized the importance of: (i) social
capital development based on organizations; (ii) human capital formation based on
education and services; and (iii) access to productive assets based on the sustainable use
of the productive potential of the natural resources of the country. The Poverty Reduction
and Local Rural Development (PROLOCAL) Project was built on these three pillars.

Rationale for Bank Assistance: The Bank has a long history in rural and non-rural
development in Ecuador.        In addition, the Bank's extensive experience in rural
development across the world and particularly in Latin America meant that successful
methodologies and approaches were accessible to the Ecuadorian project team during the
preparation of the project.      During the design of the project, the Bank and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) were co-financing the Afro-
Ecuadorian Development Project (PRODEPINE), a local rural development project based
on ethnic targeting whose experiences and lessons, for instance in local participation
techniques, were utilized in designing PROLOCAL. In addition, the former Ecuador
Rural Development Project (PRONADER), the Modernization of the State Project




                                             13

(MOSTA) and the Municipal Development Program (PDM) provided important lessons
to the design and preparation of PROLOCAL.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO of PROLOCAL is to support local empowerment, improve quality of local
services, and increase access to productive assets to improve the well being of poor
households in six micro-regions of the country.

To measure the level of achievement of the PDO, the Results Framework of the PAD
developed nine benchmark indicators. These were:

       60,000 households take active role in elaborating own local development plans;
       150 local governments collaborate with beneficiaries in generating development
       plans at the parroquia (sub-municipal government) level, the smallest territorial
       administrative level, and cantón (municipal territory, formed by group of
       parroquias) level;
       80% of expected counterpart contributions are made available by local
       organizations;
       30% of individuals participating in community development planning process are
       women;
       80% of beneficiaries are poor;
       Beneficiary households improve access to productive assets;
       Beneficiary households improve access to quality rural development services;
       Income level of beneficiaries of productive subprojects improves by 15%; and
       Under-employment among beneficiary households decreases by 20%.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objective of the project remained the same throughout the project implementation
due to its relevance in improving the wellbeing of the rural poor in under-developed
geographical regions of Ecuador.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The PDO captured adequately and clearly stated its target beneficiaries. The targeted
project beneficiaries were the rural poor living in poor regions. Geographic targeting was
envisaged ­ a total of 120 of the poorest parroquias in 31 cantones, grouped in six micro-
regions in the coastal and Andean foothill areas of the country were targeted. The six
micro-regions were defined according to geographical boundaries but reflecting
groupings with strong economic, cultural and social links. They included: Zona Sur de
Manabí, Zona Occidental de Los Ríos, Estribaciones Centrales de Los Andes, Zona
Oriental de Loja, Cuenca Alta del Río Jubones and Cuenca del Río El Ángel. The total
area covered was 19,000 squared kilometers, or 8% of the national territory, and included
more than 800,000 people.        The poor living in these micro-regions, estimated at



                                             14

approximately 600,000 people, or 120,000 households, were PROLOCAL's target
population.

Major benefits expected from the project included: (i) social capital development based
on the strengthening of local organizational capacity and empowerment of local-level
institutions, (ii) human capital formation based on promotion of local networks of local
service providers and certification of capabilities to support local development planning
processes and services, and (iii) access to productive assets based on investments
intended to create employment, diversify production, and increase income.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

PROLOCAL had three technical components and project coordination:

Component A: Planning for local development (US $2.80 million or 6.4 % of the total
project cost). The component was designed to promote social capital formation by
supporting planning for local development at community, junta parroquial and cantón
levels. Through this planning process, rural communities identified priority subproject
proposals, a subset of which was selected for preparation and financing by PROLOCAL.
Participating communities were expected to mobilize other funding sources to finance
other identified subproject investments, which may not be financed with PROLOCAL
resources. Component A was expected to facilitate identification of approximately 2250
subproject profiles: 1800 subprojects in at least 600 participating communities, 360
subprojects in 120 parroquias and 90 subprojects in 30 cantones. It had three sub-
components: (i) coordination and participation, to fully familiarize the target group with
the project objectives and procedures through communication activities; (ii) planning and
project preparation, to support local actors to prepare participatory local development
plans and subprojects; and (iii) information sharing, to systematically organize and
disseminate relevant information in a timely manner at the local and national level.

Component B: Improved supply of local development related services (US $6.97
million or 15.6% of the total project cost). This component was designed to promote
human capital formation by offering in-service training for providers of local
development services, such as grass-root organizations, NGOs, second-tier organizations,
associations, juntas parroquiales and concejos cantonales. It aimed at providing a tiered
sequence of activities beginning with "training of trainers" in phase I. In phase II, the
component was to train the leadership and technicians of the local organizations that
would identify and implement subprojects.        In phase III, certified local consulting
services providers were expected to provide technical assistance to local governments
that were interested in promoting democratic participation and transparent management
and administration. Component B included four sub-components: (i) strengthening local
networks of service providers; (ii) strengthening human capital of grass-root and
second/third-tier organizations; (iii) strengthening human capital of local governments
and promotion of democratic processes; and (iv) establishing an information system on
prices, technologies and market opportunities (ECUALOCAL). The latter was to be
composed of two sub-systems: (a) ECUAGRO, to be ran by Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock (MAG) and NGOs, to contain information on agricultural production and


                                            15

competitiveness; and (b) INFOPLAN, to be ran by the Office of Planning of the
Presidency (Oficina de Planificación de la Presidencia, ODEPLAN), and to include
basic territorial information for decision-making of governments and local development
institutions.

Component C: Subprojects (US $24.07 million or 54.0% of total project cost).
Component C, by far the major component of the project, was aimed at improving access
to productive assets by establishing a demand-driven matching grant fund for productive
and environmental investments. It would co-finance community and inter-community
subprojects within the targeted micro-regions. A total of 930 subprojects, 750 at
community level, 150 at parroquia level and 30 at inter-parroquia level were to be
supported under this component. It had three subcomponents: (i) subproject preparation;
(ii) subproject implementation; and (iii) subproject monitoring and evaluation. In terms
of process, the technical screening of identified subprojects was to be undertaken by the
project's technical personnel at regional level, according to the criteria defined in the
Operational Manual. The subprojects were to be implemented on the basis of contracts
between the Regional Coordination Units (UTRs) and the beneficiary groups. When the
beneficiary groups lacked proper legal status, the subproject execution was to be carried
out by third parties, selected by the beneficiaries, through tripartite contracts with the
beneficiaries and UTRs. The project's administration staff at the regional level was
expected to follow and monitor closely the subproject expenditure accounts.

Component D: Project Coordination Unit (US $5.11 million or 11.5% of the total
project cost). This component was to carry out the traditional PIU tasks, including
managerial, financial and technical coordination at national and regional levels. The
National Coordination Unit (UCN) and the six Regional Coordination Units (UTRs) were
to be responsible for overall project planning; including financial, procurement and
personnel management; monitoring of inputs, outputs, effects and impacts at various
levels; risk management; implementation of a communication strategy; implementation
of project activities according to the project implementation plan and the Operational
Manual; coordination among institutional actors at national and regional levels; and
support to the national institutions in deriving lessons and formulating policies for human
development. The component was to finance the costs associated with consultant services
and equipment.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no formal revisions to the four project components financed under the IBRD
loan (i.e. those described in Section 1.5 above). However, a fifth component, "Improved
Rural Financial Systems" (US $5.6 million or 12.5% of the project cost), financed by the
European Commission (EC), was incorporated and implemented as an integral and
critical part of the project (see Section 1.7 below).

1.7 Other significant changes

Design issues



                                              16

The original design of PROLOCAL, as proposed by the Government of Ecuador
preparation team, included four technical components and Project Coordination. These
were described in Section 1.5 above. However, the fifth component (Improved Rural
Financial Systems) was not financed under the IBRD loan. The component was designed
to provide micro-financial services in the six micro-regions targeted by PROLOCAL,
mostly through 64 unregulated local financial institutions (EFLs) that were identified
during the preparation phase. In addition, the component was to execute technical
assistance activities with the identified EFLs, and provide implementation support
through PROLOCAL UCN and UTRs.

The fifth component was not included in the IBRD loan as Bank's management
considered that providing micro-financial services in the country's prevailing context at
the time of preparation was highly risky. However, at a later stage during the pre-
implementation phase, it was reinstated in the project as per the original design after the
Government of Ecuador managed to secure parallel grant financing from the EC to fully
finance the component. Therefore, the IBRD loan financed four technical components,
but in actual terms PROLOCAL had five components. In addition to (parallel) financing
the fifth component, the EC co-financed with grant resources the other four components
of PROLOCAL.

The European Commission's total contribution to PROLOCAL was US $17.5 million
(14.27 million Euros) with nearly half of these grant funds going to co-finance subproject
investments: Component A received US $0.75 million, Component B was allocated US
$2.82 million, Component C received US $8.00 million, Component D had US $0.38
million, and Component E was allocated US $5.6 million. Originally the EC grant was
executed as parallel financing, but in order to better coordinate implementation and on
grounds of efficiency, at the EC's request, a co-financing arrangement was signed with
the Bank to administer EC funds (US $10.28 million). The co-financing arrangement
with the EC did not include support for the activities under the fifth component (E).
These were always managed and funded through a separate legal agreement between the
EC and the Government of Ecuador, but coordinated through the same PIU.

Implementation

Under Component B (Local Development Services), ECUAGRO was not implemented
due to the establishment of a system under the Bank-financed Agricultural Research
Project (PROMSA) that provided similar information.          ECUALOCAL was initially
conceived as an activity under Component B, but it was later incorporated as part of
PROLOCAL Communication Strategy (see Annex 7) ­ financed under components A
and D. In addition, due to demand by the local actors in the regions, ECUALOCAL
changed its initial focus in order to better support local planning (Cuenca Alta del Río
Jubones) and the preparation of subprojects in the coastal micro-regions (Los Ríos,
Estribaciones de los Andes and Sur de Manabí).

Under Component C (Subprojects), identification of subprojects and their co-financing
was initially dependent on the inclusion of the proposed subprojects in the local



                                            17

development plans. However, this requirement resulted in project implementation delays
as the consensus building and local government approval of the local development plans
took longer than originally expected. Therefore, the UCN opted to approve and co-
finance subprojects as long as they complied with the established selection criteria and
reflected potential priorities in local development plans.

The ceiling for subproject funding was initially set for community (US
$12,600/subproject), parroquia (US $63,000/subproject) and for inter-parroquia or
cantón levels (US $252,000/subproject). However, there was a need to increase the level
of financing for community subprojects but the cost ceiling per beneficiary family was
maintained within the levels estimated during appraisal. This adjustment was justified in
order to avoid internal conflicts within communities, as community ceilings were found
to excessively constrain the number families able to participate in the subprojects. In
light of this, the concept of community subprojects was changed to subprojects involving
one or more communities and groups organized around the same objectives. The average
subproject scale was therefore larger than expected at project appraisal.

PROLOCAL's institutional communication strategy sought to help build a supportive
political environment for PROLOCAL, by stimulating dialogue on development among
local and national stakeholders and clarifying the project role among agencies working on
related issues. Management of the communication strategy was to be executed by the
UCN, but it was later decentralized to the micro-regions to aid stakeholders to better
cooperate with each other and to strengthen their participation in all aspects of project
implementation, monitoring and evaluation. This change served to stimulate local project
teams, local government structures, and communities to discuss, reflect, and act on their
pressing local development needs and constraints such as poor integration to local and
regional markets, lack of access to credit, and deficient provision of basic services. It
was also instrumental to empower communities to form collective identities that
facilitated follow through actions based on information and feedback regarding project
activities to the UCN and UTRs (see Annex 7).

During implementation, one additional cantón containing three parroquias in the Cuenca
Alta del Río Jubones micro-region was added to those originally covered by the project.
Although initially targeted by PRODEPINE, this geographic area was excluded from the
project due to its demographic characteristics which more closely complied with the
targeting criteria supported by PROLOCAL. In addition, another parroquia (Carolina) in
the Cuenca del Río El Angel was added as part of this micro-region. Carolina had been
eligible for support under PRODEPINE, but with the completion of PRODEPINE it
became evident that its exclusion would have triggered unnecessary social friction with
the communities supported by PROLOCAL in the larger watershed.

In anticipation of the January 2007 government transition in Ecuador, PROLOCAL
closing date was extended from December 31st, 2006 to August 31, 2007. It was the only
extension of the project and allowed the time to educate the new authorities about the
achievements of the first phase while building official support for a new phase with the
new government. After its first four months in office the new Government officially



                                              18

established the Programa Nacional de Desarrollo Rural Territorial (PRODER) to scale-
up PROLOCAL's development impact by rapidly extending the geographical scope of
the project to cover additional areas. EC co-financing was the main source of funding for
project activities during the extension as the IBRD loan was almost fully disbursed by the
time the extension request was processed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Within the Bank, PROLOCAL was considered to be part of the CDD (community-driven
development) family of new-type projects that have become fashionable during the past
15 years, roughly coincident with the interest of the Bank in operationalizing the concept
of social capital. CDD is viewed as a mechanism that can (i) elicit development priorities
directly from target communities; (ii) expand the resources available to the poor; and (iii)
strengthen the civic capabilities of communities, nurture representative organizations and
the ability for collective action. Actually, PROLOCAL was conceived as a hybrid ­ an
amalgam of what is left of the once predominant model of integrated rural development
and the new CDD, but also incorporating elements of municipal-led development (a
variant of the administratively decentralized development model stressing local
governance) and territorially-based regional development, stressing resource and market
linkages.

PROLOCAL design also reflected the requirements of a poverty-targeted intervention, by
targeting poor households in addition to geographic regions. The components of the
project were well aligned to the achievement of the PDO. The design of the operation
addressed the lessons learned from the implementation of other rural development
projects both nationally and internationally. The design options were influenced by the
failure of the more prevalent top-down approach, which in the case of Ecuador was
showcased by the former PRONADER that closed with an unsatisfactory rating, and also
by the emerging success of the Bank/IFAD-financed PRODEPINE, a bottom-up rural
development project targeting indigenous and Afro-descendant populations that helped
setting the trend in Ecuador towards favoring grassroots led development.

PROLOCAL emphasized a strategy of participation and inclusion of communities and of
their territorial or second-tier organizations to identify and take advantage of value added
chains, access to markets and complementary off-farm activities which would benefit
socio-territorial organizations and their membership. Investments on human capital
formation and empowerment of local actors were to contribute to the proper execution of
subproject investments in the short to medium term, and to the sustainability of local
development in the longer term by ensuring that strengthened local organizations were
capable of mobilizing new financial resources with a wider range of partners for their
own development. PROLOCAL reflected well the Bank's three main principles in pro-
poor growth ­ promoting opportunity, facilitating empowerment and enhancing security
­ as articulated in WDR 2000/1 published around the time the project was designed.




                                              19

The main challenge for the preparation team was the need to establish efficient and
effective mechanisms for the identification, execution and management of the subprojects
at the local level, and the need for effective coordination at all levels ­ local, regional and
national. The design recognized the importance of empowering the beneficiaries to be the
main actors in the selection of their own priorities, while at the same time strengthening
local institutions and supporting local governments in the formulation of local
development plans. Local participation mechanisms were embodied in the project design
to ensure that project components truly reflected the priorities of the beneficiaries and
responded to their needs. These mechanisms greatly benefited from the integration of the
communication strategy, which put a major emphasis on building consensus and trust
among various stakeholders, as well as promote the concept of local development.

The project design also reflected some weakness, which may be inherent in a project of
this nature. The design was overoptimistic in determining the length of time needed to
develop the local development plans. As a reflection of this weakness, the estimated flow
of disbursements was also overly optimistic, since it did not take into account the time
needed for the participatory planning process, the institutional strengthening and
subproject preparation, before a full project implementation momentum was established.
Adding to the complexity of the project was the fact that second-tier organizations had
either a thematic or a regional focus (or a combination of the two), and thus there was a
need to undertake an inventory of organizations, review their capacity and provide them
with the necessary technical assistance to bring them "up-to-speed" and level.

Overall quality at entry can be considered moderately satisfactory given the project's
ambitious original design. Still, project preparation was supported by several studies,
which, interalia, examined lessons learned, identified priority areas and defined
intervention approaches. PROLOCAL approach of working with communities and their
territorial or second-tier organizations followed the arrangements being carried out by
PRODEPINE. While PRODEPINE depended on ethnic affinity groups to channel
resources, PROLOCAL worked with non-indigenous peasant communities, and its
intervention focused on different geographical areas.          To ensure a high level of
implementation preparedness, the task team put in place effectiveness conditions,
including the approval of an Operational Manual with detailed implementation
arrangements and business processes outlined for all project components.

2.2 Implementation

The mid-term review (MTR) was conducted in early 2005 (32 months after project
effectiveness) after the participatory planning process and other initial capacity building
investments were well established. Sufficient time to undertake these actions was not
well accounted for in project design. At the onset of implementation there was
insufficient time contemplated to gain the trust of the beneficiaries and their
organizations, to create a forum for their participation with the local authorities, to build
capacity and strengthen their local institutions, to establish the process of preparation of
local development plans, and to generate the demand necessary for the identification and
selection of subprojects. Once the necessary start-up activities were set in motion, the



                                              20

project gained the necessary momentum as reflected in its disbursement profile (Section I
of Data Sheet).

The project was not restructured, but some adjustments to the scope and implementation
arrangements were made at the MTR. These are described below:

There was also need to revisit the original Logical Framework to visualize where the
project wanted to go during the final years of implementation based on the local team's
practical sense and experience and on a more rigorous thinking about what sustainable
impacts could be realistically achieved in each targeted micro-region by project closing.
PROLOCAL's original design included several parallel objectives not properly explained
and specified. The project also assumed a causal relationship between project inputs and
poverty/employment improvements of the target population, measurable within five years.
Even in the case of subproject beneficiaries, income flows are a long-term expectation
made uncertain by many external factors.

The MTR also helped establish a more clear linkage or synergy between components by
articulating more explicitly across project activities the cross-cutting goal of
organizational capacity-building as this was not really well expressed in the original PAD.
The most immediate action was the translation of the Estrategias de Fortalecimiento
Micro-regional into the 2005 POA, including establishing more relevant indicators to
monitor and evaluate performance and output in each specific micro-region.             This
clarified a more logical sequence of products --> outcomes --> impacts that could be
adequately monitored and evaluated over time, including identification of joint products
resulting from the interaction between components.

The MTR also worked with local teams to propose indicators of sustainability of
processes and benefits largely missing in the original PAD or which showed unrealistic
assumptions about the capacity of the Ministry of Social Welfare (MBS) and the
Government of Ecuador to continue and extend local development processes after the
external financing would be spent. To this end, the MTR reviewed the key aspects of the
local planning processes started under PROLOCAL that could become institutionalized
and sustained beyond the project timeframe, ensuring greater transfer and delegation of
responsibilities to local government entities, alliances between local institutions and
national NGOs, continuity of productive investments, and a minimum of human and
social capital enabling local organizations to mobilize new financial resources with a
wider range of partners for their own development.

Notwithstanding the early delays in project implementation, the project was never at risk
status. Later during implementation, the project appeared as a potential problem project
due to portfolio system flags (two flags for country environment and record) but not
related to project performance.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design



                                           21

The project identified sufficient indicators and included a discussion on the M&E
arrangements in Annex 12 of the PAD. The M&E system included: (i) the establishment
of a computerized information system ­ almost real time; (ii) a periodic beneficiary
assessment; (iii) an impact evaluation study; and (iv) annual audits and Bank supervision
missions. To benchmark progress in the achievement of the PDO, a baseline study was
planned early during project implementation. The institutions responsible for the M&E
system and the flow of information were identified, and the need to integrate the financial
and physical monitoring components of the M&E system was recognized. With this
proposed system in place and with evaluation of the control group, the PAD considered
that the impact attributable to the project would be easily made explicit.

Implementation and utilization of the M&E system

The project established M&E subsystems that were not consolidated into a single system.
There were separate subsystems for monitoring financial aspects, subprojects,
administrative and output/impact indicators, among others. Also, the project established
an M&E system in each micro-region but these systems were not fully integrated in real
time with the system at the center (UCN) as initially planned, mainly due the high cost of
internet connections. The existing system functioned through monthly updates ­ the
UTRs sent weekly reports to be integrated by the UCN. The reports included available
relevant data for monitoring.

The M&E system, particularly the financial monitoring system, provided the required
information to the Bank's supervision team when assessing project's progress in terms of
rate of disbursement. However, the UCN demonstrated limited capacity to systematically
capture relevant information/experiences in the micro-regions and their significance
towards achievement of the PDO, and displayed modest performance at coordinating and
systematizing activities across the six micro-regions. Consequently, valuable information
relevant to support social and institutional learning objectives may have gone unnoticed.
The Bank's missions learned much more on the advance and impact of the project from
field visits than from available information through the M&E systems. However, at both
UCN and UCR levels, the existing system was used to monitor progress and the delivery
of products as scheduled.       Thus, the M&E system supported the management and
implementation of the project, but perhaps not in the most efficient and effective manner.

M&E was rated moderately satisfactory by the Bank's supervision missions (see ISRs 9
to 10), but despite having identified this weakness, the supervision team was unable to
spark the required corrective measures to ensure that the system captured information on
the transformation of people's knowledge, attitude and behavioral changes, as well as
properly monitor and quantify some of the less tangible accomplishment of the project.
The system was not streamlined to government institutions both at national and local
level and therefore its continuity after project closure is uncertain.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance




                                              22

Safeguards Compliance (Satisfactory): Safeguard issues were rated satisfactory
throughout project implementation. PROLOCAL was not involved in land acquisition,
involuntary resettlements or cultural heritage issues. Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01,
BP 4.01, GP 4.01) was the only safeguard policy triggered as the nature of subproject
investments, to be identified on a demand driven basis during implementation, was
unknown at the time of appraisal. To ensure full compliance with this safeguard, the
design foresaw the preparation of a simple standardized questionnaire to identify the need
for mitigation measures which were integrated and costed as part of subproject design. In
addition, since the project included a wide range of interventions and investments, the
Operational Manual and institutional arrangements for subproject implementation were
designed to ensure that adequate attention was given to the monitoring of unintended
negative environmental and social impacts that could arise. Finally, subprojects which
used agricultural inputs (e.g. synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) adopted the standards
recommended by Ecuador's National Institute for Agricultural and Livestock Research
(INIAP) as part of the enforced mitigating measures.

Procurement Compliance (Satisfactory): Procurement was carried out satisfactory
throughout project implementation. The PIU was staffed with a team of experienced
procurement specialists. Procurement post reviews were carried out on an annual basis.

Audit and Financial Management Compliance (Satisfactory): Overall, financial
management arrangements have been implemented adequately by the PIU. Although the
project experienced at the beginning some delays submitting timely withdrawal
applications and supporting documentation, there were no material issues and corrective
actions were promptly incorporated. Project financial management staff experience and
qualifications and minor turnover of personnel, despite the highly unstable political
environment in Ecuador, led to a continuous and committed implementation. Audit
reports, with unqualified opinions and non material internal control recommendations,
were always submitted on time. Quarterly interim un-audited reports were also generated
on a timely basis for Bank's review and contributed to decision making during project
implementation. Currently there are no pending actions, since the last audit report for the
period January to August 2007 was recently submitted for Bank's review and the
Designated Account does not show any outstanding balance or pending reimbursement.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The present government has evidenced its commitment to the program by allocating US
$ 8 million in 2008 from the national budget to support continuation of PROLOCAL. In
August 2007, the Correa administration signed a "Decreto Ejecutivo" officially
establishing the Programa Nacional de Desarrollo Rural Territorial (PRODER).
PRODER will build on PROLOCAL's development impact by rapidly extending the
geographical scope of the project to cover additional areas. The program is thus expected
to guarantee follow-up on all investments made in subproject and capacity building
investments during the first phase; keep the current project team intact so as not to
sacrifice the institutional learning that has been attained over the past 5 years; and




                                               23

maintain the partnerships developed with local actors and their organizations, service
providers, local governments and financial institutions.

Although this initial commitment reflects the expectation that government hopes to
expand operations on a national level in the subsequent phase, it still needs to provide
adequate financial resources over the long-run to the program for the type and scale of
rural productive investments which were the backbone of PROLOCAL's work. Options
for institutionalizing PRODER are also being explored with TA amd support from the
Bank. However, future Bank's financing for PRODER is yet to be determined by
President Correa who has said that such programs should in the future be financed from
the state's own resources. See also Section 4, Assessment of Risk to Development
Outcome.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The experience of PROLOCAL has made possible a convergence of vision, approach and
commitment between the Bank team and the borrower that is rarely found these days in
the Andean region. PROLOCAL supported all three key pillars of the Ecuador's CAS
(Report No. 25817), namely growth, equity and governance as it sought to reinforce and
expand the impact of Bank assistance in achieving diversified and sustainable economic
growth and poverty reduction based on the key assets of the country. The project
objective to improve the living standard of poor families in poor micro-regions of
Ecuador remained relevant throughout the implementation period, reflected the priorities
of the government, and was well aligned with the CAS.

The dichotomy of an unstable political system at the national level and more responsive
and stable local governments in Ecuador has given rise to broad recognition of the
strategic importance of promoting local development as an instrument to reduce rural
poverty and stimulate economic growth in Ecuador's diverse territorial settings. Against
this background, PROLOCAL became a critical component of the government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy in the targeted micro-regions. It has also been instrumental for
President Correa administration's renewed efforts to strengthen governance and inclusion
by helping local government structures (municipal governments and juntas parroquiales)
and local organizations to build and participate in more accountable and efficient local

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

Results from an external evaluation and three other separate assessments confirm that
PROLOCAL has achieved its development objective, and in some cases even surpassed
its original targets. The evaluations included: (i) an external evaluation carried out with
financial support from the EC (Annex 5); (ii) an economic and financial analysis of a


                                                24

sample of 40 productive subprojects to determine the impact of PROLOCAL on
household income (Annex 3); (iii) an assessment of the quantitative and qualitative
impacts of PROLOCAL's investments on institutional capacity building (Annex 6); and
(iv) an analysis of the current levels of institutionalization reached by local development
plans, and their effectiveness and likely sustainability as participatory planning tools.
These studies confirm that PROLOCAL has generated independently-verified economic
and social development benefits in terms of local empowerment, improved quality of
local services, and increased access to productive assets among poor households in six
regions of the country.

The PAD identified nine indicators to measure the achievement of the PDO. These
capture the main project outcomes and impacts which are summarized as follows:

1) A total of 84,000 households (or 140% of the 60,000 target indicator) took active role
in the elaboration of their own local development plans. The project's external evaluation
concluded that PROLOCAL has significantly contributed to the incorporation of rural
populations in the local planning process and the formulation of their development plans.
Given current levels of institutionalization reached by local development plans and their
demonstrated effectiveness and likely sustainability as partnership agreements between
local governments and civil society in setting development priorities, this PDO indicator
was largely achieved.

2) 126 local governments (or 84% of the 150 target indicator) collaborated with
beneficiaries in generating development plans at the parroquia and cantón levels.
Achievement of less than the originally planned number of development plans does not
reflect reduced project efficiency, but the fact that some local governments decided to
elaborate or update their development plans at the cantón level which covered several
parroquias within their jurisdictions. Indeed, 84,000 households participated in local
planning processes which surpassed the component target of 60,000. Other component
outcomes were reached in terms of (i) increased capacity and voice of the rural poor in
local decision making processes; (ii) increased attention of rural areas by local
governments; (iii) renewed and strengthened functions and effectiveness of local
governments; and (iv) strategic partnerships and alliances for local rural development.
Evidence of such achievements is presented in Annex 2.

3) Counterpart contribution by local organizations totaled US $17.35 million (or 360% of
the target indicator of US $4.80 million). This is an indicator of local empowerment and
beneficiary ownership of project investments, which surpassed all expectations with
respect to level of achievement.

4) Around 51% of individuals participating in community development planning process
were women (compared to the 30% target indicator).

5) To estimate the project outreach of poor population, there was not a systematic
baseline assessment of subproject participant income levels. However, it is evident that
the outreach target of 80% of subproject beneficiaries under the poverty line was



                                             25

achieved, since: (i) a basic subproject eligibility criterion was that beneficiaries were
poor; and (ii) the poverty level in participating cantones and parroquias at project start-
up was around 80% and even higher in rural areas. Annex 2 discusses PROLOCAL's
impacts in terms of outreach of poor and vulnerable population groups and their
increased access to productive assets and support services based on the findings from the
external evaluation.

6) Around 38,000 families in 1,600 rural communities or 190,000 people in six micro-
regions benefited from improved access to productive assets through subproject
investments. A total of 930 subprojects (750 at community level, 150 at parroquia level
and 30 at inter-parroquia level) were to be co-financed under this component with an
overall investment of US $20.2 million. In aggregate terms, 757 subprojects were
prepared (as validated profiles or feasibility studies) and 525 were financed. The
achievement of less than the originally planned number of subprojects is not an indication
of reduced project efficiency or increased costs per beneficiary. The average subproject
scale that was co-financed by PROLOCAL was larger than expected at project appraisal,
and the actual number of beneficiary rural communities and families (1,600 and 38,000
respectively) surpassed original targets. The adjustment in project scale was justified in
order to avoid internal conflicts within communities, as community cost ceilings were
found to excessively constrain the number families able to participate in the subprojects.
In light of this, the concept of community subprojects was changed to subprojects
involving one or more communities and groups organized around the same objectives,
but the cost ceiling per beneficiary family was maintained within the levels estimated at
appraisal. Overall project investment in subprojects was also much greater: US $37.2
million instead of the expected US $20.2 million due to larger beneficiary contributions
that surpassed appraisal expectations providing 46% of total investments (target was
20%). In terms of gender, 42% of all subproject participants were women (target was
25% target).

7) Beneficiary households improved access to quality rural development services.1 This is
reflected by subproject investments on technical assistance and beneficiary perceptions
assessed by the external evaluation. Based on the economic and financial analysis,
subproject investments on technical assistance averaged around 12% of total subproject
costs (around US $50/family for 38,000 families). The project's external evaluation
suggests that the development impact of PROLOCAL was significant in terms of
strengthening the capacities of local service providers and subproject beneficiaries and
facilitating interaction of local organizations such as grass-root organizations, second-tier
organizations, and local government institutions such as juntas parroquiales and concejos
cantonales (see Annex 2). In addition, 77% of beneficiaries perceived that subprojects
were sustainable in terms of practical application of training and technical assistance
provided, among other factors.




1There were not quantitative targets set at appraisal for increase access to quality support services.




                                                     26

8) The project's goal was to improve the income level of beneficiaries of productive
subprojects by 15%. In this regard, the financial analysis (Annex 3) estimated that
average financial income of subproject beneficiary households increased by US $370
annually for 38,000 families. There were not sufficient data available on the baseline
household income level of families participating in subprojects in order to have a robust
estimate of income growth. However, based on the baseline evaluation survey, it was
known that the average annual household income in the project areas or micro-regions
was US $2,820. Thus, the achieved financial annual net income increase represented a
13% increase or 88% of the original target value. This is an indicator of improved
wellbeing of poor households, which is likely to increase further in the next few years as
productive investments generate their full potential. The original target value is thus
likely to be achieved within a longer time-frame.

9) Under-employment among beneficiary households was reduced by 20% (equal to
target value). This estimation is based on the economic and financial analysis, which
found that the average increase in productive employment per participating family is 0.2
person/years equivalent. This is an additional indicator of wellbeing of poor households.

3.3 Efficiency

Within the context of an external evaluation, a random sample of 40 subprojects was
selected and evaluated. The analysis performed and results obtained are described in
Annex 3. Due to the relatively small selection universe, the results obtained from the
random sample provided rough unbiased estimations of feasibility at the aggregate level,
but not at micro-regional level or any other subdivision. In line with the results obtained
during the first year of operations, the incremental annual net income was around
US$250/family in the economic analysis and US $370/family in the financial analysis.

Considering only subproject investments and returns, the average Economic NPV would
be US $510/family and the Economic IRR would be 30%. Similarly, the average
Financial NPV would be US $1,070/family and the Financial IRR would be 46%. Under
a pessimistic scenario, where the estimated annual benefits would de reduced in half
(considering a zero annual net income every other year), the Economic IRR would be 6%
and the Financial IRR would be 15%.

Based on the financial results obtained, 19 out of 40 subprojects (or 47%) showed
financial IRR lower than 10% (including those with negative returns). Based on the
economic results obtained, 24 out of 40 subprojects (or 60%) showed economic IRR
lower than 10% (including those with negative returns). However as shown below, both
financial and economic returns in aggregate terms are substantially good.

Given that development planning activities and local support services activities promoted
by the project contributed to the identification and implementation of subprojects, the
latter results represent to a large extent the impacts of the whole process. Therefore, if
costs of other project components were considered (around US $19 million) and the
average results of this sample were extrapolated to the actual beneficiary population
(around 38,000 families): the overall economic NPV would be US $5 million or US


                                             27

$130/family, and the overall economic IRR would be 15%; the financial NPV would be
US $24 million or US $625/family, and the overall financial IRR 25% (similar to
appraisal estimates).

The average PROLOCAL investment per family was US $440, very close to the figure
estimated at appraisal. Similarly, the counterpart contribution of subproject participants
was US$ 330/family or 43% of total subproject investments.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the project was satisfactory. Even with an ambitious original
design, PROLOCAL performed creditably, especially in comparison with previous rural
development projects in Ecuador. It disbursed almost all its funds (unusual in the Bank's
recent Ecuador portfolio) and has received good marks from independent evaluations. It
met or surpassed all its target outputs, injected hard and soft resources into areas of
extreme poverty and initiated important processes of participatory decision-making and
governance. Project outputs are impressive; 38,000 families (190,000 people) benefited
by productive investments, about one quarter of all poor rural households in six micro-
regions, increasing their annual financial income on average by US $370 per family.
Some 4200 field promoters were trained, and over 800 local organizations strengthened.
The volume of rural loans doubled and the number of women borrowers rose three-fold.

Many lessons can of course be drawn from various perspectives (see Section 6), but the
project leaves behind an unusual amount of good will and respect, seldom accorded to
"official" programs in Ecuador. Considering that the project was implemented in the
midst of a permanent state of political crisis at the central level (continuing changes in the
MBS leadership), it managed to successfully execute available resources while building a
strong constituency and support from a wide range of local actors and their organizations,
including local governments. This support continued to grow until the end of the project
to the point that numerous local leaders requested their provincial authorities for the
replication of PROLOCAL in other regions of the country. The fact that PROLOCAL
managed to realize the above level of achievement of the PDO under the highly unstable
institutional environment of Ecuador is nothing short of remarkable.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts

The financial analysis in Annex 3 estimated that average financial income of subproject
beneficiary households increased by US $370 annually for 38,000 families. Since the
average annual household income in the project areas or micro-regions was US $2,820
according to the baseline data, the achieved financial annual net income increase
represented a 13% increase or 88% of the original target value. This is an indicator of


                                               28

improved wellbeing of poor households, which is likely to increase further in the next
few years as productive investments generate their full potential. The original target
value is thus likely to be achieved within a longer time-frame. Income increases come
essentially from increased land and labor productivity, production value added, and
increased rural employment. There were not sufficient data available on the baseline
household income level of families participating in subprojects in order to have a robust
estimate of income growth. In addition, under-employment among beneficiary
households was reduced by 20% according to the same economic and financial analysis
which found that the average increase in productive employment per participating family
was 0.2 person/years equivalent.

Gender Aspects

The indicators for participation of women and youth in the formulation of local
development plans show significant achievement. Women made up more than 51% of the
participants to local development plans, widely exceeding the target of ensuring a
participation of 30%. In addition, 42% of all subproject participants were women. This
compares favorably to the 25% target. PROLOCAL also managed to reach a high
engagement of youth groups, some of which identified and implemented subproject
investments.

Social Development

PROLOCAL generated a strong constituency and support from sector agencies, local
government structures, and a wide range of local actors and their grassroots and second-
tier organizations. This was in part due to the decentralization of program operations
which facilitated the formation of strong, inter-institutional alliances on a local level and
were key to providing social accountability regarding all aspects of the program. These
networks of local actors constitute the main pillars for institutionalization of the future
program PRODER.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Under Component A, PROLOCAL supported participatory planning processes for local
development at parroquia and cantón levels. Major component targets were reached:
84,000 households participated in the local development planning processes (target was
60,000); 51% of those individuals who participated in the local development planning
process were women (target was 30%), and 126 local governments prepared and/or
updated their respective local development plans (target was 150).

The project's external evaluation suggests that the potential impact of this component is
significant in terms of: (i) increased capacity and voice of the rural poor in local decision
making processes; (ii) increased attention of rural areas by local governments; (iii)
renewed and strengthened functions and effectiveness of local governments; and (iv)
strategic partnerships and alliances for local rural development. These are briefly
reviewed below:


                                               29

Engagement of the rural poor in local decision-making process

PROLOCAL has significantly contributed to the incorporation of rural populations in the
local decision making process. As stated before, more than 84,000 households directly
participated in the elaboration or updating of the 126 local development plans co-
financed by the project. This is particularly relevant considering: (a) the conventional
top-down character of most local government practices in Ecuador which has often led to
an antagonist relationship between local governments and citizens; and (b) the lack of
tradition in engaging the rural poor and their organizations in participatory processes
which in the past has excluded them to work with local governments in the prioritization
of possible interventions to overcome their socio-economic constraints.

Increased attention of rural areas by local governments

PROLOCAL has made an effective contribution to set up a participatory development
planning structure that has brought municipalities closer to their rural populations,
enabling a fundamental shift on the country's decentralization implementation focus. As
a result of this local development planning approach, municipal budget allocation to rural
areas in participating municipalities increased from 36% without the project to 52% with
the project2. Such a budget re-allocation is an achievement in itself considering the
limited resources available to most municipalities involved with the project.

Renewed and strengthened functions and effectiveness of local governments

PROLOCAL has also been effective in promoting a process of renovation and
administrative change within 73 out of 126 local governments involved in the project,
moving from previous sector-oriented structures to more integrated and accountable
planning approaches. Fifteen municipalities promoted significant changes in their
structure and normative planning framework through: (i) creation of new strategic
planning and coordination bureaus; (ii) incorporation of cross-sectoral approaches and
mechanisms for local economic development; and (iii) establishment of participatory
accountability mechanisms from budget elaboration to expenditure tracking and citizen
oversight. This is a relevant achievement of the project since there was no municipal
strengthening strategy as such in the project design, and impact on the local government
structure was not an explicit component objective. Actions were developed and applied
during the project implementation to respond to the emerging demands from the
municipalities themselves. Furthermore, all juntas parroquiales assisted by the project
improved their role as facilitators of local development by better mobilizing and
articulating their rural populations and organizations with the municipalities.

                                                    30

The preparation process of the local development plans has also contributed to promotion
of strategic alliances for local rural development. This has been instrumental in changing
the management style of local governments, which used to operate in isolation from
community-based organizations and other local structures. In addition, this planning
process has improved the capacity of the local governments to negotiate their vision and
priorities with provincial authorities. Noteworthy evidence includes: (a) the negotiation
between the Association of Juntas Parroquiales of Jipijapa in Southern Manabí and the
provincial government regarding the 2007 provincial budget; and (b) the preparation of
the Provincial Development Plan of Loja based on all four cantón and 24 parroquia
development plans, supported by PROLOCAL. Finally, this planning process brought
together municipalities for the design and implementation of innovative territorial-based
projects as in the case of the Association of Municipalities of the Cuenca Alta del
Jubones.

Under Component B, PROLOCAL supported: (i) human capital formation, specifically
by strengthening capacities of local service providers and subproject beneficiaries; and
(ii) social and institutional capital formation, specifically by strengthening capacities and
facilitating interaction of local organizations such as grassroots organizations
(communities, water-user associations and other associations), second-tier organizations,
and local government institutions such as juntas parroquiales and concejos cantonales.
A total of 33 cantones, 123 juntas parroquiales, one mancomunidad (i.e. an association
of cantones), 56 second-tier organizations and 252 grassroots organizations
(organizaciones de base), and 125 local financial institutions benefited from institutional
strengthening and improved their human resource capacity.

The project's external evaluation suggests that the potential development impact of this
component is significant in terms of: (i) strategic alliances developed; (ii) opportunities
generated for human and institutional development; and (iii) communication and
information systems developed and operated locally. These are reviewed below:

Strategic alliances developed

Within the framework of this component, one of the project objectives was to strengthen
at least six networks or associations of service providers (NGOs and individual
professionals) in the targeted micro-regions. A total of 17 local networks were
strengthened by the project. Of these, six were technical assistance service providers,
seven local financial institutions, and four local communicators.

Opportunities generated for human and institutional development

Regarding human development, 115 technicians were trained on project formulation and
evaluation, and 950 on project implementation. This compares favorably to the original
target of 400. In addition, the project held several in-service training workshops to
formulate and evaluate projects, and sponsored 35 technicians from the micro-regions to
participate in the Diploma program on Project Formulation and Management offered by
the Escuela Politécnica del Litoral. Most of these professionals were later hired by



                                              31

farmer organizations to design and evaluate subprojects, achieving a high level of quality
in their preparation. Furthermore 4,207 promoters were trained in areas such as: agro-
ecology, agro-industry and communications. Alphabetization subprojects turned out to
be of particular importance since they reached around 18,000 individuals. Regarding
institutional development, 252 new social organizations acquired legal status, a basic
government requirement to access capacity building and subproject support from
PROLOCAL. In total, 840 local organizations and institutions were equipped, compared
to the expected 720.

Communication and information systems developed and operated locally

The Universidad del Austro (a regional university) developed a regional node of the local
development information system (ECUALOCAL) for the Cuenca Alta del Río Jubones
micro-region. The system was later adjusted and implemented in other three micro-
regions. Today, ECUALOCAL is in operation. In addition to this initiative, the project
supported the establishment of 23 telecenters in various localities. Regarding local
communication systems, 28 tailor-made communication products were developed; 189
local communicators were trained; and Diálogo Magazine was created ­ to date, eight
editions have been published and distributed.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

When examining now at what project funds were spent on and where the time and effort
of the field teams went, it is evident that PROLOCAL focused on two major goals: (i)
income enhancement and (ii) organizational strengthening. In keeping with the territorial
focus, the latter included not only attempts to improve the performance of specific
organizations, but to build inter-organizational linkages and networks within the regions.
However, the first goal, through the mechanism of productive subprojects, remained
dominant throughout. It is fair to say that the very high demand for scarce grant financing
overshadowed the interest in capacity building. This may explain why, in PROLOCAL's
case, there was only modest original demand for capacity development and why this has
changed when resources for improved livelihood became available. Nonetheless, there
was a catalytic effect on the incentives for cooperation and collective action. Productive
subprojects energized the demand for capacity enhancement and in the case of existing
but stagnant organizations, provided them with a renewed purpose. The indirect stimulus
of productive resource transfers on capacity development is an interesting and unforeseen
outcome. The significant lesson is that a well-integrated amalgam of "hard" and "soft"
resources is needed for effective capacity building.

The external assessment confirmed evidence of the generally low degree of utilization of
the Institutional Strengthening Plans (PFIs) which was one of PROLOCAL's instruments
in this component (426 local organizations completed PFIs, see Annex 6). The
formulation of the PFI was contracted out to an NGO or to a single consultant from a list
of local service providers, who with some exceptions had limited experience in
organizational analysis or capacity building. While some of the PFIs were good at
organizational diagnosis, the recommendations tended to focus more on formal matters
such as rules and procedures, holding assemblies or preparing project proposals ("hard


                                             32

skills"). More fundamentally, the relatively low level of demand for and appreciation of
capacity building by the organizations (in contrast to the high interest in obtaining
subprojects grant money) and above all, the lack of steady follow-up have contributed to
the limited impact of the PFIs.

The external assessment (Annex 6) provides strong evidence that on the issues of
participation, representation, internal communication and accountability, there was the
much larger progress perceived among the community groups and the juntas
parroquiales in comparison to their respective higher level second-level and municipal
entities. This clearly reflects the project's strategy of grassroots development.
Consistently very high scores were achieved for advances in legitimacy and member
representation. The surveyed second-tier organizations (OSGs) reported increased
adherence of their base groups, although there were cases in which the project may have
created tensions by dealing directly with the bases and bypassing their umbrella OSGs.
But there was evidence that the campesino organizations acquired a greater voice in their
relations with the municipalities and that their greater access to information about
projects and budgets has contributed to empowerment.

As discussed earlier, the original design of PROLOCAL included four technical
components and Project Coordination. However, a fifth component (Improved Rural
Financial Systems), financed by the European Commission, was later incorporated and
implemented as an integral and critical part of the project. While modest, the component
generated considerable results: 86 non-regulated financial entities and seven financial
institutions networks were strengthened both in terms of human capital and equipment,
270 EFL staff and 680 EFL members received training in the six micro-regions, and a
trust fund was established and is operating to support operations of EFLs in the
participating micro-regions. To date, 19 local financial entities have access to the trust
fund resources and 13 new financial products are offered in the six micro-regions. In
addition to progress in credit volumes and efficiency, the various credit cooperatives and
savings & loan associations formed coordinating networks among each other and started
to develop useful linkages to the micro-enterprises promoted by the project. These
facilitated greater integration of financial institutions in the co-financing of sub-projects
by taking advantage of markets for local investments generated through the project to
extend coverage, design adequate credit products, and expand membership and
involvement in local development (see Annexes 2 and 6).

Although neither planned nor expected, PROLOCAL responded to demand by local
organizations to provide support to alphabetization programs. More than 18,000
individuals were alphabetized by PROLOCAL. Only in the Manabí region nearly 7,000
individuals (or around 19.5% of the analphabet population of the micro-regions)
benefited from this initiative. At the end of the project, illiteracy was fully eradicated in
the Cantones of Pueblo Viejo and Girón.

In Cuenca del Río El Angel and Zona Oriental de Loja, PROLOCAL pro-actively
involved persons with physical disabilities, which became important actors in the local
development planning process as well as subproject beneficiaries in these micro-regions.



                                              33

In Loja, for example, the municipality created a rehabilitation centre and awareness
campaign on physical disability.

Finally, the project also contributed to strengthen the culture of democracy and the
practice of social accountability in the use of public funds. Some social accountability
initiatives developed spontaneously and outside the direct control of the project, such as
in the case of the Cantonal Children Council in Echeandía, which began to work
independently to monitor subprojects funded by PROLOCAL.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(required for ILI, details in annexes)

PROLOCAL analyzed beneficiary and other actor's perceptions based on results from in-
depth assessments conducted by the EC in the second half of 2006 (Annex 5); an internal
evaluation carried out by the project team at mid-term level; and an external evaluation
carried out in the Cuenca del Río Angel micro-region, which was the last region
incorporated to PROLOCAL. Beneficiary perceptions were assessed considering those
who were direct beneficiaries of subproject investments, as well as more indirect
beneficiaries linked to the social and service providers networks on which PROLOCAL
had influence.

Beneficiary assessments reflected very favorable perceptions from local actors regarding
project performance. The overall successes in the implementation of PROLOCAL was
attributed to the following aspects: (i) ownership by the beneficiaries and their active
involvement in decision-making that prevented political intervention in the
implementation of project activities; (ii) close presence of the implementation unit at
micro-region to monitor the progress and support beneficiaries in resolving
implementation problems; (iii) creation of institutional alliances among the different
organizations involved at local level that made it possible to complement each other in
areas where necessary skills were lacking; (iv) flexibility to introduce modifications in
the implementation arrangements when needed based on continuous monitoring and
evaluation feedback and at the MTR; (v) strong stakeholder involvement that facilitated
learning and adaptation and enriched the project's Operational Manual; (vi) emphasis on
clusters of subprojects with high impact in improving the living-standard of poor
households; (vii) institutional strengthening of local institutions that supported all project
activities and provided social accountability for the use of public funds; (viii) government
leadership to include EC as a co-financer of the project when the Bank showed reluctance
to support micro-finance activities; and (ix) a flexible and locally imbedded
communication strategy, which successfully contributed to motivate participating
communities and build alliances across local actors.

More detailed information regarding the results of the evaluations can be found in
Annexes 5 and 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate



                                            34

In August 2007, the new Government of Ecuador officially established the Programa
Nacional de Desarrollo Rural Territorial (PRODER). It is intended that PRODER will
build on PROLOCAL's development impact by rapidly extending the geographical scope
of the project to cover additional areas. The best way to scale-up the impact and
operational knowledge accumulated during the first phase is to use it again, as soon as
possible, using implementation structures of accountable management that are already in
place to reinforce and replicate the benefits of the original project over additional
geographical regions, while encouraging its institutionalization as part of a national
policy framework for sustainable and inclusive local development.

While PRODER objectives and components would not be substantially different from the
current PROLOCAL design, modifications to improve the program based on the lessons
learned are currently being analyzed under specifically commissioned consultant studies
supported by TA from the Bank. These cover the following areas:

Improved institutional sustainability

One of the main objectives of PRODER would be to gradually transfer the innovating
approaches and development support roles developed under PROLOCAL to ongoing
public and civic entities so as to increase sustainability of these initiatives beyond the
project scope. This modification directly responds to the government request for more
institutionalization in project management. The institutional sustainability of
PROLOCAL would be twofold: (i) at the national level the Government of Ecuador has
positioned PROLOCAL as a national program for implementing the country's new rural
development policy within the National Development Plan issued in September 2007,
and to which PRODER contributes to objective 11 (establecer un sistema económico
solidario y sostenible); and (ii) at the sub-national level the provincial councils,
associations of local governments, and organized civil society would assume greater
responsibility for the execution of the activities and the selection of instruments, which
would contribute to the social accountability and decentralization agendas.

Project management

The mainstreaming of PROLOCAL in macro and local level organizations would require
revised institutional arrangements for project management. At the national level, the
installation of the new PRODER as a scaled-up program would require the establishment
of formal agreements with other governmental agencies, such as the Ministries of
Agriculture and Planning, to ensure a cohesive approach. At the sub-national level,
fiduciary arrangements would need to be revised to address issues of capacity in local
organizations, specifically with respect to procurement and flow of funds. The
organizational structure and functions of the UCN and UTRs would be revised as well to
allow for greater decentralization in the implementation of project activities. This implies
gradually mainstreaming PROLOCAL in local government structures and reflecting this
objective in program management institutional arrangements.

Better articulation between components



                                            35

The experience in PROLOCAL has shown that organizational capacity-building is the
cross-cutting goal that links and synergizes project activities across components.
Specifically, two actions would be emphasized: (i) restructure the institutional
strengthening and capacity building activities of the project to ensure greater focus and
selectivity and a clearer vision of the desired and realistic results and impact at end of
project; and (ii) identify a more logical sequence of products --> outcomes --> impacts
that can be adequately monitored and evaluated over time, including identification of
joint products resulting from the interaction between components.

Policy framework to address structural problems

The external evaluation of PROLOCAL shows that in carrying out a regional
development strategy the project encountered a number of structural/policy obstacles that
exceeded the framework and intervention instruments of the project, such as conflicts
over water and land rights, legal limitations in rural finance and contracts, and, above all,
lack of national rural development policies for low resource/income producers. The new
design will make provisions to support analysis on such policy/structural challenges and
foster dialogue on the implications in the area of rural local development beyond the local
sphere (see Section 6).

Results-based monitoring and evaluation

The lack of accountability in Ecuador stems in part from the failure to measure results.
In most instances, there are no systems to track the results of the operations or projects,
starting with the absence of base line information on existing conditions. The focus on
the MDGs, which establishes fairly explicit targets, is raising the conscience on the need
to begin measuring results and tracking performance. While some of the MDGs are broad,
many local governments in Ecuador are beginning to articulate their activities in terms of
their contribution to the reaching the MDGs. PRODER's design would include progress
indicators for effective monitoring and provision of feedback, and results/outcome
indicators for ex post and impact evaluations, based on the hierarchy of goals. The
methodology of monitoring and evaluation would include qualitative as well as
objectively verifiable indicators. The participatory M&E system used in PROLOCAL
would be revised to ensure that it delivers timely and constant feedback to support social
and institutional learning objectives and more transparency and social auditing of project
activities. The possibility of generating base line information for many programs will be
enhanced with the information being obtained through the comprehensive Living
Standards Measurement Survey that is being carried out by the Government. This sample
of over 10,000 households should provide a wealth of information that will allow some
comparisons over time in many areas of welfare and service delivery.

Subprojects

PRODER would improve the subproject component to ensure greater impacts on
enabling households to access productive assets, diversify production, and increase
income. These modifications would result in the following: (i) emphasis on human
capital formation and strengthening the management and technical capacity within
existing local and second/third-tier organizations in order to support longer term


                                             36

development process that extend beyond the project's life; (ii) mainstreaming of
environmental investments within productive subprojects focusing on marketing, value-
added production chains, and non-farm enterprises like tourism; and (iii) increasing the
share of co-financing by integrating existing local financial institutions with
entrepreneurial farmers' organizations (empresas asociativas campesinas). To better
identify and design potential subprojects, the methodology of the local development plans
would be improved to include a realistic assessment of the area's productive and
competitive potential as well as regional market and financial leakages to capture some of
the surplus generated by large commercials producers in the regions.

Developing permanent partnerships for local development

PRODER would continue the successful principle of facilitating linkages among local
actors developed under the current project with some modifications to achieve a greater
impact in developing permanent public and private partnerships for local development
that go beyond the project scope. Local organizations in rural Ecuador are important
actors in building necessary social consensus for economic reforms and long term
development, in promoting effective governance by fostering transparency and
accountability of local administration and decentralization, and in efforts to fight
inequality and exclusion. They also have an increasingly critical role in the direct
delivery of social and economic services, and in improving natural resource management
and environmental protection through collective action. This objective would be achieved
by providing more intensive and long term technical assistance to local organizations,
such as in-service training. Support, however, should be oriented to enhance the functions
for which territorial organizations are well suited (representation and dialogue with
public institutions, management of local public goods, improving local governance and
public sector transparency and accountability, influencing public decision-making and
monitoring local government actions, including the enforcement of procurement
processes and the quality of public services and public expenditures, and bridging to
other similar organizations) not those for which they are not well suited, like managing
economic enterprises related to productive projects.

Targeted geographical areas

Several options are being considered for geographical coverage and expansion. One
option is to expand/connect existing micro-regions and intensify work with existing local
governments willing to increase their own counterpart financing and adopt PROLOCAL
local development instruments. Another option is to restructure the geographical
coverage to avoid an artificial combination of municipalities that do not make sense agro-
ecologically or administratively. This second approach would favor working more
closely with the provincial councils and locating UTRs in the provincial capitals.

Bank's financing for PRODER

Even though the Bank team remains closely involved with the recently renamed Ministry
of Social and Economic Inclusion (formerly Social Welfare, MBS), and continues to



                                            37

support the institutionalization of PROLOCAL, future Bank's financing for PRODER is
yet to be determined by the Government of Ecuador. President Correa has said that such
programs should in the future be financed from the state's own resources and should not
add to the national debt. But, as of this writing, limited new resources had been assigned
to the MBS for scaling-up PRODER in the long run. Thus, PROLOCAL's expansion
remains uncertain despite strong demand from local constituencies for the program to be
scaled-up.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was deemed moderately
satisfactory given the project's ambitious design as reflected by PROLOCAL's several
parallel and competing objectives. These were revisited at the MTR which helped create
more clear synergies between components and articulate more explicitly across project
activities the cross-cutting goal of organizational capacity-building.

PROLOCAL's designers were influenced by two concepts that have been relied upon as
justification for CDD-type projects: participation and social capital. Both of these
concepts incorporate elements of capacity (i.e., participation as a requirement for
collective action or "bonding and bridging relations" as social capital). The design
options were rightly influenced by the failure of the more prevalent top-down approach,
which in the case of Ecuador, was showcased by the former Rural Development Project
(PRONADER) that closed with an unsatisfactory rating.

Notwithstanding the limitations of the legal framework for decentralization, PROLOCAL
was also critical to support promising experiences with municipal governments and build
alliances with second-tier organizations and local territorial associations taking pro-active
roles in participatory processes of local development. This orientation was a step forward
towards the construction of a more inclusive type of local development that the project
promoted in six micro-regions. PROLOCAL approach of working with communities and
their territorial or second-tier organizations intelligently replicated the arrangements
being carried out by the successful implementation of PRODEPINE. Just as in
PRODEPINE, where the CDD design of community participation and welfare was
overlaid by the ethno-cultural issues of indigenous identity, in PROLOCAL CDD was
inserted into a territorial or local development framework.

To ensure a high level of preparedness, the Bank team negotiated important effectiveness
conditions such as an approved Operational Manual, appointment of core project staff,
and establishment of a financial management system. The Project Implementation Plan
and procurement documents for the first year of implementation were also completed
during preparation. Finally, the team insisted in M&E arrangements and the contracting


                                              38

of a qualified consultant for preparation of the baseline survey to be programmed soon
after the project initiated implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

PROLOCAL's implementation proceeded successfully because of the learning capacity
that was built into it from the start. Since the project opens a new path in the development
of the rural areas of Ecuador, it was clear that the Bank and European Commission
supervision teams needed to take a very systematic approach to learning from the earliest
stages of implementation. Both the Bank and the EC coordinated well together as one
supervision team conducting regular implementation support missions, preparing joint
Aide Memoires, and providing consolidated feedback to government regarding project
performance and areas of improvement. In addition, the EC conducted four annual
missions for external monitoring using a result-oriented monitoring (ROM) methodology.

But the main challenge faced in project implementation was the threat of political and
institutional instability that has characterized Ecuador during the past six years (seven
ministers of Social Welfare, eight ministers of Agriculture, and four Presidents of the
country). To minimize disruption in the implementation of project activities, the Bank
and EC's supervision teams took the following steps:

    · implemented a supervision model based on participatory planning, monitoring
        and evaluation to assure transparency, enable community-based organizations to
        take a primary role in problem solving, and facilitate an institutional learning
        process;
    · supported greater decentralization of program operations and the formation of
        strong, inter-institutional alliances on a local level that were key to provide social
        accountability regarding all aspects of the project and also became the main
        pillars for institutionalization of the program; and
    · facilitated continuous learning and adaptation which became an important means
        to articulate a broader group of organizations, donors and agencies where lack of
        coordination had previously undermined the benefits that might otherwise have
        accrued from the substantial resources channeled into rural areas in Ecuador.

Supervision missions enabled interactions among actors, including local governance
structures, second-tier organizations, and networks of service providers to identify issues
of common concern, establish alliances and set up a transparent scheme of incentives and
sanctions designed to prevent political interference from having an effect on project
implementation.      The role of local actors in supervision strengthened the project's
policies and procedures, enriched its norms and operational manual, and provided a social
accountability for the use of public funds. Furthermore, these actors and their networks
are providing the regional constituencies supporting the evolution of PROLOCAL from a
modest WB-financed project to the Programa Nacional de Desarrollo Territorial
(PRODER) currently under preparation by the Government of Ecuador.



                                                39

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The reasonable quality at entry of the project, as described above, combined with the
participatory supervision approach adopted by the task team to support project
implementation, and ensure achievement of PDOs despite the challenging institutional
environment in the country, constitutes strong basis for a satisfactory rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government of Ecuador, through the Ministry of Social Welfare, fully supported the
project preparation process.      It assigned staff with extensive experience in rural
development to work with the task team and provided clear directions from the Under-
Secretary of the Ministry of Social Welfare regarding project objectives and intended
beneficiaries. In addition, the Government prepared the Project Implementation Plan and
other documents necessary for initiating implementation such as the identification of the
micro-regions targeted by the project.        Government's performance was hindered,
however, by the intense political and institutional instability both at the central
government level and in the Ministry of Social Welfare throughout the period of
implementation. This instability did not prevent the project from achieving its PDO but
required a tremendous and continuous effort from the PIU staff throughout
implementation to save the project from political intervention.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PIU demonstrated full commitment to achieving the PDO. It adequately engaged and
sought input from the beneficiaries and other stakeholders as per the project design, and
proved to have a high level of readiness for implementation and for the opportune
resolution of implementation issues.       It used development communication tools to
establish open channels of communication with communities and their territorial or
second-tier organizations while encouraging a process of social learning and mutual
accountability. The national and local teams were also effective at promoting functional
implementation arrangements on a local level including how local governance structures
(municipal governments and juntas parroquiales) could interact more effectively with
community-based organizations and private business initiatives the project was
promoting. Project management was also instrumental to strengthen governance by
helping local government structures and local organizations to build and participate in
more accountable and efficient local government processes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

As described above, Government's performance was moderately satisfactory due to the
continuous threat of political and institutional instability that affected the project
throughout implementation. On the other hand, the PIU performed satisfactorily in the


                                             40

most relevant aspects. It managed to achieve or surpass the targets set out at appraisal
exceeding all expectations despite the complex political and institutional environment of
Ecuador. The project was also managed with the utmost transparency by very capable
national and regional teams subject to external annual performance evaluations. Staff
performance evaluation results were used to validate decisions regarding staff contract
renewals and to identify weak areas that could be improved through training and learning
activities. Overall borrower performance can therefore be considered satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The device of probing PROLOCAL's design and performance through the lens of
previous analyses and evaluations is useful not only to draw further lessons for
development practice but also to reflect on the realities facing Ecuador's prospects for
establishing a consistent policy framework for sustainable and inclusive development in
the country's rural territories. The moment to define a more coherent policy framework
for local development is appropriate for two reasons. The first one is that local
development experiences have matured sufficiently to allow a big step forward. In the
present environment of macroeconomic stability and restarting growth a big leap forward
in rural development is entirely possible. However, it is the lack of an adequate policy
framework and institutional architecture that hold back rural development. The second
reason is the change in the conditions of competitiveness taking place in the country.
Thus, dollarization brings new rules of the game, for it is no longer possible to cushion
competitive disadvantages with monetary and exchange rate policies. Finally, Ecuador's
improving debt position and a horizon of favorable oil prices allow envisaging higher
availability of public investment resources for rural areas in the medium term.

The lessons learned from PROLOCAL are presented in the following segments:

Sharper definition of concepts and strategy - Beginning with the PAD, PROLOCAL
suffered from the imprecision of the concept of Institutional Capacity Building and from
the difficulty of formulating an operational strategy about whose capacity, for what, and
how PROLOCAL would strengthen or build. In the future, clearer definitions and
terms/language understood by all stakeholders is required. Short time frames, the
rutinization of processes, pressures to meet output targets all conspire against a proper
capacity-building strategy that is based on incremental and often indeterminate processes,
slow, gradual, persistent learning-by-doing. Future logical frameworks must articulate a
clear and realistic sequence (goals, inputs, outputs, result/impact) and also the likely
linkages and complementarities of the more direct capacity-building activities to other
aspects of project strategy.

Greater recognition of the long-term nature of the capacity-building process - This
lesson has several implications based on PROLOCAL's experience: (1) Focus initially on
narrower objectives more reachable within the project's timeframe (such as subproject-
related skills). (2) In the case of more complicated and long-term aspects, establish
intermediate targets, instruments and benchmarks to achieve desired and sustainable
levels of competency. (3) Provide for staff skilled in organizational management and
socio-organizational promotion to work alongside technical specialists. (4) Reform the


                                             41

monitoring & evaluation system (M&E) to provide feedback information during
execution. This is valid for the project as a whole, but especially for the capacity building
components. (5) Maximize the complementarity with the previous work of other
development organizations working in the area, where some level of capacity has already
been created. (6) Start some activities early and do not stagger implementation by regions
as implemented in PROLOCAL. By delaying the start of two of the six micro-regions by
2 years and one by 3 years overall progress has been reduced. At the very least, some
diagnostic work and training could have been usefully initiated much sooner everywhere.
Studies have indicated that in the case of larger organizations, the enhancement process
has taken between six and ten years, even when at the outset, some capacity has existed
and when full-time advisory teams were fielded on a long-term basis.

Catalytic role of subprojects - The unexpected lesson was that the productive
subprojects dealing with production/marketing chains, irrigation and resource
conservation, which were on a completely separate track from the other components,
turned out to have important catalytic effects for capacity building. The very high
demand for scarce grant financing overshadowed the interest in capacity building.
Nonetheless, there was a catalytic effect on the incentives for cooperation and collective
action. Productive subprojects energized the demand for capacity enhancement and in
the case of existing but stagnant organizations, provided them with a renewed purpose.
The significant lesson is that a well-integrated amalgam of "hard" and "soft" resources is
needed for effective capacity building.

Complexities of "community" structure - As in other similar CDD type projects, it was
assumed that in the project areas a more-or-less representative "village" or "community"
existed. The PAD envisages the enhancement of social capital in such localities. This
notion under-estimated the nature and diversity of "base" groups in the coastal and
Andean foothill areas where PROLOCAL was to work and the very low level of
inclusive organization, in contrast with the indigenous "cabildos" of the Sierra. As a
result, PROLOCAL's portfolio of "communities" consisted mostly of groupings of
families of common interest, constituting a fraction of the residents of a given locality.
While this exclusiveness is a logical consequence of the project's focus on micro-
enterprises rather than social services which tend to benefit all households, efforts were
made to link these specialized groupings organically to the broader territorially
determined inclusive "community". In the case of the second-tier organizations this
potentially conflictive situation is resolved as the inclusive territorially representative
second-level associations create an organic umbrella for the specialized groupings within
their membership. Perhaps in the future the juntas parroquiales that are increasingly
assuming a representation role of their micro-territories can also perform this integrating
function.

The lesson here is that a thorough understanding of the local organizational fabric is
necessary to design proper grassroots promotional strategies, which can result in different
combinations of cohesion and conflict. When projects do not understand the complexities
of the local "community" structure and culture and are eager to find any group thought
suitable for a subproject, the danger is not only the potential for conflict, but instability,



                                              42

as has happened elsewhere, when members view their association as a means of
accessing short-term individual benefits, rather than as a mechanism of cooperation for
long-term shared gains.          In most cases, ad hoc exclusive groupings formed
opportunistically to access project resources have weak linkages to more inclusive
organizational forms.

The importance of sustainable service structures - The experience of PROLOCAL
calls for a rethinking of how best to provide ongoing technical and institutional support
for the organizations that have been launched by a given project intervention toward
more solid high performing entities, but need continuous and affordable support. For the
future, this points to the creation of central service centers, linked to existing second-level
or umbrella associations. Such centers could be financed initially by the project but on a
declining share, as the proportion of national and local co-financing increases. In the case
of productive enterprise development, as the income of the members grows, the capacity
of payment for services increases. The public subsidy portion can be justified as
"software" investments, necessary to ensure the success of the supply of productive
infrastructure and inputs.

Some logical locations for such support structures are the larger second level associations
and the cantones, but sponsorship is also desirable by the emerging consortia of second-
tier organizations and by the mancomunidades and juntas parroquiales. There are several
alternative models. Based on the experience of other countries (e.g. Costa Rica, Chile)
such service centers could also be based on a triangular cooperation by the government,
the farmers associations and NGOs. A first step in this direction is a concerted effort to
strengthen the technical capabilities of the second-tier organizations, overcoming the bias
against higher level campesino associations prevalent in CDD-type programs, also
manifest in PRODEPINE as "not sufficiently grassroots." The next step would be to
reinforce the fledgling planning/development office of the municipal governments. No
real planning can be undertaken by the cantón without a minimal professional staff,
different from those responsible for infrastructure services. Until the endogenous capacity
of such centers is achieved, the project teams should count on sufficient resources to
incorporate outside professionals on a sustained rather than ad-hoc basis.

Project management roles - It was already concluded that the promotional and advisory
functions of the PIU were understaffed. The external evaluation suggested that future
projects should separate the "financial" from the "facilitator" roles and might even divide
them into different projects. The ICR team disagrees, however. First, it is precisely the
"facilitator" role of placing the responsibility for action on the local institutions and
organizations that distinguished PROLOCAL from its predecessors and this way of
operation is the essence of its financing function. Secondly, it was concluded previously
that the subproject portfolio (the "hard" element) has directly contributed to the "soft"
part of capacity building ­ and that, properly re-directed, it could do even more.

The lesson here points not to a separation but an integration of the two main roles of
future project teams. Above all, more time and effort must be devoted to creative
interaction with the local actors beyond the necessary routine contract management and



                                               43

financial control.    It is clear that PROLOCAL's reliance on short-term assistance
contracts for specific products and services did not sufficiently allow for the deployment
of the kind of change agents that has functioned in small-scale NGO-sponsored projects
with long-term international financing. And yet, there are some positive experiences with
this realm:
    · PROLOCAL took advantage of field teams already working in the project areas.
        The efforts of such teams fielded by German, Belgian, Swiss or Canadian
        assistance programs were incorporated and reinforced by project resources.
    · The project was also able to tap into the strength of some of the large national
        NGOs that have experience in community capacity development (e.g. the Fondo
        Ecuatoriano Populorum Progressio, FEPP, and the Central Ecuatoriana de
        Servicios Agrícolas, CESA, etc.). A consortium of these NGOs won the contract
        to implement the project in the Cuenca del Río El Ángel, the last micro-region
        activated (because of security problems at the nearby Colombian border), but they
        arrived almost too late to have a significant influence on the overall project
        strategy.
    · A great effort was made to train campesino promoters or sub-professionals,
        generally younger community members working for OSGs, sometimes as
        volunteers, sometimes as remunerated staff.
    · Finally, most of the field staff of PROLOCAL in the regional offices gradually
        assumed roles of change agents, although their official function was to "facilitate"
        the making of convenios or contracts which were the project's principal
        instrument for engaging service providers. Although the staff selection criteria
        did not include "social commitment" as such, a large portion of the field staff was
        highly motivated and inspired with the mission of the project, especially as the
        majority came from the same region where they worked. Even in a small country
        like Ecuador, there are strong regional and cultural differences and identities.

Broad vs. concentrated scope of projects - PROLOCAL was a hybrid of various
previous models, Integrated Rural Development, Community-driven Development, Local
Government-led Development, and as a Social Fund. PROLOCAL's implementation
experience gave expression to another term: Rural-Territorial Development. While the
results of the multi-dimensional approach are generally positive, this experience indicates
that future projects should be more clearly and more narrowly focused (even though they
may be designed to contribute to broader objectives). Especially important is to choose an
economic or a social focus. If the goal is to dynamize the regional economy one must
concentrate on productivity, markets and on both agriculture and non-farm income
opportunities. If the goal is to supplement and make more effective the government's
social welfare services, this calls for a different strategy.

Productive investments vs. social infrastructure - The decision to focus on directly
productive investments was wise, as the cumulative impact of many small income-
producing investments is likely to be high. But even so, in the micro-region of Loja, for
example, half of the subprojects went for social infrastructure (potable water, garbage
disposal). While there is clearly a great demand for such services, the mixing of goals




                                               44

causes dispersion and detracts from the impact of a single project. More particularly, it
dilutes the capacity building efforts.

Private sector - The project progressively recognized the importance to address new
market opportunities and the need to create stronger linkages with the private sector. The
experience of subprojects in the micro-region of Estribaciones de los Andes is indicative
in this regard, as demand evolved from productive subprojects to initiatives based on
expanding organizational capacity and expanding market opportunities. In the same
micro-region, partnering with cocoa and corn companies proved to be very useful to
speed up poverty reduction efforts.

Communication strategy - CDD project like PROLOCAL involve several shifts in
mentality. Having a fully funded and well designed communication strategy has proved
to be critical to stimulate and accompany such changes, by creating the necessary support
by the beneficiaries as well as serve as a tool to inspire trust and build confidence in local
institutions. Having a communication strategy on day one from project implementation
also proved to be important to gain immediate and broad based understanding and
support to the innovative CDD approach, as well as contribute to projects efforts to build
capacity al local level (see Annex 7)

CDD, empowerment and structural transformation - Several evaluations have
observed that the CDD-type projects are not suitable for dealing with fundamental
structural reforms in asset or income distribution and power.3 This issue is of particular
relevance to Ecuador. In spite of the land reforms of the 1970s, most of the cultivable
and best quality land is still in the hands of private estates. Large and medium
commercial producers have privileged access to technology, credit and markets and hold
near monopolies of water resources. Little of their income circulates locally. In Los Rios
province, one of the micro-regions targeted by PROLOCAL, 35% of the farm units only
account for 3% of the total acreage, while about 2% of the largest units occupy almost
50% of the land area. Irrigated banana and coconut plantations of over 100 hectares
dominate the rural landscape, many of which are owned by or are subsidiaries of Dole
and other multi-national corporations. These may use some local wage labor, but buy no
local inputs and do not invest locally. In fact, local capital is frequently siphoned off. In
the municipality of Girón in the Jubones micro-region, which has a lively cooperative
banking system, 35% of deposits are invested in Cuenca, the provincial capital and the
country's third largest city. Because the main sources of basic accumulation are not at all
local, the local rural spaces are likely to remain poor.




3Mansuri and Rao (2004) report that social capital development sidesteps discussions of class and political
economy and does not, per se, raise the themes of income redistribution or the links between asset base and
power. (This has led to a number of attacks on social capital as a "de-politicizing" force). Moreover, it is
asserted that in settings of extreme inequalities and clientelistic cultures, CDD approaches may have little
influence on empowerment (World Bank, 2005).

What does all this mean for PROLOCAL? Structural conditions of very unequal land
distribution, quasi-monopolies over water and often of markets in the targeted micro-
regions acted as constraints both for income enhancement and for community capacity
development, exacerbated by clientelistic practices and pervasive party politics. The
project did not tackle these issues head-on, but rather tried to bypass them. Since it was
not financing large infrastructure subprojects but many scattered small ones, it could
minimize the power constraints and had the flexibility to offer something for every
organization. This cut both ways: it allowed the project to be seen as "non-threatening"
to local and regional elites, but it also restricted its potential influence over issues of
region-wide problems, such as disputes over water rights. CDD-type projects such as
PROLOCAL are confronted by a significant policy constraint. The country does not have
a campesino-supportive rural development policy or national program with budgetary
allocations from its oil revenues to the campesino sector. Such programs could not only
extend technical services down to the grassroots, for which PROLOCAL's experience
provides a good model (see the previous section on service centers), but also facilitate
campesino access to rights in water, land, credit and markets and promote a real
decentralization, making more dynamic regional economics via more attractive local
investments. PROLOCAL, in such a favorable "enabling environment," would have
made much greater sense. Such projects cannot substitute for national pro-poor policies
and measures.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(see Annex 9)
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (formerly the Ministry of Social Welfare)
fully endorsed the ICR in the attached letter, dated 21/02/2008 (Annex 9). The letter
highlights the project's achievements in terms of increased household incomes and rural
employment; facilitated alliances between local level institutions and local governments;
beneficiary communities contributions to local investments; support to local development
processes their institutionalization; and human and social capital formation to enable
local organizations to mobilize new financial resources with a wider range of partners for
their own development. The role of project supervision is stressed by the Ministry in
terms of facilitating continuous learning and adaptation which became the means to
strengthen the project's policies and procedures from the earliest stages of
implementation.

(b) Cofinanciers

The European Commission provided the attached letter, dated 20/02/2008 (Annex 9),
with helpful comments on the draft ICR which have been addressed in the final version
of the document.

4At the request of the Government of Ecuador, the Loan Agreement was amended in 2002 to re-classify
certain operating costs (including salaries of PCU staff), specialized local advisory services required for
preparation and implementation of subprojects (preparation of diagnoses, pre-investment studies,
subproject proposals, administration and monitoring, TA for beneficiaries), and training (for technical staff,
promoters and leaders, workshops for subproject preparation and implementation) under the Project
Coordination Unit category. Hence, its total expenditure increased substantially during implementation.

5Counterpart contributions to subprojects by local actors significantly surpassed original expectations.

6The Government of Ecuador secured US $17.5 million (14.27 million Euros) from the European
Commission to co-finance all components of PROLOCAL, and the fifth component (Improved Rural
Financing Systems) which was not financed under the IBRD loan.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A - Planning for Local Development

PROLOCAL supported participatory planning processes for local development at
parroquia and cantón levels. Major component targets were reached: 84,000 households
participated in the local development planning processes (target was 60,000); 51% of
those individuals who participated in the local planning decision making process were
women (target was 30%), and 126 local governments prepared and/or updated their
respective local development plans (target was 150).7

The project's external evaluation suggests that the potential development impact of this
component is significant in terms of: (i) increased capacity and voice of the rural poor in
local decision making processes; (ii) increased attention to rural areas by local
governments; (iii) renewed and strengthened functions and effectiveness of local
governments; and (iv) strategic partnerships and alliances for rural development. These
are briefly reviewed below:

Engagement of the rural poor in local decision-making process

PROLOCAL has significantly contributed to the incorporation of rural populations in the
local decision making process. As stated before, more than 84,000 households directly
participated in the elaboration or updating of the 126 local development plans co-
financed by the project. This is particularly relevant considering: (a) the conventional
top-down character of most local government practices in Ecuador which has often led to
an antagonist relationship between local governments and citizens; and (b) the lack of
tradition in engaging the rural poor and their organizations in participatory processes
which in the past has excluded them to work with local governments in the prioritization
of possible interventions to overcome their socio-economic constraints.

Increased attention of rural areas by local governments

PROLOCAL has made an effective contribution to set up a participatory development
planning structure that has brought municipalities closer to their rural populations,
enabling a fundamental shift on the country's decentralization implementation focus. As
a result of this local development planning approach, municipal budget allocation to rural
areas in participating municipalities increased from 36% without the project to 52% with
the project8. Such a budget re-allocation is an achievement in itself considering the
limited resources available to most municipalities involved with the project.


7Achievement of less than the originally planned number of development plans does not reflect reduced
efficiency but the fact that some local governments decided to elaborate or update their development plans
at the cantón level which covered several parroquias within their jurisdictions. The component target that
84,000 households participate in local planning processes was surpassed (target was 60,000).

8Based on financial information of municipalities in four micro-regions.



                                                    49

Renewed and strengthened functions and effectiveness of local governments

PROLOCAL has also been effective in promoting a process of renovation and
administrative change within 73 out of 126 local governments involved in the project,
moving from previous sector-oriented structures to more integrated and accountable
planning approaches. Fifteen municipalities promoted significant changes in their
structure and normative planning framework through: (i) creation of new strategic
planning and coordination bureaus; (ii) incorporation of cross-sectoral approaches and
mechanisms for local economic development; and (iii) establishment of participatory
accountability mechanisms from budget elaboration to expenditure tracking and citizens'
oversight. This is a relevant achievement of the project since there was no municipal
strengthening strategy as such in the project design, and impact on the local government
structure was not an explicit component objective. Actions were developed and applied
during the project implementation to respond to the emerging demands from the
municipalities themselves. Furthermore, all juntas parroquiales assisted by the project
improved their role as facilitators of local development by better mobilizing and
articulating their rural populations and organizations with the municipalities.

Strategic partnerships and alliances for local rural development

The preparation process of the local development plans has also contributed to promotion
of strategic alliances for local rural development. This has been instrumental in changing
the management style of local governments, which used to operate in isolation from
community-based organizations and other local structures. In addition, this planning
process has improved the capacity of the local governments to negotiate their vision and
priorities with provincial authorities. Noteworthy evidence includes: (a) the negotiation
between the Association of Juntas Parroquiales of Jipijapa in Southern Manabí and the
provincial government regarding the 2007 provincial budget; and (b) the preparation of
the Provincial Development Plan of Loja based on all four cantón and 24 parroquia
development plans, supported by PROLOCAL. Finally, this planning process brought
together municipalities for the design and implementation of innovative territorial-based
projects as in the case of the Association of Municipalities of the Cuenca Alta del
Jubones.

Component B - Improved Supply of Local Development Related Services

Under this component, PROLOCAL supported: (i) human capital formation, specifically
by strengthening capacities of local service providers and subproject beneficiaries; and
(ii) social and institutional capital formation, specifically by strengthening capacities and
facilitating interaction of local organizations such as grassroots organizations
(communities, water-user associations and other associations) and second-tier
organizations, and local institutions such as juntas parroquiales and concejos cantonales.
A total of 33 cantones, 123 juntas parroquiales, one mancomunidad (i.e. an association
of cantones), 56 second-tier organizations and 252 grassroots organizations




                                              50

(organizaciones de base), and 125 local financial institutions benefited from institutional
strengthening and improved their human resource capacity.

The project's external evaluation suggests that the potential development impact of this
component is significant in terms of: (i) strategic alliances developed; (ii) opportunities
generated for human and institutional development; and (iii) communication and
information systems developed and operated locally. These are reviewed below:

Strategic alliances developed

Within the framework of this component, one of the project objectives was to strengthen
at least six networks or associations of service providers (NGOs and individual
professionals) in the targeted micro-regions.        A total of 17 local networks were
strengthened by the project. Of these, six were technical assistance service providers,
seven local financial institutions, and four local communicators.

Opportunities generated for human and institutional development

Regarding human development, 115 technicians were trained on project formulation and
evaluation, and 950 on project implementation. This compares favorably to the original
target of 400. In addition, the project held several in-service training workshops to
formulate and evaluate projects, and sponsored 35 technicians from the micro-regions to
participate in the Diploma program on Project Formulation and Management offered by
the Escuela Politécnica del Litoral. Most of these professionals were later hired by
farmer organizations to design and evaluate subprojects, achieving a high level of quality
in their preparation. Furthermore 4,207 promoters were trained in areas such as agro-
ecology, agro-industry and communications. Alphabetization subprojects turned out to
be of particular importance since they reached around 18,000 individuals. Regarding
institutional development, 252 new social organizations acquired legal status, a basic
government requirement to access capacity building and subproject support from
PROLOCAL. In total, 840 local organizations and institutions were equipped, compared
to the expected 720.

Communication and information systems developed and operated locally

The Universidad del Austro (a regional university) developed a regional node of the local
development information system (ECUALOCAL) for the Cuenca Alta del Río Jubones
micro-region. The system was later adjusted and implemented in other three micro-
regions. Today, ECUALOCAL is in operation. In addition to this initiative, the project
supported the establishment of 23 telecenters in various localities. Regarding local
communication systems, 28 tailor-made communication products were developed; 189
local communicators were trained; and Diálogo Magazine was created ­ to date, eight
editions have been published and distributed.

Impact of PROLOCAL's organizational capacity building interventions




                                              51

It is evident that evaluating the impact of organizational capacity building is inherently
difficult and even in the most sophisticated international and academic circles it remains
an evolving science (especially in the case of civil society organizations). There is
consensus that this is a long-term process. As proven in many Bank projects, tangible and
sustainable outcomes of capacity building efforts only materialize much later than the
project period.

In mid-2007, the fifth year of the project, a survey was conducted as a preliminary ex-
post assessment of the results attributable to PROLOCAL's capacity building
interventions (see main results in Annex 6). The questions focused on four sets of
indicators of capacity to which PROLOCAL's work was likely to be most relevant: (i)
human resources/leadership; (ii) management capacity; (iii) organizational culture and
(iv) linkages and negotiation.

In addition to highlighting project achievements in the above areas, the assessment made
the following observations that point to areas of improvement in PROLOCAL's capacity
building approach:

First, improving individual competencies by heavy investment in training courses, as
pursued under PROLOCAL, is only weakly connected to organizational learning and
building collective skills. The risk is that training can become instead a vehicle for
individual careers and self-promotion. (Such a motivation seems logical when peasant
leaders and even Junta council members are not paid.) This tendency could be
exacerbated by the demand for diplomas and by academic institutions' general lack of
capacity to teach organizational or management skills in a civil society context. Even
business management programs are not usually appropriate to the needs of small
cooperative-style enterprises of water users associations such as those promoted by the
project.

Second, the assessment confirmed evidence of the generally low degree of utilization of
the Institutional Strengthening Plans (PFIs) which was one of PROLOCAL's instruments
in this component (426 local organizations completed PFIs). The formulation of the PFI
was contracted out to an NGO or to a single consultant from a list of local service
providers, who with some exceptions had limited experience in organizational analysis or
capacity building. While some of the PFIs were good at organizational diagnosis, the
recommendations tended to focus more on formal mattes such as rules and procedures,
holding assemblies or preparing project proposals ("hard skills"). More fundamentally,
the relatively low level of demand for and appreciation of capacity building by the
organizations (in contrast to the high interest in obtaining subprojects grant money) and
above all, the lack of steady follow-up have contributed to the limited impact of the PFIs.

Third, in retrospect, capacity building mainly focused on strengthening the process of
"bottom-up" subproject identification, formulation and execution within the context of
the various local institutions. Demand-driven "projectization" also dominated the efforts
to improve the planning process (local development plans were essentially a compilation
of local project priorities and demands as contributions to a future vision of territorial



                                            52

development). The incentive that motivated an organization to commission PFIs was
most probably the last section which summarized project priorities and the technical
assistance requirements for subproject execution. It was assumed that all organizations
needed to know how to formulate proposals, plan participatively and keep up to date
financial books. As a consequence of the above, there was limited in-service training or
longer-term advisory work, nor sufficient attention to key issues such as user fees and
other aspects of putting organizations on the path toward relative self-sufficiency.

Fourth, remarkable on the issues of participation, representation, internal communication
and accountability, there was the much larger progress perceived among the communities
and the juntas in comparison to their respective higher level second-level and municipal
entities. This clearly reflects the project's strategy of grassroots development.
Consistently very high scores were achieved for advances in legitimacy and member
representation. The OSGs reported increased adherence of their base groups, although
there were cases in which the project may have created tensions by dealing directly with
the bases and bypassing their umbrella OSG. But there was evidence that the campesino
organizations have acquired a greater voice in their relations with the municipalities and
that their greater access to information about projects and budgets has contributed to
empowerment.

Component C - Subprojects

Under this component, PROLOCAL financed subproject investments aimed at improving
access to productive assets, in line with approved technical, social and environmental
eligibility criteria. A total of 930 subprojects (750 at community level, 150 at parroquia
level and 30 at inter-parroquia level) were to be co-financed under this component with
an overall investment of US $20.2 million. In aggregate terms, 757 subprojects were
prepared (as validated profiles or feasibility studies) and 525 were financed. The
achievement of less than the originally planned number of subprojects is not an indication
of reduced project efficiency or increased costs per beneficiary. The average subproject
scale that was co-financed by PROLOCAL was larger than expected at project appraisal,
and the actual number of beneficiary rural communities and families (1,600 and 38,000
respectively) surpassed original targets. The adjustment in project scale was justified in
order to avoid internal conflicts within communities, as community cost ceilings were
found to excessively constrain the number families able to participate in the subprojects.
In light of this, the concept of community subprojects was changed to subprojects
involving one or more communities and groups organized around the same objectives,
while maintaining the cost ceiling per beneficiary family within the levels estimated at
appraisal. Overall project investment in subprojects was also much greater: US $37.2
million instead of the expected US $20.2 million due to larger beneficiary contributions
that surpassed appraisal expectations.      Finally, 98% of subprojects were externally
audited and rated satisfactory (target was 70%).

Component results can be summarized in terms of: (i) beneficiaries' satisfaction with
subproject investments; (ii) outreach of poor and vulnerable population groups; and (iii)
increased access to productive assets and support services.



                                             53

Beneficiaries' satisfaction with subproject investments

One dimension of beneficiaries' appreciation of subproject investments is their revealed
ownership in terms of counterpart contributions. In aggregate terms, they provided almost
46% of total investments (target was 20%). Moreover, beneficiaries' perceptions of
subproject investments were assessed by the EC-funded external evaluation described in
Annex 5. Subprojects were perceived as: relevant to their reality by 77% of beneficiaries;
effective in achieving stated goals by 74% of beneficiaries; and sustainable by 72% of
beneficiaries ­ very close to the target for beneficiaries' satisfaction of 80%.

Outreach of poor and vulnerable population

In terms of gender, 42% of all subproject participants were women. This compares
favorably to the 25% target. To estimate the outreach of poor population, there was not a
systematic base-line assessment of subproject participant income levels. However, it is
evident that the outreach target of 80% of subproject beneficiaries under the poverty line
was achieved, since: (i) a basic subproject eligibility criterion was that beneficiaries were
poor; and (ii) the poverty level in participating cantones and parroquias at project start-
up was around 80% and even higher in rural areas.

Increased access to productive assets and support services

There were not quantitative targets for increase access to assets and support services.
However, in line with the economic and financial analysis in Annex 3, the value of
productive assets increased on average by US $370 per family for around 38,000 families.
Similarly, technical assistance services were made available to beneficiaries by covering
an average cost of US $50 per family. Quality of productive assets and support services
were not systematically assessed. However, as mentioned earlier, 72% of beneficiaries
perceived that subprojects were sustainable in terms of practical application of training
and technical assistance provided and profitability of investments, among other factors.

Component D - Project Coordination

Under this component, PROLOCAL financed essentially the implementation and
operation of the project coordination structure, the communication strategy and the
monitoring and evaluation system. In line with original targets, PROLOCAL's Board of
Directors was established prior to the implementation of the project. During project
implementation, two staff performance evaluations were undertaken. In 2003, the project
communication strategy was made operational. In 2004, the management information
system was implemented and made operational. This system comprised the following
sub-systems: accounting and administration, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects,
human capital, procurement, monitoring of annual operating plans and results framework,
monitoring and execution of agreements, and the digital library.




                                              54

Component E - Improved Rural Financial Systems

As discussed earlier, the original design of PROLOCAL included four technical
components and Project Coordination. However, a fifth component (Improved Rural
Financial Systems), financed by the European Commission, was later incorporated and
implemented as an integral and critical part of the project. Under this component,
PROLOCAL financed the strengthening of local financial entities (EFLs) and the
establishment of a trust fund to support operations of EFLs in the participating micro-
regions.

While modest, the component generated considerable results: 86 non-regulated financial
entities and seven financial institutions networks were strengthened both in terms of
human capital and equipment, 270 EFL staff and 680 EFL members received training in
the six micro-regions, and the trust fund to support EFLs was constituted and is
operational. To date, 19 local financial entities have access to the trust fund resources and
13 new financial products are offered in the six micro-regions. Here, outputs more
closely indicate increased capacity. In addition to progress in credit volumes and
efficiency, the various credit cooperatives and savings & loan associations formed
coordinating networks among each other and started to develop useful linkages to the
micro-enterprises promoted by the project.

The external evaluation documented the following advances (see Annex 6):

No. of members/clients                         Increase of 14%
Total deposits                                 Increase of 26%
Share of delinquency                           Decrease of 66%
No. of rural savings accounts                  Increase of 46%
No. of women borrowers                         Increase of 247%
Volume of rural loans                          Increase of 96%

Some of this progress has been due to the upgrading of large urban-based credit coops
and to the long-term concurrent assistance of European donor agencies. Potentially, the
project's work is most promising in the case of the smaller savings and loan associations,
which are generally run by women. In PROLOCAL, these facilitated greater integration
of financial institutions in the co-financing of sub-projects by taking advantage of
markets for local investments generated through the project to extend coverage, design
adequate credit products, and expand membership and involvement in local development.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

During appraisal, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted based on a sample of 30 potential
subprojects using a methodology similar to the one used during project implementation.
Within the context of an external evaluation, a random sample of 40 subprojects was
selected and evaluated. This sample was obtained from a universe of around 100
subprojects that had completed execution of subproject investments and had at least one
year of operation. The evaluation exercise conducted by the external firm was
complemented with further feasibility analyses with subproject participants since the
financial/economic data were incomplete in twelve subprojects at the time of the external
evaluation.

Due to the relatively small selection universe, the results obtained from the random
sample provide rough unbiased estimations of feasibility at the aggregate level, but not at
micro-regional level or any other subdivision.

During appraisal, economic and financial NPV and IRR were calculated for potential
subprojects and on average terms for selected micro-regions. Together with the financial
analysis, a fiscal impact analysis was performed.

The final evaluation used similar analytical parameters to those used during the ex-ante
evaluation, essentially: a 12% annual discount rate; a 10-year evaluation period (the 20-
year period considered at appraisal was optimistic); and for the economic analysis, a
shadow price (or conversion factor) for labor costs of 70%. Table 1 provides a brief
description of the analyzed subprojects. Table 2 provides a summary of the financial
analysis. Lastly, Table 3 provides a summary of the economic analysis.

Based only on subproject investments and returns, the average Economic NPV would be
US $510/family and the Economic IRR would be 30%. Similarly, the average Financial
NPV would be US $1,070/family and the Financial IRR would be 46%. Under a
pessimistic scenario where the estimated annual benefits would de reduced in half
(considering a zero annual net income every other year), the Economic IRR would be 6%
and the Financial IRR would be 15%. In terms of fiscal impact, the average NPV of fiscal
revenues (basically Value-added Tax) over a 10-year period from subproject investments
and operations would be US $3,600/subproject or US $40/family.

Regarding the financial results, 19 out of 40 subprojects (or 47%) showed financial IRR
lower than 10% (including those with negative returns). Moreover, 5 of 40 (12%) have
not generated returns yet since they involve medium term cattle improvements or
renovation of perennial plantations. Despite the negative returns of 47% of the analyzed
subprojects, the aggregated results revealed significant net financial benefits.

Regarding the economic results, 24 out of 40 subprojects (or 60%) showed economic IRR
lower than 10% (including those with negative returns). As stated earlier, 5 of 40 (12%)
have not generated returns yet since they involve investments, which generate returns in



                                            56

the medium term. Similarly, despite the negative returns of some analyzed subprojects,
the aggregated results revealed significant net economic benefits.

In terms of employment generated, the analyzed subprojects would annually generate on
average around 13 person/years equivalent (530 person/years among 40 subprojects) or
0.2 person/years per participating family. From the total employment generated, around
89% would be family labor (470 person/years equivalent among 40 subprojects).

Given that development planning and local support services activities promoted by the
project contributed to the identification and implementation of subprojects, the results of
the later represent to a large extent the impacts of the whole process. Therefore, if costs
of other project components were considered (around US $19 million) and the average
results of this sample were extrapolated to the actual beneficiary population (around
38,000 families): the overall economic NPV would be US $5 million or US $130/family,
and the overall economic IRR would be 15%; the financial NPV would be US $24
million or US $625/family, and the overall financial IRR 25% (similar to appraisal
estimates).

In line with the above, the incremental annual net income was around US $250/family in
the economic analysis and US $370/family in the financial analysis. Greater average
returns were obtained in the micro-regions of Zona Sur de Manabí and Estribaciones
Centrales de Los Andes. As an indicator of income multiplier effect, the ratio between
incremental annual net income and the project investment was calculated. This ratio is
around 0.6 in the economic analysis and 0.8 in the financial analysis ­ with wide
variation across the various subprojects and micro-regions. This implies that, one dollar
invested by the Government of Ecuador in PROLOCAL subprojects generated 0.6 dollars
of net economic benefits and 0.8 dollar of net financial benefits ­ benefits captured by
rural families.

The average PROLOCAL investment per family was US$440 ­ US$390 in productive
assets and US$50 in technical assistance. Such an average investment per family is very
close to the figure estimated at appraisal. Similarly, the counterpart contribution of
subproject participants was US $330 or 43% of total subproject investments.

Even though the sample is only representative at the project level, some hypotheses can
be formulated when comparing results across micro-regions and support services
provided. Potential differences among subproject executing organizations were analyzed
but little evidence was found in this regard.

Zona Sur de Manabí and Estribaciones Centrales de Los Andes revealed grater financial
and economic returns than the other three micro-regions. This is consistent with the ex-
ante analysis. Such a situation may reveal greater potentialities in certain micro-regions,
both in terms of natural and human resources. However, as the analyzed sample is not
fully representative care should be exercised when drawing conclusions.




                                             57

Subprojects which received in-site technical support revealed on average greater financial
and economic returns than those subprojects, which did not receive it. However, there
was considerable variation across the various subprojects. In-site technical support was
more frequent among subprojects in Zona Sur de Manabí and secondly in Zona
Occidental de Los Ríos.

In terms of subproject type or activity, the economic/financial results are substantially
different from those obtained at the time of appraisal. Agricultural production activities
seem to generate greater returns than non-agricultural activities, value adding activities,
agricultural services and combined agricultural production and value adding activities.
These differences are opposite to those perceived during appraisal (ex-ante cost-benefit
analysis). Subproject types were mixed across micro-regions. There were not significant
differences in terms of relative proportions of subproject types across micro-regions.

Finally, in terms of poverty focus, the analyzed subprojects generated benefits among
rural families living in 22 municipalities with average income level below the poverty
line (US $2/day/person) and 18 municipalities slightly above that level. The poorest
municipalities were located in Zona Sur de Manabí and Cuenca Alta del Río Jubones,
whereas the better off municipalities were located in Estribaciones Centrales de Los
Andes, Zona Oriental de Loja, and Zona Occidental de Los Ríos. Nevertheless in light of
the norms established the project for funding subprojects, it is likely that the majority of
subproject participants were under the poverty line even in those better-off municipalities.

Annex 5. External Evaluation

This Annex reports on results from various evaluations: one external evaluation carried
out by external experts of the European Commission (EC); an internal evaluation carried
out by the project team at mid-term level; and an assessment carried out in the Cuenca
del Rio Angel micro-region, which was the last region incorporated to PROLOCAL and
thus was not included in the previous evaluations.

Introduction

From the outset, PROLOCAL sought to improve the livelihoods and the surroundings of
a key group of people that became the main and most relevant actors for the success of
the project.    Consequently it was deemed necessary to obtain feedback from the
beneficiaries to evaluate project impact and performance and examine whether this was
in line with local actors' expectations.

In PROLOCAL, beneficiaries were those individuals who participated directly in the sub-
projects; the organizations linked to the sub-projects and other capacity building
investments; the local actors and the organizational network on which PROLOCAL acted
upon or had an influence. More specifically the direct beneficiaries of the subprojects are
the individuals, families and organizations directly linked to them. The beneficiaries and
participants of the institutional strengthening activities are the local legal or de facto
organizations and institutions: local governments, civil society organizations, including
local financial institutions, cooperatives and savings and loans institutions, communal
banks, etc.

To assess PROLOCAL impacts on project beneficiaries, achievements must be analyzed,
to determine how participatory was the process yielding such achievements, and how
much influence on reaching these achievements had on the training and the
organizational strengthening provided by the project. Against this context, the ex-post
evaluation carried out by the EC worked with a sample of 40 subprojects, which was
analyzed under two lenses; first, analyzing the perceptions of the direct beneficiaries of
subprojects; and secondly, analyzing the perceptions of the beneficiaries of the
institutional strengthening component on how this component influenced the structure
and management of their organizations. The institutional strengthening component was
analyzed considering three main areas: formulation of local development plans; capacity
strengthening of local service providers; and strengthening of the local financial systems.

The methodology used by the external evaluation at their beneficiary interviews and
workshops has taken into account five criteria to judge the effects of institutional
strengthening and of subprojects. The main results are presented below according to the
same criteria: (i) relevance; (ii) efficiency; (iii) efficacy; (iv) impact; and (v)
sustainability.

Relevance




                                            64

To evaluate beneficiaries' perceptions about the relevance of subprojects the following
indicators were considered: (i) inclusion of subproject in local development plans;
adequacy of their design; and whether the subproject was designed in a participatory
manner.

Survey results suggest that the vast majority (98%) of the implemented subprojects were
part of the local development plans. Their design was considered adequate, although
47% required some level of reformulation.

Regarding institutional strengthening, relevance was analyzed in terms of the level of
stakeholder participation in the design, the design itself, the need or not for reformulation,
and whether it has not or it is being implemented.            The majority of beneficiaries
perceived that institutional strengthening activities had an adequate design, that the
process was participatory and that the needs and opportunities of the participants were
adequately identified: 70 % of those interviewed said that there was no need for
reformulating proposals, and a large share of the activities (81%) continue to be
implemented. Beneficiaries indicated that the project-provided training improved the
participatory decision making process and the access to information, which in turn
improved the management of the organizations. Nonetheless, due to the relatively short
time elapsed, it is not yet possible to assert that the local development plans have been
adopted/institutionalized by the local governments as a management tool.

With respect to relevance, the internal evaluation undertaken by the project team
concluded that the local actors considered the project to be highly relevant and
highlighted the adaptability of project instruments to the needs of the population and their
educational, social and cultural situation.

Efficiency

Efficiency was assessed based on beneficiary perceptions about the time and cost
involved in assessing subprojects. Nearly 75% of those interviewed thought that in terms
of costs subprojects were implemented according to the initial plans. However, in terms
of timing, 60% of beneficiaries thought that there were delays with respect to the original
plans, and thus efficiency was less robust. The delays were reported to be partly due to
the difficulties faced by the counterparts to meet the co-financing and other requirements
expected by PROLOCAL (i.e. organizations with formal legal status, cash counterpart
financing, etc.).

Efficiency perceptions for institutional strengthening could be summarized as "mid-
high", although they varied widely amongst the various capacity building
subcomponents. For instance, the institutional strengthening for local development was
rated as efficient in terms of implementation time by 47% of beneficiaries, and in terms
of budget by 86% of those interviewed. In contrast, the development of local services,
both in terms of time and cost, were considered efficient by 90% of those interviewed.
The perception of efficiency with respect to local financial systems had the more
favorable rating in terms of budget adequacy (80 % of those interviewed) than in terms of



                                             65

implementation time (40% of those interviewed).

Those who responded that efficiency was not adequate in terms of time reported that this
was largely due to the many requirements involved in assessing PROLOCAL services.
The difficulties to gather the cash counterpart contributions were highlighted.

According to the internal evaluation, efficiency of the project was "good", highlighting
the success of its management, largely as a result of good coordinating mechanisms.
However, it was recognized that preparation of agreements and convenios with
beneficiaries took more time than expected, and thus delayed implementation.

Efficacy

Efficacy of subprojects was rated as "high", meaning that the initiatives implemented
with the support of PROLOCAL met their goals and the participants are aware and have
benefited from the results. A significant share (38%) of those interviewed perceived that
the results were better than expected.

The efficacy of the institutional strengthening component was measured by: level of
achievement of the expected results; whether the participants knew and had benefited
from the results; and whether the number of beneficiaries was higher than those expected.
With respect to the management of the local plans the perception of full achievement of
results was reported by 79% of the respondents, and the perception of knowledge and
benefit of the results by 89% of those being interviewed. Results from the development
of local services subcomponent were perceived by 100% of those interviewed to have
been fully achieved with full participation and knowledge of the beneficiaries. With
respect to results from the local financial services subcomponent, 90% of those
interviewed thought that were achieved and the participants were fully aware and
benefited from the benefits.

Efficacy was rated as "very good" by the internal evaluation, highlighting that a
participatory culture and a sense of ownership had been strengthened. The initial mistrust
of the local inhabitants to the outlook offered by PROLOCAL contrasts with the
continued stream of new demands at the end of the project.

Impact

In reviewing beneficiary perceptions about subproject impacts, it should be considered
that productive subprojects had, in the best of cases, just finished their fist productive
cycle or were still under implementation. Taking this into account, 61% of those
interviewed perceived that their income had increased, and 88% perceived that the rate of
unemployment had been reduced as a result of the subproject. On average 72% perceived
positive changes in attitudes, such as increased savings and reinvestment capacity and
propensity, entrepreneurial spirit, willingness to participate in the management and
control of their grassroots organizations, interest in production diversification and
marketing, and in organizational strengthening.



                                            66

The impact of the institutional strengthening component focused on the following
criteria: community participation in monitoring and control; appropriate social and
cultural focus; women and youth participation; knowledge of the plan; and organizational
strengthening. The results gathered showed a positive response by all (100%) of those
interviewed with respect to impact of investments. For local development it was also
high, between 76-89%.

The impact of the rural financial services component was also considered to be
significant. Over 93% of those interviewed considered that the Local Financial
Institutions (LFIs) were in better position to implement policies to improve access to
credit; 90% considered that there was greater propensity to save by members; 100% that
LFIs had improved human resources; and 60% that relationships with other LFIs were
improving towards the consolidation of networks. In summary there was a perception
that the LFIs had been strengthened by the project.

The internal evaluation considered that the project's impact was significant, even when it
was not possible to assert that PROLOCAL could substantially reduce poverty that had
been built over so many years and generations. The acquired capacity to foster new
partnerships with other institutions and funding sources to support new investments
outside PROLOCAL was also identified as a noteworthy impact.

Sustainability

Although too early to have a clear forecast of subproject sustainability, the beneficiary
surveys and workshops covered several aspects, including: the practical application of the
training provided; whether strategic alliances had been formed so far; the profitability
level of the investments; whether marketing systems were established; the use of agro-
ecological practices; and whether an appropriate gender and social approach had been
implemented.

Over 72% of the respondents indicated that the basis for the sustainability of the
subprojects had been established. To measure the sustainability of the institutional
strengthening component, beneficiaries were asked about their newly acquired
organizational capacities, the increment of self-worth amongst the relevant actors, the
increase in trust towards local governments and organizations, and the increment of
strategic alliances, among others. Generally speaking perceptions of sustainability were
encouraging: 82% saw an increase in their organizational capacity, 92% perceived an
increase in self-worth, and 100% of those interviewed said to have recuperated their trust
on social organizations.

The internal evaluation considered the sustainability of the project to be "very good".
However the continued support of the government was deemed indispensable for the
long-term success of the project. This included support from the Provincial Directorates
(Direcciones Provinciales) of the Ministry of Social Welfare which must be involved
particularly in the legalization process of the organizations.



                                              67

Evaluation of the Cuenca del Rio Angel micro-region

The previous evaluations did not include in their analysis the miro-region Cuenca del Rio
Angel, which was incorporated into the project at a later stage. An external evaluation of
this micro-region was undertaken in July 2006. The main conclusions of this evaluation
were the following: (i) implementation of PROLOCAL through a consortium of NGOs
with significant experience in the region resulted in very high efficiency in terms of
subproject implementation; (ii) even though PROLOCAL was an invigorating force for
rural development initiatives in the micro-region, the short period of execution reduced
the possibilities to achieve sustainable processes; (iii) the areas where PROLOCAL
achieved highest impact concentrated around the dynamic initiatives started by other
organizations that had left the necessary infrastructure to propel the tools offered by
PROLOCAL.

Finally, it should pointed out that although the above evaluations based on direct
interviews with beneficiaries have gathered valuable stakeholder impressions, opinions,
and suggestions regarding PROLOCAL, they are nonetheless perceptions.              For this
reason in the fifth year of the project, a survey was conducted as an ex-post assessment of
the results attributable to PROLOCAL capacity building interventions. The findings of
this study and related beneficiary workshops are described in Annex 6.

Annex 6. Field Evaluation of Capacity-Building Interventions and Beneficiary
Workshop Results

1. Field Evaluation of Capacity-Building Interventions

In mid-2007, the fifth year of the project, a stakeholder survey was conducted as a
preliminary ex-post assessment of the results attributable to PROLOCAL capacity
building interventions.

One cantón was selected in each of the six-micro-regions, where the interventions of
PROLOCAL were earliest and most intense. The sample consisted of six municipal and
11 junta parroquial-level local governments, 15 second-level and 17 community-level
campesino organizations. The questions focused on four sets of indicators of capacity to
which    PROLOCAL's        work     was  likely   to   be   most   relevant:   (i)  human
resources/leadership; (ii) management capacity; (iii) organizational culture; and (iv)
linkages and negotiation. Forty-two indicators were used, grouped into 12 variables.

Progress and impact

It is evident that to evaluate the impact of organizational capacity building is inherently
difficult and even in the most sophisticated international and academic circles it remains
an evolving science (especially in the case of civil society organizations). There is
consensus that this is a long-term process. As has been proven in many World Bank
projects, tangible and sustainable outcomes of capacity building efforts only materialize
much later than the project period. Therefore, the evidence that follows represents more
progress than impact. In PROLOCAL's case the difficulty is compounded by the fact that
three of the six micro-regions have operated only three years and one over two years.

A further complication is the existence of six target groups: two types of campesino
organizations (second level and community based), two types of local government
(cantones and juntas parroquiales), local financial entities and networks of local
professionals with their NGOs. More information is available on the first four types, so
we begin by showing the summary table of a recent survey of a sample of 49
organizations, selected from the cohort having had the longest project interventions.

The figures in the table below were derived from a scoring system expressed as a share of
the maximum possible scores of 100%. Thus 50% or less indicates low progress/impact,
above 80% high impact, and between 50% and 80% medium or moderate results.

Overall, the results, with all the caveats of little time elapsed and possible respondent bias,
are positive. Only one of the scores fell below 50 and 6 of the 16 summary scores are
above 70. The lowest score of 39.5% was in the community-based organizations (OB)'s
capacity for linkages and negotiations.         This is partly explained by the fact that
community-based groups tend to have fewer and weaker linkages than the other
organizations. Comparatively, the most robust results are in organizational culture. Next
in importance is progress in leadership and human resources. It is interesting to note that,
comparing progress by type of organizations, the newly created juntas parroquiales were
rated highest, that is, they took advantage of the opportunities the project offered to
advance from an initially very low level of organization. The impact on the municipal
governments was the lowest.

Below, we disaggregate the four dimensions shown in the table for a better understanding
of progress in specific aspects of capacity.

Human Resources and Leadership

In this dimension, the peasant associations indicated the most progress in their technical
and supervisory capacities, and in the formation of potential new leaders and field
promoters. But the scores for entry of women and younger persons into leadership
positions were quite modest. The very consistent advances shown by the community
level organizations in leadership and organizational skills in such aspects as participation
rates and decision making, is confirmed by other data and observations. This reflects, in
part, the initial very low level of organization among the peasant communities and the
catalytic effects of subprojects.

In the case of local governments, respondents rated very highly the impacts of
PROLOCAL's training programs. However, less progress is acknowledged in local



                                               70

government capacity to acquire technical staffs, which has been mainly a function of low
budgets.

Management

The greatest advances are reported in accounting, financial control and in the preparation
of financial reports. All the organizations reported advances in the skills for preparation
of subprojects and have increased their capacity to access outside resources.

The survey confirmed other evidence of the limited degree of utilization of the
Institutional Strengthening Plans (PFIs) which was one of PROLOCAL's instruments in
this component. Of the six relevant indicators only two are rated highly (preparation of
annual plans and identification of priority projects). Most of the PFIs were good
diagnostic tools. But the relatively low level of demand for capacity building by the
organizations (in contrast to the high interest in obtaining subprojects grant money) and
above all, the lack of skilled follow-up have contributed to the modest impact of the PFIs.

Organizational culture

The variables in this dimension were: Participation, Representation, Internal
Communication and Accountability. Remarkable here was the much larger progress
perceived among the communities and the juntas parroquiales in comparison to their
respective higher level second-level and municipal entities. This clearly reflects the
project's strategy of grassroots development. Consistently very high scores were
achieved for advances in legitimacy and member representation. The OSGs reported
increased adherence of their base groups, although there were cases in which the project
created tensions by dealing directly with the bases and bypassing their umbrella OSG.

Participation

The consistently high scores for the peasant associations signal important gains in raising
their external representativeness and in cementing internal relations between the OSG
and their member groups. This appears to apply particularly to the older OSG which over
the years have lost their legitimacy and capacity to deliver services valued by their bases.
The juntas parroquiales have benefited especially in recognition of their capacity of
representation at the community level.

Communication

Advances are reported in accountability through better internal communication.
Communication strategies were prepared for many organizations but there is insufficient
evidence on their implementation. However investments in ECUALOCAL to provide an
electronic information system on development topics to the local organizations have had
limited demand from them, as the actual use has been poor .

Linkages and negotiation



                                            71

With the exception of high scores for increases in the ability to negotiate (to form
alliances and networks), the impact in this variable was lower than expected. This may be
explained by the limited relevance of these indicators to the base level organizations (that
have few linkages) and by the fact that the different networks formed are yet to
demonstrate concrete benefits.

It is especially difficult to find evidence on empowerment in the directionality of
linkages, especially vis-à-vis local power holders. But there is some evidence that the
campesino organizations have acquired a greater voice in their relations with the
municipalities and that their greater access to information about projects and budgets has
contributed to empowerment.

In a few municipalities two potentially important changes have occurred: first the
establishment of some planning or rural affairs offices, which could become focal points
in the evolution of the municipal government toward a greater developmental role, and
second, a shift of municipal budgets in favor of rural services.

PROLOCAL has wisely supported the emergence of some larger federation of
organizations that could act on a wider scale and also assume capacity-building functions
for their members. Thus, the newly created association of juntas parroquiales will most
likely continue to reinforce the capacity of its constituents. It is also to be expected of the
few third tier campesino associations.

Local financial entities

This component, while modest, generated considerable results. Here, outputs more
closely indicate capacity. In addition to progress in credit volumes and efficiency, the
various credit cooperatives and savings & loan associations formed coordinating
networks among each other and started to develop useful linkages to the micro-
enterprises promoted by the project.

The external evaluation shows the following advances:

No. of members/clients                         Increase of 14%
Total deposits                                 Increase of 26%
Share of delinquency                           Decrease of 66%
No. of rural savings accounts                  Increase of 46%
No. of women borrowers                         Increase of 247%
Volume of rural loans                          Increase of 96%

Some of this progress has been due to the upgrading of large urban-based credit coops
and to the long-term concurrent assistance of European donor agencies. Potentially,
PROLOCAL's work is most promising in the case of the smaller savings and loan
associations, which are generally run by women.

Training

The most important instrument (and input) of PROLOCAL for capacity enhancement
was training. This was mostly delivered through short-term courses and workshops. The
ex-post survey included special interviews with a sample of 123 participants in training
courses: 69 were leaders; 42 were technical staff, 9 were sub-professional promoters and
3 were community members.

The survey compared the utility of the training expressed by the participants in their
function within their respective organizations with the benefits derived for their
individual careers. The following table summarizes the results:

Overall, the participants rated the usefulness of the training programs highly, but also
equally useful for organizational and personal benefits. None of the informants said that
the programs were of little or no utility. The exception to the near perfect scores in both
institutional and personal dimensions was the ratings of the second level campesino
federations, where the personal career utility (83.3%) exceeded the collective utility
(69.6%). This finding may have two explanations: on one hand, it indicates the abundant
external assistance provided by other donors to federations; and on the other hand, it
indicates the natural motivation of federation leaders and staff to have more remunerative
employment rather than being perpetual organizational volunteers with only prestige and
sometimes power as benefits. The failure by OSGs of assessing membership fees and
other measures for achieving financial self-sufficiency are the root cause of this situation,
which PROLOCAL did not address. When asked to rate the usefulness of training by
subject matter, leadership courses were considered by far the most useful (41.5%)
followed by technical (28.5%) and administrative/legal (22.8%) subjects.

The replies to the questionnaire on training confirm other parts of the survey in
highlighting the juntas parroquiales as the major beneficiaries of PROLOCAL's

capacity-building efforts. Junta members were the most articulate in identifying the
highest useful training subjects (lowest rate of response for "unspecified general subjects)
and had the highest scores for appreciating the usefulness of leadership and
administrative/legal courses.

2. Stakeholder Workshops and Results

At the beginning of 2007, an independent consultancy was contracted to conduct a
qualitative assessment of stakeholders and their acquired capacities. For this work,
workshops were undertaken in six selected municipalities (one form each micro-region,
namely: Paltas, Jipijapa, Echeandía, Pueblo Viejo and Mira) to analyze in a participatory
manner the results achieved in terms of the capacity strengthening of territorial
stakeholders (local governments, second-tier organizations and grassroots organizations),
their relationships and their strategies for the sustainability of local development actions.
Based on the conclusions of this consultancy, PROLOCAL has had incidence on three
broad areas: (i) economic dynamism - production; (ii) policy - institutions; and (iii) social
dimensions ­ organizations. These are discussed below:

Economic dynamism - production

The support and promotion of alternative production related subprojects such as, tourism,
micro-enterprises and non-traditional crops, was considered by organizations as a
contribution of PROLOCAL with high incidence, since these activities have improved
peasant economies. In terms of productivity, the support and promotion of irrigation
systems improvements is highlighted. It is noteworthy the recognition given by local
people and organizations to training activities, and their positive effect on production and
peasant economic dynamism. Generally, training processes lose momentum as programs
and projects advance during execution. In this regard, the project developed a very
pertinent training strategy with technical and social dimensions. Successful training areas
include: informatics, management, accounting, social control and monitoring of financial
management. Provision of adequate equipment for telecommunications and computer
processing, together with practical training for their use, was appreciated.

Policy - institutions

The perception of the majority of beneficiaries is that PROLOCAL had incidence in
people's participation especially when dealing with local governments. This is a positive
sign of the strengthening of grassroots and second-tier organizations. PROLOCAL was
able to bring closer municipal governments and their population. Through local
development plans, local governments had notoriously improved their relationships with
organizations at various levels and juntas parroquiales. The execution of local
development plans has recovered the trust of local organizations in local development
initiatives ­ these organizations severely criticized institutions which only prepared
documents and do not contribute to execution of plans conceived. Second-tier
organizations and local governments recognize the support provided by the project and
how they improved their presence with their constituencies and their management



                                              74

capacities. Municipal governments have improved governance through participative
budgeting, ordinances to support local development, and planning and monitoring
commissions for local development plans.

Social dimensions ­ organizations

There is high recognition to efforts undertaken by organizations, with the support of
PROLOCAL, to improve relationships across organizations, associating local actors so as
to undertake cooperation agreements which go beyond financing only. There was
resource optimization by municipal governments and juntas parroquiales. Resources
provided by the project always reached both local government levels and involved
communities through social accountability and monitoring of funds. There was capacity
building on subproject preparation, local development management and leadership
development among local actors. Legal registration of organization was in most cases an
important instrument to access funds available in various institutions. However, some
informal organizations perceived this legalization as a constraint for their development,
since they could not enter into agreements and obtain funds.

Positioning of stakeholders in local development

Stakeholders were positioned within a network of interactions or socio-grams, according
to their level of incidence in policy aspects, management and vision of local development.
In this context, PROLOCAL is perceived with high incidence. Municipal governments
are also perceived with high incidence, with one exception. The project was able to
strengthen juntas parroquiales, and they are also perceived with high incidence. Second-
tier organizations are favorably perceived in terms of participation and local development
promotion. However, their incidence in policy matters is low. The perception about
NGOs is variable, particularly because their presence is not stable in local territories.
Provincial Councils are perceived to have high incidence in policy matters, but their
participation in local development is low, with one exception. The resources invested by
PROLOCAL in development of strategic development plans, institutional strengthening
proposals, ordinances, and micro-regional coordination units allowed that the project and
local governments would increase their incidence, so as to be perceived as the pillars of
local development.

Annex 7. Assessment of PROLOCAL Communication Strategy

Background and objectives

The original objectives aims of the communication strategy were ambitious: it was
expected to: (i) familiarize potential participants of the project's aims and activities and
give these greater visibility; (ii) facilitate information exchange among the various
stakeholders and hence promote participation and collaboration; and (iii) provide basic
information useful for planning and projects to local entities, especially on technological
and marketing topics. The third objective was expected to be reached within a larger
framework, involving the Ministry of Agriculture and ODEPLAN (Oficina de
Planificación de la Presidencia). However, these national linkages did not materialize
well, and as a result, the communication strategy re-focused on two components: (i) the
so-called institutional activities and (b) community-type communication.                    While the
former was aimed at building a supportive political environment for PROLOCAL by
stimulating dialogues on development among local and national stakeholders, the latter
was geared towards empowering communities to form collective identities and to
facilitate information flows to the grassroots (see figure below).

                                    (e.g. Fora, Radio Programs)



Activities and output

The first component included the development of an institutional website, the publication
of a magazine on local development (Diálogo), the organization of national fora and fairs,
an institutional newsletter (Notilocal), institutional and lessons sharing videos, press
releases, and the support to a national campaign to disseminate results called "This is
Ecuador we want and we build".



                                                 76

The second component featured training of community-level communicators, but also
included the provision of technical and financial support to local actors, ranging from the
participatory development of radio programs to communication strategies of local
institutions. The project also supported the establishment of infocenters and of an
information management system called ECUALOCAL.

Main results

There is no systematic evaluation of the impact of the various communication processes.
As in other components, the monitoring system focused on quantitative outputs, i.e. so
many events held, number of people trained, articles published, etc. Nevertheless, from
beneficiary surveys on the level of client satisfaction and field observations, a generally
positive picture emerges. This appears to be the case for both the public relations and
media-type aspects and the "information as empowerment" aspects. Several aspects are
highlighted below:

    · In general, a good understanding and appreciation of the project was created, as
        proven by the large share of the target population, which became familiar with its
        overall approach (82% according to an external evaluation) and the high number
        of articles in the national press (73% according to the 2006 press review),
        expressing a positive view of the project.

    · The communication strategy also contributed to position the concept of local
        development in the public debate, as demonstrated by the annual press review
        carried by the project. Media attention to local development issues increased,
        from an average of three appearances per month to more than 20 during the last
        year of implementation.

    · The strategy expanded the variety of opportunities for local population to provide
        feedback to the project and local governments, as shown by the high number of
        spontaneous initiatives of social accountability generated by PROLOCAL, the
        numerous letters, calls and visits received in the regional offices from persons not
        directly benefited or targeted by the project.

    · Community-based organizations became aware of the importance of this tool to
        channel their demands, create transparency, and foster a culture of social
        accountability. At least half of the executing agencies and 47 local governments
        included some version of a communication program in their management plans as
        a result of the project.


    · Overall, the communication strategy helped in building a favorable image of
        PROLOCAL and greater trust among the local institutions. According to the
        external evaluation conducted by the EC, the target population increased their
        confidence in their own local governments (63%), and the local financial



                                             77

      institutions (55%). At the end of the project 90% of juntas parroquiales and 80%
      of municipalities improved the perception of their external accountability.

Some lessons learned from implementing the Communication Strategy

  · Having a flexible and decentralized communication strategy was helpful in
      addressing the micro-regions' socio-cultural complexity in an adequate manner.

  · Some aspects of communication had a promise of sustainability because they
      relied on local structures. In particular, the decision to select and train local
      reporters and communicators from local organizations ensured that capacity was
      successfully transferred to such organizations as a whole. A good example has
      been the involvement and training of local communicators from Radio Alfaro, a
      local community radio which contributed to project activities, but also found a
      way to sustain such activities after project closure by acquiring licenses for a
      wider coverage, thereby increasing the financial capacity of the radio. The project
      also contributed to build ownership of its activities by the government, by
      strategically anchoring some of its products to the communication strategy of the
      Ministry of Social Welfare. Some of its products, such as the magazine Dialogo
      have become official communication tools of the MBS.

  · The use of locally rooted communication channels and media proved to be more
      effective than those with advanced technology, as shown by the successful
      involvement of the project in locally owned events (e.g. local fairs, sport events,
      etc.), while more modest results achieved by the institutional website and the
      ECUALOCAL information system.

  · An important lesson for the future is that the goal of providing useful information
      to local organizations must be demand-driven, rather than supply-driven, as has
      frequently happened with donor projects. In PROLOCAL, significant resources
      were spent on supporting a computerized system of development data at the
      Universidad del Austro (a regional university), without sufficiently ascertaining
      the type of information municipal governments and campesino organizations
      actually needed and were capable of processing.

Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR

This Annex summarizes the salient points of the Borrower's ICR. Several sections
describing the project as conceived in the PAD and other information easily observable
from tables in the full Borrower's ICR have not been included in this summary.

    1. Quality at the Beginning of Project Implementation


Probably the most important aspect influencing the impact and the results of
PROLOCAL was putting together a competent managerial, technical and administrative
team with high degree of professionalism and interpersonal skills, as well as commitment
towards PROLOCAL development objectives. On the one hand, the quality of the team
contributed to lessen the permanent attempts of political interference, and thus the hiring
of personnel unqualified to face the challenges implicit in the implementation of this
innovative project. On the other, the transparency of the actions in favor of the poorest
generated confidence among the local actors.

The facilitating approach of the intervention, in addition to supporting the genuine
demands of the local actors, were decisive in reaching the objectives of PROLOCAL, to
promote local development processes, and to constitute itself in an adequate instrument to
reduce poverty and include the poor and the extreme poor in the gathering of the benefits
generated by the social development, economic and environmental sustainable
approaches.

    2. Economic Analysis

The implementation of 473 productive initiatives, in six micro-regions and with
participation of 37,633 families, generated the following impacts:

Permanent employment generation: For each participating family 0.33 permanent jobs
were created per year, with a total of 12,481 jobs during the four years of implementation.
For that, PROLOCAL invested US $16.9 million, or US $1,353 per permanent job.

According to project design, it was estimated that agricultural, agro forestry, agri-
commercial/services subprojects would employ 7,900 person/years. The implementation
of the subprojects generated 9,794 jobs/year, or 24% more than expected.

Environmental investments reached US $5.2 million, which also allowed for the hiring of
an important number of people each year. They represent 20% of the jobs generated by
PROLOCAL. The institutional strengthening projects generated 217 jobs.

From the standpoint of project size, the parroquia and cantón level subprojects generated
an average of 0.35 permanent jobs per year per family, while families participating in
community subprojects benefited with 0.1 jobs per year. Additionally, it is worth noting
that community level projects required higher investment to employ one person for a year.




                                            79

In fact, for this size of projects US $2,765 were invested to create one job, while for
cantón level subprojects it was US $1,479 and at parroquia level US $1,263.

Increases in family income: The 473 implemented subprojects with 37,633 participating
families increased the annual family income by around US$11.9 million, or US $316 per
family per year.      When comparing the total investment by PROLOCAL during
implementation (US $16.9 million) and the total incremental income, it shows that for
each dollar invested the families benefited 0.7 dollars per year. If we compare with the
families participating in productive subprojects (24,158) and the total increase in income
(US $10.8 million), it shows that each family increased its income by US $446 per year.
These indicators would tend to continue going up until the subprojects are fully
implemented.

From the point of view of the size of the subprojects the increase in family income does
not show high dispersion. In fact, families participating in community level subprojects
increased their incomes by US $376 on average, while those taking part in parroquia
level subprojects by US $247 and cantón level subprojects US $477.

Increases in family assets: PROLOCAL allowed the capitalization of families through
productive assets (US $10.9 million), or US $290 per family.

Increase in technical capital: PROLOCAL invested US $3.5 million in the
improvement of the technical and productive capacities of the families, as a result of
technical assistance and training provided. .

Net present value/Economic Rate of Return: The NPV and the IRR were calculated for
the 40 subprojects selected for the impact evaluation. From these, 16 projects yielded
rates lower to the opportunity cost of 12%. However the results from all the evaluated
subprojects are positive, yielding a NPV of US $9.8 million and a IRR of 58%.

    3. Factors affecting the implementation and the results

    Exogenous


           Accounting for the low of credibility and effectiveness of projects and
           programs implemented by previous governments, the local actors had a
           negative perception against PROLOCAL at the start of implementation.
           Changing this perception and achieving effective participation from all local
           actors demanded great efforts from the technical teams. This unfavorable
           environment delayed the initiation of project activities as time was invested to
           build trust and constructive relationships with local and regional stakeholders.

           The political instability that reigned during the implementation of
           PROLOCAL was a factor that had a negative effect in execution. In four
           years the project saw three Presidents, eight Ministers of Social Welfare, six
           of which due to their short tenure could not internalize the project and thus



                                             80

could not bring the necessary political support to bring an environment
conducive for reaching project objectives. Only the last three Ministers (Dr.
Alberto Rigail, Dr. Rubén Barberán and Economist, Jeannett Sánchez), by
recognizing that the project was a pro-poor instrument through income and
employment generation, endorsed the process that started in 2002 and
propelled it for its consolidation.

The participation of the various social organizations and local governments in
the local development proposal required meeting a series of legal and fiscal
requirements which were not demanded by the organizations to have access to
government resources. To establish this culture in the various actors required
effort and time, in many cases extremely a long time. Nonetheless these types
of inconveniences were overcome as the project was implemented. To obtain
a RUC, open accounts after a long process of bidding by financial entities, to
comply with the rigorous norms of the procurement process according to the
source of the resources (World Band, European Commission), legalizing
grassroots social organizations, among others, were factors that delayed the
utilization of project resources.

During the implementation of PROLOCAL there were several attempts of
political interference in the hiring of the managerial, technical and
administrative teams. Fortunately, transparent and rigorous selection and
hiring processes in place as well as the regular performance evaluations of the
project staff constrained the attempts to introduce staff that did not have the
competencies to successfully undertake the activities inherent to each position.

The incompatibility in the application of established legal norms and national
laws (Ley Orgánica de la Contraloría del Estado, Ley de Contratación
Publica, Ley de Consultoría) and the normative framework applied to execute
international credit agreements resulted in procurement delays for goods and
services for the implementation of the subprojects.

The project had as an objective to strengthen local capacities, particularly for
the provision of formulation, monitoring and evaluation. It was expected that
there would be a minimum installed capacity to start the strengthening process.
Unfortunately this was not the case. The project first had to strengthen the
capacities of the service providers in the use of the technical and
methodological instruments, so that they could later facilitate the processes.

Implementation of the local development plans implies medium to long term
processes, if it is desired that they become adopted institutionally, and that
they become means to break the social inequalities to benefit the poor.
PROLOCAL implemented interventions for as long as four years or as short
as 18 months, which suggests that the implementation period of PROLOCAL
was too short to fully achieve the proposed objectives with the project's new
and innovative intervention approach.



                                  81

            In summary it could be argued that the context in which PROLOCAL was
            developed was difficult, as it had to undertake actions in geographical areas
            with highly depressed populations, with high levels of illiteracy, without
            access to basic services, and without government policies to tackle rural
            development, without government investment in support small agricultural
            producers, and facing the weakening of the organizations and their internal
            leadership, amongst others.


   Endogenous


The dynamism in the implementation of the project, especially during the first one and
half years, was constrained by the following:

            The methodological instruments required to jump-start PROLOCAL were
            incomplete and required to be adjusted according to the reality.
            Methodologies to move forward with the Local Development Planning and
            Subproject components had to be adjusted and in some cases reformulated, as
            well as a new institutional strengthening strategy. Also, the communication
            strategy and the procurement norms had to be adjusted to the capacities of the
            implementing entities.

            The defined sequencing of the components in the original design of
            PROLOCAL was key at the time of disbursement, particularly for the
            implementation of the productive initiatives and for the organizational
            strengthening of the implementing entities, as it was required to wait for the
            cantón and parish development plans to be ready. In some micro-regions it
            was evident which productive areas should be supported with subprojects and
            or institutional strengthening plans.

            The new management model adopted at the Cuenca del Rio Angel also
            affected the process of implementation of PROLOCAL due to the lengthy and
            cumbersome administrative process it required to contract a NGO consortium.
            Obtaining favorable reports from the Procuraduría General del Estado, the
            Contraloría General del Estado, the World Bank and the European
            Commission so the Consortium could start managing this Regional Technical
            Unit took eight months of negotiations.

            The original document of PROLOCAL was subject to several adjustments.
            For instance, the goal was to have 600 community level projects and to
            support the same number of communities. This had to be changed as, from
            the operational and financial standpoint, it was not the most effective and
            efficient way to reach the establish goal.

            The low weak administrative capacity of the social organizations was a factor
            limiting their rapid adjustment to the dynamics and intervention model of


                                             82

            PROLOCAL. The strong support given by the project to the institutional
            strengthening strategy designed during the implementation of PROLOCAL,
            allowed the active participation of grassroots organizations, and second and
            third tier organizations during the second year of implementation.

            PROLOCAL focused in the development and strengthening of productive
            chains, particularly of export products such as cocoa, corn, coffee, rice, beans,
            and watermelon, among others. Notwithstanding, the implementation period
            of the project was too short for these product chains to fully consolidate and
            generate financial gains to the participants. Also, working with the concept of
            agri-food chains implied a higher requirement of funds, and these were not
            available due to limitations of the Local Investment Fund (FIL).

            The intervention proposal of PROLOCAL was somewhat new, different and
            innovative, and it took some time until the technical teams of the project were
            able to internalize it and transfer it to the various local actors, particularly with
            respect to their facilitating function of a process that depended from their own
            demand.


    4. Sustainability of the Model


There is a series of factors dealing with the sustainability of the development model
started with PROLOCAL. The following are the most relevant:

        The political support of the municipal governments and the Consejo Nacional de
        Juntas Parroquiales (CONAJUPARE), that were involved in the implementation
        of the development proposals, was a clear sign that those local actors considered
        that the intervention model was efficient and effective to achieve a fair and
        equitable, as well as socially, economically and environmentally sustainable
        territorial development. Also that it allowed them to strengthen their organizations,
        in particular their administrative capacity and internal controls.

        The actions of PROLOCAL resulted in improving the administrative local
        capacities of the executing entities, which ensures that in the future they will be
        equipped to start their own their own social, economical and business processes.
        The evaluation mission confirmed this when it established that local actors were
        empowered, that there was a renewed trust in Government and international
        cooperation programs, more trust in local governments and in rural financial
        entities, a higher level of self-worth, higher levels of propositive and negotiating
        capacity, more openness towards the outside of the organization to search for
        alternatives and alliances, a stronger grass-roots demand from for account-
        rendering and control, and increased propensity for savings and productive re-
        investment.

        In some micro-regions, PROLOCAL favored the allocation of resources to those
        productive proposals where the economic infrastructure component demanded


                                               83

more resources, particularly in the case of irrigation systems, marketing
infrastructure (gathering centers, processing), equipment for agri-transformation,
among others. Without a doubt these community investments allowed the
productive processes initiated with project support to become sustainable with a
much lower risk that the one normally associated with rural economic activities.

Rescuing the knowledge and productive practices of rural families, together with
the innovations brought forward by PROLOCAL resulted in the adjustment of the
productive practices to the socioeconomic conditions of the participating families.
This combination ensured the use of lower cost and easily applicable productive
technologies for the improvement of yields and the income of poor families.

The productive largely successful activities financed with project resources
recovered their initial investment and as a result allowed for the widened
participation of other families from the participating organizations, for the
diversification of production to establish better conditions for the development of
the productive activity, and for investing in infrastructure to support production.
The evaluation mission of PROLOCAL stated, "There are sufficient indications to
positively grade the operational-financial sustainability of the subprojects
supported by PROLOCAL".

Almost the totality of economic activities supported by PROLOCAL have been
implemented with an environmental sustainability approach, that is, using
agricultural practices that do not destroy the natural resources (soil, water,
biodiversity).

The medium and long-term programs to strengthen the social fabric and human
capital allowed for the strengthening to continue over time, widening the number
of organizations and the base for human capital development, and thus for
constructing a more appropriate social fabric to implement local development
actions in benefit of the great majorities. Those interviewed by the evaluation
mission agreed, "Those who received training are applying the knowledge
acquired, have improved their practices, their organizations are using their
capabilities and consequently and thus they have been strengthened". Also, the
training has allowed "several qualitative changes in the administration of their
organizations and the implementation of productive projects".

During the implementation of PROLOCAL solid relationships were developed
amongst the various development actors, and strategic alliances to steer the efforts
towards social, economic and environmental sustainability were also developed.
Furthermore, these development entities have been able to insert themselves in
long-term processes.

The ample participation of women in the development planning processes, in the
implementation of productive initiatives, and in the strengthening processes, is




                                     84

        noteworthy. The above should allow for the consolidation of these groups of
        women and their continued support of those activities started by PROLOCAL.

        Lastly, as stated by the evaluation mission: "the route and development model put
        in practice by PROLOCAL and many projects of its type, are appropriate
        instruments to fight poverty and achieve more and better inclusion, and could be
        used successfully as strategy for a serious government policy for rural
        development with inclusion and poverty reduction".

    5. Financial Execution

The implementation plan of the project established and original budget of US $49.3
million, of which US $25.2 came from the World Bank loan, US $11.04 from a grant by
the European Commission, US $5.2 from the participating actors in the implementation
of the project, and US $8.6 million as the contribution of the Government of Ecuador.
With respect to these contributions it is noteworthy that the Government of Ecuador's
commitment was effectively reduced to US $2.7 million, and thus the real global budget
of PROLOCAL was US $43.4 million. By June 2007, PROLOCAL had invested US
$68.4 million, that is 31.5% more than anticipated, due to the higher contribution of the
participants (US $20.8 million instead of US $5.2 million) and to the difference of the
effective Euro and US dollar exchange rate that was assumed in the budget.

    6. Lessons Learned


The PROLOCAL experience leaves a series of lessons that could be organized in three
different stages: i) the formulation process; ii) the negotiation process, y iii) the project
execution.

Formulation of the Proposal

Although the implementation team of PROLOCAL did not participate in the first two
moments of the history of the project; their point of view with respect to the products it
received for the implementation of the project (e.g. the project document) can be put
forward. From this standpoint the following lessons are noteworthy:

i) The PAD is a guiding framework

Being PROLOCAL a demand driven project its formulation should not have had a high
degree of detailed specific actions, but general guidelines that would establish
intervention limits; for instance: strengthening administrative capacity; strengthening
local organizations; supporting individual capacity building; promoting agricultural and
non-agricultural activities; implementing small works in support of production;
strengthening the administrative capacity of local financial entities, among others. The
details do not become known precisely until during implementation when the technical
teams start gathering the local demands.




                                            85

ii) A development approach is required

The formulating team, together with the potential implementation participants must
discuss the development approach to be considered; for instance, is the project is going to
promote "unrestrictive economic growth" or will it try to promote "growth with equity"
or the "human development" approach or a combination of these?

iii) The results framework indicators

Starting from the development approach and adjusting the broad lines of action of the
agreed approach, it is easier to define global indicators to measure the performance of the
projects; indicators such as the number of families that adopt new productive activities or
improve their current ones, the number of organizations that join the strengthening
processes, etc. It is important to define indicators of products, effects of potential
impacts, as well as some indicators that allow measuring the advancement of the
processes.

iv) The appraisal

It is common to undertake ex-ante financial, economic and social evaluations with
budgets that are estimated due to the demand-driven nature of the project. It is important
however that in social projects other types of indicators are identified to anticipate the
success or risks of the project during implementation. For instance other indicators for
efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, employment generation, income generation, etc,
could be sought. Forecasted internal rates of return or net present values based on
assumed specific productive activities is barely a challenge to the creativity of the team.

v) The investment plan

In a project of this nature, as the reaction of the local actors during the implementation in
not known, to develop detailed investment plan is also inadequate. The plan should only
provide global allocations (by components) so that it becomes a guide of broad
allocations that, above all, reflect the adopted objectives; for example: 50% of global
budget for productive investments, 20% for environmental proposals, 20% for
organizational strengthening and 10% for operating costs. With this type of allocations
the implementing teams would know the amounts they can use and would know how to
distribute them over time.

vi) Complementary instruments

It would be valuable to prepare, together with the project document, other support
instruments, such as, in the case of PROLOCAL, the operation manual, the manual for
the local investment fund, the performance guides for the local actors, among others.

In any case, for projects of this nature, it could be established during formulation that
after six months of activities the implementing team should present a series of details that



                                              86

would approximate better to reality, as per the initial implementation experience; it would
be required, for instance, the results framework indicators, the investment plan, the
amounts of funds allocated to each component, an others that allow for the
implementation of a real monitoring and evaluation system closer to the realities of the
territories focused by the project.

The Negotiation of the Proposal

For the case of projects financed by credit, a series of conditions for effectiveness need to
be met before the signing of the credit agreements. By experience, these conditions
should also be required for project fully financed by national resources. It is important to
consider the following issues:

i) Selection of the implementing team

To guarantee the technical adequacy and ethics of the project implementation team, the
team selection process must be competitive and shall be entrusted to an entity external to
the one in charge of the implementation. The selection process is to be framed within the
terms of reference prepared during project formulation, and shall incorporate a
mechanism that guarantees the transparency of the exercise.

ii) The baseline

In the experience of PROLOCAL, an effectiveness condition was the establishment of a
baseline. This execution of this work was technically sound, but its usefulness has been
questioned. The problem is that, even when its technical quality is unquestionable, the
intervention areas of the project were not precisely determined; the selected sample never
guaranteed that the families participating in the survey were going to participate in the
subprojects and, for the purpose of a future impact evaluation, the results, can barely be
useful as witnesses to changes produced in comparison with the families that actually
participated in the implementation of the project. It would be a "with and without
project" comparison.

To this respect, it would be better to construct the base line during the first few months of
the implementation, when there is at least a preliminary identification of the territories
and the actors with whom the project will work. It is probable that, due to the urgency at
that point in time, the technical quality of the exercise would be sacrificed somewhat, but
its usefulness would be much more significant. "This is how they were before.... This is
how they are now".

The Implementation

For this phase the relevant lessons are the following:

i) Induction




                                              87

As the people involved in the formulation and those in charge of the implementation were
different, it is absolutely necessary to implement well-structured induction exercises at
different levels, or with different actors. The first exercise must be implemented with the
implementation team to clarify the conceptualization, the development approach, the
methodological issues, the established goals in terms of indicators, and the immediate
actions required, among others. Something similar must be implemented with the
representatives of the local actors. The objective is that the `rules of the game" are clear
from the beginning. This would facilitate future consensus building and the subscription
of agreements.

ii) Building local capacities

It is clear that the implementation of initiatives by the local actors will be successful only
if their capacities are built-up in a parallel manner. This brings up the need to better
direct the organizational strengthening plans. Strengthening could mean to analyze and, if
it was the case, reconfigure the structure and functionality of the organizations, to
incorporate schemes that differentiate management from administration, to train
promoters and "campesinos técnicos", to train entrepreneurial leaders, among other actors.

In any case, it is not about denying the aspirations of the local actors and their
organizations.     The project should support the participatory formulation of their
institutional strengthening plans, that would consider issues such as those previously
mentioned, and others such as, the strengthening of the local social fabric, the generation
of resources of their own, the rescue of their cultural identity, etc.

iii) Facilitation

In an intervention approach such as that of PROLOCAL, the technical team does not
implement but facilitates, but this requires understanding the following:

         Facilitation as a process
         Facilitation as intermediation
         Facilitation as negotiation
         Facilitation as induction
         Facilitation as organization
         Facilitation as orientation
         Facilitation as evaluation
         Facilitation as training
         Facilitation as human capital development
         Facilitation as team work
         Facilitation as research
         Facilitation as collective learning
         Facilitation as example
         Facilitation as sharing

iv) Building capacity in local governments



                                              88

From experience, in order to build curricular plans for training processes for development,
particularly with the Juntas Parroquiales, it is necessary to call upon the Law. This is the
instrument that by defining the obligations, responsibilities, and rights of those who are
part of the local governments leads us to the question of how well prepared are the local
actors to perform the mandate of their Law. For example, if the Law assigns them the
responsibility to steer local development planning processes (PDL), it is necessary that
those who guide the local governments at least know what a PDL is and how it is
formulated in a participatory manner.

v) Valuing non-formal training

If process management is being incorporated, the local leaders are facing a situation of
"learning by doing"; however, the skills they develop are not usually valued as true
learning. In the case of PROLOCAL they have learned, for instance, to manage funds
within the framework of formal regulations, to manage bank accounts, to direct
competitive bidding processes for the selection of service providers or the procurement of
goods, to regularize their relations with the Internal Revenue Service, among others. In
the case of the families that adopt new productive practices or improve the ones they had,
probably, the new technologies improve their linkages with markets locally and
nationally, and may be in some cases even international markets. This type of learning is
precisely the product of the "facilitation" efforts.

vi) Co-financing amounts as guidelines

While it is necessary to establish a ceiling or indicators of amounts to be financed by the
project and by the local actors as their counterpart, it is necessary to establish exceptions.
Of course, exceptions have to be managed with utmost rigor to avoid that they become
the general rule. There are cases of families in extreme poverty that cannot contribute
with cash, for instance, to cover 40% of the cost of a capital good (a policy of the FIL)
and that run the risk of staying out of the processes. In such cases, with a valid
justification this percentage could be negotiated and other forms of retribution could be
established, such as contribution of community labor and local building materials to fix
the town's school. The important issue is to promote a sense of responsibility for the
good management of the project resources.

A similar case is when, for example, the project allocates reference investment amounts
per family (US $800) and turns out that the subproject is so complex that the reference
amount is insufficient. The important thing is to incorporate mechanisms that guarantee,
as previously stated, that the exceptions don't become the general rule.

vii) The understanding and respect of the "campesino" logic

Even as facilitators, the members of the technical teams have the tendency to induce
solutions, sometimes foreign to the reality of the area of intervention. From this
perspective it is important to motivate the creativity of the peasants and facilitate the



                                              89

expression of their knowledge, skills and proven practices. One must not forget, however,
to undertake joint feasibility analysis of the proposals and of the new practices. It must
also not be forgotten that they are those who "demand" and "propose" their solutions.

viii) The need to incorporate transversal strategies

Possibly this is a formulation issue, however, during implementation, heterogeneous
territorial dynamics could force the incorporation of strategies that cut across the whole
proposal, such as:

        A clear communication/information strategy.
        A strategy to promote the establishments of alliances between the local actors and
        other institutional or business partners.
        A strategy to support the recovery of traditional technologies and the development
        of new ones.
        A strategy to facilitate the implementation of a value chain approach.

ix) The consideration of higher vulnerability groups

Experience shows that groups of people who are physically challenged generally have
remained outside the influence of development projects. This is an important population
sector which has all the rights to be served. Solutions coming from them have proved that
their participation is feasible, even in productive matters.

This could also be said about young people. They need opportunities to begin to act as
actors capable of undertake productive activities, cultural, etc.

Special attention should also be given to women head of households.

x) Understanding the roles of the various actors

It is not uncommon to find conflict between, for example, political organizations and
civil organizations. The origin of these is the poor definition of roles; much of which are
legislated and other can be concerted. This requires better management of conflict
resolution guidelines.

A stronger dissemination effort is required for the intervention approach in which the
most important actors, the implementing entities, are peasant organizations and local
governments, and they are, not the project, the ones that steer their processes. It is a
matter of changing attitudes towards local development.


    7. Performance of the World Bank and the European Commission


During the four and half years of implementation of PROLOCAL, the World Bank and
the European Commission undertook 13 Joint Evaluation Missions. All of these could be
considered satisfactory as they contributed towards the good management of the project


                                              90

and consequently to the achievement of its objectives. In each mission it was possible to
reach a consensus with the Managerial Technical and Administrative/Financial team of
PROLOCAL in issues such as management, operational and support strategies.

Annex 9. Comments of Borrower, Cofinanciers and Other Partners on ICR

Comments of Borrower

The Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (formerly the Ministry of Social Welfare)
fully endorsed the ICR in the enclosed letter, dated 21/02/2008. The letter highlights the
project's achievements in terms of increased household incomes and rural employment;
facilitated alliances between local level institutions and local governments; beneficiary
communities contributions to local investments; support to local development processes
their institutionalization; and human and social capital formation to enable local
organizations to mobilize new financial resources with a wider range of partners for their
own development. The role of project supervision is stressed by the Ministry in terms of
facilitating continuous learning and adaptation which became the means to strengthen the
project's policies and procedures from the earliest stages of implementation.

Comments of the European Commission (Cofinancier)

The EC provided the enclosed letter, dated 20/02/2008, with helpful comments on the
draft ICR which have been addressed in the final version of the document.
