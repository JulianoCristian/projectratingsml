The\n            main components will: 1) promote social capital formation,\n            by supporting planning for local development, at the\n            community, parochial, and canton levels, as part of a\n            participatory development planning process. Rural\n            communities will identify priority subprojects, and,\n            community representatives will participate in the planning\n            process at the parochial level; likewise, cantons will\n            prepare their development plans, to include linkages to\n            parochial subprojects; 2) train local stakeholders through\n            organized nongovernmental organizations, who will survey\n            technical skills, and prepare a capacity gap analysis, and\n            implement training programs. Formation of local networks of\n            technicians will be promoted, to in turn expand their\n            technical skills, while technical assistance will build\n            local governments' management, and administrative\n            capacities; 3) establish a demand-driven grant fund, to\n            finance infrastructure, productive capacity of\n            socio-territorial organizations, and environmental\n            investment subprojects. Technical screening of this work\n            will be undertaken by technical personnel at the regional\n            level; and, 4) finance consulting services, and equipment to\n            implement the managerial, financial, and technical\n            coordination, through the Project Coordination Unit."}, "docdt": "2001-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
