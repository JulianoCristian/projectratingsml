Program Project is a\n            stand alone operation to finance, together with funds from\n            the IMF and certain bilateral sources, the debt buyback\n            portion of the Government's 1989-90 commercial bank\n            financing and debt reduction package. The package provides\n            an exit vehicle for low exposure commercial banks at a\n            sizeable discount, while encouraging new flows from those\n            banks with a long-term interest in the Philippines. The\n            financial package is an integral part of the\n            Government's medium-term program, which focusses on\n            strengthened macroeconomic performance, the adequacy and\n            efficiency of investment, and improved maintenance of public\n            assets. Conditionality is designed to help achieve these\n            objectives and is a product of a clear Bank strategy and\n            reflective of close coordination with the IMF."}, "docdt": "1989-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
