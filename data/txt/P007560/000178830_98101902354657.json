employment in rural areas. It will\n            provide medium- and long-term credit for investment in crop\n            development, livestock production, fisheries and\n            agroindustries. It will include a low-income producer's\n            component, comprising approximately one-half of the total\n            investment program. A program of applied research, training\n            and monitoring will provide support to credit operations.\n            The project will also strengthen FIRA's programming and\n            planning operations. About 140,000 families will benefit\n            from the project. The project has no special risks."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
