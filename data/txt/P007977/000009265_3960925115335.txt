PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
mu
LIMA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2132-PE)
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Lima Wator Supply
and Sewerage Project (Loan 2139-PE). This loan, made to the Servicio de Agua
Potable y Alcantarillado do Lima (SEDAPAL), with the guarantee of the Republic
of Peru, was signed on June 4, 1982. Original cl*sing date was June 30, 1988.
The original loan amount was US$40.6 million, later reduced, along with the
project scope, to US$27.0 million at the roquest of both the Government and
SEDAPAL. On November 6, 1986, the Bank suspended loan disbursement. The loan
was closed effective June 27, 1989, after tho borrower submitted documentation
supporting expenditures through the loan Special Account. The last
disbursement was on December 11, 1986. Total loan disbursements amounted to
US$S.2.4 million. The remaining US$14.6 was canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of the Latin America
and the Caribbean Region, Country Department I (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III) and is based inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda. Part II of the report was
prepared by SEDAPAL after it had an opportunity to review the Parts I and III
prepared by the Bank.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PERU
LIMA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2139-PE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
I&JOStivs-
1.        The overall project objective was to improve health and living
conditions in the Lima Metropolitan area. Specific project objectives were to
improve: (a) water and sewerage services, particularly to low-income families
in highly populated areas; (b) the management of ground and surface water
resources; and (c) the project executing agency's (SEDAPAL) managerial,
technical, and financial capabilities (para. 6).
IumlImentation ExIerience
2.         The project implementation process was marred from the beginning by
problems that led to reduction in the project scope and the loan amount and,
subsequently, to the suspension of disbursements and loan closing without
completing the project (para. 13).
3.         The principal determinant of this unsatisfactory performance was
the lack of Government commitment to institutional reform. This issue was
compounded by adverse macroeconomic conditions during project implementation.
Inflation, in particular, was beyond the Government and the Bank's
expectations (it accelerated from 731 in 1982 to 158Z in 1985), making it more
difficult for the Government to implement required tariff increases in a
timely fashion. Because of the inadequate pricing policy, the pressure over
SEDAPAL's scarce financial resources mounted, resulting in revenues
insufficient to cover operating costs and to contribute to capital
expenditures. SEDAPAL's poor performance was exacerbated by the pricing
policies put in place by the new Government in 1985. Disbursements for this
Loan were suspended in November 1986 because of non-compliance with Loan
covenants. The overall policies of this Government eventually resulted in
arrears to the Bank which led to suspension of disbursements for all the Bank
loans to Peru in 1987 (paras. 14 and 22).
4.         The inadequate capacity of the Government to direct and control
SRDAPAL's operations was another negative factor in project execution. The
entity was overburdened by regulations and restrictions that did not allow It
to operate effectively and efficiently. Procurement procedures, tariff rates.
budgets, personnel policies, and salary structures were tightly regulated by
several agencies, including its parent company (SERAPA), reducing in practice
the accountability of managers at all levels. This situation was aggravated by
the inability of SENAPA and SEDAPAL's managements not only to carry out a
constructive dialogue with Government authorities but also to withstand
pressures to concentrate on actions leading to immediate political gains as
opposed to a long-term perspective in policy design (para. 15).



- ii: -
ieaulte
5.         The project failed in achieving its objectives. There was little
progress in improving the coverage and quality of services, and there was no
progress in strengthening SEDAPAL's techniical and managerial capabilities.
Water and sewerage service coverage by 1989 was estimated at 781 versus a
targeted 90%. The quality of the services continued to deteriorate as water
was not being provided on a continuous basis and rationing was on the
increase. Water wastage continued as a result of SEDAPAL's inability to
account for the water produced, and of the lack of price signals to encourage
consumers to conserve water (tariffs were kept extremely low and water use was
increasingly charged on a flat-rate basis). Bill collection was still highly
unsatisfactory. Maintenance of existing assets continued at levels well below
those needed to avert their rapid deterioration (para. 17). These problems
were exacerbated by the populist approach of President Alan Garcia, which did
not encourage the financial discipline to transform SEDAPAL into a business-
like institution.
Sustainability
6.         The sustainability of the project's economic benefits is unlikely
as the project investments were not fully carried out, nor were the managerial
and operational reforms required for an efficient operation of the system
(para. 18).
Lessons Learned
7.         One lesson of this project is that the Bank should take fully into
consideration previous experiences with the proposed borrower or executing
agency. The experience under the first project (Loan S-11-PE), which aimed at
preparing SEDAPAL to undertake major investments, had not been satisfactory
and, thus, the decision to go ahead with the second project involved
substantial risks. In similar cases the Bank should request further evidence
of both the Government and the project entity's commitment to implement
reforms, before going ahead with a new project (para. 23).
8.         A second lesson is that the Bank should increase its awareness of
the complexities of institutional reform, and the need to have precise
objectives and a clear strategy to meet them. The objectives of Loan 2139-PE
were laudable, but when added together were too ambitious, without clear
priorities, and not complemented by concrete action programs. The financial,
operational and administrative measures required to improve SEDAPAL's
performance in accordance with the agreed monitoring indicators were not
clearly identified (para. 24).
9.         A third lesson is that the Bank should be more rigorous in
enforcing compliance with loan covenants when the borrowers or project
executing agencies consistently fail to satisfactorily execute the project.
Delays in applying remedies result in an inefficient use of the borrower's and
Bank's financial and human resources (para. 25).

'R.        Project Background
1.        The Project was the second step of a process initiated by the
Government in 1978, with Bank support, to improve the coverage and quality of
water and sewerage services in Metropolitan Lima. The first Bank-financed
project in the sector, the Water Supply and Power Engineering Project (Loan S-
11-PE), assisted SEDAPAL' in the assessment of Lima's water resources, the
preparation of a master plan for further system development, and the
improvement of the entity's managerial and operational abilities. The second
Bank-financed project in the sector (Loan 2139-PE), which is the subject of
this report, aimed at satisfying short- to medium-term water supply and
sewerage needs of Lima's population, with emphasis on low-income groups. It
also aimed at continuing to improve SEDAPAL's managerial and technical
capabilities.
2.         The Lima Metropolitan area (Lima) includes the cities of Lima and
El Callao, and a number of smaller communities within the jurisdiction of Lima
and El Callao provinces. Its population was 4.6 million as of June 30 1981,
and was expected to increase to about 9.1 million by the year 2000. The area
contained about 26% of the country's population, and generated about 60% of
GDP and 70Z of the country's industrial output.
3.         Population. Service Levels and Quality.  In 1981, only half of
Peru's population had access to potable water and only 40% were connected to
sewerage systems. Coverage in Lima was about 62Z for water supply and 56% for
sewerage. About 40% of the residents of Lima belonged to low-income families,
earning less than two minimum-wage salaries per family. The majority of the
low-income population lived in high-density development located on the
outskirts of the central urbanized areas and under extremely poor sanitary
conditions. Conditions in rural areas were much worse: less than 20% of the
population had access to potable water, and even less to sanitation services
through a house discharge or latrine.
v Ex-Lima Water and Sewerage Company (ESAL), reorganized and renamed in
1981. The PCR for Loan S-11-PE was issued on September 7, 1990.



-2-
4.         Sector Development Obiectives.  The main Government objective in
the sector was to expand service coverage in urban and rural areas. Its
strategy aimed at resolving the most urgent water supply and sewerage
deficiencies, while strengthening the institutional, financial, and managerial
capabilities of implementing agencies. To this effect, in September 1981, the
Government reorganized the water supply and sewerage sector. A new
institution, the National Water Supply and Sewerage Service (SENAPA), was
created and entrusted with the following responsibilities: (a) sector
planning; (b) formulation of financial and tariff policies; and (c) sector
coordination and technical assistance. Water companies in the largest cities,
including Lima, became subsidiaries of SENAPA.
5.         Linkages Between Proiect. Sector. and Macro Policy Objectives.  The
project concept fit into the Government's strategy of strengthening public
sector institutions and improving environmental, social, and health conditions
of the lower-income segments of the population. It was also consistent with
the Bank's strategy of helping the Government in this endeavor as well as in
developing a sound physical and social infrastructure, with emphasis on
izLsXitutior. building and provision of services to the urban poor.
C.         Proiect Obiectives and Description
6.         Proiect Obiectives.  The overall objective of the project was to
improve health and living conditions in Lima. Specific project objectives
were to improve: (a) water and sewerage services to low-income families in
highly populated areas, as well as to families in several areas of Lima, under
the framework of the existing master plan; (b) the managemant of Lima's ground
and surface water resources; and (c) the project executing agency's (SEDAPAL)
managerial, technical, and financial capabilities.
7.         According to appraisal estimates, the overall service coverage
level in Lima would increase from 622 for water and 56% for sewerage in 1981.
to 86% and 79X, respectively, by project completion in 1986. Coverage would
continue to increase beyond the completion date of the project to reach a
targeted coverage of 902 and 85% in water supply and sewerage, respectively,
by 199O.i
8.         Prolect Description.  The project had an estimated cost of US$92.8
million and included four major components:
(a)    Water Supply and Sewerage Works.  The largest component of
the project (46.72 of total cost) comprising: (i) water
supply works, including distribution networks, storage
capacity, house connections, water mains, and a pumping
station; and (ii) sewerage works, including collectors and
house connections.
(b)    Groundwater Development.  (24.02 of total cost) comprisings
(a) drilling and equipping wells; (b) repairing existing
t Thirty-seven of total water supply beneficiaries, and 40 percent of
sewerage beneficiaries were estimated to belong to the absolute
poverty group.



wolls; and (c) building infiltration galleries along the
Rimac River. and rehabilitating existing galleries.
(c)    Operation of the Distribution System and Reduction of Water
Losses. (20.5% of total costs) comprising: (i) provision
and installation of master meters in existing wells and in
water mains; (ii) acquisition, installation, and
rehabilitation of micrometers, and improvement of SEDAPAL's
meter repair shop; and (iii) provision of water quality
control laboratory equipment and purchase of vehicles.
(d)    Technical Assistance.  (8.8% of project costs) comprising:
(i) s. users' survey of water and sewerage connections; and
(ii) the improvement of the management and control of water
resources including groundwater recharge, and deep wells.
D.         Proiect DesiL#n and Organization
9.         ESAL (reorganized and renamed SEDAPAL in late 1981) prepared the
project with major inputs from consultants under Loan S-11-PE over a period of
eight months (between January and September 1981).
10.        The Banlk considered SEDAPAL as an institution strong enough to be
responsible for project implementation, although institutional development was
considered among the important aspects of the project. The most serious
institutional difficulties identified at appraisal were: (a) inability to
recruit and retain qualified managers and technical personnel as a consequence
of inadequate salary levels; (b) overstaffing (unskilled and semi-skilled job
categories); (c) deficiencies in technical and commercial operations which
resulted in about half of the water produced not being accounted for; and (d)
inadequacy of water tariffs to generate the financial resources necessary to
maintain the system and undertake the most urgent investments.
11.        The Bank considered, however, that SEDAPAL had made substantial
progress in overcoming the above difficulties, particularly in strengthening
its organization through the recruitment of qualified personnel (including a
new general manager), and the completion of a water and sewerage master plan
for the Lima Metropolitan area. Still, the most critical issue remained the
low level of tariffs and the slow pace of the Government to take action on
required increases. This weakness continued during the implementation -f the
project and was a major reason for SEDAPAL's poor performance in project
execution (paras. 13 tc 17).
12.        The design of the loan was based on the notion that the Government
was strongly committed to implement all the changes necessary for a successful
completion of the project, and that Loan 2139-PE would sustain progress
already made through Loan S-11-PE. The Bank was aware, however, that failure
of Government authorities to support periodic tariff adjustments would
jeopardize SEDAPAL's financial viability, and consequently hamper compliance
with the project's objectives. At the time the Bank view was that close
supervision and monitoring would substantially reduce the project's risks. As
shown later, the Bank overestimated the extent to which its project
supervision efforts could influence the Government's decisions aimed at
improving SEDAPAL's performance. In other words, project design was based on



-.  4    
unrealistic expectations in terms of both the borrower's commitment and Bank's
ability to promote the implementation of sound financial and managerial
practices.
E.         Project Implementation
13.        The project implementation process was marred from the beginning by
persistent problems that led to a reduction in the project scope and the loan
amount and subsequently to the suspension of disbursements on November 6, 1986
due to lack of compliance with Loan covenants. 3 By then, only 46% (Us$12.4
million) of the reduced loan amount (US$27.0 million) had been disbursed. The
loan was closed effective June 27, 1989.
14.        The principal determinant of this unsatisfactory performance was
the lack of Government commitment to implement institutional reform. This
issue was compounded by adverse macroeconomic conditions during project
implementation. Inflation, in particular, was beyond the Government's and the
Bank's expectations (it accelerated from 73% in 1982 to 158% in 1985), making
it more difficult for the Government to implement required tariff increases in
a timely way. Because of the inadequate pricing policy, the pressure on
SEDAPAL's scarce financial resources mounted, resulting in revenues
insufficient to cover operating costs or to contribute to capital
expenditures.
15.        The inadequate capacity of the Government to direct and control
SEDAPAL's operations was another negative factor in project execution. The
entity was overburdened with regulations and restrictions which did not allow
it to operate effectively and efficiently. Procurement procedures, tariff
rates, budgets, personnel policies and salary structures were tightly
regulated by several agencies, including its parent company (SENAPA), reducing
In practice the accountability of managers at all levels. This situation was
aggravated by the inability of SENAPA and SEDAPAL's managements not only to
carry out a constructive dialogue with Government authorities but also to
withstand pressures to concentrate in actions leading to immediate political
gains as opposed to a long-term perspective in policy design.
16.        The project also experienced other difficulties, similar to the
ones confronted by its predecessor (Loan S-11-PE), namely: (a) inadequate
technical management of the project due to lack of qualified personnel; (b)
frequent changes in SEDAPAL's Board of Directors; (c) protracted procurement
procedures; e and (d) delays in the production of final designs.
> Suspension of disbursements was never lifted, since the Minister of
Economy and Finance did not authorize the Plan of Action for SEDAPAL's
financial recovery and for accelerating project execution, which SEDAPAL had
prepared. Furthermore, due to arrears in debt service, a general suspension of
disbursements for all Bank loans to Peru has been in effect since May 5, 1987.
' This was caused mainly by the existence of numerous bureaucratic
regulations. The Bank, by correspondence and during supervision missions,
advised SEDAPAL on procurement matters, but improvement only became apparent
toward the end of 1986. By that time, loan disbursements had been suspended
and later the undisbursed balance of the Loan was cancelled.



F.         Prolect Results
17,        The project failed to achiov21l  nbjeur:ivon.  There was little
progress in improving the coverage &iid oiiKIi-i, oi soIco, and there was no
progress in strengthening SEDAPAL's teoht,.Icul axid iauna,g.al  capabilities.
Water service coverage by 1989 was estimated at /8% verutio a targeted 90%.
The quality of the services continued to deteriorate as water is currently not
being provided on a continuous basis and rationing is on the increase. Water
waste continues as a result of SEDAPAL's inability to account for the water
produced, and due to the lack of price signals to encourage consumers to
conserve water (water use is increasingJy charged on a flat--rate basis). Bill
collection is still highly unsatisfactory.  Maintenance of existing assets has
been reduced to levels well below those needed to avert their rapid
deterioration--from 1987 to 1989 only 3 km/year of water pipes were replaced
in a system with over 6,200 kms of pipe, most of which has been poorly
maintained over many years.
G.         Project Sustainability
18.        The sustainability of project econuoic benefits is unlikely as the
project investments were not fully carried out nor were the managerial and
operational reforms that were required for an efficient operatior. of the
system.
H.         Bank Performance
19.        Bank performance was mixed, vwith the positive aspects of the
performance offset by the negative. The positive aspects include the
following. First, an extensive dialogue with the Government and sector
authorities took place about SEDAPAL weaknesses and, most importantly, about
specific policies and actions to improve the entity's performance. These
policies and actions were reflected in several action plans agreed with the
authorities. And second, an intensive supervision effort occurred, with the
Bank undertaking 13 supervision missions during the loan disbursement period
(1982 to 1986).
20.        The negative aspects of the Bank's performance were significant
both during project preparation and appraisal and during project
implementation. First, the Bank was overoptimistic in its assessment of the
ability of the Government and SEDAPAL's management to implement the
institutional and financial reforms required for successful project execution
(para 12). Most importantly, the Bank did not take fully into consideration
SEDAPAL's unsatisfactory performance under Loan S-11-PE; even though, the
project financed with this loan was substantially smaller and less complex
than the second project (total project cost was US$6.1 million for the project
under Loan S-Il-PE, and US$92.8 million for the project under Loan 2139-PE).
Second, the Bank excessively delayed the application of remedies in response
to the Government and SEDAPAL's lack of response to its timely and repeated
recommendations to improve project implementation (para 19). Suspension of
loan disbursements and loan cancellat.on were frequently considered between
1984 and most of 1986, but were always rejected following appeals by SEDAPAL
for flexibility and understanding. It was not until the end of 1986 that the
Bank decided to suspend disbursements. Third, the Bank readiness to agree with
the Government request for a major reduction in project scope and in loan



amotnt (from US$40.6 to US$27.0 million) did not provide an adequate incentive
to the Government and SEDAPAL to implement long overdue reforms.
X.         Borrower Performance
21.        Several key issues affecting the overall public enterprise sector
in Peru we-re among the main determinants of SEDAPAL poor performance in
project execution. First, there were conflicting objectives, particularly in
setting tariffs and in enforcing bill collection. Second, most important
budgetary, personnel, salary, investment, procurement, and some operational
decisions were made largely ignoring efficiency considerations. Third, a
system of control of SEDAPAL's operations by the Government's leading
management was oriented more towards fulfilling bureaucratic regulations
(including procurement procedures) than efficient performance.
22.        SEDAPAL's poor performance was worsened by .he policies put in
place by the new Government in 1985, by which it limited the tariff increases
and did not supply adequate funds for maintenance, investment activities and
debt service. These problems were exacerbated by the populist approach of the
Government of President Alan Garcia, which did not encourage the financial
discipline to become SEDAPAL into a business-like institution. The overall
policies of the Government led to arrears to the Bank, which subsequently led
to suspension of disbursements for all loans to Peru in 1987.
J.         Lessons Learned
23.        One lesson is that the Bank should take fully into consideration
previous experiences with the proposed borrower or executing agency. The
experience with the first project (Loan S-11-PE), which aimed at preparing
SEDAPAL to undertake major investments, had not been satisfactory enough;
thus, the decision to go ahead with the 3econd project involved substantial
and inherent risks. In similar cases the Bank should request further evidence
of the Government's and the project entity's commitment to implement reform
before going ahead with a new project.
24.        A second lesson is that the Bank should increase its awareness of
the complexities of institutional innovation and change, and of the need to
have precise objectives and a clear strategy to meet them. The objectives of
Loan 2139-PE were laudable, but when added together were too ambitious,
without clear priorities, and were not complemented by concrete action
programs. The financial, operational and administrative measures required to
improve SEDAPAL's performance in accordance with the agreed monitoring
indicators were not clearly identified.
25.        A third lesson is that the Bank should be more rigorous in
enforcing compliance with loan covenants when the borrowers or project
executing agencies fail to satisfactorily execute the project. Delays in
applying remedies result in an inefficient use of the borrower and Bank's
financial and human resources.

and supervision reports provided the basic information for the preparation of
Part I and Part III of the PCR. The documents provided detailed information
that made possible a critical evaluation of the constraints affecting project
implementation, however gaps exist with respect to actual monitoring
indicators because the information was not available. Also, information
regarding actual completion of some project components was not available in
the project files nor was this information furnished by SEDAPAL.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PERU
LIMA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (LOAN 2139-PE)
PART II. BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE ON PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION L
During project execution, SEDAPAL maintained the Bank informed on
the various difficulties experienced in implementing each of the subprojects
financed by the Loan --many of which are described in Part I of the Report--
but it is worth highlighting them since the Bank ascribes the poor results to
SEDAPAL staff performance, while on the contrary it was almost impossible to
achieve better project development under the prevailing conditions.
1.         Lack of transparency in current legislation with respect to
preference for Bank regulations concerning acquisitions and
contracting of consultants, vis-a-vis local legal dispositions in
effect during that period, such as those aimed at protection of
domestic industry or to domestic consultancy business.
In actual practice, this was the main cause of the grossly delayed
process of competitive bidding for the acquisition of meters, whose
installation should have generated the financial viability of the
Project. It also entailed dealing with heavy red tape in obtaining
tax-exemption status to all procurement of imported goods or
equipment.
2.         Restrictions on investment authorizations with excessive
bureaucratic obstacles. Delays in approval of each annual budget
by CONADE and for the amendments or expansions of the same by the
Company.
3.         Non-compliance on the part of SENAPA and the Government with their
commitments as established in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
with respect to authorizing the necessary rate increases to finance
investments and to cover operational and maintenance costs as well
as long-term debt service.
The limited own resources and income reduction in real terms due to
the policy of non-authorization of rate increases, resulted in lack
of resources required to finance the counterpart amounts of the
projects. The latter, in turn, made it impossible to start many
subprojects. although the real cause was often disguised as delays
in the decision-making process, which should not be understood as
the responsibility of SEDAPAL's executives but rather of the
Presidents of SENAPA and SEDAPAL, which obviously are positions
filled with political appointees working closely with the
Government.
To partially supplement the lack of counterpart funds to execute
civil works, especially for water and sewerage networks in popular
neighborhoods, SEDAPAL sought and obtained financing from the Banco
de la Vivienda to carry out such works. As foreseen, the cost of
a This part is an unofficial translation of the comments received from
SEDAPAL, after it had an opportunity to review the Parts I and III prepared by
the Bank.

these credits was passed on to the beneficiaries. Without these
credits, project execution would have been drastically reduced.
4.         Legal dispositions on the creation of SEDAPAL explicitly
established its autonomy. Unfortunately, in practical terms it has
been affected by excessive interference from the Government,
through the application of austerity measures --issued at the level
of the Central Government-- restrictions on expenditures,
investments, and indebtedness.
5.         On November 6, 1986, the World Bank sent a letter to the President
of SEDAPAL on which it expressed its concern that the Company was
not generating enough profits to cover operational and maintenance
costs nor the required funds for new investments; it further
indicated that if an Action Plan was not adopted that included the
necessary rates, along with other measures, the Bank would proceed
to suspend loan disbursements effective that date. The Action Plan
had already been prepared and approved by our Board of Directors
and the Housing Ministry; however, the World Bank requested
approval from the Ministry of Economy and Treasury, thus obtaining
the Government's commitment to increase rates. This approva. never
took place.
6.         Consequently, on May 5, 1987, the World Bank sent a telex to the
Ministry of Economy in which it informed that since Peru was in
arrears with the payments on the amounts due on loans granted by
it, it was suspending further disbursements on all the loans
granted by the Bank to the Republic of Peru.
7.         The World Bank's actions provoked the following inconveniences:
*      Delays in the disbursement process to suppliers or
Consultants, which was later solved through the
implementation of the Revolving Fund.
3      Delays in the review of bidding documents or competitive
biddings.
*      Lack of understanding of local conditions and lack of
flexibility in the application of contracting rules, when,
for instance, because of political or social reasons it may
be convenient to favor, for a given contract, the local work
force.
*      High financial cost of the loan, maintaining its interest
rate even when international rates for any new loan had been
reduced. This situation generated doubts and dissenting
opinions on the continuation of project execution, which
thus resulted in poor project execution.

Comments: Issues raised at different stages:
1.    In mid-1980, the Government first expressed its interest in Bank involvement and the Bank attached high
priority to the Project. In January 1981, the Bank organized an identification mission.
2.    A preparation mission followed in March 1981. At this stage, some main issues identified were: (a) weak
management of SEDAPAL; (b) inadequacy of tariff levels; and (e) poor bill collection system.
3.    Project preparation was carried out by two missions (March and April 1981).  This allowed the Bank and
the Borrower to agree on: (a) the final definition and scope of the project; (b) a comprehensive tariff
study and timetable for implementation; (c) completion and approval of bylaws of SEDAPAL; and (d)
retroactive financing for expenditures incurred up to US$0.5 million.
4.    In June 1986 the scope of the project was reduced together with a reduction in loan amount by US$13.6
million.
