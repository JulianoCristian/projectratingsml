for water supply and\n            from 67 percent to 79 percent for sewerage; and to\n            strengthen SEDAPAL, the Lima Water and Sewerage Service. The\n            project is based on a water and sewerage master plan and\n            includes the following major components: (a) extension of\n            water supply and sewerage systems to low income areas; (b)\n            development and improvement of groundwater resources; (c)\n            improvement of the operation of the water distribution\n            system and reduction of unaccounted-for water; and (d)\n            provision of technical assistance for a survey of water and\n            sewerage connections and for better water resource management."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
