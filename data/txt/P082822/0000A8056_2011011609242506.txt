                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing very well towards the development results by providing access to medium term finance to 671 firms so far under the original loan and the additional finance
                         loans. The loans have been used for both working capital and investment purposes, either through expanding their capacity by buying new equipment or civil engineering upgrades/
                         rehabilitation. The loans are well dispersed both sectorally and geographically. Most of the SMEs that have utilized the funds from the project came from textile industry, tourism,
                         energy and rubber and plastic production. The geographical coverage extends to most parts of Turkey with an emphasis on underserved areas such as the North, East, South East
                         and the Central part.
