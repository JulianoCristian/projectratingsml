                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing very well towards achieving the development results by providing access to medium term finance to 709 SMEs so far under the original loan and the two
                         additional finance loans. In total, US$ 631.1 million equivalent has been approved to SMEs for both working capital and investment purposes. SMEs supported through the Project
                         managed to increase their employment by as much as 9,328 people, as new funds helped them run smoothly their operations without significant difficulties and strengthen their long-
                         term business opportunities. The loans are well dispersed both sectorally and geographically. Overall, almost 20 percent of the disbursement went to underserved areas such as the
                         North, East, South East and the Central part. Most of the SMEs that have utilized the funds from the project came from textile industry, tourism, energy, rubber and plastic production.
