Medium\n            Enterprises Project, which is being successfully\n            implemented. The additional financing will scale-up the\n            project's impact and development effectiveness and\n            continue to support the project's development\n            objectives to increase Turkish small and medium enterprises\n            (SME) access to medium-term finance'. It will scale-up\n            the achievements of the original project not only during the\n            implementation period (2008-2012), but also beyond that\n            period as the Borrower will use the reflows repaid from the\n            initial sub-borrowers to finance new investments before the\n            funds are returned to the World Bank. In addition, given the\n            reduced financing available as a result of the current\n            crisis, the additional financing will ensure continued\n            access to finance for SMEs."}, "docdt": "2008-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
