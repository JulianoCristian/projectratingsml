                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed RFIII would be to increase economic benefits to rural private enterprises and households by increasing their access to
                         finance. The expected outcomes would include: (i) improved access to financial services for rural entrepreneurs; (ii) increased capital investment made by the rural
                         entrepreneurs as well as increased employment; (iii) increased lending, particularly term lending to the rural private sector for capital investment by all participating
                         financial institutions (PFIs) on market-based terms.
