                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed RFIII would be to increase economic benefits to rural private enterprises and households by increasing their access to
                         finance. The expected outcomes would include: (i) improved access to financial services for rural entrepreneurs; (ii) increased capital investment made by the rural
                         entrepreneurs as well as increased employment; (iii) increased lending, particularly term lending to the rural private sector for capital investment by all participating
                         financial institutions (PFIs) on market-based terms.

                         The project is progressing well with regard to achieving the development objectives. All PDO indicator targets for December 2012have already been exceeded. In terms of increased
                         access to finance, about 75,000 sub-borrowers benefited from receiving financial assistance for their sub-projects, of which nearly 30,000 were first-time borrowers, and about 17,000
                         were women. The two mainlines of credit for medium-long term lending and short-term lending financed 75,000 sub-projects with a cost of USD301 million. The project contributed

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (a) Possible Reallocation. The Micro-finance Loan Fund of US$10 million is already fully disbursed, and the Rural Development Fund of US$175 million will most likely be fully
                         disbursed by June 30, 2013. The Technical Assistance component is expected to have a surplus of about US$3 million. It was agreed that the project management unit would
                         assess the performance of this component in December this year to determine the need for a reallocation to either one or both the funds.

                         (b) Time required for Technical Assistance Component. Six of the nine key consultancy packages are already under implementation and have provided useful interim
                         recommendations to the recipient agencies. These assignments are expected to be completed in early 2013. Three packages, two relating to VBARD and one relating to cash-flow
                         based lending, will require until the project closing date of December 31, 2013 to be concluded. Therefore, while it is expected that the two project lines of credit will be fully
                         disbursed by June 30, 2013, it was agreed that the project will continue until the closing date, specifically to realize the objectives of the technical assistance component.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
