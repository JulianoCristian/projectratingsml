                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed RFIII would be to increase economic benefits to rural private enterprises and households by increasing their access to
                         finance. The expected outcomes would include: (i) improved access to financial services for rural entrepreneurs; (ii) increased capital investment made by the rural
                         entrepreneurs as well as increased employment; (iii) increased lending, particularly term lending to the rural private sector for capital investment by all participating
                         financial institutions (PFIs) on market-based terms.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well with regard to achieving the development objectives. All PDO indicator targets for December 2013 have already been exceeded. In terms of
                         increased access to finance, about 102,000 sub-borrowers benefited from receiving financial assistance for their sub-projects, of which nearly 50,000 were first-time borrowers, and
                         about 27,000 were women. The two main lines of credit for medium-long term lending and short-term lending financed 102,000 sub-projects with a cost of USD382 million. The

                         Bank's share in the cost was US$206 million, with the participating financial institutions and the sub-borrowers contributing US$64 million and US$112 million respectively. The
                         income impacts of the sub-projects continued to corroborate the positive results of the 2012 comprehensive assessment; the repayment rates were near 100%. Conservative
                         estimates place incremental jobs created through the assisted sub-projects at 110,000. Given the continued strong implementation performance, the project is expected to fully
                         achieve its development objective by the December2013 closing date.
