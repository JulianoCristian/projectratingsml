                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed RFIII would be to increase economic benefits to rural private enterprises and households by increasing their access to
                         finance. The expected outcomes would include: (i) improved access to financial services for rural entrepreneurs; (ii) increased capital investment made by the rural
                         entrepreneurs as well as increased employment; (iii) increased lending, particularly term lending to the rural private sector for capital investment by all participating
                         financial institutions (PFIs) on market-based terms.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well with regard to achieving the development objectives. All PDO indicator targets for December 2012 have already been exceeded. In terms of
                         increased access to finance, about 92,000 sub-borrowers benefited from receiving financial assistance for their sub-projects, of which nearly 39,000 were first-time borrowers, and
                         about 24,000 were women. The two mainlines of credit for medium-long term lending and short-term lending financed 92,000 sub-projects with a cost of USD338 million. The project

                         contributed USD180 million, the participating financial institutions USD59 million, and the sub-borrowers USD99 million. The income impacts of the sub-projects continued to
                         corroborate the positive results of the 2012 comprehensive assessment; the repayment rates were near 100%. Conservative estimates place incremental jobs created through the
                         assisted sub-projects at 98,000. Given the continued strong implementation performance, the project is expected to fully achieve its development objective by the December2013
                         closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Possible Reallocation. The Micro-finance Loan Fund of US$10 million is already fully disbursed, and the Rural Development Fund of US$175 million will most likely be fully disbursed
                         by project closing. The Technical Assistance component is expected to have a surplus of about US$3 million. It was agreed that the project management unit would assess the
                         performance of this component in March 2013 (by which time the VBARD training activities should have commenced) to determine the need for reallocation to either one or both the
                         funds.
