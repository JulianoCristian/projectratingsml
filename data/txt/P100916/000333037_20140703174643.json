follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: micro-financial institutions may be small\n            but they have the advantage of proximity to the clients and\n            deep outreach. Such institutions invariably operate\n            unsupervised and outside the framework of the banking\n            regulation, and given the limited size of their equity and\n            managerial capacity, face constraints to growth. An\n            important action would be to put in place an enabling\n            regulatory framework and supervision system, assess the\n            viability of such institutions, explore the possibility of\n            consolidating these into larger and stronger institutions\n            which could have a wider operational jurisdiction and offer\n            a wider range of financial services. Studies relating to\n            strategy for penetration of rural markets and training for\n            staff orientation to better understand the risks related to\n            agricultural lending and approaching small and medium rural\n            enterprises are an important mechanism to provide\n            opportunities for private banks to explore provision of\n            rural financial services. An ambitious technical assistance\n            and capacity building program, such as the one implemented\n            under the project, should be supplemented with continuous\n            support and hand-holding from the Bank project team to be\n            successful. An approach that links line of credit with\n            compliance with accreditation criteria has huge potential to\n            effect institutional change. The project not only reduced\n            poverty through project sub-loans but also resulted in\n            significant institutional improvement in the participating\n            banks through continuous and rigorous monitoring of their\n            performance against key performance standards and adjusting\n            the size of their lines of credit in response to their\n            operational performance."}, "docdt": "2014-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
