Therefore,\n            the second phase includes roads rehabilitation, and,\n            construction of small bridges, market buildings, small-scale\n            irrigation, and reforestation sub-projects. However, this\n            environmental assessment identifies a special concern\n            regarding the \"chimapacas\", shallow water\n            reservoirs, with severely degraded, stagnant water, but a\n            major source of drinking water, which endangers health, with\n            the increased risk of malaria. Mitigating measures address:\n            1) construction, and use of chimpacas should not be\n            considered, rather through technical assistance, a properly\n            designed well system should be built for human consumption\n            needs. In addition, capacity building should be increased\n            within the local water departments, and, monitoring of water\n            quality established, through environmental technologies; 2)\n            soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding should be\n            controlled by limiting infrastructure rehabilitation to the\n            dry season, through appropriate disposal of oil and solid\n            wastes, and, re-vegetation practices to restore natural\n            habitats; 3) irrigation systems should ascertain groundwater\n            uses, build drainage systems to prevent water-logging, and,\n            create terraces, or contour ploughing to slow runoffs; and,\n            4) sanitation, and hygiene education, to train communities\n            on the uses of new facilities, and, on the operation, and\n            maintenance of water systems."}, "docdt": "2000-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
