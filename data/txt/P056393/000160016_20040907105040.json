The project has contributed to a number of\n            lessons as follows: 1) For the Bank to be effective in a\n            conflict/post conflict context, a quick and flexible\n            response is required.  2) The demonstration effect of a\n            transparent and accountable institution in an environment\n            where nothing seems to work has a tremendously positive\n            impact on institutional development. FAS evolved into a\n            credible institution through its ability to function with\n            transparent fiduciary procedures. It set an example of good\n            governance for both the public and the private sector. It\n            was therefore able to attract significant resources from its\n            development partners (donors and private sector). 3)\n            Continuity of staffing in a conflict/post conflict context\n            helps to deliver goods and services.  4) Developing\n            partnerships and enhancing capacity of partners such as\n            churches and nongovernmental organizations who provide the\n            interface with communities, contributes to identification of\n            innovative sub-projects and leveraging of operational costs.\n            Training of such partners can ensure consistency in\n            community participation tools. 5). The requirement of having\n            two women out of five community nucleus members has helped\n            to increase female representation, however, the reality of\n            this participation needs to be closely monitored and\n            supported with training programs. 6) Define social impact\n            indicators upfront. To be able to monitor and measure the\n            impact of a project on social capital, a clear definition of\n            practical indicators (including an appropriate baseline) is required."}, "docdt": "2004-08-17T00:00:00Z"}
