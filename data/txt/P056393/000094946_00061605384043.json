      sustainable utilization of basic social and economic\n            services by target populations. The project consists of\n            three components: 1) Social and economic infrastructure\n            subprojects will support a wide range of small, medium and\n            large-scale subprojects for the expansion and improvement of\n            basic social and economic infrastructure, as well as the\n            provision of training in operation and maintenance of the\n            facilities. The subprojects will be identified by poor\n            communities, implemented with the assistance of an\n            implementing partner, and coordinated with local government\n            representatives, nongovernmental organizations, and sectoral\n            agencies. They are related to education, health, water and\n            sanitation, small-scale community infrastructure, and\n            environmental infrastructure. 2) Capacity building will go\n            beyond pursuing community participation in its operation by\n            supporting independent civil society through training\n            programs to strengthen the institutional and managerial\n            capacity of local organizations. 3) Strengthening the\n            monitoring and evaluation system (M&E) will a)\n            capitalize on the existing strengths of the M&E system\n            and project cycle of FAS I, and b) address the areas for\n            improvements and gaps that were identified at the end of FAS I."}, "docdt": "2000-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
