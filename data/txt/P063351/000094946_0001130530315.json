project outcome is considered highly\n            satisfactory, likewise, for both the Bank, and the\n            Borrower's performances, who compromised on a set of\n            priority programs, at a level of budgetary protection that\n            would be feasible, given the Government's pressing\n            fiscal constraints. Key lessons suggest: 1) that counterpart\n            ownership of reform programs becomes an effective tool for\n            implementation, and rapid disbursement of funds, and, that\n            the Bank's willingness to support a phased program of\n            reforms, ensured both budgetary protection, and a continuing\n            dialogue; 2) that an effective political communication is\n            paramount to social reforms strategies, and should be\n            accompanied by comprehensive public information campaigns,\n            provided reforming governments properly expose their reform\n            rationale, which may avoid delays in implementation; 3) that\n            in addition, the rationale, and extent of the Bank's\n            support should also be clarified early, since the problems\n            that arose from lack of understanding of the adjustment\n            lending, led to confusion on the use of disbursed funds,\n            whereas participation would have better been, part of the\n            Brazil Rescue Package, simply as an emergency liquidity\n            assistance, rather than a \"Social Protection\"\n            loan; and, 4) that given the country's difficult\n            political climate, the choice for several single-tranche\n            adjustment instrument, proved successful."}, "docdt": "1999-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
