This first loan supports the\n            government's program of protected social expenditures\n            developed and agreed to in October/November of 1998 that are\n            targeted to the poor and to groups likely to suffer from\n            increased economic insecurity during the next 12-18 months.\n            Specifically, the loan funds productive agricultural\n            investments to reduce poverty, improvement of the quality\n            and efficiency of basic education programs in the poorest\n            areas of the country, reforms in health financing, delivery\n            of basic health services in the Northeast, and support for a\n            key public health intervention--AIDS control.
