IIP investments will replace pumping\n            equipment, rehabilitate water and wastewater treatment\n            plants, specific sections of water mains, and contaminated\n            water intakes. 2) The Management Strengthening and\n            Operational Improvement Program will implement a set of\n            governance, and technical/commercial reforms, to improve\n            physical system operations, management, and financial\n            performance, providing hardware/software tools, as well as\n            technical assistance, and training.
