﻿1. Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to arrest the decline of water and wastewater services of
fourteen medium-size cities (less than 500,000 inhabitants) located in different regions of
Russia that have demonstrated their commitment to the project objectives and the institutional
reforms necessary to achieve them. More specifically, at the city level, the project seeks to:
(a) support the most critical and immediate investments needed to improve the operation of
the water and wastewater systems while achieving improvement of system operations,
reduction of operational costs, improvement of service quality; and (b) implement a specific
set of institutional and commercial reforms aimed at improving physical system operations
and financial performance of vodokanals.
Through project implementation, the Russian Federation will extract lessons from the
implementation of the fourteen sub-projects over a wide range of local conditions and the
project will support the preparation of replicable methodologies, guidelines, and case studies
to guide the government's program of municipal services reform aimed at helping municipal
local governments and their water and wastewater enterprises (vodokanals) to become better
managed, more efficiently operated and financially sustainable utilities that are capable of
providing water and wastewater services of a higher quality to their customers in a cost-
effective manner.
2. Project Description
The Municipal Water and Wastewater Project (MWWP) is composed of three major
components: (1) Immediate Investment Program; (2) Management Strengthening and
Operational Improvement Program; and (3) Project Management and Implementation
Support.
Project Component I - Immediate Investment Program (HP):
In each city, a set of high priority immediate investments have been identified, justified,
costed and designed by consultants during project preparation. The HP for the vodokanals has
an implementation period generally of no more than two years; and a total cost below the sub-
project loan size to allow sufficient resources for the implementation of the Management
Strengthening and Operational Improvement Program.
Project Component 2 - Management Strengthening and Operational Improvement Program
(MSOIP):
The objective of this component is to implement a specific and well-defined set of technical
and commercial reforms aimed at improving physical system operations and management and
financial performance of Vodokanals. The MSOIP is divided into two closely related sub
components
2.1 - Technical Assistance for Implementation of the MSOIP (TA):
This sub-component will finance the consulting services to support: (i) the development and
implementation of a new governance and commercial system, accounting and financial
management system, tariffs setting system and metering strategy; and (ii) the identification of
investments to improve the quality and efficiency of-water and wastewater services. Finland,
Sweden and United Kingdom are expected to participate in the financing of this component.


﻿2.2 - Investment in Support of the MSOIP:
This sub-component will finance investments (goods, works and training) in order to: (i)
improve the management of vodokanals; and (ii) improve the operational efficiency of the
existing systems through implementation of the interventions defined under sub-component
2.1. The investments in this category would include various items generally used with water
and wastewater systems like pipes, valves, pumps, mechanical and electrical parts, and
controls, bulk and block meters, maintenance equipment, leak and pressure management
equipment, and other equipment.
Project Component 3 - Project Management and Implementation Support:
3.1 - Engineering Designs and Bidding Documents: Consultants will assist each of the
participating vodokanals in the elaboration of final designs and bidding documents of all
investments in the MSOIP. Finland and Sweden are expected to participate in the financing
of this component.
3.2 - Supervision of Construction: Consultants will assist vodokanals in the supervision of
construction to ensure that the quality of equipment and civil works under both the IIP and the
MSOIP meet adequate standards of quality and that bills provided by suppliers and
contractors are correct.
3.3 - General Procurement Assistance: Qualified advisors will assist the National Foundation
for Housing Reform (NFHR) and vodokanals in procurement actions to ensure compliance
with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines. The advisors will also
be responsible for training the staff in the NFHR and in various vodokanals in handling
procurement. Sweden will finance this component.
3.4 - Project Implementation Arrangements: The NFHR will be responsible for managing and
supervising the project. The NFHR will be the main link with the Bank and fully responsible
for ensuring that the project is implemented efficiently in accordance with the provisions of
the Loan Agreement.
3. Project Environmental Summary
The project has been classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental
review to identify potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation and
monitoring measures where needed. A review of potential environmental impacts from the
proposed investments has been carried out during the project preparation process for each
of the participating cities by the Vodokanals with the assistance of foreign consultants.
This is being complemented by sub- project specific Environmental Management Plans
(EMMPs) that will be reviewed and approved by Russian authorities and the Bank prior to
any construction activities being undertaken in the concerned municipality.
The project is not anticipated to have significant negative environmental effects and will
not result in any involuntary resettlement or land acquisition since it focuses on
rehabilitation of existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the
premises of existing facilities or within the right of way of public streets.. The project will
not finance construction of new facilities for water production, water treatment, or
wastewater treatment. Investments financed by the project will not affect any known
archeological or historical site or any critical natural habitats, -nor will it entail resettlement
or affect indigenous peoples. None of the structures to be rehabilitated include dams.


﻿Nevertheless, the project may cause some environmental impacts that require mitigation
measures related to: (i) inappropriate disposal of excavated materials, construction debris,
and small quantities of hazardous wastes and materials related to construction activities;
(ii) damage caused by contractors during construction activities; and (iii) nuisance during
construction (noise, dust, and traffic disruption). The contract documents include
provisions for mitigation measures and/or avoidance. Participating vodokanals, under the
guidance of Gosstroi and the Bank, are preparing public meetings to discuss project
objectives and construction activities and their likely impacts on the environment and
public at large.
OP 7.50, "International Waterways" applies to twelve sub-project , which are located on
international waterways as defined by paragraphs (a) or (b) of the policy. These include the
cities of Astrakhan, Cheboksary, Gagarin, Oryol, Petrozavodsk, Pskov, Sochi, Tobolsk,
Volkhov, Vologda, and Votkinsk. These sub-project involve rehabilitation of existing
schemes and/or construction, which in the team's judgment (i) will not adversely change
the quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely
affected by the other riparians' water use. Given the nature of the planned interventions to
be supported by the sub-project and the fact that they will not adversely impact
downstream riparian countries, the exception to the external notification requirements of
OP 7.50, as set forth in paragraph 7(a) of the policy has been determined by LEGOP and
ECSSD to apply in the case of the project. To the extent that future sub-project sub-mitted
by additional vodokanals or identified under MSOIP may impact the environment within
Russia and/or other riparian countries, they will have to comply with the applicable
policies and procedures of the Russian Federation and Bank.
The project is expected to result in environmental and health benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure improved drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better
handling of water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply
network will reduce water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants
will reduce the risk of sewage spills, and assure improved quality of wastewater released
after treatment and better handling of solid and liquid wastes; (iv) pumping station
rehabilitation will increase energy efficiency of the vodokanals' operations; (v)
improvement in operations will contribute to better day-to-day environmental management
(treatment plant waste management, handling of chemicals, improvement in operation and
maintenance of the sewerage network, including better emergency response; more efficient
use of information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance
with environmental regulations); and (vi) water conservation through demand management
will reduce the need for construction of new capacity for years to come. Environmental
issues will also be addressed in the Corporate Development Plans to be prepared under the
project for each vodokanal. Potential environmental issues related to investments included
in the fourteen cities that will initially be supported by the project are analyzed in the
reports available in the Project Files; these will be complemented by sub-project specific
EMMPs.
The project was reviewed and approved by the State Committee for the Ecology of the
Russian Federation during appraisal. All components of sub-project with potentially
significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly those with a construction
budget over US$0.5M, will be reviewed by relevant environmental authorities (either the
Department of State Ecological Expertise or its delegate at the municipal level) to ensure
compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental Expertise. They will also be reviewed
by the Bank for compliance with environmental and disclosure procedures. Review and
approval of projects that require this process, particularly those components that require an
EIA (OVOS) under local regulations, will take place prior to initiating construction. This


﻿procedure will also be followed for all components of investments in the fourteen initial
cities, as well as those in later phases of the project.
During project supported construction, supervision of implementation of the environmental
management plan for each sub-project will be one of the functions of the construction
supervision consultants. The Project Implementation Unit at the Central Level will have
the support of an advisor to ensure compliance of the bidding documents for proposed sub-
project with Russian and Bank environmental guidelines. During project implementation,
adequate resources will be made available for an environmental specialist to be part of the
Bank team during supervision missions, Mid-Term Review and Implementation
Completion Report. Contractors will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding
documents, for keeping work sites pollution-free, returning sites to their original
conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and other work-related nuisances. They will also be
responsible for notification of the discovery of any previously unknown archeological
and/or historical sites that may be found during excavation activities.
4. Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans (EMMPs)
The EMMPs for each sub-project have been prepared for the participating vodokanals by
the NFHR with the assistance of an international consultant. The EMMPs include a
description of the legal and administrative framework of the environment sector with
specific application to the sub-project, a description of the baseline conditions,
identification of potential environmental impacts; identification of specific mitigation
measures; and recommended monitoring actions. The EMMPs include information on
implementation and monitoring responsibilities. The provisions already included in
contract documents and enforced through the EMMP are adequate to minimize potential
negative environmental impacts associated with project supported activities. The EMMPs
will be implemented by participating vodokanals and supervised by engineering
consultants, NFHR, and environmental authorities at the municipal level.
The project includes support for a number of site specific interventions to improve water
and sewage services in cooperating municipalities. Project supported activities in each
municipality included the preparation of a feasibility study complemented by an EMMP.
The process used in the project is to have the feasibility studies and the associated EMMPs
reviewed on a sub-project basis by both Russian environmental authorities and the Bank
before proceeding with the implementation process. The draft and final EMMPs will be
disclosed in English and Russian on an ongoing basis during the course of project
implementation, in the cooperating municipalities, Resident Mission and InfoShop.
5. Environmental Assessment by Project Cities
5. 1 Astrakhan
In Astrakhan, one component - rehabilitation of a sewage interceptor (US$0.7 million)- has
been designed and bidding documents prepared, corresponding to about 4% of the total sub-
project costs of US$18.9 million. In addition, the rehabilitation of two main sewage pumping
stations has been proposed and designs are expected to be available by the end of 2000. About
half of the investment components are still unidentified and will be selected with the help of
technical assistance consultahts during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been


﻿classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
ACVK has two wastewater treatment plants: the Northern wastewater treatment plant and the
Southern wastewater treatment plant, each serving their own zone. The Northern wastewater
treatment plant is located at Moshaik Street. It was designed by the Rostov Institute and built
with a capacity of 90,000 m3/day in 1979, and expanded by 50,000 m3/day in 1995. Against
this design capacity of 140,000 m3/d, around 103,000 m/d is actually used. The BOD5-
reduction is from 75 mg/1 down to 2.7 mg/, or 96.4%. A main reason for this result was
obviously the very low BOD-load of the influent, which may indicate surface or groundwater
intrusion into the sewerage system during the prevalent high water season. Also some
phosphorus and nitrogen reduction takes place in the process. Its effluent is being discharged
to the Volga River, through a 2.5 km long 1500 mm concrete effluent pipeline. Sludge
disposal at this plant was reported to be a problem, because of a lack of modern sludge
treatment facilities. There is sufficient space on site for another 10 years' sludge storage.
Southern wastewater treatment plant is located at Kabardinskaya Street. It has a capacity of
100,000 m3/day and was constructed in two stages: mechanical treatment only (1963) and
biological treatment added (1975). It is currently operating at an actual load of 73,000 -
75,000 m3/day. The design was based on an influent quality of 250 mg/1 BOD and 300 mg/l
suspended solids, with 94% BOD removal (effluent: 15 mg/1 BOD). Sludge is deposited in
sludge fields, located about 6 km outside the town. There are 18 fields in total; their capacity
is reported to be used for 60-70% now. In fact, six sludge fields are still completely empty,
while it takes two years for a field to dry completely.
There are no measurements of bacterial discharges neither into the river nor in the river.
However, it is reasonable to assume that the level is high and the Caspian Sea downstream
may be affected.
Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components (immediate and those to be identified)
will be to improve environmental and health conditions in the city of Astrakhan. These
components will not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since they focuse on
rehabilitation of existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the
premises of existing facilities or the rights of way of public street networks. The project will
not affect any known archeological or historical site.


﻿In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites
pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and
other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5. 2 Cheboksary
In Cheboksary, three components - improvement of the water intake (US$3.1 million),
improvement of pumping efficiency (US$0.3 million) and installation of flow meters (US$3.1
million)- have been identified and bidding documents prepared, corresponding to about 26 %
of the total sub-project costs of US$17.4 million. The remaining investment components will
be selected with the help of technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project
implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions. Treated effluent from the WWTP is discharged into
the Tsivil River for effluents coming from Line 1, and into the Volga River for Line 2. The
Volga River, forming the northern border of Chuvashia, is also the main river in the study
area. At the heights of Cheboksary the Volga assumes almost the characteristics of a lake,
with a width ranging from 4 to 13 km, due to the regulating dam built in 1985 near
Novocheboksary for hydroelectric exploitation of its large flow. The annual average flow in
the Volga, at Novocheboksary dam, is some 1,200 ml/s with minimum flow of about 700 m/s
during the winter month, when the entire lake surface is covered by a thick layer of ice.
During the snow melting period in April and May, the highest flows are registered with
monthly average values in the range of 1,500-2,000 m3/s. The construction of the


﻿impounding dam caused important deterioration of the Volga water quality, due to decay of
the submerged vegetation. During the year, it is worth mentioning the high quantity of
organic substances like algae and plankton during the summer months. In autumn, when the
water temperature drops, in association to frequent rainfalls and high discharges, the water in
the lake assumes higher turbidity and colour.
Some sources of pollution of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary include the WTP,
where water from backwashing and the sludge removed periodically from the settling basins
are discharged into the Volga River without any treatment. Another important source of
pollution is the storm drainage system
Table 5.2.1 presents a summary of the WWTP performance in 1996. Altogether, treated
effluent characteristics, both from Line 1 and 2, result in fair compliance with the temporary
limits set for 1998, but are by far worse than the relevant prescribed final limits. It is also to
be pointed out that current results obtained by the existing treatment plants, would be
considered satisfactory with respect to foreign norms. On the other hand, to reach a fair
compliance with final limits, treatment process should be extended beyond biological
treatment, with the construction of further advanced treatment sections, demanding high
investment cost and more elevated Operation and Maintenance (O&M) cost.

Potential Environmental Impacts. A review of potential environmental impact of the
proposed investments has been carried out during project preparation. The components
identified for immediate investments are not expected to cause significant negative
environmental effects, as they involve rehabilitation and limited improvements of existing
water infrastructure (booster stations, pumps). These components will not raise any
resettlement or property rights issues since it focuses on rehabilitation of existing facilities.
All work, including the reconstruction of the main transmission line will be executed within
the premises of existing facilities. The project will not affect any known archeological or
historical site.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the Project.


﻿5.3 Gagarin
In Gagarin, two components-supply of laboratory equipment (US$0.04 million) and
improvement of distribution pumps (US$0.3 million) - have been identified and tender
documents prepared, corresponding to about 21 % of the total sub-project costs of about
US$1.4 million. The remaining investment components will be selected with the help of
technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions. Gagarin WWTP is an (ultra) low-loaded
conventional activated sludge system. The effluent of the Gagarin WWTP is discharged into
the Gzhat River. The following table shows the present effluent quality and the maximum
allowable concentrations (MAC values) of organic compounds and nutrients. Also the latest
standards used in EU countries are given.

According to the MAC values the concentrations of phosphorus and of the nitrogen
compounds ammonia, nitrite and nitrate are critical. To lower the nitrogen concentration in
the effluent, denitrification measures must be implemented at the wastewater treatment plant.
To lower the phosphorus concentration, chemicals for precipitation must be added to the
activated sludge system. The measures for advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal will
be process-integrated measurements. Therefore, extension of the activated sludge volume is
not necessary.
Compared to the EU guidelines, especially the Russian standards for COD, BOD, P and
ammonia removal are very strict. To meet these standards, ultra low-loaded activated sludge


﻿systems are required. The investment costs for these kind of systems are very high and the
effectiveness of such investments in relation to their environmental impact, such as river
water quality, is doubtful.
The sludge (primary and secondary sludge) at the wastewater treatment plant is currently
thickened (1-2%) but not treated any further before being pumped to the sludge ponds next to
the treatment plant. Natural dewatering of the sludge takes place there, but this is not sufficient
to prevent that the sludge ponds are filling up. Both from an environmental pollution point of
view and according to the new regulations, a sludge treatment system would be preferable.
Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components (immediate and to be defined) will be to
improve environmental and health conditions in the city of Gagarin. These components will
not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since they focuse on rehabilitation of
existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the premises of
existing facilities or the rights of way of public street networks. The project will not affect
any known archeological or historical site.
In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites
pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and
other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5.4 Kansk
In Kansk, two major components - rehabilitation of water treatment plant (US$1.4 million)
and reconstruction of sewage interceptor and pumping stations (US$6.1 million) - have been
identified and bidding documents are under preparation, corresponding to about 77% of the
total sub-project costs of US$9.7 million). The remaining investment components will be
selected with the help of technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project
implementation..
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage


﻿of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions. Currently, treated effluent from the WWTP in
Kansk is discharged into the Kan River. This river flows south to north for approximately
400 km and drains an area of 23,800 km2 prior to reaching the city of Kansk. The river
continues eastward and discharges into the Yenisey River. The sparsely populated drainage
area contains flatlands and the Vostochnyy Sayan Mountains. Total 48% melted snow, 32%
rainwater, and 20% groundwater discharges feed the annual river volume. River flow rates
vary between 12 and 4,480 m3/s at Kansk, with the lowest flow rates in the winter. The city
of Kansk uses the Kan River for its supply of water.
Quality of water in the Kan River varies during the year. High river flow rates in the spring
increase the turbidity up to 80 mg/1. In addition, the water quality is somewhat compromised
by the presence of benzopyrene, hydrocarbons, phenols, methanol, lignosulfonates,
asphaltenes, and metals (zinc, copper, aluminum, manganese, nickel, and lead). Table 20
shows water quality data in the Kan River at the Left Bank intake facility.
The wastewater collection and treatment systems in Kansk are in a state of emergency.
Pretreatment of the industrial wastewater, sewage collection system, wastewater treatment
plant operation, and sludge handling facilities are in a poor state of repair and operate with
gross inadequacies. In addition to the inadequate facilities and equipment, wastewater
received at the plant is highly concentrated and the plant is hydraulically overloaded. Table
21presents a summary of the WWTP performance in 1996. The plant seems to be unable to
handle the high concentrations of solids, BOD, COD, sulfites, sulfates, and other constituents
presents in the strong incoming wastewater. The effluent discharged to the Kan River is of
very poor quality. A biological process at the secondary treatment units is limited, as
indicated by low oxygen content and poor BOD removal efficiency. Reportedly, plant
discharge significantly exceeds limits for suspended solids, E. Coli and oxygen content.

Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all (immediate and to be defined) components will be to
improve environmental and health conditions in the city of Kansk by improving the quality of
potable water, as well as reduce the risk of sewage overflow and flooding. These components
will not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since they focus on the rehabilitation
of existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the premises of

5.5 Nakhodka
In Nakhodka, two components - rehabilitation of water pumping station (US$3.0 million) and
installation of meters (US$0.5 million)- have been identified and bidding documents
prepared, corresponding to about 64% of the total sub-project costs of US$5.6 million. The
remaining investment components will be selected with the help of technical assistance
consultants during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions.
The wastewater qualities are monitored at the inlet and outlet of the treatment plant on
five quality items, including i)Temperature, ii) pH, iii) BOD, iv) COD, v) SS and
nutrient compounds. The WWTP effluent qualities are generally good, whereas those
discharged from the wastewater and drainage outfalls are the major pollutant sources of
the water bodies. The wastewater qualities discharged through outfalls at certain points,
particularly those discharging to the sea coast have high pollutant concentrations, for
example, 100 mg/l or higher BOD5,suggesting that urgent measures are to be taken to
prevent such discharge.
Almost 200 outfalls within the Nakhodka discharge wastewater and stormwater. Of the
total assumed wastewater production of 50,000 m /day, the WWTP is currently treating
only 20,000 m'/day or 40 percent of the total wastewater production. The balance is
being either discharged to the bay or infiltrate into ground.
The WWTP effluent qualities are generally good, whereas those discharged from the raw
wastewater and drainage outfalls carry many portions of pollutants and considered being
the major pollutant sources. The WWTP effluent generally has BOD5 contents of less
than 15 mg/I. The raw wastewater inflowing to the bay through outfalls have BOD5
concentrations of more than 100 mg/l, consequently, the waste concentrations in the bay


﻿water close to outfalls are generally high.
As no comprehensive long-term water quality monitoring program covering the entire
bay area has been planned yet, the bay water quality data to show the extent of the bay
contamination are limited. The available bay water quality data are those sampled by
NVK at several monitoring points for checking the effect of WWTP effluent to the bay
water. The bay water qualities at 1,000 m offshore were BODs 1.2 mg/i, Phosphates 0.1
mg/I, Nitrites 0.02 mg/I, etc., which values are lower than the water quality standard
requirements.
Under the normal condition when tide current velocity is about 1 m/sec, an effluent of
20,000 m'/day containing 20 mg/1 BOD, and 1,000 Coliform MPN/ml would easily be
dispersed, dilluted and dieaway. Thus, result in BOD5 of lower than 0.0006 mg/l and
almost nil Coliform (T90 3hr.) survival in the 1,000-m offshore water. Although some
assumptions were made for these figures, it may be reasonable to consider that the bay
water at 1,000-m offshore was no longer affected by the WWTP effluent constituent.
The region's morbidity statistics in the last several years, indicate that there has been
small number of the water-born disease patients, which are no more than the normal
level. These may be explained by the low ambient temperatures prevailing in the region
throughout the year, which made the people less chance to contact with the contaminated
water, while giving unfavorable habitats for propagation of microorganisms.
The pollution contribution through rural and urban drainage may however continue to
increase in the future. Predictions of the future organic loading on the waterways
suggest that even after the collectible domestic and industrial wastewater is completely
removed from the service area, the residual pollution from outside of the sewer service
area may affect in parts of rivers and coastal zones.
Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components will be to improve environmental and
health conditions in the city of Nakhodka. These components will not raise any resettlement
or property rights issues since it focuses on rehabilitation of existing network and facilities.
All work will be executed either within the premises of existing facilities or the rights of way

pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and
other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.


﻿5.6 Oryol
In Oryol, two components - extension of Kromskoi well field (US$1.4 million) and
replacement of transmission mains (US 1.0 million) - have been designed and bidding
documents prepared, corresponding to about 29% of the total sub-project cost of US$8.3
million. The remaining investment components will be selected with the help of technical
assistance consultants during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine

environmental regulations); and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions
Wastewater from the wastewater treatment plants in Oryol is discharged into the Oka River.
Oka is a tributary of the Volga River and rises approximately 50 km south of Oryol. The total
length of the river is 1480 km and covers a drainage area of 239 900 km2. The river is mainly
surrounded by agricultural land and passes about 60 km south of Moscow on its way to the
Volga River.

Oka River is a eutrophicated river with high amounts ofnutritive salts and oxygen consuming
material. According to European classification, the phosphorus, nitrogen and COD
concentrations are all regarded as very high. The limits for a highly eutrophicated river in
Europe are set at level of 50 jig/ for phosphorus and 1,5 mg/l for nitrogen. After the


﻿discharge from the wastewater treatment plant these levels are exceeded almost ten times in
the case of phosphorus and about 3 times for nitrogen.
Cadmium is the only metal analyzed in the river and for this reason it is hardly appropriate to
assess the impact of heavy metals before and after passing through the treatment plant.
According to the European standard >0.3 jug cadmium / I is regarded as a very high level of
cadmium in the water. In Oka River such a level is exceeded both upstream and downstream
of the treatment plant.
According to the measurements given in table 4.6 the impact of the wastewater treatment
plant is extremely high in the river. The nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are four
times higher downstream the treatment plant and the BOD5 concentration is twice as much.
There are no measurements of bacterial discharges neither into the river nor in the river.
However, it is reasonable to assume that the level is high and those downstream cities, such as
Tula, may be affected.
Review of potential environmental impacts. One component defined for the immediate
investment program involve the extension of groundwater abstraction capacity at Kromskoi
well field to improve service level in certain areas of Oryol. This increase in abstraction is
within limits of current permits, well below of potential capacity and does not pose any risk to
environment. In addition, it will allow to reduce abstraction of water from wells of poor water
quality. Installation of water meters will take place within existing facilities and any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components (immediate and to be identified in later
stages) will be to improve environmental and health conditions in the city of Oryol. These
components will not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since they focuse on
rehabilitation of existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the
premises of existing facilities or the rights of way of public street networks. The project will
not affect any archeological or historical site.
In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites
pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and
other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over USSO.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5.7 Pechora
In Pechora, two major components - renovation of the water treatment plant (US$4.2 million)
and construction of transmission pipeline (US$0.7 million) - have been identified and bidding
documents have been prepared, corresponding to about 70% of the total sub-project costs of
US$6.9 ibillion). The remaining investment components will be selected with the help of
technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project implementation.


﻿For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations); and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions. Currently the city of Pechora is the main discharger
impacting the river water quality in the Pechora region. Treated effluent from the wastewater
treatment plant in Pechora is discharged into the Pechora River. The discharge pipe is
equipped with a diffuser to ensure even mixing in the river. There is also a fish farm
upstream the city in connection with the gas turbine power plant. The fish are grown in the
cooling water discharge area. The plant has been designed for 500 tons of fish per day.
During normal operation, the oil industry does not impact the quality of the river water. An
oil accident occurred in 1989 in the catchment area of Maloje Kozhva River, a tributary of
Pechora River. No impacts on Pechora River water quality or ecosystem were reported,
because the accident occurred in spring and the melting waters diluted the oil. The oil
pipelines passing Pechora River are monitored frequently by the oil industry and the risk of
rupture is currently considered minimal.
PVK monitors the quality of Pechora River upstream and downstream of the discharge point
of the wastewater. The samples are taken only during the period of no-ice and analyzed in the
wastewater laboratory of PVK. This data of the river water quality from sample points is
given in the consultant's report.
There is no data on the total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. However, the
phosphate-phosphorus concentration indicates slightly eutrophic conditions. The ammonium-
nitrogen concentration was very high in 1994 and also surprisingly high in 1995-1996
compared to the nitrate-nitrogen concentration, especially since the oxygen concentration was
high during the sampling periods.
The values of COD are rather high, which might indicate strong impact of drainage water
from mires. However, the concentration of iron is fairly low and the pH close to seven, which
do not indicate impacts of mires. The concentrations of phenol and surface active compounds
are low. The oxygen concentration is high during the non-ice period.
According to the monitoring results of the Vodokanal, the impacts of wastewaters on the river
water quality includes:
*  concentration of saspended solids increases;
* COD increases;
* BOD increases;


﻿*  no clear impacts on nitrogen concentrations (total nitrogen results missing);
*  very slight increase in the phosphate-phosphorus concentration or no impact; and
*  no impacts from iron, oil product, oxygen, phenol or surfactants.
The nutrients in the treated wastewater are mainly nitrate-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus
form.
There is no flow data available for Pechora River. The dilution of wastewater is adequate in
Pechora River. The discharge of treated effluent is not expected to impact the chemical or
hygienic quality of Pechora River and cause any adverse impacts.
There are no national parks or other sensitive habitats in the vicinity of Pechora. The
discharge of wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant is not expected to affect the
endemic salmon population or other rare fish species.
Review of potential environmental impacts. The components defined for the immediate
investment program involve the reconstruction of existing infrastructure (water treatment
plant) and the construction of a new water transmission pipeline. Any potentially significant
environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction methods. The
ultimate objective of both components will be to improve environmental and health
conditions in the city of Pechora by improving the quality of potable water supplied to the
consumers. These components will not raise any resettlement or property rights issues. All
work will be executed either within the premises of existing facilities or the rights of way of
public street networks. The project will not affect any known archeological or historical site.
In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites
pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and
other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5.8 Petrozavodsk
In Petrozavodsk, one component - the rehabilitation of the wastewater treatment plant
(US$8.6 million) - has been designed and bidding documents prepared, corresponding to
about 62% of the total sub-project costs of US$13.9 million. In addition, the rehabilitation of
water treatment plant has been identified as a priority and the design work will be initiated
shortly. The remaining investment components (about 10 % of total) will be selected with the
help of technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project implementation. -
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will


﻿assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions. PETVK water supply system extracts water from
Petrozavodsk Bay on Lake Onega. The extraction site is located not far from the city's harbor
front and only 8 km from the discharge point of the biological wastewater treatment plant.
Under unfavorable hydro meteorological conditions, municipal wastewater can reach the inlet
of the water supply system. Eutrophication and humus rich waters from River Shuya also
affect Petrozavodsk Bay, with the corresponding decrease in water quality.
Raw water is treated by sand filtration and disinfected by chlorine. The existing water
treatment system does not ensure drinking water quality of satisfactory quality, including
bacterial pollution, according to the national standards. The water quality even deteriorates in
the distribution system. The poor tap water quality increases the population morbidity
(Source: Barents Region Environmental Program).
Biologically treated wastewater is being discharged into Petrozavodsk Bay. The treated
wastewater causes noticeable pollution of the Petrozavodsk Bay. Due to increased nutrient
loading, intensive development of blue-green algae (up to 1 million cells/liter, with the BODs
of 0.4 g/m3) has in recent years been observed during the summer months in Petrozavodsk
Bay.
The dewatered wastewater sludge is transported to a dumping site which has been constructed
to an old gravel pit. The sludge has not been stabilized and is contaminated with heavy
metals and cannot thus be utilized in agriculture. The sludge also causes environmental
contamination of the general environment and the ground water resources in the vicinity of
the dumping site.
Environmental impacts at Petrozavodsk WWTP are based on the loading figures of the basic
scenario in 2010. These figures are reflected against present figures in Table 19. The most
significant result will be the reduction of phosphorus emissions to Lake Onega which will be
halved from the present situation due to the new biological removal process.

Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure (water
treatment plant and waste water treatment plant), any potentially significant environmental
impact will be minimized using appropriate construction methods. The ultimate objective of
both components will be to improve environmental and health conditions in the city of
Petrozavodsk by improving the quality of potable water, as well as reduce the pollution of
Lake Onega. These components will not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since
it focuses on rehabilitation of existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either

5.9 Pskov
In Pskov, one component - the rehabilitation of the water treatment plant (US$5.9 million) -
has been designed and bidding documents prepared, corresponding to about 53 % of the total
sub-project costs of US$11.1 million. The remaining investment components will be selected
with the help of technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project
implementation.


﻿For the purpose of O.P. 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) later rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will
reduce water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved

Current Environmental Conditions. Wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant in
Pskov is discharged into the River Velikaya. The recipients affected by wastewater from
Pskov are:
* The River Velikaya on the last 10 km before it reaches Lake Pskov
* The River Velikaya Delta at the inlet to Lake Pskov
* Lake Pskov (Lake Pihkva in Estonia)
* Lake Chudskoye (Lake Peipus in Estonia)
* The Baltic Sea
The River Velikaya is the largest river in the region. The river, the major source to Lake
Pskov and Lake Chudskoye has a drainage area of 25 000 kn2 and a mean flow of 125 m31s.

The delta is located 8 km to the northwest of Pskov City, where the river joins Lake Pskov.
The area is about 3 km2 and has 40 swampy islands that are divided by channels.
The delta comprises a distinctive natural environment with breeding places for rare and
diminishing species of fish, bird breeding places and many different plants. This unique
natural complex of fauna and flora is one of the special attractions in the Pskov Region.


﻿Data obtained by Estonian researchers for the period 1987-89 indicate a high level of
contamination of the delta's silt with lead, cadmium, zinc and mercury. During the past years
the water in the River Velikaya has been characterized by high level of iron, copper, non
organic and organic reductants, organic matter and in some cases phosphor containing
compounds and petroleum products.
The changes in the benthos of the delta observed over the past 30 years show its progressing
eutrophication, increase of mass of suspended particles and accumulation of bottom silt.
However, they do not reflect any dramatic destructive phenomena. The delta as before
continues to perform the role of a natural filter, by accumulating more and more organic
matter.
The most significant impact on the pollution level is said to originate from uncontrolled
discharge of industrial wastewater from industries in Pskov and discharges from the
wastewater treatment plant in Pskov. The wastewater from Pskov is discharged into the River
Velikaya 10 km upstream of the Lake Pskov-Chudskoye system (Peipsi-Pihkva in Estonian).
Through its outflow, the River Narva, the lake is connected to the Gulf of Finland. The River
Velikaya and the River Emajogi are the main contributors of phosphorus and nitrogen to Lake
Pskov-Chudskoye.
A drastic increase in concentrations of sodium, potassium, sulphate and chloride indicating
increased anthropogenic influence since the 1960 are reported. Fluctuations in content of
oxygen and carbon dioxide have also increased. A low level of oxygen caused a large
number of fish to be killed in summerl988. The oxygen had obviously been consumed by
degradation of large amounts of phytoplankton. Pollution load on Lake Pskov-Chudskoye
from agriculture has obviously decreased since the 1980s. The lake seems to be in a rather
healthy state in spite of the pollution load from agriculture and sewage water from large
population centres.
Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure (water
treatment plant), any potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using
appropriate construction methods. The ultimate objective of all components (immediate and

﻿5.10 Sochi
In Sochi, one major component - the rehabilitation and capacity enhancement of Bzugu
wastewater treatment plant (US$27.0 million)- has been identified and the preparation of
bidding documents will be initiated shortly. This component corresponds to about 78% of the
total sub-project costs of US$34.7 million. The remaining investment components will be
selected with the help of technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project
implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where. The
project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)

expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions.
The City of Sochi is located on the Black Sea shore, 15 lan from the Russian-Georgian border
and discharges the processed effluent into the Black Sea.
Two WWTPs (Nagavinsky and Bzugu) process the wastewater flow from the city center. Up
to 70% of the wastewater flow from the city center goes to the Nagavinsky WWTP. It is
located in the immediate neighborhood of the residential and resort areas, without special
protection zones. It is heavily overloaded, its facilities are dilapidated, and it has been
operating under an "emergency" regime for many years. This has increased the chances of an
overflow accident, which can seriously affect both recreation and industrial facilities (railroad
station). The plant has operational problems such as unacceptable odors and poorly treated
effluent. These create a serious annoyance for the tourists and the population. The Bzugu
WWTP has been operating at 30-40% of its design capacity. Both WWTPs discharge their
effluents into the Black Sea, and the outflow from the Nagavinsky WWTP goes through an
outfall near the popular beaches. The Black Sea is locked by the Bosphorus Straits from the
Marmara Sea and the rest of Mediterranean Sea. Consequently, it does not have strong tides
or heavy sea storms, and its capacity for natural self clean up from pollution is very low.
The Navaginsky WWTP does not meet the norms of BOD5, N-NH4, N-NO2, surface active
substances, and phosphates. The SVK is being fined for these violations. Table 5.10.1
presents the discharge data for Nagavinsky WWTP

sanitary-hygienic and ecological quality of sea water. The only exception is the Kudepsta

Review of potential environmental impacts. As the component defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction and improvement of existing
infrastructure (wastewater treatment plant), any potentially significant environmental impact
will be minimized using appropriate construction methods. The ultimate objective of all
components (immediate and to be defined at a later stage) will be to improve environmental
and health conditions in the city of Sochi. These components will not raise any resettlement
or property rights issues since they focus on the rehabilitation of existing network and
facilities. All work will be executed either within the premises of existing facilities or the
rights of way of public street networks. The project will not affect any known archeological
or historical site.
In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites
pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and


﻿other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of'State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5.11 Tobolsk
In Tobolsk, one component - supply of network repair equipment (US$0.7 million) - has been
designed and bidding documents prepared, corresponding to about 9% of the total sub-project
costs of US$6.9 million. In addition, the rehabilitation of water treatment plant and
distribution system has been proposed and design work initiated. The remaining investment
components (about 50 % of investment components) will be selected with the help of
technical assistance consultants during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions.
Tobolsk WWTP is an (ultra) low-loaded conventional activated sludge system. Its effluent is
discharged into the Irtish River. The standards for discharges of effluent in the Russian
Federation are very strict compared to the EU standards. They are calculated on the basis of
on a maximum allowable load of components in the effluent, with the intention to reduce
environmental impact to a minimum and to improve surface water quality. Furthermore the
effluent has to be disinfected. The following table shows the present effluent quality and the
maximum allowable concentrations (Russia) of organic compounds and nutrients. Also the
latest standards used in EU countries are given.

According to the Russian standards the concentrations of BOD, phosphorus and the nitrogen
compounds ammonia and nitrate are critical. To lower the nitrogen concentration in the
effluent, denitrification measures must be implemented at the wastewater treatment plant. To
lower the phosphorus concentration, chemicals for precipitation must be added to the
activated sludge system. The measures for both advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal
will be process-integrated measurements. After implementation of these measurements the
nitrogen and/or BOD removal may still be critical (N,t 4.5-10 mg/1). Therefore, in the
future, a further extension of the activated sludge volume may be necessary to realise
advanced nitrate and BOD removal. Compared to the EU guidelines, especially the Russian
standards for COD, BOD, P and ammonia removal are very strict. To meet these standards
ultra low-loaded activated sludge systems with post treatment are required.
Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components will be to improve environmental and
health conditions in the city of Tobolsk. These components will not raise any resettlement or
property rights issues since they focus on the rehabilitation of existing network and facilities.
All work will be executed either within the premises of existing facilities or the rights of way
of public street networks. The project will not affect any known archeological or historical
site.
In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites

Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5.12 Volkhov
In Volkhov, three components - construction of booster station and water reservoir (US$0.7


﻿million), improvement of pumping efficiency (US$0.2 million) and renovation of the water
treatment plant (US$0.4 million)- have been designed and bidding documents prepared,
corresponding to about 89% of the total sub-project costs of US$1.4 million). The remaining
investment components will be selected with the help of technical assistance consultants
during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed, as
well as to identify opportunities for environmental assessment. The project is expected to
bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will assure better drinking water
quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of water treatment residuals; (ii)
rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce water losses and decrease the
volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the
wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage of sewage, and assure improved
quality of wastewater released after treatment and better handling of solid and liquid waste;
(iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy efficiency of the Vodokanals'
operations; (v) improvement in operations will contribute to a better day-to-day
environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling of chemicals and
toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the sewerage network,
including improved emergency response; more efficient use of information from the existing
water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with environmental regulations) ; and
(vi) water conservation through demand management is expected to eliminate the need for the
construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions.
The water quality of the Volkhov River, which is used as the source of water supply for the
city, is affected by organic and industrial pollution. Although water produced by the
treatment unit is of an acceptable quality, the treatment process used is not suited to certain
aspects of the pollution, such as its color. The backwash water used to clean filters is not.
recycled and the settled raw sludge is discharged into the sewage system.
The wastewater collection system suffers from root intrusion, which exacerbates groundwater
infiltration into sewers. Two unequally sized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) treat the
sewage flow from both parts of the city, located on either side of the watercourse. The
sludge-drying plant of the WWTP of VGVK is not in operation, due to the fact that some of
its equipment is unsuitable. Thickened sludge is diverted to sludge-drying beds, mainly
during winter.
Average wastewater quantities reaching the wastewater treatment plant are estimated to be in
the range of 20,000-25,000 m'/day, which is roughly equivalent to the quantity of potable
water supplied to users from the VGVK and the Railroad treatment plant. The wastewater is
treated by two independent lines, line 1 with a capacity of 5,000-7,000 m'/day for wastewater
flow from Volkhov 1, and line 2 with a capacity of 15,000 m3/day for wastewater flow from
Volkhov 2. This abnormally high volume of wastewater flow should be attributed to the high
infiltration rate of surface and groundwater into the wastewater system. The amount of
infiltration could be as high as 10,000-15,000 m3/day.
The high rate of infiltration implies that wastewater coming into the treatment plant is not
very concentrated. This view is confirmed by analysis of raw wastewater samples carried out
by VGVK wastewater treatment plant laboratory. Concentration of suspended solids (SS) is
high. The SS concentration which is normally equivalent in raw wastewater flows to 1 to 1.2
times the biological oxygen demand (BOD) concentration reaches 1.8 for Volkhov 1 and 2.8
in Volkhov 2. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) for Volkhov 2 as compared to BOD rates for


﻿the same sample is too high. This is supposed to be an indication that untreated industrial
effluent is being discharged into the wastewater collection system. The Aluminum Plant
could be responsible for this industrial pollution.
The plant is old but the quality of treated effluent indicate that treatment results are acceptable
with regard to European standard. It should be noted that no automatic samplers are available
at the plant, which makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the treatment process.
Review of potential environmental impacts. The components defined for the immediate
investment program involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure (pumping stations and
treatment plant) and construction of a booster station and water reservoir. These components
will not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since works will be executed either
within the premises of existing facilities or the rights of way of public street networks. The
project will not affect any known archeological or historical site. Any potentially significant
environmental impact due to implementation will be minimized using appropriate
construction methods.
In order to minimize impacts during implementation, contractors will be responsible, under
the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites pollution-free, returning sites to
their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and other work-related nuisances. They
will also be responsible for notification of the discovery of, or any problem related to,
previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5 million, will be reviewed by relevant
environmental authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their
delegate at the municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental
Expertise. Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those
components that require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This
procedure will be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well
as those in later phases of the project.
5.13 Vologda
In Vologda, two major components - the renovation of pumping stations (US$0.7 million)
and installation of water meters (US$0.7 million)- have been designed and bidding documents
prepared, corresponding to about 26 % of the total sub-project costs of US$5.6 million. The
remaining investment components will be selected with the help of technical assistance
consultants during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine
potential negative environmental impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed.
The project is expected to bring environmental, as well as health, benefits because: (i)
rehabilitation and improved operation and maintenance of the water treatment plants will
assure better drinking water quality, reduction in the use of chemicals and better handling of
water treatment residuals; (ii) rehabilitation of parts of the water supply network will reduce
water losses and decrease the volume of water intake; (iii) rehabilitation and improved
operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants will reduce the risk of spillage
of sewage, and assure improved quality of wastewater released after treatment and better
handling of solid and liquid waste; (iv) pumping stations rehabilitation will increase energy
efficiency of the Vodokanals' operations; (v) improvement in operations will Contribute to a
better day-to-day environmental management (treatment plants waste management, handling
of chemicals and toxic substance, improvement in the operation and maintenance of the


﻿sewerage network, including improved emergency response; more efficient use of
information from the existing water quality monitoring networks; better compliance with
environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions.
The wastewater treatment plant is located on the eastern side of the city near the small
watercourse of Dolokva, a confluent of the Vologda River. Treated effluent is discharged into
the watercourse, which drains an area of 6 lkn' between the railway line to Moscow and the
Vologda River. Raw wastewater effluent pumped by the main pumping stations, industries
and large enterprises are mixed at the inlet basin before flowing to the bar screening unit.
Treated effluent from secondary clarifiers is discharged to the Dolovka watercourse.
The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) has a site laboratory. Chemical and bacteriological
analyses are carried out regularly, at least once every day for suspended solids, chemical
oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, phosphates, nitrites, nitrates, ammonia, pH and
temperature. A sample of the average monthly value of these parameters for wastewater
treatment plant influent and effluent is shown in the following table:

The BOD load for tanks is 0.54 kgBOD/m3/day for the first lane and 0.32 kg BOD/m/day for
the second lane. The process can be considered as low load activated sludge only in the
second lane. The first lane could be considered as medium load activated sludge. Moreover,
retention time is very low (less than 3 hours during peak flows). The nitrification process is
not sufficient because of the diluted effluent, ammonium concentration at the plant inlet
should only be about 22 mg/I. About 50% is nitrified during biological process. Aeration is
therefore not sufficient.
In summary, the WWTP plant is rather old but the results of the analysis of the treated
effluent samples indicate that the quality of the treated water is in conformity with the EU
regulations.
On the other hand, there are several points, which require attention:
(i)    High quantity of heavy metals is in the effluent, due to the industrial
discharges.
(ii)   Diluted influent at the wastewater treatment plant
(iii)  Critical conditions of the equipment in general. Some of them are out of
order, others are constantly being repaired. Most of this equipment is far
beyond its useful life.
Pollution discharged through industrial activity is a major problem for the WWTP. First,
biological treatment could be inhibited due to the excessive concentration of toxic
compounds. Second, heavy metals are concentrated in the sludge, which prevents any use in
agriculture.
Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components (immediate and to be identified) will be to
improve environmental and health conditions in the city of Vologda. These components will
not raise any resettlement or property rights issues since they focus on the rehabilitation of
existing network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the premises of
existing facilities or the rights of way of public street networks. The project will not affect

﻿All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly

5.14 Votkinsk
In Votkinsk, two components - the renovation of the water treatment plant (US$0.7 million)
and improvement of pumping efficiency (US$0.7 million) - have been identified and bidding
documents prepared, corresponding to about 76 % of the total sub-project costs of US$2.1
million). The remaining investment components will be selected with the help of technical
assistance consultants during the early stages of project implementation.
For the purpose of OP 4.01 on Environmental Impact Assessment, the project has been
classified as Category B, which requires a limited environmental review to determine

environmental regulations) ; and (vi) water conservation through demand management is
expected to eliminate the need for the construction of new capacity for years to come.
Current Environmental Conditions.
Wastewater from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Votkinsk is discharged into the
Oka River. Oka is a tributary of the Volga River and rises approximately 50 km south of
Votkinsk. The total length of the river is 1480 km and covers a drainage area of 239 900 kmn.
According to VVK the average flow in the river is 2 m'/s. The river is mainly surrounded by
agricultural land and passes about 60 km south of Moscow on its way to the Volga River.
The Oka River is an eutrophicated river with high amounts of nutritive salts and oxygen
consuming material. After the discharge from the wastewater treatment plant these levels are
exceeded almost ten times in the case of phosphorus and about 3 times for nitrogen. Table
5.14.1 presents water quality data for the Oka river before and after effluent discharges from
the WWTP. According to the measurements, the impact of the wastewater treatment plant
discharges on the river is significant. The nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are four
times higher downstream the treatment plant and the BOD5 concentration has doubled. There
are no measurements of bacterial discharges and information on heavy metals is limited.


﻿Table 5.14.2 presents a summary of the WWTP performance in 1996. The discharge of
BOD5 and suspended solids is low, and even though it exceeds the national effluent standard,
it does not exceed international standards. Nitrogen and phosphorus removal are good. Most
of the heavy metals are reduced by approximately 70% and beyond the effluent limits.
However, the reduction of heavy metals in the effluent implies an accumulation in the sludge.

Review of potential environmental impacts. As the components defined for the
immediate investment program only involve the reconstruction of existing infrastructure, any
potentially significant environmental impact will be minimized using appropriate construction
methods. The ultimate objective of all components (immediate or to be defined) will be to
improve environmental and health conditions in the city of Oryol. These components will not
raise any resettlement or property rights issues since it focuses on rehabilitation of existing
network and facilities. All work will be executed either within the premises of existing
facilities or the rights of way of public street networks. The project will not affect any known
archeological or historical site.


﻿In order to minimize impacts during implementation of immediate investments, contractors
will be responsible, under the clauses of the bidding documents, for keeping work sites
pollution-free, returning sites to their original conditions, and minimizing dust, noise and
other work-related nuisances. They will also be responsible for notification of the discovery
of, or any problem related to, previously unknown historical sites.
All components with potentially significant negative environmental impacts, and particularly
those with a construction budget over US$0.5M, will be reviewed by relevant environmental
authorities (either the Department of State Ecological Expertise or their delegate at the
municipal level) to ensure compliance with the Russian Law on Environmental Expertise.
Review and approval of projects that require this review, particularly those components that
require an EIA (OVOS), will take place prior to initiating construction. This procedure will
be followed for all components in the immediate group of investments, as well as those in
later phases of the project.
