{"cdata!": "The main objective of the Higher\n            Education Rationalization Project is the formulation and\n            adoption of a long-term higher education strategy geared to\n            the training needs of the economy.  In addition, and while\n            awaiting adoption of this strategy, the project supports\n            independently justified, high priority measures.  These\n            measures are justified by the urgent need to halt a very\n            serious decline in management so that existing scarce\n            resources are used more efficiently, and in educational\n            quality so that minimum acceptable teaching/learning\n            standards are at least maintained.  To meet these\n            objectives, the project comprises:  (a) improving\n            administration/management; (b) upgrading teaching/learning;\n            (c) strategy development; and (d) priority teaching\n            materials.  The project would benefit the whole higher\n            education sub-sector, including the three Universities of\n            Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Kisangani together with the 32\n            Technical and Pedagogical Institutes and the Higher\n            Education Ministry through strengthened statistics and\n            analysis for improved management, financial procedures and\n            strategy development, in addition to training of key\n            administrators and teachers."}, "docdt": "1987-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
