PROJECT SUMMARY
Bomffwemr               Turkiy* Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB), Sinai Yatirim ve
Kredi Bankasi (SYKB), and tAe Government of Turkey
(GOT).
Guwantw.                Republic of Turkey (for the loans to TSBK and SYKB).
Private export-oriented industries.
Amount:                 US$ 300 million equivalent consisting of:  (i) US$ 150
million for TSKB; (ii) US$ 50 million for SYXB; and
(iii) US$ 100 million for the GOT.
Terms:                  TSKB and SYKB will repay the Bank on the basis of
composite amortization schedules of subloans. The loan
to GOT will be on stLadard IBRD terms.
2*lending Terms:        The sub-borrower will be given an option to borrow
either in local or foreign currency. In case of the
loans denominated in TL, the sub-borrower will be able
to borrow at a fixed interest rate specified under the
Foreign Exchange Insurance Scheme (FERIS) at the time
of borrowing. The interest rate under FERIS is
currently 34% p.a. including a spread of 41 for the
participating banks. In case of the loans denominated
in foreign currency, the participating banks will
on-lend at the Bank rate plus a cpread of up to 4%
p.a.. The maturity of the subloans would normally not
exceed ten years including a maximum grace period of
three years.
Proisot Descrpton       The proposed Project is designed to support Turkey's
drive for exoanding exports and to improve the policy
and institutional framework relevant to export
finance. It consists of a credit component of US$
298.5 million for on-lending by the participating banks
and a technical assistance component of US$ 1.5
million. The credit component will be implemented
through the participating banks, which will include two
private development banks (TSKB and S m ), and several
major private and public commercial banks. TSKB and
SYKB will be the direct borrowers of the Bank funds.



- il -
The coumercial banks will have access to the Bank loan
through TSRB and 8YKB, which would perform intermediary
functions on behalf of the Government for a fee 0.5%
p.a. All sub-projects financed under the Project would
be expected to meet the agreed target of exporting at
least 201 of incremental production within 3 to 5 years
after start-up. The participating banks will be
responsible for appraising investment projects in
accordance with agreed procedures, and the appraisals
will include calculation of the internal financial and
economic rate of return. A minimum economic rate of
return of 151 in real terms would be required for all
sub-projects financed under the Project. The appraisal
reports will also include a statement on the
environmental impact of the sub-project and measures
which would be taken to comply with enviromental
regulations in Turkey. The Project includes a
technical assistance component of US$ 1.5 million for
strengthening the Export Promotion Research Center (US$
500,000), assisting the Ex-Im Bank in setting up a
trade and export credit information system (US$
900,000), and US $100,000 for carrying out a study of
credit delivery system for industrial finance.
Goods and services financed under the Project will be
subject to standard procurement procedures for projects
involving financial intermediaries. Contracts below
US$ 2.5 million will be procured through domestic and
international shopping with at least three quotations.
For contracts above US$ 2.5 million, Limited
International Bidding wiAI be required. The proceeds
of the Bank funds will be disbursed at the rate of 1001
of the foreign exchange cost for machinery and
equipFent of eligible sub-loans and 60t of locally
procured goods, the estimated foreign exchange cost.
Consultants will be employed in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. Special accounts will be set up
under each loan to facilitate disbursements.

INDUSTRIAL EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
IL BACKGROUND
1.01     Until 1980, Turkey's industrial development strategy was mainly based
on capital intensive import substitution in basic industries. The main policy
instruments employed were large investments in State Economic Enterprises and
high levels of protection to both public and private industries. These
policies, combined with an overvalued exchange rate, led to an inward-oriented
industrial sector. The industrial sector was hard hit by the oil crisis in
the 1970s and by the end of 1970s was facing a severe foreign exchange
crisis. Industrial production and capacity utilization declined sharply,
inflation surged, and private industrial investment tumbled. To reverse the
trend, starting in 1980 the Government adopted a new economic strategy aimed
at stabilizing the economy, placing greater reliance on market forces and
encouraging private industrial investment. The main elements of the new
strategy were: (i) competitive exchange rate; (ii) import liberalization;
(iii) export promotion; (iv) deregulation of prices; (v) public sector
reforms; and (vi) deregulation of the financial system. These policy
initiatives were supported by five SALs, one Financial Sector Adjustment Loan,
and borrowings from the IMF. The impact of these policy measures on the
economy, industrial sector, exports, and private industrial investment has on
the whole been very positive. Between 1980-85, GDP increased at an annual
rate of 4.42. Manufactured exports grew by almost 50% p.a. during the same
period which more than doubled industry's share in total merchandise exports,
from 36% to 752. The average capacity utilization rate increased from 522 in
1 80 to 73S in 1985. Private manufacturing investment rebounded from the
depressed level in 1980 and has increased at an annual rate of 6% in real term
since 1983. The inflation rate declined from l07% in 1980 to 30% in 1986.
1.02     The export growth during the 1980-86 period was achieved mainly
through the increase in teie capacity utilization and modest investment in
improving the quality of the Turkish products. Thus far, exports are highly
concentrated with five countries (West Germany, Italy, Iran, Iraq, and U.S.A.)
accounting for about 50% of Turkey's exports. Also, about half of Turkey's
exports are consumer goods (mainly textile, leather, and foods), which are
likely to be adversely affected by the trend towards increasing protection in
the major importing countries. Moreover, the buoyant local demand has
increasingly absorbed a larger share of production. Turkey, therefore, would
need to increase its export capacity, diversify markets and products to reduce
its vulnerability, and make its exports more competitive by giving exporters



sufficient incentives co compete in international markets. The proposed
Project aims at supporting the Government in sustaining its export drive and
improving the efficiency of the financial system especially for channelling
investment credit. The proposed Project consists of two components: (i) a
credit component of US$ 298.5 million; and (ii) a technical assistance
component of US$ 1.5 million. The credit component is targeted at private
export-oriented industries. The credit will be channelled through the two
private development banks (Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB) and Sinai
Yatirim ve Kredit Bankasi (SYKB)) and the commercial banking system which will
have access to funds through TSKB and SYKB which would perform intermediary
functions on behalf of the Government. Investors in Turkey will have an
option for the first time to obtain a complete financial packago from a single
financial institution. The participation of commercial banks will enhance
competition which in turn would improve the efficiency of the system. To
enable TSKB and SYKB to compete effectively, the proposed Project includes
operational diversification programs for TSKB and SYKB which will allow them
to undertake all types of banking activities. Financial restructuring of TSKB
has been carried out to a large extent and will be completed by September 30,
1988. The Project would support GOT's plan to improve policy frameworks for
export finance, export credit and insurance (para 2.14). The technical
assistance component of the Project aims at strengthening export promotion by
improving access to information on export market through the newly created
Export-Credit Bank of Turkey (Ex-Im Bank) and technical assistance to small
aud medium-sized exporters through the Export Promotion Research Center
(IGEME).
L T    MANUFACTURING SECTOR AND POLICIES
A. Macro-economic Developments in the 80s
2.01     Until 1980, Turkey's industrial development strategy was principally
based on import substitution in basic industries. The main policy instruments
employed were large investments in State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) and
generous tax and financial incentives combined with high levels of protection
which benefited both the public and private sectors. These policies led to
rapid industrial growth which increased industry's share in GDP from 13% to
18Z between 1963-77. However, these policies also gave rise to some serious
weaknesses, namely extreme anti-trade bias and lack of competitiveness, high
capital-intensity, high import dependence particularly for intermediate and
capital goods and very low efficiency, particularly in SEEs. These weaknesses
became manifest following the first oil crisis in 1974 which resulted in a
large baleance of payments deficit in 1977-78 and were exacerbated by the
second oil crisis in 1979. Industrial growth declined sharply, capacity
utilization rates fell to record low levels and inflation surged. Turkey also
faced a severe balance of payment problems which led to a loss of
creditworthiness in international financial markets.



-3-
Polir Changes Since 1980
2.02     In response to this severe crisis, in early 1.980, the Government
announced a new economic strategy aimed at stabilizing the economy, placing
greater reliance on market forces than on quantitative controls and encou-
raging the efficient growth of the private sector. To implement this
strategy, the Government initiated wide ranging reforms involving a number
of key policy areas: exchange rate (large nominal devaluation followed by
continuous adjustment to maintain a competitive e:change rate); import
liberalization (elimination of the quota list, shifting imports to the more
liberalized list; reduction in guarantee deposits, simplification of
regulations and centralization of import administration); export promotion
(payment of indirect tax rebates, export credit, priority access to foreign
exchanges for duty-free imports of inputs, relaxation of export price
concrols and procedural simplifications); price liberalization (deregulation
of prices; abolition of price committee and fund; reduction of subsidies);
public sector reforms (freeing most SEEs from price controls, rationalizing
public investment); financial sector policies (deregulation of interest
rates, reduction of selective credits, capital market legislation); monetary
policies (control of monetary aggregates to curb inflation); and tax reforms
(to increase resource mobilization and restructure investment incentives to
promote exports).
2.03     Since 1980, in the context of various Bank-assisted operations,
specifically five SALs, one Financial Sector Adjustment Loan, one
Agriculture Adjustment Loan, and borrowings from the IMF, these policy
initiatives have been further deepened in all areas, although the emphasis
has varied in response to economic performance. The thrust of the reforms
initiated in 1980 was maintained until 1982 without significant changes. In
1983, the failure to implement effective monetary and fiscal policies led to
negative real interest rates. The reform program entered a new phase from
early 1984 with greater emphasis on real exchange rate devaluations, rapid
import liberalization, maintenance of positive real interest rates for
deposits and SEE reforms to improve efficiency and financial viability.
Private sector investments were also supported through a number of generous
investments incentives while SSE investment in manufacturing were cut back
sharply.
B. Impact on Manufacturing Industry
2.04     The manufacturing sector's response to the Government's
stabilization and liberalization program has been impressive. Annex 1
summarizes the key aggregate performance indicators for the manufacturing
sector as a whole. The adoption of a realistic exchange rate and
complementary export promotion policies stimulated manufactured export
growth to a remarkable extent. Between 1980-1986, manufactured exports grew
by almost 31% per year which doubled industry's share in total merchandise
exports from 36% to 75% (para 2.07). As a result, in spite of the
depressed domestic market, manufacturing emerged as a lead sector growing at
an annual average rate of 8.0% (compared to the average GDP growth rate of



- 4 -
4.4% p.a.). This high growth increased its share in GDP from 21.31 to 25.0%
durint this period. The average capacity utilization rate in manufacturing
improved from 52% in 1980 to 751 in 1986. Most of the export growth has
taken place in the private sector reflecting its more positive response to
the adjustment policies of the Government. Manufacturing output, however,
recorded an impressive growth of over 10% due to buoyant domestic demand.
2.05     The improvement in manufacturing exports and output was not
accompanied, at least until 1983, by an increase in private investment.
Private manufacturirg investment, which had grown steadily at an average
annual rate of 11.6 percent during 1972-1977, fell sharply during the
economic crisis period 1978-1981, and remained stagnant, thereafter, until
1983. Lower capacity utilizatiod, weak domestic demand and the very high
cost and limited availability of investment funds have been the major
deterrents (Chapter III). Public investment in the manufacturing sector,
grew considerably over the entire period 1972-1980 (with the exception of
1978). Following the adoption of the new policy package in 1980, public
investment in manufacturing has been cut back. Preliminary estimates by the
State Planning Organization (SPO) for 1984-86 indicate that private
industrial investment has increased at an annual rate of 62 p.a. in real
terms. Furthermore, the share of private manufacturing investment in total
investment rose from 41% in 1980 to 66.22 in 1986.
2.06     The revival of private manufacturing investment can be attributed
to higher capacity utilization and improved profitability of firms.
Improved profitability, in particular, may have enabled firms to utilize the
generous investment tax allowancez and undertake investment programs
especially balancing, and modernization, despite the high and rising cost of
borrowing in the past few years. The eight sub-sectors with the highest
investment growth rates (in descending order) are rubber and plastics (941),
leather products (771), measuring instruments (58%), electrical machinery
(341), textiles (14b', paper and printing (9%), food and beverages (41), and
non-electrical machinery (3%). Of these eight, seven have above average
export growth, five have above average capacity utilization and four have
above average output growth. It appears that consumer goods have increased
their share in total fixed manufacturing investment primarily at the expense*
of intermediate goods.
Manufactu i  Export Performance and Prospects
2.07     The growth in manufacturing export from Turkey has b3en most
impressive. Annex 2 shows Turkey's composition of commodity exports for
1980-87 period. Total exports increased from US$ 2.9 billion in 1980 to US$
7.5 billion in 1986, an annual compounded growth rate of 17%. Manufacturing
exports rose from US$ 1.1 billion in 1980 to US$ 5.3 billion in 1986, or an
annual increase of 311. The growth rate between 1980-85 was much higher at
491. The decline in exports during 1986 was due to a decline in oil
revenues especially in Iran and Iraq (see para 2.08). The decline in
exports to Iran and Iraq has been offset, to a large extent, by an increase
in exports to EEC countries. During the first ten months cf 1987,



- 5 -
manufacturing expc,rts increased by 442 in dollar terms over the same period
last year. Table i below shows export performance by sub-sector during
1980-86 period. in 1980, three sub-sectors (textiles, agriculture processed
products, and chemicals) accounted for about 702 of the total exports.
Their shares declined to about 542 in 1986 reflecting rapid growth in other
sectors. The share of textiles declined from 42% in 1980 to 34.82 in 1986.
It is interesting to note that the fastest export growth during the period
has been in new miscellaneous sub-sectors which is classified as others.
The three other fastest growth sub-sectors are: iron and steel(692), metal
products and machinery (442), hides and leather products (442). The growth
of the textile sector has slowed markedly and the increase was ol.y 32 in
1986, reflecting the increased protectionism in the importing countries.

2.08     Turkey exported to more than 100 countries in 1986.  Exports to the
OECD countries accounted for 57.6% of total exports followed by Middle
Eastern Countries (30.92) and others (11.52). Turkey's largest trading



- 6 -
partner was Germany (19.42), followed by Italy (7.8S), Iran (7.62), Iraq
(7.4X) and U.S.A. (7.4X). Annex 3 shows Turkey's exports by destination for
1980, 1985, and 1986. During the period, Turkey experienced export growth
in pract ially all markets. However, exports to the Middle Eastern
Countries especially Iran and Iraq increased dramatically from US$ 220
million in 1980 to about US$ 2.0 billion in 1985. In 1986, exports to these
two countries tumbled and amounted to only US$ 1.1 billion. Both countries
are in arrears in payments to Turkey and are experiencing financial
difficulties. Negotiations are at an advanced stage to solve these problems
and the prospects are reasonably good. However, the default has discouraged
Turkish exporters from selling in these markets. Exports to EECs were
basically flat in 1986. This was due both to strong local demands in
Turkey, as well as increasing competition in traditional exports, i.e.
textiles and leather products and quota problems.
2.09     The strength of the export recovery in 1987 and beyond is a crucial
determinant of the pace and nature of Turkey's economic prospects. In 1986,
merchandise exports accounted for only 13% of GNP, which is very low in
comparison to the East Asian countries which are comparable to Turkey in
terms of per cap'ta income and stage of development. Therefore, there is
potential for increasing exports from Turkey, provided that other factors
are put in place. The Government plans to take several policy measures in
the areas of export finance and insurance, and export promotion to
accelerate exports (para 2.14).
2.10     The current situation in Turkey suggests a continuation of
favorable demand conditions in manufacturing. Manufacturing output grew by
some 10 in 1986, which increased the overall average capacity utilization
rate in manufacturing closer to 75%.  Investmen. demand is likely to
increase sharply in sub-sectors which have both high capacity utilization
rates and strong export performance. These include textiles and garments,
basic chemicals, fabricated metal products, electrical machinery, paper,
food and beverages, wooden furniture, and non-electrical machinery of which
the first five will probably be the major claimants on available funds.
Barring any major economic setbacks, private industrial investment should
grow over the next few years at least at a modest rate of 61 p.a. in real
term from the 1986 level of TL 1,176 billion (US$ 1,57 billion). On this
basis the projected level of private industrial investment for 1987-89
period would be about US$ 5.0 billion, or US$ 1.67 billion p.a. Assuming an
average debt-equity ratio of 1:1, the demand for loan funds would be roughly
US$ 2.5 billion. The proposed Bank loans of US$ 300 million would finance
only 61 of the private manufacturing investment or 12X of the borroving
requirement of the private industry during the period.
C. Poliey Issues Affecting the Future Development of Private idus
2.11     Although the stabilization and liberalization program pursued by
the Government over the past five yesrs has achieved significant reduction
of distortions in factor and product markets, and the easing of
administrative and regulatory barriers, additional policy measures are



- 7 -
needed to sustain the growth in private investment and exports. The private
sector manufacturing investment study by the Bank -' has identified
several areas needing further policy reforms which should help stimulate
private sector investment and exports. These policy aspects are summarized
below.
Trade Polivy Isues
2.12     Export growth haa been fostered by a combination of direct
incentive to exporters, import liberalization and real exchange rate
devaluation. These policies have substantially reduced the anti-export bias
which characterized the policy in the 70s. Since 1985, however, there has
been a gradual reduction in the level of direct export subsidies because of
pressure from GATT and bilateral trading partners. In order to ensure that
the reduction in direct export subsidies does not worsen the competitive
position of exports relative to the non-traded goods sectors and to import
substitutes, exchange rate adjustments must be accompanied by greater import
liberalization. An examination of the Government's import policy in 1986,
however, indicates that import protection has marginally increased. Clearly
the current levy policy (levies are ad hoc ad valorem fees charged on top of
import duties) has introduced some distortions in the import liberalization
program and needs to be corrected. The private sector manufacturing
investment study (c.f.) makes the following recommendations on the trade
regime: (a) elimination of export tax rebates by 1988-89; (b) maintenance
of real exchange rate, sufficient to offset the decline in direct export
incentives; and (c) rationalization of the import levy list. The findings
of the report (para 2.12) were discussed with the Government in October
1987. It is likely that the Government would take these recommendations
into consideration in formulating its economic program, which is expected to
be announced in April 1988.
Export Finance, Export Credt Insurance, and Export Promotion
2.13     Turkey has performed very well in expanding exports.  However, the
bulk of the increase in exports was achieved by utilizing the existing
capacity and selling in less demanding markets. To sustain its export growth
Turkey would need to take additional steps to assist the export sector. The
Government is aware of this and has taken a number of concrete measures to
promote exports. These measures include: conversion of the State Investment
Bank (DYB) into the Export-Credit Bank of Turkey (Turk Ex-Im Bank) and the
introduction of the Export Finance Scheme on December 1, 1986.  However,
several additional measures would need to be taken to improve the
institutional framework for export.  Some of the measures, which would be
useful in promoting expotts and making Turkish exporters more competitive, are
discussed below:
(i)  Terms of Export Finance.  The maximum term which is availaUle to the
Turkish exporters is presently 4 months based on a confirmed
1/  Turkey:  Private Manufacturing:  Assessmernt of the Impact of Past Policies
and Future Adjustment Needs. Report No. 6684-TU, July 21, 1987.



irrevocable letter of credit. There is no deferred payment
facility available. Turkish exporters are therefore at a
comparative disadvantage vis-a-vis exporters from other developing
countries such as Korea, Brazil, and India. Most capital goods are
generally purchased on a deferred credit basis. Also, the export
cycle of all products is not as short as that of garments and
textiles. Therefore, the relaxation in terms would be desirable;
(ii)  Eligibility Criteria.  The present eligibility criteria of
requiring a proven track record of export for the last three years
with a minimum annual export of US$ 1.0 million precludes all new
exporters. For Turkey to be able to inLrease and diversify exports
it needs freer entry by relaxing the eligibility criteria. Any
bona-fide exporter with a confirmed irrevocable letter of credit
should have access to the rediscounting faciiity, and the present
financing limit of 50% should be increased, perhaps to 80% of the
face value of the letter of credit;
(iii)  Refinancing Procedures.  Under the present system each transaction
requires the approval of the Central Bank.  While the system aims
at preventing abuses, it is probably too restrictive, and should be
simplified.  The Central Bank should consider simplifying the
procedures by delegating approval authority to the commercial banks
within an agreed limit.  The limit can be established based on an
application by the interested banks. The banks will then be
responsible for monitoring and reporting to the Central Bank.
Alternatively, the Central Bank may consider delegating this
authority to its twenty three branches;
(iv)  Export Investment (Project Finance).  Export growth in the recent
past has been achieved mainly through the increase in capacity
utilization. As a number of industries are now operating at a high
capacity level Turkey would need to create additional export
capacity. Given the very high level of real interest rates, the
Government would need to take some corrective measures to make
export-oriented investment more attractive. One way to achieve this
would be to increase the refinancing percentage for export-oriented
projects. Another way of increasing investment in export-criented
enterprises would be to increase the outlets which can provide
long-term finance for investors. TSKB and SYKB are presently the
two major sources of foreign exchange term finance in Turkey. They
have played a key role and with the recent improvements in their
operations would be able to continue to play an active role.
However, Turkey has a well developed commercial banking system with
a large network of branches. In a number of developing countries
(India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Korea), the commercial banks have
become active in project finance in recent years. There is also a
general trend toward one stop banking. The role of the commercial
banks in project finance in Turkey has been constrained because of
the volatility in interest rates and lack of long-term resources.
Under the proposed Project, the interested and eligible commercial



- 9 -
banks would hsve access to the Bank funds through the
Administrating Institutions (TSKB and SYKB). An allocation of US$
100,000 is also made under the technical assistance component of
the Project, to carry out a study of the credit delivery system for
industry (para 4.05);
(v) Exp'rt Credit Insurance and Guarante_. The need for such a
facility for a country like Turkey has been established in several
previous studies. Such a facility is expected to be provided by
the Turk Ex-Im Bank. In several countries the export credit
insurance function is carried out by a separate legal entity in
order to protect the soundness of the institution. In case of the
Turk Ex-Im Bank, the scheme could be operated by the same staff; arid
(vi) Export Promotion-IGEME. The Government plans to strengthen IGEME
and make it more responsive to the needs of exporters. However, a
number of concrete measures are needed to make IGEME a more
effective and responsive institution, of which the most important
is the need for a greater involvement of pri-rate sector exporters
in IGEME's overall management (para 4.03).
2.14     The Government is in agreement with the above-mentioned findings
and recommendations, and the Central Bank is in the process of revising its
rediscounting scheme for export finance. The revision in the scheme is
expected to be extensive and cover the aspects which are discussed above. A
draft of the revised scheme is expected to be ready by March 1988. Also, an
agreement has been reached with GOT that only eligible commercial banks
would have access to Bank funds through the Administrating Inst*tution (para
4.15).
D. The Bank's Strategy in the Manufaeturng Sector
2.15     Revival of private investment in the manufacturing sector and more
importantly its efficient allocation will depend on the ability of the
Government to create and maintain a positive and stable economic environment
in which policy distortions are minimized so Lizat market forces can operate
efficiently. In particular, distortions involving the exchange rate,
interest rates, and prices in factor and product markets as well as policy
biases towards preferred market sectors, regions and type of firms, need to
be minimized, and eventually eliminated. The Bank's strategy should be to
continue to assist the Government to follow through with its program of
policy reform aimed at creating a competitive economic environment in which
market forces are the principal determinants of investment behavior.
2.16     The Bank has recently completed two studies which analyze policy
issues relating to industry. The first entitled "Fiscal Policy and Tax
Reform" examines inter alia the incidence of tax incentives on capital
investment. The second "Adjusting Public Investment" analyzes the level and
composition of public investment and recommends programs for the
rationalization of public investment. The latter study also recommends
institutional reforms to improve appraisal, monitoring and implementation of
public investment. A third study on private sector manufacturing investment



- 10 -
(c.f.) has identified several issues involving investment incentivec, trade
policy and industrial finance which have been briefly summarized in para
2.12. In addition to the above) a study on the agro-industries is under
preparation and its findings are expected to be discussed with the
Government in late 1987.
2.17     Two projects of immediate relevance to the manufacturing sector
have been included in the Bank's lending operations. The first, the Project
under consideration, Industrial Export Development Project (IEDP), is
designed to increase industrial exports from Turkey. The non-availability
of long-term finance at a reasonable cost is a major impediment to private
industrial investment (Chapter III) in Turkey. A large share of the
resources mobilized by the financial system has thus far been used to
finance the budget deficit through larger holding of government bonds by
financial institutions. These bonds carry a high interest rate of up to 501
tax free, making them more attractive to the banks than providing term loans
to the private industries. The availability of long-term funds under the
Project will, therefore, be very important in terms of creating additional
capacity in efficient export-oriented industries. The proposed Project,
will also support the Government's plan of improving the framework for
export finance and export insurance and intensifying export marketing
efforts. To increase the flow of credit for private investment, the
Government, by June 1988, would consider the merit of introducing a system
of floating interest rates (para 3.16). If a reasonable reference rate
could be devised, this new instrument may encourage commercial banks to
provide some of the longer-term investment finance from their own
resources. The proposed Project will be the first Bank-assisted project in
Turkey in which the commercial banks are used as the vehicle to reach
private industries. This should lead to a more efficient system of
providing industrial credit to the private industry. Moreover, the Project
will play an important role in assisting TSKB, the principal development
bank, in its financial restructuring and operational diversification.
2.18     The causes of high non-preferential interest tates, the issue of
crowding-out (para 3.16), and constraints affecting the development of
capital and financial markets would be discussed with the Government in
connection with the proposed second FSAL. The Bank is also planning an
agro-industry project based on the study noted in para 2.16. Since
agro-industries have a large export potential, the proposed agro-industry
project will complement the IEDP in furthering Turkey's export drive.
m. THE FIXANCIAL SECTOR
A. The Structure of the Fincial System
3.01     The financial system of Turkey consists of:  (i) the Central Bank;
(ii) the specialized public banks; (iii) the domestic and foreign c3mmercial
banks; (iv) the development banks; (v) the social security system, (vi)
insurance companies and credit cooperatives; and (vii) the securities



- 11 -
market.  The banking systo,m dominates the financial system, with a share in
total financial assets of approximately 90. The volurie of securities held
outside the banking system has grown significantly, but is still marginal.
3.02     At the end of 1986 there were 13 public banks l', 2 private
development banks and 40 private commercial banks, of which 24 domestic
banks and 16 foreign banks. The total number of bank branches was 6,372 and
the number of people employed in the banking system was 151,200. The public
banks were established under special law and tend to be fairly specialized
in their lending operations. For instance, the Agricultural Credit Bank
(TCZB), the largest bank in Turkey, specializes in agriculture lending but
it is also active in commeroial banking; Halk Bank (HB) tends to specialize
in lending to small- and medium-scale enterprises. Many public banks have a
large network of branches and mobilize a substantial volume of resources
through deposits. The two private development banks (TSKB and SYKB) cater
exclusively to financing of the private sector. TSKB and SYKB have been the
major sources of term finance and until recently relied mainly on foreign
sources for loanable funds. In addition to the two development banks, there
are two public institutions which also specialize in investment financing.
The State Investment Bank (DYB)2' and DESIYAB, which provides financing to
projects in less developed areas. The latter's resources come mostly from
transfers of Turkish workers abroad.
3.03;    The number of private domestic commercial banks has not changed
since 1978, while the number of foreign commercial banks has increased from
4 to 16. The entry of foreign banks has introduced several new techniques
into the financial system - for instance they were active in interbank
operations before the Central Bank provided the institutional support for
the development of an interbank market, and have also introduced the
know-how in securities trading. Practically all of the new foreign banks
have limited their participation to a single branch in Istanbul and have
concentrated on providing trade finance to prime Turkish companies, which
does not require domestic currency funding and is profitable.
3.04     The relative shares of the four bank groups in total bank assets
has not change significantly between 1980 and 1986. The public banks
account for more than half of total banks' assets. TCZB is the largest
financial institution in Turkey and accounted for 24.5% of the total assets
of the banking system at the end of 1986. The participation of foreign
banks has remained very reduced despite the entry of twelve foreign banks
during this period. The Turkish banking system has remained highly
concentrated. The share of the four largest banks (TCZB and three private
banks) in total banks' assets is around 52X. Within the group of private
banks, the share of the four largest banks-' is even higher.

B. The Size of the Financid System
3.05     The size of the financial system and trends in its growtht are
summarized in Table 2. The ratios of M2 and M2X (including foreign exchanige
deposits) to GDP reached 23.3% and 28.42, respectively, at the end of 1986,
which shows considerable improvements in resource mobilization comparedl to
the depressed period of the late 1970s. Such rapid increase in financial
depth after 1980 is explained by the macro-financial reforms initiated in
1980, which comprised the maintenance of real interest rates on deposits,
the reduction of taxes and charges on financial intermediation and lower
inflation i'. The progress in resource mobilization is not fully
reflected in Table 2. In addition to the larger mobilization of banks'
deposits, several new financial instruments, such as corporate bonds and
more recently, commercial paper, have been introduced. The government-issued
revenue sharing certificates were very well received and some of the banks
have been allowed to manage mutual funds. There has also been some revivat
in stock market activities. However, the stock market is presently dormant
and is not likely to become a major scuirce of funds for the corporate sector
for quite some time (para 3.15).
3.06     Although the Turkish financial system has performed well since
1980, it is still very shallow by comparison with other countries at a
similar stage of development. The ratio of M2 to GDP in Turkey is 23%,
compared to the average of 36% for developing countries at similar income

levels. Also, the ratio of broad money to GDP (including the foreign
exchange deposits) is only slightly higher than the levels achieved in the
early 1970s. These two factors suggest that there is still ample scope for
further progress in resource mobilization.
C. Credit Growth and Allocation
3.07     Although the growth of credit is clearly related to deposit
mobilization, such correlation is not always direct, as shown in Table 2.
Before 1980 credit as a percentage of GDP decreased much faster than broad
money. However, between 1980 and 1983, credit grew less than broad money.
In 1984, both the ratios of credit and money to GDP fell. In 1985 there was
a recovery in deposit mobilization which was not translated into increases
in real credit; on the contrary, the ratio of credit to GDP kept declining.
Finally, during 1986 credit grew much faster than broad money.
3.08     There are other important factors, in addition to deposit
mobilization by the banking system, which explain the behavior of credit
duriig this period. First, increases (decreases) in external borrowing by
Turk2sh banks result in increases (decreases) in credit for the same level
of deposits.  The sharp decrease in the ratio of credit to GDP after 1977 is
explainied not only by the reduction in the real stock of deposits but also
by the strong decrease in external borrowing by Turkish banks - external
financing was substantially curtailed ae the country's creditworthiness fell
during that period.  During 1986 the reverse was truc.  increased borrowing
from at oad helped explain why the credit stock grew so rapidly during that
year. Second, variations in reserve and liquidity requirements also explain
different rates of growth between credit and money. For instance, the
reductiorn in reserve requirements in 1985-86 also contributed to the higher
growth of credit during 1986. Finally, larger voluntary holdings of
government bonds by Turkish banks resulted in a decrease in the growth of
credit for the same growth of banks' liabilities. The stocks of government
bonds held by Turkish banks have increased rapidly since 1984, due to the
high net of tax returns offered on these bonds. This factor depressed the
growth of credit in 1984 and 1985 and prevented an even higher growth of
credit during 1986.
3.09     Regarding credit growth and allocation, the overall picture is
mixed. The reduced role of the Central Bank in the financial intermediation
process (Annex 4) has helped to reduce the distortions in credit allocation
generated by preferential credits. Credit allocation tends to improve as
the banks' lending capacity increases (due to lower -eserve requirements)
and more credit flows to activities with high returns. However, the
increased lending capacity of Turkish banks did not lead to e proportionate
increase in credit to the private sector due to the increase in the holdings
of Government bonds (Annex 5). The Government bonds carry a high interest
rate of up to 50% tax free, which makes it more attractive for the banks to
invest in the bonds rather than to make loans to private sector. The ratio
of public domestic debt to GDP has increased from 3.3% in 1984 to 5.3% in
1986.

D. Idustrial FiQanwe
3.10 Although the volume of credit to the private sector has increased in
real terms, medium- and long-term industrial credit has remained scarce.
Tenm finance in Turkey is provided mainly by investment and development
banks, which until recently relied heavily on multilateral and bilateral
institutions, and Central Bank's rediscounts for their resources. Domestic
resource mobilization by these institutions has been limited. The deposit
money banks provide medium- and long-term loans to the extent that these
loans are partly rediscounted by the Central Bank (the rediscounted share
varies from 50% to 80b of the loan). Medium- and long-term industrial loans
financed entirely out of the deposit money banks' own resources are very
limited. With the availability of long-term refinancing resources under the
proposed Project, the commercial banks are expected to play a more important
role in this area.
3.11     Table 3 shows data on total industrial credit, as well as estimates
of medium- and long-term industrial credit in Turkey. The table suggests
taat the growth in long-term credit has generally been stagnant for three
reasons: (1) Central Bank rediscounts have not increased in real terms; (2)
development banks have experienced difficulties in mobilizing domestic
resources and their utilixation of foreign credits were constrained by the
absence of a Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS); I' and (3)
deposit money banks have been unwilling to provide long-term loans from
their own resources as they do not have long-term resources.

3.12     In Turkey, development finance has remained overly dependent on the
Central Bank's rediscounts and foreign sources. As mentioned above, real
1/    FERIS was introduced in March 1985 as an insurance scheme operated by
the Central Bank of Turkey.

interest rates on term loans have remained very high, discouraging firms
from borrowing from financial institutions at non-preferential rates.
Although financial expeases are tax deductible in full, the effective cost
is still hign. As a result, the demand for Central Bank's rediscounts and
FERIS loans is strong. The interest rates on these loans are more
reasonable -- 34% (322 + 2% commission p.a.), compared to 60% in the case of
the commercial bank lending rates for working capital loans. As the
commercial banks do not have access to long-term deposits at a reasonable
cost, they have not been able to carry out term transformation as in other
countries. As the supply of funds from the Central Bank for rediscounting
is limited, the term credit is rationed and borrowers have to wait several
months for these loans. This, in turn, has inhibited private industrial
investment.  To carry out necessary investments the private sector has
increasingly resorted to equity financing in recent years. The availability
of long-term investment funds under the Project will therefore have a major
impact on private investment.
E. Finacia Markets
3.13     There has been considerable progress in the area of money and
capital markets. First, in May 1985, the Treasury moved to an auction
system for selling its securities and at the end of 1986 set up a regular
auction schedule, which has enhanced the Treasury's ability to sell its
debt. Second, in early 1987 the Central Bank introduced open-market
operations. The further development of these operations will enable the
Central Bank to control more effectively the money supply. Third, the
interbank market is widely considered a success after only one year in
operation. Daily volume is estimated to be around TL 150-200 billion
compared with TL 4 billion in early 1985. The development of the mArket has
enabled banks with excess reserves to lend to banks facing temporary
liquidity shortages. Fourth, the corporate bond market is expanding and the
first commercial papers were issued in the second quarter of 1987. The
development of these instruments will provide the corporate sector a direct
access to private savings and will enhance competition in the financial
system.
3.14     However, there are still some impediments to progress in the above
mentioned areas. In the area of Government securities, for example, the
major problem is the restricted distribution of these securities. Most of
these securities are held by banks, there being no significant arbitrage
activity between securities and deposits. To the extent that the Treasury
can broaden its distribution base, drawing savers from financial as well as
non-financial assets, it can reduce its overall funding costs. At the same
time it can increase the depth of the financial system. Regarding the
interbank market, despite its initial success, there are still impediments
to further improvements in the liquidity of the banking system. For
instance, the transfer of funds between Central Bank's branches is still
slow and inadequate. Also, the complete immobilization of required reserves
reduces flexibility in the use of reserves. Finally, the market for private
securities still suffers from excessive intervention from the Capital Market
Board (CMB), there is no external auditing of companies selling securities



- 16 -
to the public and insufficient disclosure of relevant information to
investors. The improvement in the financial markets is one of the important
objectives of the Second FSAL.
Corporate Securities
3.15     Turkey's embryonic capital market accounted for less than 32 of the
financial system in 1986. As of December 31, 1986, there were 375 companies
listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange with a tc.al market capitalization of
TL 641.6 billion (US$ 855 million), or roughly 1.62 ef GNP. The sizes of the
market is extremely small in comparison to the stock markets in othel
developing countries such as Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. The stozk
market in Turkey has not been a major source of investment finance. The
growth of the market has been inhibited by several factors: high inflation,
low dividends (in real terms), lack of adequate diseloaure requairements and
audited financial statements l/ and absence of incentives for family owned
concerns to become public companies. High interest rates on other
instruments especially treasury bonds and deposits make it less attractive
for investors to invest in equities. Since the interest rate for corporate
bonds and commercial papers are lower than the commercial banks' lending
rates, it is more advantageous for companies to issue bonds and commercial
papers. As a result, corporate short-term bonds have increased rapidly f-om
TL 16 billion in 1983 to TL tll billion in 1986. The sharp increase in the
volume of corporate papers is also due to the new decree allowing
corporations to issue commercial paper up to 6 times their equity. The
Second FSAL would address some of the important aspects affecting the
development of corporate securities markets. These would include auditing
of companies on the stock exchange and companies selling securities to the
pubiic.
3.16     The financial system has performed relatively well and been able to
mobilize more resources. However, the size of the system is small and a
large share o' these resources has been channeled towards the financing of
the budget deficit through larger holdings of government bonds. The most
recent increase in deposit mobilization is due to the foreign exchange
deposits and these resources are mainly used for trade financing. Sustained
increases in long-term lending to the private sector will therefore depend
on: (i) greater resource mobilization by the financial system; and (ii)
reduced absorption of domestic financial resources by the government, which
is a necessary step for the reduction of market-determined lending rates and
increase in the availability of credit to the private sector. The
introduction of a system of floating interest rates may also contribute to
the increase in credit for private investment, since it would make deposit
money banks more willing to extend their own resources for long-term
activities. The Government has agreed to consider the merit of floating
interest rates under the proposed Project by June 30, 1988. The issue of
crowding-out and the Government deficit would be discussed under the Second
FSAL.
1/    Starting January 1, 1988, the forty companies which are listed in the
first market of the Istanbul Stock Exchange will be required to have
their 1988 accounts audited.

TV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Obiectives
4.01     The proposed Project is designed to support Turkey's drive for
expanding industrial exports and the policy and institutional framework
relevant to export finance. This will be achieved by: (i) providing
financial support :o private export-oriented projects in key sub-sectors
where Turkey has a comparative advantage; (ii) supporting TSKB, the major
private development bank, in its financial restructuring and operational
diversification program; (iii) improving the credit delivery system for
industry by including commercial banks in the Project; (iv) intensifying
export marketing and promotional efforts by strengthening the Export
Promotion Research Center (IGEME) through greater private sector
involvement; and (v) creating a computerized trade and export credit
information system at the Ex-Im Bank.
B. Project Description and Desin
4.02     The proposed Project is aimed at financing private export-oriented
investments (para 4.06) in Turkey. The Project consists of a credit
component of US$ 298.5 million and a technical assistance component of US$
1.5 million (paras 4.03-4.05). The credit component will be channelled
through the participating banks which will include two leading private
development banks (TSKB and SYKB) and several private and public commercial
banks which meet the eligibility criteria (para 4.98). TSKB and SYKB will
be the direct borrowers of the Bank funds. In addition, TSKB and SYKB would
manage Us$ 98.5 million on behalf of the Government as Administrating
Institutions (Als). The commercial banks would have access to the Bank
funds through the TSKB and SYKB (para 4.15). The participating banks
including commercial banks will be responsible for appraising investment
projects in accordance with Bank agreed standards. All sub-project
appraisals will include calculation of Internal Financial Rate of Return
(IFRR) or Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and will be subject to a minimum
rate of return of 15% in real terms. Each appraisal report will also
include a statement on the impact of the proposed investment on environment
and the proposed preventive measures where appropriate. All export-oriented
industries will be eligible for financing. New enterprises will be eligible
under the Project; however, based on the existing pipeline of projects, it
is expected that the Project would finance mainly the expansion,
modernization, and rehabilitation of the existing medium- and large-scale
enterprises.
C. Technical Assistance
4.03 §ppprt for Export Promotion Activities. The Project will also
support Lhe strengthening of IGEME. IGEME was established in 1960 as a
semi-autonomous agency affiliated with the Undersecretariat of Foreign
Trade. It has a staff of about 60 professionals. IGEME has been



- 18 -
responsible mainly for organizing trade fairs in Turkey and arranging visits
to foreign trade fairs. It has also prepared a number of country studies
for exporters. Thus far, IGEME has not been particularly effective in
export promotion. Part. of the proLlem stems from the limited experience of
IGEME's staff and poor facilities. Th- private sector is not represented in
IGEME's governing board. The Governmeit is committed to addressing these
shortcomings. Specifically: (i) IGEME's Board of Directors would be
reconstituted to allow representation by private exporters at the same level
as Government representation; and (ii) IGEME's management would be
strengthened. These changes would require an amendment in IGEME's Act which
is outdated. During negotiations, an agreement was reached with the
Government that the Government would take all necessary actions to
strengthen IGEME, its management structure and procedures by December 31,
1988. IGEME will use the Bank funds to: (a) provide advisory services to
small- and medium-sized exporters; (b) train IGEME's staff so that they
could service the exporting community more effectively; and (c) upgrade its
computer facilities to enable it to better service its clients. The cost of
these activities is estimated at US$ 500,000.
4.04     Technical Assistance to the Turk Ex-Im Bank.  The proposed Project
would include a component to finance: (a) technical assistance needed by
the Turk Ex-Im Bank to develop appropriate procedures for provision of
medium- and long-term post-shipment export finance, and guarantees and
insurance programs and for training staff to implement such program; and (b)
a trade and export credit information system to complement its export
finance activities. The trade information system would also be used by
IGEME for its trade promotional activities. The estimated cost of the
technical assistance needs of items (a) and (b) above are about US$
900,000. The TUrk Ex-Im Bank will borrow these funds from the Government
and assume the foreign exchange risk. This arrangement was confirmed during
negotiations.
4.05     A study of credit delivery system for industrial finance in
Turkey. The channels for reaching private industries under the Project
would be increased through the inclusion of commercial banks. This is a
step in the right direction. As the private sector is expected to continue
to play a major role in Turkish industry, *t is important that investment
needs of private industry are met in a most efficient manner.   The proposed
Project therefore includes US$ 100,000 for a study of the credit delivery
system to industry. The study will analyze past financing patterns of
industry and efficiency of various channels which tere used to finance
industry. Investment needs of private industry in .he late 1980s and 1990s
will be assessed and appropriate vehicles for meeting their needs would be
identified. During negotiations, an understanding was reached with the
Government on the terms of reference of the study (Annex 8) and that the
study would start by June 30, 1987 and be completed by the end of 1988.
D. Beneficiaries
4.06     Sub-project Eligibility Criteria:  Export-Oriented Investments. The
last loan made to TSKB in 1982 required that all investment sub-projects



- 19 -
export at least 402 of the incremental production resulting from
investment.  This was largely achieved.  Given the need to maintain the
export drive, there is a need to retain explicit achievement criteria to
promote export-oriented investments. However, it is appreciated that the
criteria should be flexible enough to avoid excessive concentration in a
particular industry group. It is, therefore, proposed that sub-projects
financed under the Project should meet the following export achievement
targets: expansion sub-projects should export at least 20b of the
incremental production within three years of start-up; new sub-projects
should export at least 20% of total production within five years of
start-up. In case of balancing, modernization, and rehabilitation projects,
the borrowing company should be the one that is exporting at least 20% of
its sales. Investment projects by sub-contractors, i.e. the companies
supplying their products to the exporting companies will also be eligible
under the Project. Also, other export-oriented activities such as tourism
will be considered on a case by case basis. The Project will include a
comprehensive reporting requirement to ensure that the eligibility criteria
are complied with by the participating banks (para 5.05). During
negotiations an agreement was reached with the Government and participating
banks that only sub-projects which meet the above mentioned eligibility
criteria will be financed under the Project.
E. Proieot Cost and Financing Plan
4.07 The total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at US$ 598.5
million of which US$ 300.0 million is in foreign exchange. The estimate is
based on the recent investment trends, pipelines of the participating banks,
and their projected lending programs over 1987-89 period. The three
proposed Bank loans amounting to US$ 300.0 million will finance about 502 of
the project cost. The balance will be financed by the private investors,
participating banks, and suppliers credits. The proposed loans to TSKB and
SYKB would cover about half of their foreign exchange requirements over
1987-89 period (Annexes 7 and 8). On the basis of recent trends the private
industrial investment in Tu:key is estimated to reach about US$ 1.7 billion
p.a. during the 1987-89 period with a foreign exchange requirement of about
US$ 850 million p.a. The proposed Project would, therefore, finance about
61 of the private industrial investment annually.
F. Participatin Banks and Eligibility Criteria
4.08 DFIs. Under the proposed Project, the Bank funds will be channelled
through two private development banks and the commercial banking system.
TSKB and SYKB have been the major sources of long-term foreign exchange
resources for the Turkish industry. TSKB enjoys good standing in the
industrial and financial communities. It has developed a cadre of competent
staff who are known for their project appraisal skills and experience.
During 1980-85, it faced severe financial problems but it has since restored
its financial viability (para. 4.11). SYKB is a well managed financial
institution and has the institutional capability to play a more active role



- 20 -
in fioanc'ng medium- and large-scale industries. Participation of both
institutions will be subject to the eligibility criteria discussed below.
4.09     18KB.  Annex 7 provides a detailed discussion of TSKB's past
performance and prospects. Highlights are given below. TSKB was set up in
1950 by a group of Turkish private commercial banks and insurance companies
with the objective of providing lung-term fiuancing for private industr>
IFC also assisted TSKB as an investor and co-financier and at present holds
2% of TSKB's equity. The Bank has actively supported TSKB's development and
as of June 30, 1987, has made 15 credits and loans totalling US$ 532 million
to TSKB. The latest loan of US$ 100 million for export industries was
approved in February 1982. Since 1980, TSKB has operated in an extremely
difficult economic environment. During the 1980-85, TSKB faced severe
financial problems because of the massive and successive devaluations which
resulted in large non-performing loans. The situation was exacerbated by
the lack of domestic resources and the restrictions in its Charter, which
prohibited TSKB from diversifying its activities beyond term lending.
Because of the low profitability TSKB was unable to build up adequate
reserves. It was also difficult for TSKB to raise new capital. As a
result, TSKB was undercapitalized in relation to the type of business which
it catered to. The high non-performing assets and lack of domestic
resources led to tight liquidity position and a negative interest rate
spread in 1985 on its existing portfolio.
4.10     The Bank mission, which visited TSKB in October 1986, assisted
TSKB's management in devising a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring program to address its fundamental problems so that it could
again play an active role in the financial system. The main elements of the
financial restructuring plan consisted of: (i) doubling of its share
capital from TL 20 billion to TL 40 billion over 1987-88 period; (ii)
raising long-term TL resources by TL 20 billion to enable TSKB to lend in
local currency; (iii) increasing the spread by an introduction 2% p.a.
service charge; and (iv) restructuring terms of the existing quasi-equity
loans. The main elements of the operational diversification plan entails
offering of a broader range of banking services. Specifically, TSKB plans
to offer the following services: (i) working capital finance initially
limited to its existing clients; (ii) money market operations; (iii) capital
market operations especially comnercial papers and government
securities;(iv) lending to non-industrial sectors; and (v) leasing.
4.11     Since October 1986, TSKB's management and the Government have taken
a number of concrete measures to implement the agreed financial and
operational restructuring program. In January 1987, TSKB's Board of
Directors approved an increase in paid-in capital by TL 24 billion over
1987-88 period, and full payment of the first tranche of TL 12 million was
completed in September 1987. A new quasi-equity agreement was reached with
the Government in May 1987. These arrangements have substantially increased
tSKB's capital base. On February 15, 1987 TSKB raised Y 9.5 billion in the
Japanese market through private placement on good terms and conditions. The
proceeds of US$ 62 million equivalent of the seven year yen issue was
swapped in TL with the Central Bank at a rate of 32% p.a. fixed for seven
years. This will provide TSKB with long-term domestic resources to carry



- 21 -
out its diversification program. Effective March 1, 1987 TSKB has started
charging a commission of 2% p.a. for all new loans. This will further
augment domestic resources. The efforts made by TSKB in improving the
quality of its portfolio has begun to bear fruits. Its cash collections in
1986 were above the agreed target and the percentage of non-performing loans
declined to 17% of the total rortfolio by the end of 1986. With the
increase in cash collections and new resources, TSKB in early 1987 repaid
all high cost short-term loans from commercial banks. To enable it to carry
out the diversification program, TSKB initiated a reorganization study in
November 1986 with the assistance of a consultant from the Morgan Guarantee
Bank. The study was completed in January 1987 and the implementation has
started. Essentially, TSKB will be transforming itself from a development
bank to a merchant bank capable of performing all capital market
activities. TSKB has also been successful recently in raising domestic
funds by selling its commercial paper.
4.12     The net result of the above actions is that TSKB will become
profitable in 1987 and its profitability is projected to increase from 1988
onward. Given the improvement and good prospects, TSKB is in a position to
play an active role under the proposed Project. However, to ensure that
TSKB continues to make progress it will be subject to the following
eligibility criteria: (i) an additional increase in paid-in capital of TL 12
billion is to be completed by September 30, 1988; (ii) approval of the
diversification program and near term strategy (1987-88) by TSKB's Board of
Directors; (iii) implementation of the diversification program satisfactory
to the Bank; (iv) a maximum debt/equity ratio of 10:1 1'; and (v) a
minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.1:1. The Bank will have the right
to withhold new commitments if TSKB fails to implement the agreed financial
restructuring and operational diversification program. This was reconfirmed
during negotiations.
4.13     SYKB.  Annex 7 provides a detailed discussion of RYKB's past
performance and prospects. SYKB was set up in 1963 by five major commercial
banks in Turkey to finance private industrial investment. The Is Bank, the
largest private commercial bank in Turkey, owns 60% of SYKB's paid-in
capital, which amounted to TL 3.6 billion at the end of 1986. SYKB has,
to-date9 received three loans amounting to US$ 135 million from the Bank.
These were loans for the textile industries (US$ 15 million);
labour-intensive industries (US$ 40 million); and the small- and
medium-scale industries (US$ 80 million). The implementation of the loans
for textile and labour-intensive industries was delayed somewhat because of
the reluctance of the firms to bear the foreign exchange risk. With the
introduction of FERIS in 1985, the implementation accelerated and both loans
are now fully disbursed. The implementation of the SMI loan, which was
approved in February 1986, has been proceeding well. As of December 1, 1987
SYKB had fully committed the loan and disbursements amounted to US$
39.0 million.
1/    For the calculation of this ratio, quasi-equity would be treated as
equity and receivables under FERIS from the Central Bank is to be
deducted from outstanding foreign debts.



- 22 -
4.14     SYKB is a well-managed financial institution and has built up a
cadre of competent staff. During the last few years, SYKB concentrated
mainly on providing long-term finance to small- and medium-size industries.
It has performed well. In line with the changes in the financial system and
the expected demand for funds from large industries, SYKB plans to amend its
strategy to enable it to provide a broader range of banking services to the
private industry. As a conservatively managed financial institution, SYKB
plans to proceed cautiously in its diversification efforts. In this
connection, it has prepared a new operational strategy to guide its
operations. The appraisal mission is in full agreement with SYKB's
management on the proposed strategy. The mission's assessment shows that
SYKB will continue to be a sound financial institution (Annex 7). The
eligibility criteria applicable to SYKB under the proposed Project would
be: (i) approval of SYKB's near term strategy by SYKB's Board of Directors;
(ii) preparation and implementation of an operational diversification
program; (iii) a maximum debt/equity ratio of 10:1; and (iv) a minimum debt
service coverage ratio of 1.1:1. These eligibility criteria were agreed
upon during negotiations.
4.15     Commercial Banks.  In addition to the two development banks, Bank
funds will be channelled through the commercial banking system. This will
be the first Bank project in Turkey in which commercial banks are used as a
vehicle to reach private industries. As commercial banks are major players
in the financial system, their participation would increase the volume and
sources of investment funds for export-oriented projects. The overall
efficiency of the financial system would improve because of the added
competition. Participation by commercial banks has been constrained by the
limited project appraisal capacity of most banks and their lack of access to
long-term domestic and foreign resources. The introduction of the
commercial banks in project finance for export projects will be achieved by
providing funds through the two AIs. Under the proposed Project, a Bank
loan of US$ 100 million will be made available to the Government. Of this
amount, US$ 98.5 million will be for on-lending through participating
commercial banks (PCBs) and the balance of US$1.5 million for technical
assistance. TSKB and SYKB, would manage the loan funds of US$98.5 million
on behalf of the Government for a service fee of 0.52 p.a. Any PCB which
meets the eligibility criteria (para 4.19) would have access to the funds
for long-term investment financing. The PCB will be allowed to finance up
to 100% of the sub-loan at the prevailing FERIS rate (para 5.02). The
Government will be responsible for the commitment fee under the Bank loan
during the commitment period. However, this cost will be recovered in full
by charging a front-end fee of 1.5S to the sub-borrowers. The PCBs would
submit sub-loan requests together with the appraisal reports to the Bank
through the AIs.
4.16     The Central Bank has been operating the rediscounting facility in
local currency for several years. Annex 9 provides a summary of the Central
Bank's medium-term rediscounting facility for 1981-86 period. Rediscount
loans for industry rose from TL 10.5 billion in 1981 to TL 146.1 billion in
1986. Some major banks such as Is Bank and Ak Bank have been active
participants and are well equipped to handle this facility. However, they



- 23 -
would need to become familiar with Bank procedures. Given its past
experiences, the Central Bank would have been a logical choice for
chanelling Bank funds to private export-oriented industries. However, the
Government has recently decided that the Central Bank should limit itself to
the traditional central bank functions of establishing and implementing
monetary policies. Given the non-availability of the Central Bank to
perform this function, the introduction of commercial banks in project
finance will start by using the alternative existing channels which are TSKB
and SYKB. Both institutions have considerable experience in project finance
and are familiar with Bank procedures. They have also worked closely with
several major commercial banks in the past and would therefore be a
reasonable alternative to the Central Bank.
4.17     As both TSKB and SYKB would also be direct lenders and are
effectively controlled by a major commercial bank, using them as AIs
presents a potential conflict of interest problem. Other commercial banks
may be reluctant to access funds because of the confidentiality reason.
However, the design of the proposed Project includes several safeguards t
minimize this problem. First, their role would be reduced to: (a) verify.
the eligibility criteria of PCBs; (b) reviewing the eligibility criteria of
investment proposals prepared by the PCBs; (c) advising the PCBs on the
Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures; (d) maintaining revolving
funds and handling disbursements on behalf of the Bank; and (e) providing
progress reports on implementation to the Bank. In return for these
services, the AIs would receive a management fee of 0.5% p.a. Second, there
will be no free limit and each sub-loan will, be submitted for Bank
approval. In order to have a meaningful review of these projects, the
minimum sub-loan size would be set at US $400,000. Third, to ensure a
reasonable distribution of funds among the commercial banks, an initial
maximum limit of US$ 15 million per institution would be established. This
would provide the Bank with an opportunity to assess the seriousness of the
PCB and its project appraisal capability. The proposed initial limit of US$
15.0 million per PCB is rather small in relation to the size of the
potential PCBs especially the five largest banks. However, this will be the
first time in Turkey that the Bank's funds would be channeUled through
commercial banks. Therefore, a cautious approachi is justified. Also,
co-financing with TSKB and SYKB will be excluded and the limit would be
reviewed from time to time based on the experience gained and would be
adjusted if required. Given that the PCBs do not have access to long-term
funds, the availability of the Bank funds would enable them to offer a
broader range of financial services to industry.
4.18     Since AIs would not be making investment decisions and be basically
acting as agents of the Government, they could not be expected to bear the
credit risks. Given that TSKB is still going through a major financial and
operational restructuring, it would also not be desirable to have tl;.ise
additional debts on its books. The funds, therefore, should be passed on to
the AIs under the fund management agreements. During negotiations, an
agreement was reached with the Government and the AIs on the fund management
agreements which also spelled out the role of the AIs and their
obligations. Signing of these agreements would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.

4.19     Any PCB which would like to have access to the refinanciuig facility
would have to meet certain eligibility criteria. These criteria would
include: (i) a sound financial condition and performance; (ii) an
unqualified audited financial statement audited by external auditors 1';
and (iii) competent staff to appraise and supervise investment projects or
agree to build up such a capacity as the lending program justified. The
Treasury will be responsible for selecting the PCBs in accordance witli the
above mentioned eligibility criteria, which were agreed upon during
negotiations.
V. THE PROPOSED LOAN AND MAiN FEATURES
A. Amount and Allocation of Funds
5.01     The proposed loan package of US$ 300 million equivalent will
consist of three separate loans: (i) US$ 150 million for TSKB; (ii) US$ 50
million for SYKB; and (iii) US$ 100 million to the GOT for on-lending
through commercial banks (US$ 98.5 million) and technical assistance (US$
1.5 million) for the Ex-Im Bank, IGEME, and a study of credit delivery
system to industrial finance. The loans to TSKB, SYKB and the GOT will be
on the Bank's standard variable interest rate. TSKB and SYKB will repay the
Bank on the basis of a composite amortization schedule of subloans. The
loan to the GOT will have a fixed amortization of 17 years including a grace
period of 4 years. Each institution will be able to extend loans to its
borrowers for up to 10 years including a grace period of no more than 3
years. The credit risk will be borne by TSKB, SYKB and the PCBs. Out of
US$ '.00 million loan, the GOT would ask TSKB and SYKB to manage US$ 98.5
a'lion for on-lending through commercial banks. GOT would on-lend
US$900,000 to the Turk Ex-Im Bank for building up the trade and export
credit information system and pass on US$ 500,000 to IGEME as a grant.
These arrangements were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.
B. On-lending Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
5.02     The sub-borrowers of the Bank funds will have an option to borrow
either in local or foreign currency. In case of loans denominated in
foreign currency the sub-borrower would borrow at the Bank variable interest
rate plus a maximum spread of 4% p.a. and a commitment fee of 0.75% on
undisbursed balances. For loans denominated in local currency, the
sub-borrower will have an option to borrow either on a fixed or floating
interest under the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS), which is
operated by the Central Bank since 1985. Under FERIS, the spread between
the lending rate and the cost of funds to the Central Bank is used to
1/    All commmercial banks are required by the Central Bank of Turkey to
have their 1987 accounts audited by external auditors by June 30, 1988.



- 25 -
provide insurance against foreign exchange risk. The fixed rate uwder FERIS
is currently 341 p.a. '" This rate is positive in comparison to the last
12 month average Wholesales Price Index (WPI)l" and is projected to be
positive during the life of each sub-loan (8 years including a grace period
of 3 years). The FERIS rate is reviewed twice a year by the Money and
Credit Committee and adjusted if required.
5.03     As the Government is committed to bring down the inflation rate, it
would be undesirable to have sub-borrowers locked in a high interest rate
for a period of 8 years. Therefore, under the proposed Project, the
Government has agreed to consider the merit of introducing a floating
interest rate under FERIS by June 30, 1988. If the Government decides to
introduce a floating interest rate then it would be available to
sub-borrowers under the Project as an option.
C.          aton
5.04     Subloam size, free lbmits and review Procedum
TSKB and S M . The proposed free limits for TSKB and SYKE under
the project are US* 5.0 million and US$ 2.5 million respectively. The
limits for TSKB and SYKB have been increased from U84.0 million and US$ 2.0
million respectively, to reflect inflation, exchange rate changes and the
change in the client mix which is expected to take place under the proposed
Project. It is expected that about 50 sub-projects would be financed by
TSKB and 30-40 by SYKB. In addition to the individual free limit, an
aggregate maximum limit of US$ 15.0 million equivalent for a single project
will apply whether it is finaned individually or jointly by the
participating banks. The proposed free limits would give the Bank an
adequate control of the quality of appraisal reports and to ensure that only
the enterpzises which meet the agreed eligible criteria (para 4.08) will be
financed.
Partic-pating Commercial Banks. Since the commercial banks have
limited experience in preparing project proposals, it is proposed that the
Bank review each sub-project from each participating commercial bank, which
meets the eligibility criteria (para 4.19). The participating banks would
submit their loan requests together with appraisal reports to the Bank
through the Administrating Institutions (para 5.01). To allow a meaningful
review of the sub-loans, the minimum size of the sub-loan to be financed
under the Project will be US$ 400,000 unless otherwise agreed upon by the
Bank. The maximum sub-loan size will be set at US, 4.0 million, or 202 of
the networth (paid-in capital plus retained earnings of the PCB, whichever
is less).
_/    Base rate of 281 + 4i spread . 22 commission p.a.
2/    The twelve-month average rate (October 1986 to October 1987) was 292.



- 26 -
Reportng requirements and audits
5.05     TSKB will be required to submit progress reports acceptable to the
Bank. These reports will cover TSKB's financial condition and results,
utilization of Bank funds, operational U.argets, achievement of the agreed
operational diversification and financial restructuring programs, and
training. TSKB will also provide revised financial projections twice a
year. TSKB's reporting requirements were discussed and agreed upon during
negotiations. SYKB will continue to provide the same progress reports as
under the previous loan. However, the coverage will be expanded to include
performance of some of the problem companies, its diversification efforts,
and semi-annual financial projections. Participating commercial banks will
submit quarterly reports on the utilization of Bank funds. The Admini-
strating Institutions will be responsible for providing the Bank with the
aggregate reports on the utilization of the Bank funds for participating
commercial banks on a quarterly basis in a format which is satisfactory to
the Bank. Also, the participating banks will be required to submit a
quarterly report on export performance of the sub-projects financed under
the Project. The reporting requirements were discussed and agreed upon
during negotiations.
5.06     TSKB is audited by an external auditor (Arthur Auderson) annually.
It will continue to provide a long form audit within 120 days after the
close of its fiscal year which is December 31. SYKB has been providing a
short form audit until 1986. Starting in calendar year 1987 it will be
required to provide a long form audit in a format satisfactory to the Bank.
SYKB has been audited by an external auditor (Price Waterhouse) and the
accounts have not been qualified. The participating commercial banks will
submit their annual financial reports in a format specified by the Treasury.
5.07     Closing Date.  Based on the pipelines of the participating banks,
it is expected that the credit component of the Project will be committed
within three years after Board approval and disbursed within five years.
Therefore, it is proposed that the last date for submission of sub-loan
applications to the Bank will be December 31, 1990. The same date will
apply to the technical assistance component. The closing date of the three
loans will be December 31, 1992.
D. Procurement and Disbursements
5.08     Goods and services financed under the proposed Project will be
subject to standard procurement procedures for projects involving
development finance institutions. For contracts below US$ 2.5 million, the
present comercial practice of local and international shopping with at
least three quotations will be followed. Limited International Bidding
(LIB) would be required for individual contracts for equipment and civil
works above US$ 2.5 million. Project sponsors would seek bids from a list
of potential suppliers broad enough to ensure competitive prices. Sponsors
would notify embassies and trade representatives of Bank Group member
countries and Switzerland represented in Turkey. Advertisement in the
international press will not be required. The participating banks will be

VIL RECOM EAnDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government
and the implementing agencies on the following:
Government
(i) There will be greater involvement of the private sector in IGEME.
The Government will take necessary steps to strengthen IGEME's
management by December 31, 1988 (para 4.03);
(ii) The credit component under the Government loan will be passed
through TSKB and SYKB to eligible commercial banks under fund
management agreement. The AIs would receive a management fee of
0.52 p.a. of assets under management. Signing of these agreements
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para 4.18);
(iii) The eligibility criteria for participating commercial banks (para
4.19);
(iv) The participating intermediaries will finance only private
export-oriented investments (para 4.06);
(v) The sub-borrower will borrow at a fixed rate specified under FERIS
at the time of borrowing. The Government would consider the merit
of introducing a system of floating interest rates by June 30, 1988
(Para 5.03);
(vi) The Government will pass on US$ 500,000 to IGEME as a grant (para
5.01);
(vii) The participating banks under the Project will receive a spread of
41 under FERIS, which is available to all banks. In addition, the
intermediaries will charge an annual commission of 21 p.a. (para
5.02);
(viii) The terms of reference of the credit delivery system for industrial
finance and timing of its implementation (para 4.05);
TSKB and SYKB
(ix) The eligibility criteria for TSKB and the Bank's right to withhold
new commitments if TSKB fails to implement the agreed financial
restructuring and operational diversification program (para 4.12);
(x) The eligibility criteria for SYKB (para 4.14);
(xi) Reporting requirements for TSKB, SYKB and the participating
commercial banks (para 5.05).

required to maintain records of the method of procurement. The proceeds of
the Bank loan would be disbursed at the rate of 100S of the foreign exchange
cost for machinery and equipment of eligible sub-loans 100% of overseas
training, and 60% of locally procured goods, which is the estimated foreign
exchange cost. Special accounts will be established for TSKB and SYKB to
facilitate disbursements. Disbursements by the participating commercial
banks would be handled through the Ala.
VX  PROJECTS BENEFrTS AND RISKS
6.01     Benefits.  The proposed Project would be beneficial to the country
in several ways. First, it would assist the Government in maintaining the
growth of private industrial investment through the availability of foreign
exchange for investment. Second, the export growth should accelerate with
the additional export capacity, simplification in export finance procedures,
availability of export finance and credit insurance on more competitive
terms, and strengthening of the export promotion institutions. Third, the
credit delivery system for industrial finance is expected to improve with
the proposed operational diversification and financial restructuring of
TSKB. Fourth, the efficiency of the financial system will be enhanced with
the participation of the commercial banks in the Project, and the financial
services to the investors should improve with the increased competition.
Fifth, the Project would assist SYKB's efforts in diversifying its
operations from SSIs to larger enterprises with the availability of Bank
funds. This, in turn, will create additional competition for TSKB. Based
on the past experience, the proposed Project is expected to create about
20,000 new jobs with an average investment cost per job of about $30,000,
which is reasonable. All sub-projects financed under the Project would be
subject to a minimum economic rate of return of l5S at the time of appraisal.
6.02     Risks.  There are two specific project risks.  First, private
industrial investment may slow down if the macro-economic conditions
deteriorate and if, in particular, inflation accelerates. This could lead
to a slow down in the commitment and disbursement rates. However, the
Government is expected to continue its program of controlling inflation,
maintain a realistic exchange rate, provide adequate export incentives and
promote exports. Furthermore, the participating banks, especially TSKB and
SYKB, have a large pipeline of projects which are at an advanced stage.
Second, the comnercial banks are accustomed to making loans based on
collaterals and are not familiar with Bank procedures. Therefore, a
significant delay in implementing the commercial bank component could
occur. However, this risk will be minimized as they would be assisted by
TSKB and SYKM and through extensive training of the staff of participating
commercial banks. Also, the large banks do have capable staff and they
should be able to familiarize themselves with Bank procedures in a short
period. In summary, the Project does entail risks, but the commitments
sought from the Government and implementing agencies are adequate safeguards
and they should minimize these risks.

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF TURKEY
(TSKB)
1.      TSKB was set up in 1950 by a group of Turkish commercial banks and
insurance companies with the objective of providing long-term financing for
private industry. IFC also assisted TSKB as an investor and co-financier
and at present, holds about 2S of TSKB's equity. The Bank has actively
supported TSKB's development and as of June 30, 1986, has made 15 credits
and loans totalling $532 million to TSKB. The latest loan of US$100 million
for export industries was approved in February 1982.
Review of Past OBerations
2.      Table 1 below provided a summary of TSKB's operations from 1981-86.
Since 1980, TSKB has operated in a very difficult economic environment.
Inflation has been extremely high and volatile. Interest rates have
steadily increased and are now at very high real level,.  DomeLtic demand
has generally been depressed and private investment has remained fairly
stagnant. TSKB's lending during 1981-86 averaged $53 million p.a. but its
operations have decreased overtime in real terms. Its share of private
industrial investment was estimated at about 6S in 1986 and averaged about
71 during 1981-85. TSKB's importance in financing industrial investment has
been reduced somewhat since 1980, due to the faster growth of other
development banks and more active financing of industry by commercial
banks. Because of its severe portfolio problems (para 5) and lack of
domestic resources TSKB has not been able to diversify its activities. The
financial system in Turkey has been changing rapidly because of the recent
liberalization measures, TSKB has been falling behind in diversifying its
operations and meeting the competition.

3.       TSKB was constrained by the limitation in the Banking Law which
disallowed development banks from accepting deposits from public or issuing
negotiable instruments. This constraint was removed in 1985 when the new
banking law was promulgated. Under the new banking law, TSKB and other DFIs
are allowed to mobilize funds from capital markets by issuing notes, bonds
and other negotiable instruments to other institutions and public. Also,
the law provides that funds received by DFIs from banks and the public will
not be considered as deposits and, therefore, not subject to reserve
requirements. TSKB has taken full advantage of this feature and has up to
March 31, 1987 raised TL 50 billion by issuing one year notes to the
public. However, the total amount of notes TSKB can issue is limited to
three times its net worth. The limit is imposed by the Capital Market
Board. TSKB's ability to raise additional resources from the capital
markets has been enhanced substantially with the recent increase in paid-in
capital (para 11). Up to the end of 1986 TSKB utilized the proceeds of the
notes to meet its liquidity requirements and to reduce its high cost
borrowings from commercial banks. Starting in March 1987, TSKB has become
an active participant in the money market and the proceeds from notes are
used to invest in the commercial papers and inter-bank markets.
Past Financial Performance
4.       Table 2 summnarizes TSKB's financial performance since 1983.  TSKB's
lending has suffered a decline in real terms during this period. Because of
the rapid TL devaluation, total debt obligations, which were mainly in
foreign exchange, increased from TL 125 billion in 1983 to TL 395 billion in
1986. However, TSKB's net worth increased from TL 7 billion to TL 27
billion, resulting in very high effective total debt/equity ratios during
the same period. Without the capital increase in late 1986, the effective
debt equity ratio of TSKB would have been well over 20:1. Its spread was
inadequate to generate a sufficient surplus to build up its capital base and
in fact declined from 6% in 1981 to about 2% in 1985.1/ Because of the high
proportion of non-performing loans in its portfolio on which it accrued
interest, its real spread was negative. TSKB, however, continued to report
a net profit in each year during 1983-85, paid taxes and dividends. As its
liquidity problems mounted, TSKB had to resort to medium-term and short-term
borrowings at high interest rates between 50-90% p.a. and these borrowings
reached TL 39 billion by the end of 1986, further eroding its profitability
and liquidity. Because of recent changes in Turkish accounting rules on
interest accrual, TSKB can no longer accrue default interest on arrears
until they are collected. This led to further deterioration in reported
profit.
1/ Under the Export Industries Loan (1982), the Government agreed to give
TSKB a spread of 5.5S under FERIS. However, the spread was reduced to 42.
Since TSKB has to pay 12 for the exchange conversion fee, the net
spread under the Bank loan is only 3X, which is inadequate.

Portfolio and Arrears
5.       TSKB faced a significant arrears problem until late 1986 but the
trend has since been improving. Initiatives taken by TSKB in 1985 and
additional measure taken since October 1986 (para 11) are beginning to bear
fruits. Table 3 presents the evolution of arrears since 1983. Although
arrears in absolute terms have increased from TL. 24 billion at the end of
1983 to TL. 68 billion as of December 31, 1986, total arrears has been
contained. The percentage of portfolio at risk has also declined from 45.92
at the end of 1983 to 17% at the end of 1986 (Table 3). The total number of
non-performing accounts has decreased from 164 in 1983 to 126 in 1986. Of
the 126 accounts, TSKB has taken legal actions against 105 and it should
begin to benefit from these efforts over the next few years. Furthermore,
the performance of the accounts under FERIS has been much better with the
collection ratio well over 952.
6.       TSKB's arrears problem started in 1978 when the Turkish Lira was
devalued by 332 against the US$. The problee was exacerbated by the unila-
teral abandonment of the foreign exchange guarantee scheme in 1979 by the
Government. About 552 of TSKB's loan portfolio was affected by arrears at
the end of 1980. The difficult economic conditions adversely affected most
of TSKB clients, particularly those who could not export. The continuous
devaluation of the Lira during 1980-85 to maintain a realistic exchange rate
resulted in an explosive increase in the Lira equivalent of foreign currency

denominated debt. High inflation and very high real interest rates after
1983 further depressed the profitability of most industrial enterprises and
reduced their ability to service ballooning debts. TSKB's portfolio
problems worsened during 1983 and by the end of 1984, about 462 of its
portfolio by number was in non-performing accounts (Table 4).

7.       A breakdown of TSKB's loan portfolio and arrears by major
sub-sectors is given in Table 4. As of June 30, 1986, TSKB's total loan
portfolio amounted to TL. 331.6 billion. Loans to the three major
!tub-sectors (textiles, electrical products and electronics, and wood
products) accounted for about half of TSKB's portfolio. Loans to the
textiles sector accounted for 291 of the portfolio. A distribution of
TSZ3's arrears by sector shows a pattern similar to that of its portfolio.
As of June 30, 1986, TSKB's total arrears amounted to TL. 67.3 billion.
Three sub-sectors accounted for 51% of the arrears in the following order:
textiles (261); electrical and electronic (121); and wood products (131).
The food sub-sector accounted for another 111 of the arrears. The arrears
problem in the textiles sector, the largest industrial sub-sector in Turkey,
is mainly confined to firms which primarily cater to the local market.
Domestic demand for textiles has been depressed during the past few years
because of the demand management policies pursued by the Government which
has sharply reduced real wages. The sharp increase in debt service
requirements and lower domestic sales led to large losses and

decapitalization of several large textile firms such &a Dokusan and
Turbman. These firms now need large cash infusions which are beyond the
means of the present owners; a change in product mix is needed to enable
theo to export. In some companies, new management is also needed. In the
electrical and electronic products sub-sector, the problem appears to be
technical in nature. Product technical specifications are often not
internationally competitive and prices are also high.

8.       Table 5 provides a breakdown of TSKB's portfolio and arrears by
geographical locations. As of June 30, 1986, loans to three regions
(Marmara, Agean and Mediterranean) accounted for about 75S of total
portfolio. During the late 1970s, TSKB expanded its lending activities in
the less developed regions (Eastern Anatolia and Southeastern Anatolia) in
line with the Government's policy of promoting industries in less developed
areas. Because of infrastructural and other problems, arrears of loans in
less industrialized regions are proportionately more than their share in the
total portfolio. As of June 30, 1986, TSKB's outstanding loans to the two
less developed regions amounted to 52 of the total loan portfolio while the
two regions accounted for about 141 of the total arrears. However, in
relative terms, the impact of leading to the less developed areas has been
less severe on TSKB than the impact of devaluations.

9.       TSKB initially believed that the Government would assist the
industrial companies which were affected by the devaluations, but this did
not materialize. TSKB has, since 1985, taken a number of concrete measures
to address the deteriorating trend in its portfolio. These measures
include: (i) rescheduling the accounts which have been facing short-term
problems; (ii) assigning hard core problem cases to the investment divisions
for major financial restructuring; (iii) taking swift legal actions to
liquidate firms which cannot be salvaged; and (iv) coordinating its
activities more closely with other creditors. Also, a permanent Management
Review Committee has been set up to review the financial restructuring
proposals and monitor action programs. TSKB's Board of Directors has also
become much more involved in reviewing restructuring of firms in arrears.
Since many of TSKB's Board members are chief executives of major comuercial
banks, their involvement has helped TSKB's management in addressing the
arrears problem. To ensure that TSKB does not face the same problem in the
future, it needs to institutionalize its portfolio restructuring activities.
Financial and Operational Restructuring of TSKB
10.      A Bank mission which visited TSKB in October 1986 devised a
comprehensive financial and operational restructuring program to address
TSKB's fundamental problems and to restructure TSKB financially so that it



- 41 -
ANNEX 6
Page 7 of 9
could again play an active role in the financial system. The main elements of
the financial restructuring plan consisted of: (i) doubling of its share
capital from TL 20 billion to TL 40 billion over 1987-88 period; (ii) raising
long-term TL resources by TL 20 billion to enable TSKB to lend in local
currency; (iii) increasing the spread by an introduction 2% p.a.
commission/service charge on all new loans starting April 1, 1987; and (iv)
restructuring terms of the existing quasi-equity loans. The main elements of
the operational restructuring plan entails offering of a broader range of
banking services. Specifically, TSKB plans to offer the following services:
(i) working capital finance initially to its existing clients; (ii) money
market operations; (iii) capital market operations especially commercial
papers and government securities;(iv) lending to non-industrial sectors; and
(v) leasing.
11.      Since October 1986, TSKB's management and the Government have taken a
number of concrete measures to implement the agreed financial and operational
restructuring program. In January 1987 TSKB's Board of Directors approved the
increase in paid-in capital by TL 24 billion over 1987-88 period. Full
payment of the first tranche of TL 12 billion was completed in September
1987. A new quasi-equity agreement has been reached between the Government
and TSKB. Effective March 1, 1987 TSKB has started charging a commission of
21 p.a. for all new loans. On February 15, 1987 TSKB raised Y 9.5 billion in
the Japanese market through private placement on good terms and conditions.
The proceeds of $ 62 million equivalent of the seven year yen issue was
swapped in TL with the Central Bank at a rate of 32b p.a. fixed for seven
years. This arrangement will provide TSKB with domestic resources to carry
out its diversification program. The efforts made by TSKB in improving the
quality of its portfolio has begun to bear fruits. Its cash collections in
1986 were above the target and the percentage of non-performing loan declined
to 171 of the total portfolio by the end of 1986. With the increase in cash
collections aud new resources, TSKB in early 1987 repaid all high cost
short-term loans from commercial banks and was liquid. It has started to
participate in the inter-bank market. To enable it to carry out the
diversification program, TSKB initiated a reorganization study in November
1986 with the assistance of a consultant from the Morgan Guarantee Bank. The
study was completed in January 1987 and the implementation has started. TSKB
has also been successful in raising domestic funds by selling its commercial
papers.
12.      The net result of the above actions is that TSKB will become
profitable in 1987 and its profitability is projected to increase from 1988
onward. Table 6 provides a stumary of the impact of the restructuring plan on
TSKB's financial results for 1987-91 period. TbKB's projected financial
results and condition for 1987-91 period are given in the attachment 1 of this
Annex. Given the improvement and good prospects TSKB is in a position to play
an active role under the Bank project.

13.      To ensure that TSKB continues to make progress it will be subject
to the following eligibility criteria: (i) completion of the financial
restructuring plan. Full payment of the capital increase of an additional
TL 12 billion to be completed by September 30, 1988; (ii) approval of the
diversification program and near term strategy (1987-88) by TSKB's Board of
Directors; (iii) implementation of the diversification program satisfactory
to the Bank; (iv) a maximum debt/equity ratio of 10:1"'; and (v) a
minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.1:1.
Diversification of Future Operations
14.      To survive and prosper in the rapidly changing financial system in
Turkey, TSKB needs to diversify and offer a broader range of banking
services. ^omercial banks are able to provide a "one-window" banking
1/    Quasi-equity is to be treated as equity and receivables under FERIS
from the Central Bank to be deducted from outstanding foreign debts.

service which should also be provided by TSKB. Specifically, the areas
which TSKB should consider entering are: (il merchant banking and
underwriting; (ii) working capital finance initially to its existing
clients; (iii) leasing; (iv) trade financing, especially preshipment and
exchange transactions; and (v) money market operations. TSKB has a good
name in the market, and is in a position to diversify if it so desires.
TSKB's diversification plans and specified actions which TSKB will take
during 1987-89 were discussed and agreed upon negotiations (Attachment 2 of
this Annex). Implementation of the agreed program will be a condition of
further commitment of the Bank's funds.
Organization Strengthening
15.      The mission feels that TSKB's organization structure has become
somewhat unwieldy and needs to be streamlined. TSKB's important operations
are concentrated in a single department -- the Loan and Investment
Department which is responsible for: (i) processing of loans and equity
investments, (ii) restructuring of projects in difficulty, and (iii) project
foll3w-up. This approach has resulted in project supervision being given
low priority. For a comparatively small institution like TSKB, a functional
organization structure would be more appropriate. However, any organization
plan that is developed should be sufficiently flexible to incorporate, as
needed, the new operations TSKB is contemplating and which the mission
strongly supports: short- and medium-term loans for working capital
purposes, lease financing, underwriting/sale of stocks, shares and other
commercial paper. In November 1986, TSKB initiated a study of its
organization with the assistance of a consultant provided by the Morgan
Guarantee Bank of New York. The study was completed in January 1987 and
implementation has started. It is expected that implementation will be
completed by June 30, 1988. The new organization is well thought out and if
implemented properly would enable TSKB to diversify and operate more
efficiently.

TURKEY
INDUSTRIAL EXPORT DEVELOPMEWT PROJECT
SDNAI YATIRIM VE KREDI BANKASI
I. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Background and Ownership
1.       SYKB was established in 1963 as a development banking company by
five major commercial banks in Turkey. The paid-in capital TL 4 billion is
distributed in the following: ls Bankasi has 601 of paid-in capital and the
remaining 401 share is equally divided among the other four banks..'
Originally, SYKB was set up as a sister organization to TSKB for providing
working capital loans to TSKB clients but since late 70s, SYKB has had a
shift in its lending policies and has had a growing role in meeting the
investment financing needs of the private industrial sector.
Organization and Management
2.       SYKM  is governed by a compact Board of Directors comprising six
members, a representative each of five shareholder banks and the General
Manager of SYKB. Is Bankasi representative is the Chairman of SYKB's
Board. The Board is responsible for deciding general policy matters and
approving in principle loan applications based on the appraisals made.
3.       True to its character, SYKB has adopted a simple organizational
structure. In view of relatively small staff size (total staff of 118
including 75 professionals), SgKB'I organization is horizontally arranged
into seven departments. Its three operations departments (technical,
financial and economic) are responsible for appraising projects and their
supervision. The treasury and resource mobilization functions are entrusted
to the loans and accounting departments. In addition, SYKB has a legal
department and a personnel and control department. The personnel department
looks after only the routine matters, whereas the real personnel functions
(staff selection, training, assessment and promotion) are performed by the
respectiv, department heads.
4.       SYKB has been able to keep the real salaries of its employees at a
competitive level and the staff turnover is very low and morale high. SYKB
recognizes the need for training to its staff members and deputes its
officers to short courses, seminars and workshops in Turkey and abroad. For
1/ Ak Bank, Garanti Bankasi, Vakiflar Bankasi, and Ticaret Bankasi.

ANNEX 7

instance, SYKB's Board approved that 15 officers be sent abroad during 1986
and 1987 far training in technical and banking skills. SYKB has not been
following a policy of staff rotation in the past. A system of rotation of
staff as between key operational departments is necessary for healthy growth
of both the officers and the organization.
5.       Notwithstanding the organizational competence, it would be
necessary to look ahead and, in terms of near term objectives especially
resource diversification, some organizational changes would seem necessary.
Thus, a small cell needs to be set up to look at international capital
markets as also the national markets of Japan, Germany and Switzerland and
explore possibilities of augmenting resources from these liquid markets.
Going by the experience of development banks in other similar countries, it
takes time and staff input to understand the working of international
markets and cultivate banking and merchant banking contacts for effective
mobilization of resources. Yet another organizational change that needs to
be seriously considered is in respect of supervision and follow-up
function. As the size of loan operations increases, it becomes necessary to
closely monitor the loan portfolio by assigning special staff. A separate
sub-division with four officers could be set up under the financial analysis
department and staff could be rotated between appraisal and supervision so
as to provide the concerned staff exposure to both these important
dimensions. SYKB has agreed to bring about changes in its organizational
structure as suggested above.
Operating Policies, Procedures and Standards
6.       Policies:  SYKB adopted a Policy Statement in March 1986 which
exisures sound lending operations. The statement, provides, inter alia, for
conducting sectoral and sub-sectoral studies to identify priority
development areas and viable projects with high economic priority. It
further stipulates that SYKB will finance projects whose majority control is
vested with the private sector and provide up to 602 of the fixed Investment
cost of the project; its total exposure in an enterprise will not normally
exceed 20% of its own net worth; equity investment will not exceed 252 of
the enterprise's capital and 102 of its own net worth; and it will not carry
foreign exchange risk. SYKB's lending terms vary from project to project
but in general the working capital loans are up to 5 years and investment
loans are up to 15 years including grace period. SYKB follows conservative
lending policies by requesting its clients to provide collateral and bank
guarantees. S M's collateral policies seem adequate and reasonable. Over
80S of SYKB loans are covered by collateral and/or bank guarantees.
7.       Appraisal: SYKB's appraisal procedures are satisfactory as
indicated by the review of subprojects financed under the Bank's loan.
Appraisal includes assessment of the management capability and
creditworthiness of the applicant and economic, financial, technical and
marketing viability of the proposed project. Economic rates of return are



- 52 -
ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 14
calculated for all projects with total investment cost more than US$750,000
and generally projects must yield and ERR higher than 15%.
8.       Supervision:  SYKB's staff now makes periodical visits to projects
and monitors the cost and financing of projects under implementation and the
financial performance of projects in operation. Supervision reports are
generally comprehensive and satisfactory. In 1986, SYKB compiled about 160
supervision reports out of total number of 208 firms in its portfolio.
Nowever, with the deterioration of arrears on its portfolio (para. 20-22),
there is scope for further strengthening of the project supervision by
increasing the frequency of visits to firms operating and monitoring
non-financial aspects of projects (including technical and marketing
aspects). In this light, SYKB, in assisting its borrowers, should resolve
disputes between major shareholders, arrange for mergers and takeovers and
securing additional equity and loan financing from local and foreign
sources. SYKB has agreed to establish a new section for supervision
activities under its Financial Analysis Department with the responsibilities
of reappraising problem projects and assisting its borrowers in developing
and implementing restructuring programs. Initially, SYKB will allocate four
financial analysts for supervision supported by engineers, with rotation
every six months in order that officers have exposure to both appraisal and
supervision. SYKB will increase number of staff in the new supervision unit
as becomes necessary.
Procurement and Disbursement Procedures
9.       SYKBts procurement procedures are designed to ensure economy and
efficiency. SYKB ensures that competitive bidding procedures appropriate to
each project are adopted by clients who in Turkey are generally well
informed of the equipment available. Normally at least three bids from
suppliers in different countries are required for purchase of imported
goods. For contracts in excess of US$2.5 million financed under the
proposed loan, SYKB requires a limited international competitive bidding.
For local procurement, adequate domestic shopping is required. These
procurement procedures are consistent with those adopted by other Bank
assisted DFCs providing loans to and are considered satisfactory.
Disbursement procedures, which are made on the basis of invoices and
evidence of shipment, are also satisfactory.
II. PAST PERFORMANCE AND IMPACT
SYKB's Role in the Economy
10.      SYKB as one of two major DFCs has had a significant role in meeting
investment needs of private manufacturing sector. Since its inception in



- 53 -
ANNEX 7
Page 4 of 14
1963, SYKB has provided TL 94 billion of financial assistance (foreign and
local currency) to about 1,620 projects. In particular, SYKB has played an
important role in providing financing (investment loans and working
capital), to small- and medium-scale industry. During 1982-1986 period,
SYKB's financial support to manufacturing sector has created about 30,000
jobs (para 12). The total investment by private manufacturing sector during
1982-1986 amounted to about TL 1,800 billion and SYKB's share in that was
about 4.5X. Although initially this may not seem significant, the SYKB's
share of investment in the private manufacturing becomes more significant
when investments are isolated by SMI and non-SMI sector.
Past Operations and Economic Impact
11.      Review of Past Operations:  Summary of SYKB's past operations are
presented in Table 1. Total loan approvals of SYKB have increased from TL
5.1 billion for 81 projects in 1982 to TL 40.4 billion for 88 projects in
1986, i.e. 68S increase p.a. in nominal terms. Foreign currency loan
approvals were 732 of total loans during the 1982-1986 period, with the
relative share increasing from 70% in 1982 to 852 in 1986, mainly because of
the availability of new foreign currency resources to SYKB and the
introduction of the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS).
Impact and Structure of SYKB's Operations
12.      SYKB's promotional activities include the identification and
development of and assistance to SMI projects of high economic priority. To
achieve these objectives, SYKB has completed studies of various industrial
sub-sectors, including textile goods, forest products processing industry,
meat processing industry, and marble extracting and processing industry.
The above studies have led to the identification and financing of a large
number of sub-projects, some of which are export-oriented. SYKB recently
completed the study of the cotton yarn and fabric industry in Turkey. The
projects assisted by SYKB have high labor-intensity. During the 1982-1986
period, 30,000 direct jobs were created by projects financed by SYKB, with
an estimated average cost per job (excluding land and buildings) of about
US$11,000. SYKB has played a positive role in the development of small and
medium-scale industry. However, in line with the changes in the financial
sector, it has started to cater on medium-scale industries as well. SYKB
financed 370 projects from 1982 through 1986. The subsectoral distribution
of projects financed by SYKB during 1982-1986 is presented in Table 2.
Fixed investment loans were 60% for expansion and 402 for new projects.
13.      SYKB's overall sectoral distribution of outstanding investments is
presented in Table 3. It can be observed that textiles is one of the major
subsectors financed by SYKB. In particular, during the 1982-1986 period,
SYKB's investments in the textile sector accounted on the average for 352
per annum (Table 2). In contrast, SYKB's outstanding loan in the textile

sector was about 25% per annum during the same period. Other subsectors, each
of which represents over 10% of the outstanding loans during the same period
are: machinery/metal products/electronics, chemical/ plastic/rubber, and
food. The combined percentage of the outstanding loan in the above-listed
subsectors is in the range of 68% (1982) to 712 (1986). There are two main
reasons for the concentration of inv-stment by SYKB in these subsectors.
First, SYKB has made a commitment and promotional effort towards development
of export-oriented projects. Second, these are subsectors which have either
experienced the fastest growth rates in exports, or had a major share of
exports of the Turkish economy in the last five years. However, the
consequence of concentrating SYKB's loan portfolio in the above subsectors has
also led to concentration of SYKB's arrears in these subsectors.   As of
December 31, 1986, these four subsector groupings accounted for 71% of SYKB's
total arrears (para 17).

14.      Bank-financed Operations:  SYKB has, to date, received three loans
from the Bank in support of (i) the development of the textile industry,
US$15 million (Loan 1755-TU); (ii) the labor-intensive industries, US$40
million (Loan 1952-TU); and (iii) the small and medium-scale industries,
US$80 million (Loan 2647-TU). Due to the reluctance of firms to incur
foreign exchange risk, the last date for loan commitments under the textile
projects was extended twice. With the introduction of FERIS, the loan was
almost entirely committed by December 1984, with about US$14 million
disbursed, and the remaining amount cancelled. The last date for
commitments under the loan for the labor-intensive industries project was

also extended twice (December 31, 1985) for the same reason. This loan was
also fully committed soon after the introduction of FERIS.  SYKB has approved
112 sub-projects (net of cancellations) with a total amount of US$40.0 million
(100X) under the Bank loan for labor-intensive industries. Sub-loan
disbursements amounted to US$39.6 million, which corresponds to 99% of the
total loan amount. Sub-projects assisted under the loan created about 14,000
jobs at an average cost of $12,744 (excluding land and buildings). At least
one-third of the loan for labor-intensive industries was earmarked to finance
SSI sub-projects defined as enterprises with assets, excluding land and
buildings, not exceeding US$350,000 in the case of new sub-projects, and
US$500,000 in the case of expansion of sub-projects"'. About 362 of the
loan amount has been approved for SSI sub-projects.

15.      The latest loan to SYKB, the small and medium-scale industries
project (approved in May 1986) has been committed and disbursed at a rapid
rate. Currently, SYKB has approved 103 sub-projects (net of cancellations)
with a total amount of US$56.7 million (about 71S of SYKB's share of the
loan). The disbursement has been about US$25 million and ahead of schedule.
Sub-projects assisted under the loan would create about 20,000 jobs at an

average cost of US$12,000 each (excluding land and buildings). The major
industrial sub-sectors which have been beneficiaries of Bank-funded loans
are textile, chemical, machinery, food, metal products, and marble
industries. The majority of these projects are located in Istanbul (321),
Tekirdag (11X), Bursa (101), and Izmir (91). The ERR and IFRR were
calculated for sub-projects with a fixed investment of above US$750,000
each, ranging between 30% to 60S and 351 to 701 respectively. SYKB's
performance in utilizing the loan as reflected by good quality of
sub-project appraisal, financing of a large number of SSI sub-projects and
low cost per job has been very satisfactory.
Past Financial Results and Condition
16.      Profitability.  SYKB's financial statements for 1982-1986 are given
in Attachment 1 of this Annex and a sunmmary is given in Table 1. Net profit
increased from TL 0.4 billion in 1980 to TL 1.7 million in 1986, 32% of net
worth. SYKB's administrative expenses in relation to total assets declined
from 1.92 in 1982 to 1.41 in 1986 due to increase in volume of business and
effective cost control. This is satisfactory. SYKB's average interest
spread on assets for the last few years has been about 10 p.a. due mainly
to low interest rate on loans from its shareholders. In 1977, the
shareholders agreed to forgo interest on their loans in lieu of higher
dividends on their equity investment. As a result, SYKB's dividend payout
ratio was 80:20 in 1986 as compared to the limit of 82:18 permitted by
SYKB's Articles of Association. The actual returns to shareholders in
nominal terms on their investments in SYKB has been in line with interest
rates on term deposits or other financial instruments in Turkey. SYKB's
total assets increased from TL 10 billion at the end of 1980 to TL 73
billion at the end of 1986. In nominal terms they increased by over 600%.
The paid-in capital has increased from TL 400 million at the end of 1982 to
TL 3.6 billion a, the end of 1986.  In November 1987, SYKB's Board of
Directors authorized an increase in capital from TL 4 billion to TL 12
billion to be paid-in as required. Throughout this period SYKB's
debt/equity ratio has remained within the limits agreed with the Bank under
different loan agreements. The long-term debt/equity ratio has gone up from
6:1 at the end of 1984 to about 8:1 at the end of 1986 which is within the
maximum limit of 10:1 agreed with the Bank under the Small and Medium-scale
Industry project (2647-TU).
17.      Portfolio and Arrears.  Notwithstanding the difficult economic
condition, SYKB has built up a sound portfolio. However, SYKB's arrears
have increased over the past few years. This is primarily due to the
consecutive devaluations of the Lira during the last few years, very high
real interest rates and corporate insolvencies. SYKB has performed
reasonably well during this difficult period by: (i) following a
conservative lending policies; (ii) financing mainly expansion and
export-oriented projects which have higher returns; (A..) avoiding foreign

exchange risk by seeking coverage under FERIS for a large share of its
portfolio; and (iv) seeking adequate collaterals. Table 4 presents the
trend in arrears of more than 6 months.

18.      Performing loans are defined as loans with minor or no problems and
with little or no arrears. Non-performing loans are defined as loans in
court or with serious arrears problems over six months. A distribution of
SYBK's arrears by sub-sectors at the end of 1986 shows a similar pattern to
that of its portfolio. Four subsectors accounted for 71% of the arrears in
the following order: textiles (31Z), food (17%), machinery/metal products/
electronics (162) and chemicals (7X). SYKB's arrears of non-performing
loans have increased considerably since 1984. Many of these arrears are
associated with firms which had borrowed in foreign currency and had
undertaken foreign currency exchange risk under line of credits available
from the Bank, EIB and other foreign currency sources prior to the
introduction of FERIS. Furthermore, some of the recent year arrears are
attributed to: (i) delays in the completion of subprojects, and (ii)
short-term capital loans are presently costing an interest of up 70-85
percent to the enterprises. To overcome this problem, since mid 1985, SYKB
has increased the penalty interest rate on overdue payments to 701 from
622. SYBI also allows 6 months for delay in debt-servicing and thereafter
it normally enforces the bank guarantee. The bank guarantee letters and



- 59 -
ANNEX 7
Page 10 of 14
promissory notes generally cover about 80 percent of SYKB's portfolio and
the remaining is covered by mortgages and promissory notes.  Also, it seems
SYKB has been able to contain the level of arrears.  Total arrears as of
percent total loan portfolio and portfolio at risk-' have declined in the
first quarter of 1987.  SYKB plans to increase its provisions for bad debts
by TL 1.7 billion in 1986 and TL 2 billion in 1987, which is adequate to
cover the possible write-offs.
19..     SYKB's cash collection as a percentage of  total due for
collections has remained around 70% for the last two years. However, the
performance of the accounts under FERIS has been much better, with the
collection ratio of about 95b in the first quarter 1987. To maintain its
financial soundness SYKB should undertake evaluation of its ten hard core
problems with the view to restructure these projects. SYKB has agreed to
keep the Bank informed of the progress of the ten major cases which
constitute about 50% of arrears on quarterly basis. SYKB will continue with
the agreement reached under the textile project to maintain at least 5% of
its net annual income as a provision for bad and doubtful loans and
investments, up to a maximum of 2% of its loan and equity portfolio. To
achieve better arrears control, SYKB proposes to reorganize its supervision
activities to give greater emphasis to project implementation and
supenrision(para 8).
20.      Resources.  SYKB's resource mobilization thus far has been mainly
focussed on Central Bank rediscount facilities and own sources in the form
of paid-in capital and reserves for domestic currency financing
requirements, and the Bank, and to a lesser extent, EIB for foreign currency
financing requirements. Of the domestic resources, SYKB has approved TL
20.6 billion and has a deficit of about TL 1.0 billion which can be covered
by drawing on Central Bank rediscount facility. In 1986, for the first
time, SYKB successfully issued its own bonds in the domestic market
reflecting acceptance of SYKB as a solid and mature institution by the local
capital market. SYKB could also utilize this option to meet its domestic
resource financing requirements in the future.
III. PROSPECTS
Future Role and Diversification Program
21.      The development plan aims at increasing industrial investment in
the private sector at 7% p.a. Also it is envisaged that the industrial
production will increase by 7.32 p.a. over the nest several years. In this
light, SYKB will have an important role to play in industrial growth and
investment in the coming years. The Turkish Government will continue with



- 60 -
ANNEX 7
Page 11 of 14
its effort of continued improvement in the investment climate by providing
incentives to promote private industrial investment especially in
export-oriented industries. While SYKB will continue with its primary role
as a major DFI's by providing financing to private manufacturing sector,
SYKB plans to diversify its operations into non-manufacturing sectors and
financial services such as tourism sector and leasing. As a start, SYKB
plans to participate in the share of a leasing company to be established
jointly with national and international financial institutions. In the near
future operational role, SYKB will give high priorities to export-oriented
industries.
22.      SYKB plans to diversify its resource mobilization activities in the
following ways: (i) in its support of expanding the domestic capital market,
SYKB will promote public participation in investment through the issuing of
its own bonds, taking advantage of the confidence that it enjoys within the
domestic market, and (ii) SYKB will seek to obtain lines of credit abroad
from new sources. SYKB has started a dialogue with several German banks for
obtaining HERMES-backed credits and is exploring possibilities of obtaining
further resources from EIB. To support its new operations, SYKB will focus
its staff recruitment to professionals with experience in large-scale
project appraisal. To prepare staff for planned diversification programs,
SYKB has developed a well-balanced program of internal end external
training. SYKB's Board has approved overseas training programs for 15
members of its professional staff for 1987-1988 period. Currently, SYKB is
evaluating the domestic training programs offered by the Center of
International Banking Studies (CIBS) established under FSAL I..
Furthermore, to meet its resource diversification program in the futture,
SYTB plans on the establishment of a resource mobilization unit within the
Loans Department with initial staff of 2 in 1987 and to be fully staffed by
1988. SYKB's new plans are reflected in its revised Financial and
Operational Strategy Statement, which was discussed and agreed upon during
negotiations.
Future Operations
23.   Operational Forecast.  SYKB's future prospects are good.  SYKB's share
in the private sector manufacturing investment requirement in the
manufacturing sector during 1987-1991 is estimated at 4X, which is a
reasonable target. A summary of projected operations and key financial
results are given in Table 5.
24. SYKM's loan approvals are projected to increase at a real rate of
25-30 p.a. assuming an inflation rate of 30-35b p.a. This growth rate is
attainable for the following reasons: (i) private industrial investment in
Turkey is expected to continue to grow at a real rate of 62 p.a.; (ii)
SYKB's marketing and promotional capabilities, and (iii) SYKM's strong
pipelines.

The project pipeline of SYKB as of November 1, 1987, consisted of loan
applications for US$34 million equivalent in foreign currency and TL 5
billion (US$7 million) in local currency. The projects included in the
pipeline are mainly subsectors with strong export share/growth base such as,
textile (352), metal products/machinery/electronics (20%), chemicals (101),
and leather and hides (91).
Proiected Resource Requirements and Financing Plan
25.      During 1987-1989, SYKB plans to lend about TL 230 billion with
about TL 180 billion (US$158 million equivalent) in foreign exchange. As of
April 30, 1987, SYKB's untied foreign exchange resources available for new
commitments consisted of the remaining of the credit line from the Bank US$
24 million. To meet its lending targets, SYKB expects to raise resources by
increasing foreign currencies from its traditional and new sources. The
proposed Bank loan of US$50 million plus the remaining of the existing SMI
loan (US$24 million) will meet portion of the foreign currency
requirements. SYKB has opened dialogue with German banks for obtaining
Hermes-backed credit (US$50 million). SYKM is planning to approach its
Governments for approval shortly after certain clarifications are obtained
from the bidding banks.   SYKB plans to meet the remaining resource gap
(US$34 million) through open markets sources (such as the Japanese Capital
Market) and EIB. With the background of successful resource mobilization in
the domestic market, the time seems appropriate for SYKB to test
international markets by raising a medium-term foreign currency credit.
While continuing with its efforts of getting funds from Germany (HERMES
credits) and EIB, SYKB must focus its attention on international credit
markets, namely, the euro-currency market. Towards this objective, the
proposed resource cell must keep a watch on these markets, create a data
base (exchange rates, interest rates and the liquidity), and cultivate
contacts with banks and merchant banks locally and abroad. In view of a
sound balance sheet and operational efficiency demonstrated by SYKB, it
should be possible to raise medium term credits from Euro-markets.
26.      Total local currency loan commitments of SYKB during 1987-1989
period are estimated at about TL 51 billion. SYKB plans to meet its local
currency requirements largely through increases in paid-in capital and
retained earnings, borrowings from central bank, and proceeds of issued
bonds. To meet its resource mobilization program, SYKB will create a
resource mobilization unit within the Loans Department. The equity
investments of SYKB are expected to remain low (TL 800 million in 1986) and
would increase at an average rate of 101 p.a. during 1987-1991.
Prolected Financial Condition and Results

major adverse economic problems in Turkey. SYKB's total assets are
projetted to grow at an annual nominal rate of 552 from TL 113 billion in
1987 to TL 655 billion in 1991. Loans are projected to grow from TL 52
billion in 1986 to TL 601 billion in 1991. The growth in assets will be
financed mainly by medium- and long-term borrowings which will grow from TL
54.8 billion in 1986 to TL 544 billion. SYKB's financial structure will
continue to be sound with debt/equity ratio below the 10:1 debt/equity limit
during 1987-1991 period. SYKB will maintain 10:1 debtiequity ratio and
lower by increasing its equity mainly through increase in paid-in capital
and retained earnings. SYKB's paid-in capital is projected to increase from
TL 4 billion in 1987 to TL 25 billion in 1991. SYKB's profit after tax is
also expected to increase by at least five times from TL 4 billion in 1987
to TL 22 billion in 1991. The return on equity is expected to be in the
range of 50S during 1987-1991 which is satisfactory. With higher operating
volume and an expected increase in loan size, administrative expenses as
percentage of total assets are projected to decline from 1.22 in 1987 to
0.81 by 1991. The liquidity position of SYKB will continue to be
satisfactory. The Debt Service Coverage Ratiol' would remain above 1.1
between 1987-1991. Also, SYKB expects cash collection performance to
improve greatly over the next three years. SYKB's estimates are that
average cash collection during 1987-1988 period will increase to over 901.
The cash collected as percent of fallen due for the first quarter of 1987
stood at 91X. Provisioos will remain at 52 of total loans outstanding
during 1987-1991 period 1which is satisfactory. zl

Terms of Reference
ObQietyi
1.       Private sector is expected to play a major role in Turkish industry
over the next few years. The role of the private sector in the manufacturing
industry will be crucial especially if the export drives were to be
sustained. It is, therefore, important that the private sector is provided
with adequate investment funds in a most efficient manner. The study aims at
analyzing investment needs of private industry during the late 1980s and 1990s
and identifying vehicles which could be used to satisfy the investment
requirement.
Scone of the stwdy and methodology
2.       The study will carry out a review of the past financing pattern of
private industry in Turkey. It would discuss the importance of various
sources of financing (equity, retained earnings, domestic loans, foreign
loans, supplier credits, and other sources). It will assess the roles of the
concerned intermediaries, i.e development banks, commercial banks, merchant
banks, bilateral and multilateral institutions, as well as the capital
markets. The study will review the performance of these intermediaries within
the overall macro-economic environments which prevailed in Turkey during
1977-1986.
3.       The consultants to ba employed by the Treasury would rely on past
reports produced by Turkish and international organizations. This review is
to be supplemented by interviews of 30 major industrial firms in Turkey and
major financial intermediaries and monetary authority. The consultants would
also draw on experience of other countries with similar stage of economic
development.
mentof th stud
4.       The study would be managed by a task force to be formed by the
concerned Turkish organizations. This could include the Treasury, Central
Bank of Turkey, TSKB, 8YKB, Bankers' Association of Turkey, and the Chamber of
Comuarce and Industry. The consultants employed by the Government under the
Industrial Export Development Project would work with the task force. The
study 'tould commence in July and is expected to be completed by December 31,
1988.
