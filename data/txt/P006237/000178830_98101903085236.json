The unit cost for this 360-MW installation\n            (excluding interest during construction) would be about\n            US$175 per kw, which is considered to be low cost hydro. The\n            generated energy would be delivered to the interconnected\n            system over 345-kv and 138-kv transmission lines. This\n            transmission system has been planned along the lines\n            recommended in the South-Central Power Study and has been\n            confirmed by a recent review in connection with the proposed\n            loans. The Second Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project will\n            assist in financing a 360 MW hydroelectric power plant, a\n            400 MW hydroelectric power plant, a 400 MW hydroelectric\n            power plant, and associated 345 kv and 138 kv transmission facilities."}, "docdt": "1968-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
