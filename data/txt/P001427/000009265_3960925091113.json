The Bank played an important role in the\n            implementation of this project. The principal lessons\n            learned from implementation of this project are summarized\n            below under three headings: (a) centralized workshops, (b)\n            technical assistance, and (c) quality of local leadership. A\n            thorough assessment of proposed changes, including a review\n            of alternative strategies for attaining them is a\n            prerequisite for bringing about change and reform. The\n            effectiveness of the technical team was affected, partly by\n            a drastic modification of its composition, early arrival of\n            the experts and poor utilization of fellowships. Fellowships\n            in certain areas, such as agricultural education, could not\n            be awarded, because of a paucity of qualified candidates.\n            The quality of local leadership is the key element in\n            bringing about institutional development. The Bank's\n            input, in terms of software, was extremely limited. The\n            provision of an expert was deleted, and the fellowships were\n            modified to comprise short study tours. Yet, the Forestry\n            Training Institute (FTI) has been able to establish itself\n            as an outstanding training institution, partly because of\n            the high quality of leadership exercised by its faculty. The\n            right choices of faculty members were critical factors in\n            bringing about changes."}, "docdt": "1987-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
