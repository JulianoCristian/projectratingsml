                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All key issues raised in the last ISR have been resolved.
                         i) The Ministry of Economy expects that the Ministry of Finance will agree to fund the operational costs during the grace period (July 1-October 31).
                         ii) The Ministry of Economy has found alternatives for funding the consultants to the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) Secretariat (through the USAID BRITE project and IFC,
                         although the agreements are still being finalized).
                         iiI) The PIU/MoE has made progress on the description of how the project has achieved "MSTQ system development meeting the World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments". A
                         summary is included in this ISR, and more detail will be included in the client's implementation completion report, as expected.
