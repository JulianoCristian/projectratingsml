                         The Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) remains on track towards reaching its development objectives and completing its outputs by the closing date. The Metrology,
                         Standardization, Testing and Quality (MSTQ) component is proceeding well. Procurement is proceeding according to plan, and the clients are pleased with delivery. The National
                         Institute of Standards and Metrology (NISM) is beginning to to implement its restructuring into the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) and the National Institute of Standardization
                         (NIS).

                         The project's credit line component, which was added with the CEP Additional Financing in 2009, has been very successful. The credit line was fully disbursed six months ahead of
                         schedule, by December 2011. Success was due to the characteristics of the financing made available, which address clear financing needs of companies in Moldova, as well as the
                         active involvement and coordination activities of the Credit Line Directorate and the Project Implementation Unit. The government has now decided to manage the repayments of
                         credit line loans in a revolving fund, from which 17 additional loans had been made as December 31, 2012, for a total of USD7 million (above the original credit line amount of USD
                         22.5 million).
                         Demand for the Matching Grant Facility has grown, as economic conditions in Moldova improve and enterprises enjoy higher profitability, which in turn increases their ability to fund
                         the self-financed portion of activities supported by the matching grant. As of December 31, 2012, 419 matching grants have been disbursed to enterprises. Because the grant cycle is
                         annual, the project is expected to surpass its target of 460 matching grants by June 2013.
                         The Business Environment component is proceeding well. Regulatory Impact Assessment became mandatory for all new legislation affecting business operations as of 2008, and the
                         work of the CEP-funded consultants at the Regulatory Impact Assessment Secretariat ensures that this is implemented smoothly. The 2012 domestic Cost of Doing Business survey
                         showed that all of the project's targets in the area of improving the business environment have been achieved, though progress on some indicators has plateaued.
                         Additionally, the private credit bureau is functioning, with 100% of banks reporting to it.
