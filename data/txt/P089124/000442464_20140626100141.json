Moldova were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            given the sustained high degree of Borrower's ownership\n            of and commitment to the program, even a very complex and\n            ambitious program can be implemented successfully. The\n            selection of two professional organizations (chamber of\n            commerce and industry (CCI) and credit line directorate\n            (CLD)) to administer the matching grant facility (MGF) and\n            the line of credit operation (LOC) went a long way to ensure\n            successful implementation. The government must be commended\n            for utilizing project funds to hire such competent agencies.\n            The project design should have taken into consideration the\n            complexity and time required in procuring complex machinery\n            which was to be installed in existing refurbished buildings.\n            It is recommended that the Bank, in collaboration with the\n            counterparts, invest more time in planning complex project\n            activities (such as high precision metrological instruments\n            and the facilities to house them), involving relevant\n            technical experts and allowing for an adequate timeframe,\n            avoiding delays that were experienced under the project.\n            While the MGF component was successful overall, the\n            component can have had a greater impact if it were not for\n            constraints on timelines presented by the way in which the\n            MGF administrator's CCI contract was handled. The main\n            essential components for a successful private sector\n            development (PSD) project which focuses on small and medium\n            enterprises (SMEs) in a country the size of Moldova can be\n            considered to have: (i) proper regulatory reforms for a\n            better business environment and ease of doing business; (ii)\n            upgrading of the metrology, standardization, testing, and\n            quality (MSTQ) systems to gain access to foreign markets and\n            boosting competitiveness; and (iii) access to finance and\n            technology services. Well-functioning implementation unit,\n            staffed with competent and committed people and fairly\n            remunerated is essential for a successful implementation of\n            a multi-component and a complex project."}, "docdt": "2013-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
