                         The team's overall impression is that the Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) remains on track towards reaching itsdevelopment objectives and completing its outputs by
                         the closing date. Previous delays with procurement of some equipment under theMetrology, Standardization, Testing and Quality (MSTQ) component have been overcome. The
                         National Institute of Standards andMetrology (NISM) is on track to implement its restructuring into the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) and the NationalInstitute of Standardization
                         (NIS) by the end of 2012, and the selection of a strategic twinning partner to build capacity inNISM/NIM is ongoing. The project's credit line component, which was added with the

                         CEP Additional Financing in 2009, has been verysuccessful. The credit line was fully disbursed six months ahead of schedule, by December 2011. Success was due to
                         thecharacteristics of the financing made available, which address clear financing needs of companies in Moldova, as well as the activeinvolvement and coordination activities of the
                         Credit Line Directorate and the Project Implementation Unit. Demand for the MatchingGrant Facility has grown, as economic conditions in Moldova improve and enterprises enjoy
                         higher profitability, which in turnincreases their ability to fund the self-financed portion of activities supported by the matching grant. As of June 30, 2012, 416matching grants have
                         been disbursed to enterprises, which is just below the project's end target of 460. The Business Environmentcomponent is proceeding well. Regulatory Impact Assessment became
                         mandatory for all new legislation affecting business operationsas of 2008, and the work of the CEP-funded consultants at the Regulatory Impact Assessment Secretariat ensures that
                         this isimplemented smoothly. The 2012 domestic Cost of Doing Business survey showed that all of the project's targets in the area ofimproving the business environment have been
                         achieved, though progress on some indicators has plateaued. Additionally, the privatecredit bureau is functioning, with 100% of banks reporting to it. Due to these positive evolutions,
                         the pace of the projectimplementation has accelerated overall, and the disbursement ratio is significantly greater than in November 2011.

                         reimbursement of beneficiary enterprises from the Matching Grant Facility (MGF); and (c) utilization of savings of US$2 million for additional activities.

                         Notwithstanding the progress to date and the CEP AF implementation ahead of schedule, in its communication with the client the team has underscored the importance of
                         accelerating the implementation of ongoing activities under the original project. Procurement of US$2-3 million of equipment under the MSTQ system is underway. The PIU is working
                         on updating the procurement plan, which the project team will review in detail along with the PIU. If there are any expected savings, the project team will work with the PIU to ensure
                         that all project funds are used for activities that support the project's Development Objectives by June 30, 2013.
