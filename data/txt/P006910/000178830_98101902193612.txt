INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
FOR A HIGHWAY STUDIES PROJECT
I submit the following report and recomnendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Costa Rica for the equivalent of $1.4 million to
help finance a highway studies project. The loan would have a term of 10
years, including a 2-year grace period with interest at 7-1/4 percent.
PART i - THE ECONOMY
2.        An updating economic report entitled "Memorandum on Recent Economic
Developments and Prospects of Costa Rica! was distributed to the Board on
May 4, 1972. A country data sheet is attached as Annex II. The long-run
development performance of Costa Rica has been among the best in Latin
America, combining high average economic growth rates with a continuous
effort to distribute more broadly the benefits of development. During the
past decade, output expansion of over 6 percent per year in real terms,
coupled with some reduction in the population growth rate, resulted in an
increase in per capita current GNP from $420 in 1960 to over $560 in 1971.
Also in spite of a labor force growing at over 3 percent per annum, open
unemployment was kept at a low 4-5 percent of the economically active pop-
ulation. The absence of a standing army and minimal defense expenditures
permitted the public sector to channel a large share of resources to the
economic and social sectors.   Today almost nine-tenths cf the population
are literate and the mortality rate is one of the lowest in the Hemisphere.
However, the vagaries associated with heavy dependence on a few export
items as a source of income and growth, together with periods of overly
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, have led to periodic financial
difficulties. At present Costa Rica is going through one of these periods
of serious fiscal and balance of payments stringency.
3.        The Administration which came to office in May 1970 made mobiliza-
tion of idle productive resources through credit expansion a major goal of
economic policy. During 1971, credit to the private sector increased by
over 27 percent, and a large share of banking system credit was financed by
Central Bank rediscounting. Central Government revenue grew by only five
percent, because of increased import exemptions, a fall in coffee export
taxes and a decline in profits of the banana companies, while expenditures
increased by over 20 percent. The level of prices increased somewhat more
than in previous years, although the main demand pressures were translated
into rising imports, which grew by about 30 percent in 1970 and 10 percent
in 1971. This unfortunately coincided with a weakening in world coffee and



banana prices, so that export income stagnated in 1971. By mid-1971, net
interrational reserves fel1 to the equivalent; of less than four weeks of
imports. The rate of real GDP growth also slowed down to around _..5 percent
in 1970-71, and is likely to be no more than 4 percent in 1972.
4.        In an effort to restore financial stability, the Costa Rican
authorities have taken various measures during the past eighteen month^Ls.
Tn June 1971, the Central Bank reintrod4uced a dual exchange rate, sil".r
to the one that had been in ex stence in the 1°o7-69 period, and imposec
surcharges on non-essertial imports.   However, this new exchange policy
did not tackle the major source of the problem, excess aggregate demand.
Consequently, early in 1972, a more comprehensive package of stabilization
measures was implemented.   It included the introduction of various taxes
aired at raising fiscal revenues and controlling import growth through
increased conswuption and income -taxes and taxation o- remittances abrOad,
a stricter nionetary progrEam, and the shift of various import categories
from the official to The more depreciated free exchange rate.   However, -thcbe
efforts have not yet yielcded the expected results, largely because the grcwth
of government revenues has been held back by the increasing flow of duty-
exempt imports from Centratl America and low income tax yields.   As a result,
the budget deficit continues at about the same high level as in 1971 (or
about 30 percent of current revenues), and the Government has had to finance
a part of the gaD from the Central Bank and Jrom foreign commercial banks.
Some relief is in the offing:   higher coffee ex-Dort prices will lead to an
mprovement in current revenue performance in the coming months, an(d the
recent agreement with CACM countries on the appropriate exchange rate for
regional trade will reduce the volume of duty free imports. However, a
comprehensive program to improve the fiscal situation has not been elaborated
yet.  Although e strict control on expenditure growth will have to continue
to be exercised, several legal constraints limit the extent to which the
Central To-erwnrent can effectively cut expenditures in the short run.   As
such, any; fiscal program will require action mainly on the revenue side
through tex tax- easures and stricter tax administration.
5.        Aljthough net international reserves have increased somew4hat dur-ing
1972, a 1 4rge amount of import payment arrears remains.  A part of the
apparent arrears have in fact been paid off through the free exchange market,
and the authorities recently paid off the remaining arrears to other Central
American countrres;  however. the remaining volume to be paid to the rest
of the world rerAins substan.tial and is probably over $50 million.   The auth-
orities are preparing a plan for the elimination of these arrears and the
placing on a prI mpDt basis o0 those  nTmoort payments which are at the official
rate of exchange.  Par, of the plan will undoubtedly involve some reform of
the exchange system, along t.he lines recently introduced for transactions
with Central kmerica.   Under the agreement between Costa Rica and its CACM
Dartners olf October 1 J, 1972, abvout 75 percent of Costa Rican imports from
the CACM will be payable at the 'free" rate of ¢8.60 per U.S. dollar, instead
of the official selling rate of 4S.65-   Tn order to compensate Costa Rican
exporters to the CAi"' for th(- higher cost of imported components, exports
will now receive an effective exchange rate of ¢7.60, with half the proceeds
at the official rate .nd the other half at the "freeT rate.



6.        The Bank has kept up a dialogue with the Costa Rican authorities
about fiscal and financial policies which are necessary for the orderly
exploitation of Costa Rica's substantial development potential. Igportant
steps have been taken in the last year - including the tax measures, the
monetary program and the partial exchange realignment with Central America
noted above - but further efforts are necessary on the fiscal, monetary and
balance of payments fronts. For the longer run, Costa Rica has the potentia}
for rapid economic growth. Substantial progress has been achieved, with
pablic su-pport in reduclng the rate of population inoreaasc. Considerable
potential exists in agricu?ltnire and rmining, while manufacturing could continue
to expand ranidly if the Central American Common Market can be successfully
restructured.  In order to make good this potential, a h-gh level of public
investment will be required but will oray be feasible if sufficient public
savings can be generated.  The Bank's last economic report estimated that,
if the same overall growth rates as the 1960's were to }e achieved in the
present decade. gross public external capital inflows cf :,320 million would
be required in 1971-76.  This should he ;nttainable withozt, ny major in-
crease in the level of external public debt ser-rice, which presently absorbs
about 13-14 percent of export earnizngs, so long as Costa Rica can continue
to rely on official aid for the bulk of its long-term official capital require-
ments and can minimize m-edium-term borrowing from commercial sources.
7.        Apart from the Bank, external ffinancing is provided principally by
USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (1IB) and the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAII has been active mainly in
agriculture, road maintenance and construction and health. 17FB has been
financing mainly agricuitural and industrial credit, water supply, housing,
feeder roads, rural electrification and vocatiorral and agricultural education.
CABEI is active in financing projects which have a regional impact, principally
in transport, industry and telecommunications. The past lending of these
agencies is sumaarized below:

PART II - BMJK GROUP OPER'ATIONS TIN COSTA RICA
8.        Costa Rica has to date received fourteen Bank loans totalling
$117.9 million and one IDA credit for $4.6 million.   As of October 31,
1972, the Bank and IDA held $101.8 million, including )'43.9 mrillion not
yet disbursed. The latest coeration, a loan for agricultural credit, was
signed in June 1972.  The next loan to Costa Rica would be for an educat.ion
project, which we plan to present for your consideration during the com-ni,
year.
9.        Execution of Bank Group financed projects has, on the whole, bee!
satisfactory, although there have been delays in implementing ongoing lo-ns
f'or power and agricultural credit, and cost overruns have occurred on pro-
jects in power and highways.  Annex I contains a surmmary statement of Baunk
Group operations as of October 31, 1972, as well as notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
10.       In the past Bank and IDA lending to Costa Rica has been fairly
diversified, including operations in agriculture, industry, highways, power
and telecommunications. Our proposed lending strategy for FY73-77, which
complements tJhat of other international development agencies, concentrates
on removing serious bottlenecks in the transportation sector, satisfying
rising demands for power and telecommunications services, supporting the
agricultural diversification efforts of the Government and providing fina--
cial assistance to help implement a new national plan for educational deve-
lopment. In the area of technical assistance, the Bank is currently acting
as executing agency for a UTTDP-financed project to study the transport needs
cf the heavi?.y congested San jose Metropolitan Area, from which concrete
project prcoposals are expected.  The Bank is also giving financial assistance
to the first stage of a pernanent unemployment survey in Costa Rica to be
implemented by the Natlonal LTniVersity.
11.       IFC has made one -nvestment in the form of a loan of $0.6 million
in Costa Rica to Productos de Concreto S.A., a company which manufactures
concrete products. The loan has been fully repaid.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
12.       Details on the transport sector may be found in the Appraisal
Report for the Second Highway Project (PTR-2b, dated March 18, 1970). Given
the geographical distances between the main centers of production and Costa
Rica's principal ports, transport plays an important role in the economy,
which depends heavily on exports of primary commodities and imports of
machinery and intermediate goods. Expanding regional trade and the need to
open up new lands for productive use have also increased the pressure for
a more satisfactory transportation network. Nevertheless, the country has
topographical and climatic features which make provision of the necessary
facilities both difficult ard costly.



-5-
13.       Railways have traditionally served the needs of the banana and
cocoa plantations. However, over the last two decades highways have re-
placed railroads as the main mode of internal transportation, largely
because highway transport is more appropriate for the generally short
transport hauls and the small amount of bulk traffic. Today roads carry
about 83 percent of all cargo in the country and account for 97 percent
of all passenger-km; railways account for 16 and 2 percent, respectively,
and airplanes and ships for the remainder. As of 1970 Costa Rica had a
total road network of some 18,800 km, of which 1,500 km were national,
900 km regional and the balance feeder roads. Fifty-two percent of national
and regional highways and less than one percent of feeder roads were paved.
During the last decade Costa Rica has received external financial assistance
for road construction from the IBRD, IDA, IDB, USAID and CABEI.
14.       The Ministry of Public Works and Transport is responsible for the
formulation and implementation 6f national transport policy. In the high-
way sector, the Ministry exercises responsibility through the General Direc-
torate of Highways and the Directorate of the Inter-American Highway. High-
way design standards have been revised during the last few years and are now
appropriate to conditions in Costa Rica. The quality of recent highway con-
struction has generally been satisfactory; however, maintenance needs sub-
stantial improvement.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
15.       No separate appraisal report has been prepared for the proposed
highway studies project. The proposed loan would help finance a feasibility
study, the justification for which was already established in the appraisal
report for the Second Highway Project. Should the roads analyzed in the
feasibility study prove to be technically and economically justified, the
loan would also support detailed engineering. Updating information was
collected by a Bank mission which visited Costa Rica in August 1972, and
negotiations were held in WXashington in November 1972.  The Government was
represented by Messrs. E. Angulo (Ministry of Public 'lorks) and C. Solera
(Costa Rican Embassy in i'Jashington, D.C.).
Background
16.       At present there is no all-weather highway connecting Costa Rica's
main port of Limon with the capital city of San Jose. In April 1970, the
Bank made a $15.7 million loan (Loan No. 664-CR) to help finance construction
of a road extending from Limon to Siquirres, about one-third of the distance
between the port and the capital. Construction of that road is proceedirg on
schedule, and about 40 percent of the work is completed. The Bank lenr1ing
program for Costa Rica includes a follow-up highway loan in FY75, which woaud
help finance construction of a new or improved road for the remaining two-
thirds of the distance (San Jose to Siquirres), as well as for a related road
between San Jose and Puerto Viejo, which may share over part of its length a
common alignment with the San Jose-Siquirres road (see Map). The currently
proposed loan would help finance the feasibility study and detailed engineer-
ing of these two roads.



-6-
17.       Project preparation of both roads is urgently required.   A {10
km partially paved road currently connects San Jose with Siquirres.   The
last 36 km of the road between Pavones and Siouirres was constructed with
Bank Group assistance (Loan No. 299-CR/Credit NIo. 10-CR, signed in October
1961). The existing road traverses difficult mountain terrain, and because
of numerous sharp curves arnd long sections where grading is steep, traffic
must travel at very low speeds, resulting in hligh operating costs.  The
pavement is in poor condition, due mostly to heavy rainfall in the area,
inadequate maintenance and the large number of heav,y vehicles which use the
road. Once the Siquirres-Limon highway is completed, congestion on the
road from Siquirres to San Jose wiTll becone ve,ry serious.  The 90 km Sar
Jose-Puerto Viejo road is in worse condition than the San Jose-Siquirres
road. Some h40 km betwqeen San Jose and Vera Blanca were paved about 30 years
ago and have since deteriorated considerably, while the other 50 km is a
low-standard gravel road wihich crosses mountainous terrain.  Given -their
cormmon alignment option, the joint execution of the feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for both roads is much more economical.
18.       Preliminary analysis of the two roads based on rough estimates of
construction and maintenance costs, expected t;raffic and road user savings
indicates that their construction would yield an economic rate of return
of about 18 percent.
Project Description and Financing
19.       It had been planned to finance the feasibility study (but not the
detailed engineering) for these twJo roads under Loan No. 664-CR, but in
view of the substantial cost overrun on the construction of the Siquirres-
Limon road covered by that Loan, it row appears desirable to devote the
whole amount of Loan No. 6'64-C2. to finance construction and to cover the
costs of the feasibility study plus the detailed engineering out of the new
loan. Corresponding amendments would be made to the Agreement covering
Loan No. 664-CR.
20.       A contract for the construction of the Siquirres-Limon road was
awarded in early 1971 to the lowest evaluated bidder SAOPLM (Italian/Vene-
zuelan consortium), but for an amount some 30 percent above the appraisal
estimate (excluding contingencies). Since the contract was awarded, some
further cost increases have occurred with the result that the total cost
of construction and construction supervision is now estimated at $22.5
million, with a foreign exchange component of $15.8 million, as compared
with the appraisal estimate of .$18.6 million (including contingencies),
with a foreign exchange component of $13.0 million.   These various increases
are due largely to the adverse physical characteristics of the region which
both make road construction very costly and also make it difficult to pre-
dict just how costs may behave. It also happens that there was a poor res-
ponse to the invitation to bid on this project. The cost increases have
reduced the rate of return on the project from about 17 percent to 1i per-
cent, which is still acceptable.  The Government has accepted the resporisib-
ility for financing the full costs of the project, including interest during
construction, that are not covered by the Bank.



-7-
21.       The feasibility study will examine two alternative routes for each
of the twro roads concerned (see Map), and the further expenditure of funds
on detailed engineering would be conditional upon positive findings of
the feasibility study and the use of consultants acceptable to the Bank.
The feasibility study is expected to be completed by June 1073 and the
detailed engineering by about June 1974.
22.       The cost of the feasibility study is already knowin, a contract
having been awarded in March 1972 to the consortium Baltodano-Echancli-Lara/
Edwards and Kelcey (Costa Rica/U.S.).   The cost of detailed engineerin-
will depend somewhat upon whether the feasibility studyr recoranends a nartial
common alianment, or separate alignments for the twJo roads;  the provision
for contingencies is designed to cover the additional costs which wTould
arise in the latter case.
23.       On this basis the total cost of the feasibility study and detoiled
engineering for the two roads is estimated at a maximum of $2 million (see
details in Annex III).  The proposed loan would finance 70 percent of these
costs, including interest and other charges during execution.
Retroactive Financing
24.       The proposed loan provides for retroactive financing, within a
limit of $25o,ooo, in respect of expenditures incurred on the feasibilitY
study since March 1, 1972.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRENTS ANDS AUTHORITY
25.       The draft Loan Agreement betwieen the Bank and the Republic of'
Costa 'Rica, the report of the Committee provided for in Article ITI,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a iResolutior
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
26.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions to reflect the
arrangement described in paragraph 19 above. Section 7.04 of the (iraft
Loan Agreement and Schedule 4 thereto, contain the amendments to the Loan
Agreement for Loan No. 664-CR, dated rYpril 2, 1970.
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan wouldl comply x;ith the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No.
538      Agricultural Credit Project:   US$3.') million of June 5, 968.
The project had a very slow start, mainly because funds for croedtQ
were available from other external sources, project unit staff
were unsatisfactory and participating commercial banks had liutlce
experience in preparing detailed fa:m plans. The situation o--.
to improve in 1970;  by August 31,   971 the loan had been fully
committed and US$2.7 million had been disbursed by end Octobe:r
1972. Disbursements will extend up to March 1973.
631      Third Power Project:  US$12.0 million of July 10, 1969.
Project execution is about 24 montths behind schedule, and costs
have increased some 60 percent above appraisal estimates, due
primarily to tunnelling difficulties and to initial lack of
organization and experience. There is still about one kilometer
of difficult tunnelling to be done; the project is under close
supervision. The Borrower has arranged to finance the overrun
with loans from foreign commrcial banks.
632      Second Telecommunications Project:   ULCW65 million of July 10, 1969.
Project execution has been satisfactory and the loan is expected to
be fully disbursed by December 1972.
664      Siquirres-Limon Highway Project:   US$15.7 million of April 2, 1O970.
See paragraph 20 above.
800        Fourth Power Project:  US$6.5 million of February 24, 1972.
The loan became effective in June 1972 and the project is
proceeding satisfactorily.
801        Third Telecommunications Project:   US$17.5 million of February
24,'1972. 
The loan became effective in June 1972 and the project is pro-
ceeding according to schedule.
827        Second Agricultural Credit Project:   US$9.0 million of June
5,_ 1972.-
The loan has not yet become effective because of delays in
obtaining Congressional ratification of the documents. Par-
ticipating banks have, however, already commenced lending to
beneficiaries and progress is satisfactory.
