 outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: in this case,\n            budget support was particularly successful. It should\n            probably occupy a major place in that type of emergency\n            assistance program, notably when the two following\n            conditions are met: (i) the government did not wait for\n            donor assistance to design and begin to implement activities\n            aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis; and (ii) the\n            emergency assistance operation is not an isolated\n            development policy operation; it is integrated into larger\n            budget support activities supporting a comprehensive policy\n            reform package adequately prepared and supervised by the\n            government and the World Bank. The respective obligations of\n            the government and the World Food Program (WFP) should have\n            been more clearly defined. Ideally, a Memorandum of\n            Understanding (MOU) specifying what should be done might\n            have provided the legal framework and the incentive for a\n            more expeditious treatment of school feeding activities and\n            quick adoption of practical measures to handle unforeseen\n            operational problems."}, "docdt": "2010-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
