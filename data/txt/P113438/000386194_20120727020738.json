PRICES\n            CRISIS RESPONSE", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Food Crisis Response\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Burundi were as\n            follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was significant; Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the choice of\n            instruments and policy measures for an emergency food crisis\n            intervention needs to take into account the local causes of\n            poverty and hunger. In the case of the Burundi food crisis\n            operation, recent sector work emphasized the centrality of\n            long-run constraints to agricultural productivity to these\n            problems, while the analysis in the program document gave\n            the impression that the main problem for Burundi was\n            short-term in nature caused by the 2007-08 spikes in world\n            commodity prices. For budget support as for other\n            operations, it is difficult to assess results in the absence\n            of a clear framework setting out links between policy\n            actions, outputs, and outcomes and of baseline measures of\n            the outcomes against which progress can be measured. The\n            food crisis grant operation for Burundi did not clearly\n            specify the links between the various actions that were\n            supported and the outcomes underpinning project objectives.\n            Scaling up of safety nets is a common strategy in an\n            emergency situation, but expanding a program to new areas\n            may take time. In the case of Burundi, not all schools had\n            the necessary infrastructure to support the feeding program,\n            and local management had to be put in place in the new areas."}, "docdt": "2012-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
