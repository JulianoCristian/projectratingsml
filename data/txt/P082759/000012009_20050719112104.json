This simplified Implementation Completion Report\n            conveys the following findings and implications for\n            subsequent operations. A stable political environment\n            contributed to the continued, successful implementation of\n            macroeconomic and structural reforms in Vietnam. Building a\n            broad-based consensus and strong government commitment\n            through the preparation of the Comprehensive Poverty\n            Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), minimized the risky\n            (and potential) erosion of political support, and the\n            likelihood of policy reversals due to political changes. The\n            availability of technical assistance grants from donors, and\n            strong and close Bank team support, plays a key role in\n            low-income countries with weak technical working level\n            capacity, especially in reforms in the State-owned\n            enterprises (SOE), and banking sectors. The continued\n            efforts within such coordination, proved successful in both\n            project design and implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
