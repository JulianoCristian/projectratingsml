3. Program Description

Concise Description of the Overall Program

In 2002, Vietnam adopted the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) that was
widely recognized as a blue print for development with strong national ownership. The CPRGS, and its
subsequent updates, embodied the country overall reform program. These documents translated the
vision delineated in the Ten-Year Strategy for 2001-2010 into concrete actions to steer the economy
toward a "market-economy with socialist orientation." The preparation of the CPRGS involved a wide
range of stakeholders and was built on empirical analysis; it enumerated development targets, identified
appropriate policies to attain them, and aligned resources to those policies. Among its key targets are the
Vietnam Development Goals (VDGs), the localized version of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The CPRGS's program rests on three broad pillars interconnected with cross-cutting themes:

 · Pillar I: High growth through a transition to a market economy, requiring the implementation of an
      ambitious structural reform agenda.
 · Pillar II: An equitable, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable pattern of growth through
      appropriate sectoral and social policies and programs.
 · Pillar III: Adoption of a modern public administration, legal and governance system, essential to
      attain the first two goals.

In 2003 the CPRGS was expanded with a chapter discussing the role of infrastructure in promoting
economic and social development.             1  In November 2003, the first CPRGS Progress Report was issued
which evaluated Vietnam's performance in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction, reviewed
policy implementation in 2002-2003, and identified challenges ahead.

Brief Description of the Operation and its Relationship to the Program

The above reform program has been supported by the Bank through a series of Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs) covering a five-year period.              2  The Bank's annual PRSCs to Vietnam support
the implementation of the CPRGS, evaluate its impacts, and draw lessons for subsequent adjustments of
strategies and policies. While the reform program supported by PRSCs focuses on policy actions, its
implementation is expected to bring about improved economic and social outcomes. These outcomes can
be compared to key indicators selected during the preparation of the annual PRSC. The indicators
represent measurable yardsticks to assess progress in the implementation of the structural, social and
governance reform agendas. Initiated by PRSC 1 and supported by PRSC 2, the objectives of the reform
program continue under PRSC 3 as follows:

    · Promotion of greater internal and external competition, endorsement of an acceleration in the
         divestiture of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the restructuring of state-owned commercial
         banks (SOCBs), improvement in transparency and accountability in SOE operations and in the
         banking sector, and support for the establishment of a sound regulatory framework for policy
         lending by the government.              Overall, these measures should lead to a better allocation of
         resources, economic growth and job creation.

    · Promotion of human development through an expanded budget appropriation and higher quality
         standards for education, through resources to cover the health care costs of the poor and through

1   The inclusion of this chapter fills what the Government perceived as an important gap in the original CPRGS.
2   Consideration of such an extended time horizon is warranted by the fact that the CPRGS will be mainstreamed into the five-
    year plan 2006-2010.

         mechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, especially in upland and
         ethnic minority areas. The credit supported important measures to improve environmental and
         water resources management as well.

    · Increase in transparency and accountability of public finances, simplification of administrative
         procedures, and steps towards curbing corruption as part of a broader effort to build modern
         governance. Other actions supported by the credit aim at revamping planning processes, moving
         away from a command approach towards the alignment of policies and resources to the
         attainment of well-specified development goals.

In line with the programmatic approach, PRSC 3 is based on progress reflected in key policy actions,
summarized in Table 1.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

Overall, PRSC 3 has achieved notable progress in supporting Vietnam to maintain the solid course of
actions, the direction, and the momentum of the reforms with a general fulfillment of its stated goals
across the board. Substantive progress has occurred in the structural, social and governance pillars of the
reform agenda. Given the comprehensiveness of the country reform agenda, however, there were areas
that progressed much faster than the others; some measures were implemented on a timely basis while
others lagged behind; certain activities were completed successfully whereas others needed further
attention.

Macroeconomic framework. The overall progress in the country's reform agenda benefited largely from
the stability and good performance of the country's macroeconomic framework in the first half of the
2000s. GDP growth remained above seven percent for the third consecutive year, and indeed accelerated
to attain 7.7 percent in 2004 (see Table 2). This strong performance has been maintained despite some
adverse shocks. These included a serious outbreak of avian influenza, severe floods and droughts, a sharp
rise in the price of key imported commodities, and the introduction by other countries of market barriers
in textiles, garments and other export products.



                                                         4

Broad-based growth is leading to an improvement in living standards for most population groups, with
strong indications of a continuing decline in poverty. As a result, the improvement in living conditions
has been widespread.      Preliminary figures from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey
(VHLSS) 2004 indicate a substantial decline in the poverty headcount since 2002, the year of the last
survey. Estimates combining data from the VHLSS 2002 with trends in the growth of provincial
economic activity, suggest that the poverty headcount ratio could have fallen to around 26 percent in 2004
compared with 29 percent in 2002.

The resilience of the economy to adverse shocks is partly a reflection of prudent economic management.
The strong economic performance of the Vietnamese economy also reflects the increasing strength and
buoyancy of the private sector. While the number of SOEs is steadily declining, an additional 35,000 new
businesses were registered in 2004, representing a year-on-year increase of 26 percent in number and 24
percent in registered capital. Private sector industrial production rose 23 percent in 2004, compared with
12 percent for the state sector. FDI commitments reached a seven-year high of US$ 4.2 billion in 2004,
or nearly ten percent of GDP.

Helped by high oil prices, exports grew by 29 percent in 2004, reaching 57 percent of GDP. Exports of
textiles and garments continued to expand, albeit at a lower rate, in spite of the expiration of the MFA and
stricter quotas in the US market, while shrimp exports were slapped with anti-dumping tariffs.
Confronted with uncertain market conditions, exporters have looked to diversify into the European Union
(EU) and Japanese markets, with some initial success. This trend should be aided by recent garment
quota removals in the EU and better food safety standards in Vietnam.

The stable macroeconomic framework provided a positive environment for the reform program under the
CPRGS to continue making significant progress overall. Table 3 below presents the activities supported
by PRSC 3 in terms of triggers and corresponding Bank staff assessment. Annex 1 provides further
details in the achievements and outcomes up to 2004.

Pillar I: Transition to a Market Economy. Achievements under this pillar can be grouped under five
main topics: trade integration, SOE reform, financial sector reform, private sector development, and
infrastructure. Trade integration was marked by significant progress within the PRSC 3's time frame
which culminated in the turning-point of the offer from WTO in June 2004 that paved the way for the
critical phase of bilateral negotiations.         3  Other measures to promote trade were also undertaken and
helped to move the economy toward low average tariffs as well as elimination of nearly all non-tariff
barriers.

During the project's implementation period, recorded statistics show some good achievements in
encouraging private sector development. Over 1,200 enterprises registered their new business on average


3        Eight bilateral agreements have now been finalized, including a crucial one with the European Union in October 2004.



                                                               6

every month during 2003-04. The corporate income tax rate was unified at 28 percent for all companies,
irrespective of ownership, a measure designed to promote private sector development with more level
playing field between the domestic and foreign invested sectors. The government also opened the
Internet and mobile telephone services to competition, while reducing further international telephone and
leased line rates to regional levels. Other measures improved the legal framework for the organization,
operation and management of business associations. The administration of intellectual property rights
was also strengthened.

There has been a general consensus on and endorsement for an acceleration in the divestiture of state-
owned enterprises (SOEs).        The divestiture process proceeded at a faster pace than before with
accelerated SOE ownership transformation by following the 104 SOE restructuring plans. The combined
figure for 2003 and 2004 was 1091, reflecting a very substantial acceleration in the process. Ownership
transformation also seems to be associated with more substantive restructuring, as reflected in the
operation of the social safety net for redundant SOE workers. The elimination of direct subsidies,
increased competition in product markets and, to a certain extent, the hardening of the budget constraint,
are exerting pressure on SOEs to become more competitive. As a breakthrough step, the equitization
process was broadened with the approval of the party to include large SOEs and General Corporations
(GCs) in sectors hitherto deemed strategic, such as electricity, post and telecommunications, chemicals,
metallurgy, and banking and insurance.

However, the actual rating of SOEs according to the criteria set out in the Decision on SOE Performance
Evaluation and Monitoring has not made much progress within the PRSC 3 time frame since actual
classification of SOEs -- according to Decision 271/2003/QD-TTg (under PRSC 2) -- started in July
2004.    The Decree established administrative sanctions for lack of compliance and provided the
classification of SOEs in three categories based on their earnings, returns to state equity, and ability to
service their debts. In the past, few SOEs complied with any reporting obligations from the government
and it would take time for them to change their mindset and follow this requirement. Sanctions to be
imposed for lack of compliance may help to change SOEs' behavior over time.

The progress toward transparency and accountability in the banking sector and the financial sector has
been uneven. There was a series of measures to reinvigorate the implementation of the government's
financial sector reform program, including the issuance of a plan for the international integration of the
banking sector and the reform at the SBV. The four SOCBs developed new credit manuals, providing the
banks with critical information to improve credit and overall risk management upon implementation. The
new Chart of Accounts for banks was adopted, along with new regulations on accounting and bank
reporting policies, all close to the International Accounting Standards (IAS). The SOCBs have been
subjected to IAS since PRSC 1, but there were delays in releasing those audits. A 60-day limit was
imposed on the "negotiations" of IAS audit by SOCBs. The government adopted a decision to equitize
two SOCBs, and took steps to enable one SOCB to identify a strategic partner for equity participation.

The government also considerably strengthened the regulations for the operations of the Development
Assistance Fund (DAF), restricting both the scope and mechanisms for policy lending. Despite the re-
channeling of directed credit through DAF, however, implicit pressures for non-commercial or politically-
preferred lending still exists for SOCBs, especially in provincial branches.

Pillar II: Making Development Inclusive ­ socially and environmentally sustainable. The PRSC 3
has been effective in supporting the promotion of human development as recorded in the achievements
and outcomes of the education and health sectors, in the reforms on land policy and environmental and
natural resource management.




                                                      7

In education, the government has increased the share of education and training to over 17 percent of the
2004 budget in line with CPRGS goals. School quality has been slowly improving, aided by the
nationwide adoption of the Fundamental School Quality Level (FSQL) standards. In the health sector,
basic health statistics show some improvement toward the target: infant mortality at 26/1000 (37/1000
reported in 2001); under-five mortality rate at 35/1000 (48/1000 reported in 2001). The authorities have
created the Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFP) in all provinces with full central government share of
funding.

The government has publicly acknowledged the problem of HIV/AIDS in the country. Shortly thereafter,
a national HIV/AIDS strategy was adopted and more importantly, initial steps were undertaken toward its
implementation. This strategy has the international support with funding and technical assistance.

The allocation of land through the land-use right certificate (LUC) mechanism has achieved good
progress. The percentage for 2004 is as follows: 90 percent allocated for agricultural land; 75 percent for
rural residential; 25 percent for forest, and 40 percent for urban residential. The percent of rural
household with leased land has reached 15 percent. The Land Law was enacted, supporting access to
land for all sectors, community land-use practices and providing for a unified land administration system.

The credit supported important measures to improve environmental and water resources management as
well. Steady progress was made toward increased population access to water and sanitation services, 53
and 25 percent respectively (compared with 41 percent and 17 percent in 2001). The government has
decentralized the department of Natural Resources and Environment in all provinces with the
responsibility for reviewing the environmental aspects of projects submitted for investment below a
certain level of investment, according to the value of the investment. The "polluter pays" principle and
mechanism for industrial and municipal waste water discharges were established. Pollution offenders are
required to upgrade their technology, move to authorized zones or face closures.

Pillar III: Building Modern Governance. There has been solid progress in public finance management
with increase in transparency and accountability. In public financial management area, the entire 2005
state budget plan was disclosed for the first time, including an aggregate amount for defense expenditure,
a process made legal by the State Budget Law, which became effective in 2004. The accounting system
of the state budget and the state treasury were unified, allowing for better monitoring of expenditures and
insuring they are made for intended purposes. This was enhanced by the completion of the overall design
of an integrated Treasury and Budget Management Information System. The new Accounting Law was
enacted and associated new accounting and auditing standards were issues in lines with international
standards. The SOEs are subjected to independent audits unless exempted and subject to audit by the
State Audit of Vietnam (SAV).

Public planning processes are also being strengthened with greater focus on outcomes. The actions
supported by the credit aim at revamping planning processes, moving away from a command approach
towards the alignment of policies and resources to the attainment of well-specified development goals.
The CPRGS guidelines were issued to initiate the roll-out of this approach in provincial planning and the
process was launched in 20 provinces. The education sector piloted a Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) that allows for better planning in the near future, including improved coordination
between capital and recurrent expenditures.           Public administration reforms have included the
promulgation of the national policy of One Stop-Shop (OSS) mechanism for service delivery and the pilot
project in four cities on the report card approach to public services delivery.

Finally, in the anti-corruption area, the government has strengthened the public procurement process
with open competitive bidding as the main method and a mandated establishment of a Procurement

Bulletin. Government agencies are required to adhere strictly to legal procedures, scheduled and scope of
inspection of business.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

The reform program supported under PRSC 3 aimed to continue building on the achievements under the
previous two PRSCs and the government's own blue print for reform, the CPRGS, and its updates. Most
of the measures supported by PRSC 3 were within the government control, and directly monitored by the
PRSC Steering Committee, under the Prime Minister's direction and headed by the First Deputy Prime
Minister, and the PRSC Secretariat for the day-today matters. The government strongly owns the
program which has also been widely supported by the stakeholders, resulting in meaningful and lasting
achievements.

The SBV has been the principal implementing agency for PRSC 3, continuing to chair the Secretariat
Group which oversees the day-to-day implementation of the program. Its experiences acquired under the
SAC and the first two PRSCs contributed to the successful completion of PRSC 3. SBV provided the
leading role in coordinating with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI), Ministry of Trade (MOT), and other concerned ministries and agencies involved in the PRSC 3.
The PRSC Secretariat coordinated and monitored the implementation of the reform program among the
ministries and agencies with reports on accomplishments, problems, and adjustments. The Secretariat
worked closely with Bank staff during the implementation of the program and followed up on the
outstanding issues with relevant agencies and ministries.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance. The Bank and its country office led by the Country Director, the Lead Economist and
sector specialists in the field maintain an effective dialogue with the government's senior counterparts in
what has now become effectively an annual exercise in carrying out the joint review of the progress of
reforms, as supported by the PRSC series to assist the government with its poverty reduction strategy and
sustained growth with equity. Bank staff were effective in keeping the momentum of reforms with timely
intervention and helped ensure successful preparation and supervision of the operation. As co-chairman
of the Consultative Group, the Bank played an effective leadership role in aid coordination and was
successful in mobilizing cofinancing for PRSC 3 from seven multilateral and bilateral donors, totaling
$122 million equivalent.

The PRSC 3 was a structural adjustment credit in support of a collection of diverse reform and policy
activities and thus follows the requirements of OD 8.60.

Borrower Performance. The government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam continues to play an active
role through the PRSC Steering Committee under the direction of the First Deputy Prime Minister. The
sense of program ownership was very strong among the government officials of all levels. The PRSC
Steering Committee maintained a continuing policy dialogue with Bank staff in residence in the Country
Office, coordinated and monitored the program and helped carry out most of the policy actions called for
in PRSC 3 before Board presentation and effectiveness. The SBV provided an effective anchor for the
implementation of the program and was proactive in meeting the requirements called for by the Credit.
The preparation and implementation of the PRSC 3 was effected under the solid leadership of the Prime
Minister, the firm direction of the First Deputy Prime Minister, and the experienced SBV staff with over a
decade of experience in working with international financial institutions on structural reforms.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

A stable political environment contributed to the continuing successful implementation of macroeconomic
and structural reforms in Vietnam. The building of a broad-based consensus and strong government
commitment through the preparation of the CPRGS minimize the risk of political support erosion and the
likelihood of policy reversals due to political changes.

The availability of technical assistance grants from donors and strong and close Bank team support
played a key role in low-income countries with weak technical working level capacity, especially in the
reforms in the SOE and banking sectors

Close donor coordination was critical in avoiding duplication of efforts that could stretch government
capacity. The PRSC 3 continued with the effort in incorporating well the donor coordination in both the
design and implementation.

Subsequent operations. PRSC 3 is the third of a series of PRSCs designed to support the government's
program as outlined in the CPRGS. The fourth PRSC (PRSC 4) has been prepared and scheduled for
Bank Board submission in June 2005. PRSC 4 will continue the Bank support to Vietnam under the
PRSC series within the CPRGS framework.

                                            UNDER THE FIRST THREE PRSCS

 The range of economic reforms supported by the Bank in PRSC 3 continued to broaden considerably
 since PRSC 1. In addition to the mainly structural reforms, PRSC 3 included additional policy actions
 aimed at keeping development inclusive and building modern governance, including measures related to
 education and health sectors, environmental sustainability, land management, legal development and
 public financial management.

 The table below summarizes the achievements under the three PRSCs.
