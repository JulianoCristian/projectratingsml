Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Country Context  
 
Despite a limited natural resource base regional conflict, Jordan’s economy performed well over the past 
five years with a growth rate of 5-7 percent.  Comprehensive structural reforms over the last decade have 
underpinned its good economic performance.  This growth has been broad-based, supported by exports 
and manufacturing expansion.   
 
In terms of human development indicators, Jordan ranks above average with respect to lower middle-
income countries.  The incidence of poverty declined from 14.0 percent in 2000 to 7.0 percent in 2006.  
Education indicators have improved consistently since the mid-nineties;  the illiteracy rate is 8.9 percent, 
the third lowest illiteracy rate in the Arab world; the primary gross enrolment ratio has increased from 71 
percent in 1994 to the 98.2 percent in 2006; the transition rate to secondary school has increased from 63 
percent to 97 percent over the same period; and transition rates to higher education has varied between 79 
percent and 85 percent of secondary school graduates over the past five years.  The university gross 
enrolment rate for the population between 18 and 25 years for university has increased from 18.5 percent 
in 2001 to 22 percent in 2006, among the highest in the Arab world.   
 
High unemployment, particularly among the young and deep pockets of poverty persist.  At 2.7 percent 
annually, Jordan’s population growth is among the highest in the region and nearly 70 percent of the 
population is under the age of 30.  Projections indicate that about 80,000 new jobs and continued strong 
growth of 7 percent or more would be needed each year to avoid higher levels of unemployment and 
increasing poverty. Unemployment of university graduates for the past 4 years has remained about 14.7 
percent and 22 percent for women.  For community college graduates it is 11 percent and 31 percent for 
women. Poverty reduction and job creation remain Jordan’s most important challenges.

In 2005, Jordan allocated about 15 percent of public expenditures to education, representing about 4.5 
percent of GDP.  Higher Education receives 14.7 percent of education expenditures or equivalent to 0.65 
of GDP which is low when compared to the OECD average of 1.6 percent of GDP or to other middle-
income countries.  Public financing for higher education has been declining over the past five years.  
Transfers to universities have declined from JD 60.4 million in 2004 to JD 52.6 million in 2007 
representing a decline of 14 percent.     
Sector Context and Issues  
Under the last project, reforms were only partially implemented. 
 
In large part, this was due to two 
factors.  First, a strong sector strategy endorsed by Government was missing and thus decision-makers 
lacked the common shared vision necessary to implement a sector strategy and related reforms.  Decision-
making in higher education on specific issues regarding admissions, financing, student fees and 
appointments were made by various entities including the Royal Court, the prime minister and the 
ministers of finance, plan and higher education and yet there was little formal coordination among these 
decision-makers.  Such disparate centers of decision-making meant that it was difficult to maintain a 
consensus on the reform program.  Frequent changes in ministers, the institutional set-up and senior 
appointments also undermined adherence to a sector strategy.  Secondly, specific responsibilities and 
technical expertise were not assigned to implement reforms, for example, to institute the formula funding 
mechanism and restructure community colleges.   
 
Competitive funds are significant reforms which aim to change behaviors of stakeholder to focus on 
improving quality and relevance of programs.  For a competitive fund to add value it needs to be aligned 
with other government policies such as linking access to quality assurance and defining programs to 
broader economic priorities.  To be most effective, a competitive fund needs to be headed by a well-
known and respected academic who can manage the competitive process both technically and 
administratively in a transparent and efficient way.  Political support to this reform champion is essential 
to implement the competitive scheme in a professional, transparent and unbiased manner. 
 
Jordan’s higher education system has evolved over the past five years but not fast enough to meet the 
needs of a high growth knowledge-based economy
.
Demand for university education has grown rapidly 
between 2000 and 2005 with enrollments almost doubling between 2000 and 2005 or growing at an 
annual rate of 14 percent from 77,841 to 152,400 students and the number of public universities has 
increased from 7 to 10.  Over the same period, enrollments in 12 private universities grew by about 18 
percent annually from 36,642 to 55,744.  Enrollments in community colleges, however, declined slightly 
from 30,000 to 25,700 indicating a bias to university education in Jordan.  Community colleges have not 
been able to put in place a system which trains young people with the technical skills necessary for a 
knowledge-based economy. College programs have remained theoretical, not linked to the needs of the 
market.  Faculty members have, on average, less than 2 years practical experience in enterprises.  The 
pub
lic community college system is managed by the Al’Balqa University and does not have a governance 
or management system to work closely with the private sector, to revise curricula and develop apprentice 
and in-service training programs.  Private and non-profit sectors are not actively involved in the Boards of 
universities or providing endowments, financing university chairs and infrastructure.  In order to improve 
the relevancy of higher education, the Government introduced in 2000 the US$15 million Higher 
Education Development Fund (HEDF), with the World Bank support, which allocated resources on a 
competitive basis to initiatives aiming to improve the relevance of undergraduate programs.  Results were 
mixed but 11 new undergraduate programs were established as well as the process of opening up 
universities and involving enterprises and civil society in programs and research. 
 
Rapidly growing demand for university education is driving the system.  
The demand for higher 
education is forecast to grow much more rapidly that in the past due to:  (i) the rapid growth of school 
Page  3

aged population; (ii) improvements over the past five years in enrollment rates and improving completion 
rates for primary and secondary levels. About 98 percent of children go onto secondary school, the 
percentage of student sitting the Tawjeehi exam is gradually increasing and the percentage of students 
succeeding has increased from 40 percent in 2000 to 52 percent in 2006; and (iii) rising incomes in Jordan 
has increased the demand for higher education.  Projections of future enrollments in higher education, 
taking into consideration these factors, show that the numbers of students entering university will increase 
to 70,000 per year by 2010 up from 50,469 in 2005.  As shown in Figure 1, the increasing size of cohorts 
will continue to pressure the higher education system until 2016.  Given the Government’s budget 
constraints, higher education’s capacity will need to develop strategies to cope with this demand 
including relying more on the private sector.  Currently, the regulatory framework for private universities 
is highly restrictive limiting its ability to respond to the influx of students.

Financing Constraints and Impact on Quality and Equity 
·
Financing constraints on higher education are arguably the biggest challenge for the future
.
·
G
overnment’s financing strategies do not promote a culture of quality in post-secondary 
education,
 which has led to the perception of a declining quality of public higher education.   
·
The affordability of higher education for those wishing to have a higher degree is creating an 
equity imbalance.   
·
Enrolments of students from the richest wealth quintile represent over three times those from 
the poorest wealth quintile.

Governance and Management of the System 
·
The governance system is not aligned effectively to create a flexible system, responsive to 
global changes and the needs of society.   
·
Ineffective university autonomy and hinder innovation and universities’ capacity to respond 
to change. 
·
Weak financial management and accountability systems 
 
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT  
 
The first pillar of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY07-10, approved in May 2006, relates to 
“Strengthening the Investment Environment for a Skill-intensive, Knowledge-based Economy.” Central 
to building this pillar is ensuring that a skilled and flexible workforce supports Jordan’s growth ambitions 
over the coming years. This will require continued reform of the post-secondary sector with emphasis 
being put on:  (i) significantly improving the relevance of education and post secondary technical 
training; (ii) rationalizing public financing of the sector in a way that promotes sustainability and equity 
through student loans and grants; and (iii) strengthening the governance and management of the sector by 
introducing stronger quality assurance and accreditation systems for public and private institutions and 
supporting research. 
 
The proposed project will build on the experience of the last higher education project and support the 
implementation of an operational sector program that will assist the Government of Jordan meet the dual 
challenge of promoting competitiveness and improving the relevance of education. The proposed program 
is also a complement to the current Bank strategy to support the education sector and complement efforts 
to improve the quality of basic and secondary education supported under  the Education Reform for 
Knowledge Economy projects (ERfKE I & II), and vocational and technical training under the proposed 
Employer Driven Skills Development project. 
 
2. Proposed 
objective(s) 
 
The proposed HERfKE project supports the Government’s sector program and integrates the 
implementation of policy reforms into its design.
 
The proposed project development objective is 
to 
support the development of a higher education system that is financially sustainable, with incentives to 
improve the equity, quality and relevance of tertiary education in Jordan
.
The project will support policy 
reforms that will: (i) improve the Government’s capacity to diversify and improve financing mechanisms 
to universities as a means to create incentives to promote a culture of quality and innovation in 
universities; and (ii) strengthen the management and efficacy of the sector by aligning the roles, missions 
and responsibilities of various governance bodies to the new strategy objectives.  In terms of expected 
results, the project would increase the efficiency of public higher education institutions; diversify the 
resource base of state universities and link government financing mechanisms to quality incentives.  The 
project components are summarized below.  
 
3. Preliminary 
description 
 
Component 1 - Sustainable Financing
 
would: (i) establish a standardized and transparent allocation 
mechanism of the government block grants; (ii) strengthen the competitive financing mechanism to 
develop programs for universities and community colleges; (iii) build the capacity of the R&D fund; and 
(iv) identify successful elements in the student aid system that can be further strengthened and expanded, 
and support the creation of new grant and loan programs where necessary.

Component 2 - Accreditation and Quality Assurance
 would:  (i) strengthen the accreditation and quality 
assurance system for both public and private universities; (ii) establish links between the government and 
labor market information systems; and (iii) enhance testing and analysis of learning outcomes.  
Component 3 - Strengthening Sector Management
 would:  (i) clarify roles and responsibilities of higher 
education governance bodies (HEC, MoHESR, BOT, and HEAQAC) for the purpose of streamlining 
decision-making and enhancing monitoring of sector performance; (ii) develop capacity in HEC for 
medium-term sector planning, policy making, and evidence-based decision-making; (iii) implement 
academic and administrative management information systems; and (iv) improve university capacity for 
budgeting, planning, financial, and human resource management, as well as building senior management 
capacity at the university level for strategic planning.
