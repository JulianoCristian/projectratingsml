In addition to the removal of\n            institutional and capacity-related barriers, the project\n            aims to establish energy services companies (ESCOs) as the\n            main vehicle to guarantee a sustainable energy efficiency\n            market. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from September 30, 2011 until November 30, 2011. This will\n            be the third extension: the original closing date was\n            December 31, 2009; a first extension to December 31, 2010\n            was granted in July 2009; a second extension to September\n            30, 2011 was granted in December 2010. The project's\n            audit report for 2009 has been recognized by the World Bank\n            as acceptable. A reallocation of funds also took place in\n            July 2010, totaling USD 625,000. USD 225,000 were\n            reallocated to the guarantee and USD 400,000 to the\n            Technical Assistance (TA), leading to the current budgets of\n            USD 3.725 million and USD 2 million, respectively."}, "docdt": "2011-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
