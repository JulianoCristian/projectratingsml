The closing date for the\n            project will be extended from December 31, 2010 until\n            September 30, 2011. This will be the second extension. The\n            original closing date was December 31, 2009, and a first one\n            year extension was granted in July 2009. The Grant was\n            approved on November 4, 2004, and became effective on\n            December 13, 2004. Its amount is USD 8.5 million. As\n            disbursement was very slow for the first years of\n            implementation of the project, the Tunisian government\n            requested an extension in May 2009. It was granted by the\n            World Bank on July 23, 2009, while an action plan was being\n            developed to accelerate disbursement. A reallocation of\n            funds also took place in July 2010, totaling USD 625,000\n            (USD 500,000 as per unallocated funds in the Grant\n            Agreement, USD 125,000 from Sotugar fees, which were\n            overestimated in the initial allocation).
