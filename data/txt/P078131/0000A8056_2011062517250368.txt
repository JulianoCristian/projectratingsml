                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the proposed project is to overcome barriers to the development of a sustainable market for energy efficiency products. In addition to the
                         removal of institutional and capacity-related barriers, the project aims to establish energy services companies (ESCOs) as the main vehicle to guarantee a
                         sustainable energy efficiency market.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursements were slow for the first years of implementation of the project and a first extension of one year for closing date was given, namely December 31, 2010. Thanks to the
                         action plan that was adopted in 2009, and to its successful implementation by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), the project's activity has significantly accelerated throughout
                         2010.

                         The Guarantee component (Component 2 - GEF funds to SOTUGAR-managed guarantee fund) was almost totally disbursed (98%) as of December 31, 2010 and was fully disbursed

                         as of April 30, 2011. However, the #Surprime# and Technical Assistance (TA) components (Components 1 and 3), while improving their disbursement, were behind schedule. Based
                         on favorable disbursement rates over the year 2010 the project has been given a second extension of nine months until September 30, 2011. It was expected that most undisbursed
                         funds would be disbursed during the first half of 2011, the third quarter being considered an additional time margin.

                         The political turmoil of early 2011 caused a slowdown of disbursement. This slowdown was limited and the overall disbursement rate for the project reached 84% as of the end of
                         April 2011. However, although all remaining contracts regarding the TA component (Component 3) will be able to be signed within the next month or so, it is likely that the execution
                         of such contracts will extend beyond September 30, 2011 by about a month. Therefore, a new short #technical# extension of the project will probably be required. In addition, a slight
                         adjustment of fund allocation (USD 100,000 or so) between the #Surprime# and Guarantee components might be necessary.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A short #technical# extension of about a month is likely to be necessary for the last technical assistance activities (Component 3) to be delivered. This will be confirmed after the
                         upcoming Energy mission in Tunisia. A minor adjustment of fund allocation between Components 1 and 2 might be also required. This will be monitored by the World Bank project
                         team during the next two months.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
