                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the proposed project is to overcome barriers to the development of a sustainable market for energy efficiency products. In addition to the
                         removal of institutional and capacity-related barriers, the project aims to establish energy services companies (ESCOs) as the main vehicle to guarantee a
                         sustainable energy efficiency market.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Disbursement was slow in the first years of implementation of the project and a first extension was given for one year, to December 31, 2010. Thanks to the action plan that was
                         adopted in 2009 and to its successful implementation by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), the project's activity has significantly accelerated throughout 2010 and 2011.
                         However, the project could not be fully disbursed by end 2010 and the closing date was further extended to November 30, 2011 to allow for full disbursement of funds.

                         The project is now closed. As of November 30, 2011, US$ 7.820 million were disbursed, i.e. 92.0% of the project's budget, and an additional US$ 0.685 million were committed under
                         the three component of the project (mostly Component 2 - Guarantee: US$ 0.410 million, and Component 3 - Technical Assistance: US$ 0.235 million), leading to a potential
                         disbursement rate of 100.1%. The project has four months to execute final payments and disbursements. It is expected that final disbursement will reach approximately US$ 8.475

                         million, i.e. 99.7% of the budget (limited leftover funds are expected in Component 1 - Additional Subsidy and Component 3 - Technical Assistance, due to actual contract amounts
                         and foreign exchange differentials), which is satisfactory.
