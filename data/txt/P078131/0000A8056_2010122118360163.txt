                         Implementation Status Overview
                           Disbursements were slow for the first years of implementation of the project, which has been extended to close on December 31, 2010, instead of December 31, 2009. Thanks to
                         the action plan that was adopted in 2009, and to its successful implementation by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), the project's activity has significantly accelerated throughout
                         2010. The guarantee component will probably be disbursed by 12/31/2010, but the "surprime" and Technical Assistance (TA) budgets won't be fully disbursed.

                         Regarding the TA, most of the undisbursed budget should be spent during the first quarter of 2011. Regarding the "surprime", disbursement should reach 70% at the end of

                         December. The PIU believes that about half of the undisbursed funds under the "surprime" will be disbursed during the first quarter of 2011. The remaining funds, i.e. about USD
                         400,000 would take a few more months.
