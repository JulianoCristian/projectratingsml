Lessons learned from the project: The EMSRP\n            experience confirms that it is possible to incorporate\n            modest institutional reform agenda even in emergency\n            projects, provided that there is close supervision,\n            effective policy dialogue and adequate time to develop and\n            implement the institutional activities. While the\n            preparation of emergency projects on a fast track may be\n            lauded as demonstrating high responsiveness to immediate\n            needs on the ground they may also suffer in terms of not\n            focusing in sufficient depth during project preparation to\n            important matters like the design of impact monitoring\n            indicators. Even in emergency operating situations, it is\n            important to be pragmatic in determining the extent to which\n            funds should be allocated without detriment to the overall outcome."}, "docdt": "2006-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
