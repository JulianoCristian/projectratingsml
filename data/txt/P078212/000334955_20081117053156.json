The\n            main problems encounters are: 1) the security situation\n            worsened early in project implementation, and remains\n            difficult; (b) putting in place the management agent for the\n            Municipal Fund (MF) was delayed by over a year, slowing\n            progress on creation of the MF; and (c) delays in fulfilling\n            eligibility criteria by municipalities for access to second\n            year funding. The panel considered the efforts of the task\n            team to work in the difficult environment to be commendable,\n            not only their intentions, but also their results. Project\n            design relied on the staying power of municipalities that\n            had been operating in the difficult environment all along.\n            Additional support made available to them via the project\n            was able to be marshaled with the support of technical\n            assistance contractors who worked effectively in reaching\n            the scattered project municipalities. The Bank's\n            strategy of supervision called for a strong local presence\n            in both WB and in Gaza, and flexibility to work\n            opportunistically to visit project sites as and when possible."}, "docdt": "2004-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
