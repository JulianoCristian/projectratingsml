           construction works, and operation of sewage and water\n            supply, cleaning of networks regarding water, wastewater,\n            and storm drainage, as well as construction of buildings,\n            roads, and electricity rehabilitation. This will potentially\n            generate water line breaks, dust emissions, noise\n            disturbances, in addition to pollution resulting from\n            construction debris, and/or toxic gases emanating from\n            manholes, and other facilities. This environmental\n            assessment stipulates mitigation measures as follows. A\n            survey of existing facilities will be conducted during the\n            design face to establish appropriate work schedules (limited\n            to day times), provide traffic safety regulations, and\n            enforce waste disposal regulations, while a re-vegetation\n            plan will be implemented following construction. Waste\n            disposal will be strictly controlled and monitored for\n            disposal at selected (sanitary) landfills; this includes the\n            provision of equipment to facilitate flushing, hosing, and\n            cleaning, as well as air jitters to vacuum toxic gases from\n            manholes. Solid waste burning will be prohibited, instead,\n            wastes shall be incased, and transported to dumping sites\n            (which should be fenced). Electricity poles to be relocated,\n            or installed should be insulated, a practice to be followed\n            by routine checks, and monitoring."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
