      opportunities; and, c) introducing a mechanism to link\n            central, and local government budgetary planning processes,\n            to strengthen Palestinian emergency response capacity,\n            enhance mobilization of donor assistance, and improve the\n            efficiency, and equity of resource transfers to local\n            governments.
