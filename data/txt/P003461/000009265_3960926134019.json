aims to\n            (a) stimulate growth and diversification of agriculture by\n            expanding availability of medium-and long-term credit, and\n            (b) increase the Agricultural Bank of China's\n            (ABC's) operational efficiency through institutional\n            development.  Specifically, the project through ABC would\n            use project funds to provide subloans to households,\n            cooperatives, collective enterprises, state-owned\n            enterprises and state-collective partnerships for\n            investments in tree crops, livestock, aquaculture and\n            agro-processing.  This lending would be in six of\n            China's poorer provinces: Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan\n            in the southwest and Anhui, Henan and Hubei in the north\n            central region.  The project's technical assistance\n            component for institutional development would be used to\n            strengthen ABC's  in-house staff training capability,\n            and to conduct studies of ABC and the Rural Credit\n            Cooperative (RCC) operations.  The focus of this\n            institutional development program is to assist in the\n            Government's effort to reshape ABC's role\n            consistent with the ongoing reform of the financial system."}, "docdt": "1987-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
