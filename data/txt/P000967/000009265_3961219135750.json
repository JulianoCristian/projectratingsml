{"cdata!": "The Private Sector Adjustment Credit\n            Project will provide balance of payments financing in\n            support of the Government's program to promote private\n            sector growth by accelerating the pace of privatization and\n            by maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic policy\n            framework, including improved management and\n            poverty-orientation of public expenditures. The\n            privatization component, which cuts across several sectors\n            and uses private firms to implement privatization, has three\n            parts: the first, covers 46 medium sized state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs); the second covers 64 small SOEs; and the\n            third covers 4 large and strategic SOEs, including Ghana\n            Telecom and State Insurance Corporation. Of these, the\n            Government is expected to sell or liquidate 48 small and\n            medium-sized SOEs and to offer for sale 3 large and\n            strategic SOEs including Ghana Telecom, within the program\n            period. The macroeconomic framework component, in addition\n            to ensuring fiscal and monetary discipline, seeks to\n            implement better expenditure monitoring systems in 16\n            ministries covering at least 70 percent of total\n            expenditures, a more efficient multi-year contracting system\n            in 2 ministries, and a comprehensive accounting system in 6\n            ministries. Also, expenditures on basic education, primary\n            health, and rural infrastructure will be increased in real\n            terms to improve the poor's human resources and\n            income-augmenting opportunities."}, "docdt": "1995-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
