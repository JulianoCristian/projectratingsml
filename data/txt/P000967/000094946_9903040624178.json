{"cdata!": "This project (PSAC) is rated\n            satisfactory: it achieved its objectives. All the components\n            were effectively implemented resulting in substantially\n            reducing government ownership of commercial enterprises and\n            in fiscal saving. Furthermore, the project signaled stronger\n            government commitment to enhance the role of the private\n            sector. Key lessons learned include emphasizing the need for\n            quality privatizations. The implementing agency should\n            ensure that the process is widely publicized so as to\n            attract as many competitive bidders as possible. The\n            selected buyers should be committed to returning the\n            enterprises to viability. At the same time, the buyers\n            should be capable and willing to meet their outstanding\n            obligations. Compliance can be achieved by writing default\n            clauses into the sales contracts and invoking these clauses\n            when default occurs. Because the project assumed that\n            process issues could be resolved in a shorter time and the\n            outsourcing process was oversimplified, unforeseen delays\n            occurred in implementing the divestiture program.\n            Fundamental issues like the legalities involved in\n            transferring land titles need to be addressed system-wide.\n            Combining this project with the Public Enterprise and\n            Privatization Technical Assistance Project (PEPTA) was\n            helpful as the two projects were coordinated as one\n            operation with some mutual conditionalities, which\n            effectively meant more supervision time for the PSAC\n            privatization component."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
