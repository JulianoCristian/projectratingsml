The project was executed between 1978 and\n            1985, and was twice extended. Extensions were necessary due\n            to disbursement delays caused mainly by the\n            Government's inability to provide adequate counterpart\n            funds on a timely basis. The problem of counterpart funds\n            was the central issue affecting the execution of the\n            project, followed by the poor level of management by the PU.\n            Despite these problems, the project objective to increase\n            agricultural output was met. Sub-loans for livestock\n            production had a positive impact and although productivity\n            increases were small, there was a significant increase in\n            the area of improved pastures and the total number of herds.\n            However, productivity increases were only marginal."}, "docdt": "1988-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
