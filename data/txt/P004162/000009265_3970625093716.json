The quality and capacity for skill training in\n            these VHSs in the fields of industry, commerce, agriculture,\n            fisheries/maritime have been significantly upgraded by\n            increasing the overall provision rate of modern specialized\n            training equipment and shops, coupled with the staff\n            training required to incorporate and use the equipment in\n            the revised curricula. These significant improvements in\n            quality and capacity should enable the institutions to more\n            adequately address the changing skill requirements in those\n            sectors. The performance of the Borrower was commendable.\n            The performance of the Bank was also good. The following are\n            a couple lessons learned in this project: (a) the approval\n            of a Borrower's project proposal by its National\n            Assembly/Cabinet not only assures that it is consistent with\n            the sectoral policy of the Government , but that its\n            implementation will be closely monitored at different levels\n            of government. The progress of a Bank-funded project that\n            has criteria for the allocation of loan proceeds to\n            different institutions, is advanced significantly when the\n            Borrower receives such approval prior to the time of pre\n            appraisal, and (b) bank missions most often interact\n            primarily with national governments. With many governments\n            currently seeking to decentralize education to the\n            provinces, more Bank attention should be given to local\n            implementers. Technical assistance should be provided to\n            these implementers during the project identification and\n            preparation stages. The focus of the technical assistance\n            should be on project management and implementation,\n            especially for those project components where lending is\n            predominant. Field visits to the local OEs, by Bank\n            supervision missions, were also considered an important\n            factor in the success of the project."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
