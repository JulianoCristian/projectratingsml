IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROJECT
LOAN 3314-KO
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Vocational Education
Project in Korea, for which Loan 3314-KO in the amount of US$30.0 million equivalent
was approved on March 28, 1991 and made effective on September 3, 1991.
The loan was closed on schedule on June 30, 1996. Final disbursement took place
on October 31, 1996, at which time a balance of US$429,454.18 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Robert L. McGough, EA1HR, V. Desa
(consultant) and Sing Zak Sung (consultant), EAIHR, and was reviewed by Messrs. Sven
Burmester, EA1HR Division Chief, and Walter Schwermer, Project Advisor.  The
borrower conducted a separate evaluation of the project and provided a copy of the
evaluation report to the Bank. This report is included, in an unedited form in Annex 2.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission,
March 30-April 10,1996 It is based on material in the project files. A final, short
Completion Mission was conducted during the Korea Projects Supervision Mission (for
five EAIHR supervised projects) from October 28 through November 16, 1996. The
borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by: (a) providing specific data upon
request;  (b) contributing views reflected in their own evaluation of the project's
preparation and execution; and (c) through their comments made on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROJECT
(Loan 3314-KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
(i)    All project objectives have been successfully achieved, especially (a) upgrading
skill training in selected Vocational High Schools (VHSs) in line with the country's
economic and industrial development and (b) enhancing the capability of the provincial
and urban Offices of Education (OE) to manage and implement vocational school projects.
The quality and capacity for skill training in these VHSs in the fields of industry,
commerce, agriculture, fisheries/maritime have been significantly upgraded by increasing
the overall provision rate of modern specialized training equipment and shops, coupled
with the staff training required to incorporate and use the equipment in the revised
curricula. These significant improvements in quality and capacity should enable the
institutions to more adequately address the changing skill requirements in those sectors.
Implementation Experience.
(ii)  Implementation progress was excellent at all times.  The allocation of loan
proceeds by priority fields of study and to participating OEs, and the selection of the
VHSs in the project followed criteria agreed to between the Borrower and the Bank. The
reorganization of the Ministry of Education (MOE) in 1994 did not significantly affect the
implementation of the project. Despite initial delays, the project was completed by the
original completion date.  This was due to the competent management of the
implementing agencies and GOK. The project was completed with a small cost underrun
(about 1%). The loan closed on June 30,1996 as planned. All covenants have been fully
complied with.
(iii) Equipment procurement followed Bank procurement guidelines. Disbursements
were slow in the early years of the project as: (a) the revised curricula for the VHS were
finalized only in March 1992, delaying the completion of the attendant standard equipment
lists and (b) with decentralization, the 15 local Offices of Education (OE) needed some
time to better understand how to procure equipment directly through OSROK and to
make arrangements for adequate counterpart funds in their local budgets. Once these
understandings were reached, disbursements began to increase after 1994, with actual
cumulative disbursement reaching US$29.573 million by October 31, 1996, that is, about
99% of the loan amount of US$30.0 million. Sample review of equipment management,
utilization and maintenance showed positive results.



v
Borrower Performance
(iv)   The performance of the Borrower was commendable. Despite early difficulties
brought on by a major reorganization of MOE and a need to learn more about Bank and
international procurement procedures, the implementing agencies were able to quickly
adjust with effective policies and procedures to support the overall coordination and
implementation of the project. Agreed upon implementation plans were fully implemented
on schedule.
Bank Performance
(v)   The performance of the Bank was also good. Client satisfaction with the Bank's
performance is high. Overall project supervision was also effective. It was noted that,
early in the project, a number of supervision problems were identified and resolved before
they had a negative impact on the project. Project reports and documentation were well
prepared and maintained thoughout the duration of the project. It was also noted that all
Bank missions were staffed with experienced Bank staff and consultants who understood
the needs of the country, vocational/technical education and project implementation.
There was little attrition in the staffing of this team over the duration of the project. This
consistency in staffing was also considered a positive factor in the success of the project.
Sustainability
(vi)   The Government fully understands that Korea's future competitiveness in the
technology/information intensive global economy is, to a large extent, dependent on the
nation's ability to establish and maintain a base of manpower with strong technical skills.
For this reason, the Government has long been committed to the development of the VHS
system as it has proven to be an important supplier of technically trained manpower to
industry. To date, support for the VHS has been consistent and of reasonable quality.
There is no reason to expect this commitment to waiver in the foreseeable future.
(vii)  Equipment has been well maintained in the past in the VHSs and it is reasonable to
believe it will be well maintained in the future. The decentralization of secondary school
system to well-managed OEs makes for sustainability.  There is already significant
interaction between schools and employers at the local level, thereby improving the
relevance of vocational training to labor market needs.
(viii) A concern, in the quest for sustainability, has been the need to develop an effective
planning mechanism for resource allocation for consumables and O&M. To this end,
under the Project, the Government has been committed to cover recurrent costs for
consumables and O&M, estimated at about US$8,000 per annum per school.
Nevertheless, economies are being explored under this project.  For example, the
institutions have implemented procedures whereby costs for depreciation (wear and tear)
of expensive CNC turning and milling machines are reduced through the use of acrylic
plastic consumable machining materials instead of metals. Further, an in-depth study of



vi
the resource allocation mechanism for consumables and O&M for future operations was
included in the following Bank financed project (Ln- 3469-KO).
Findings and Lessons Learned
(ix)   The following are a couple lessons learned in this project: (a) the approval of a
Borrower's project proposal by its National Assembly/Cabinet not only assures that it is
consistent with the sectoral policy of the Government , but that its implementation will be
closely monitored at different levels of government. The progress of a Bank-funded
project that has criteria for the allocation of loan proceeds to different institutions, is
advanced significantly when the Borrower receives such approval prior to the time of pre-
appraisal, and (b) bank missions most often interact primarily with national governments.
With many governments currently seeking to decentralize education to the provinces,
more Bank attention should be given to local implementers. Technical assistance should
be provided to these implementers during the project identification and preparation stages.
The focus of the technical assistance should be on project management and
implementation, especially for those project components where lending is predominant.
Field visits to the local OEs, by Bank supervision missions, were also considered an
important factor in the success of the project.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROJECT
(Loan 3314-KO)
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Project Objectives and Scope
1.    The overall objective of the project was to assist the Borrower in upgrading the
skill training provided in selected vocational high schools (VHSs), grades 10-12, to ensure
that their graduates meet the increasingly complex skill requirements of industry,
commerce, agriculture and fisheries/maritime, thereby assuring their continued
employability and increased productivity in the workplace.
2.    To achieve the above goal, the project encouraged a decentralized management
approach in the Boards of Education (BE), now called the Offices of Education(OE). In
nine provinces and six major cities, the OEs were delegated major direct responsibilities
for the selection of the participating VHSs and for the identification of equipment
requirements. The OEs were required to work within the Ministry of Education's (MOE)
prescribed standards, regulations and allocated budgetary resources.
3.    The expected result of the loan investment was to raise the overall provision rate
of experimental and practice equipment in the VHSs from 53% in the year 1991 to 63%
by the year 1996.
Evaluation of Objectives
4.    The Government's sectoral objective was to  support its economic and
industrialization policy through a complementary human resource development strategy
matching the supply of manpower both in terms of numbers and continually changing skill
requirements. The role of vocational education and training (VET) in this endeavor was
stated clearly in the first Education Credit to Korea in 1969. Credit 151-KO(1969-1976)
supported, inter alia, 27 vocational/technical schools at the senior secondary level together
with technical assistance and fellowships to strengthen the planning and administration of
vocational and technical education. The second education project, Cr.394/ Ln.906-KO
(1973-1979), financed equipment for another 32 vocational high schools(VHSs), while the
third education project Ln. 1096-KO (1975-1981), continued to support expansion and
quality improvement in another 4 VHSs and an additional 7 vocational training
institutes(VTIs) under the Ministry of Labor. The fourth education project Ln. 1474-
KO(1977-1983) assisted a further expansion of 16 VTIs and improvement of instructor
training. Project Completion Reports (PCRs) are available for all these projects that were
completed successfully.



2
5.    By 1989, there was a total of 588 VHSs in Korea, with an enrollment of 835,000
students in the technical, commercial, agricultural and fisheries/maritime fields. Since the
completion of the last Bank-funded project in the sub-sector of vocational education in
1983, technology intensive activities were being adopted in these fields at the workplace
for the commercial operations to remain competitive. The government chose to resume
borrowing in 1991 for the vocational education sub-sector with the current project Ln
.3314-KO. This was in consonance with its new policy to decentralize the administration
of secondary education to the newly strengthened OEs, the former BEs, in the provinces
and major cities.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.    The overall objectives of the project have been achieved, as verified by
implementation review missions visits to all the 15 participating OEs (6 municipal and 9
provincial) and sample visits to VHSs in the cities and the provinces. The findings were:
(a) Quality and capacity for skill training in the selected VHSs in the fields of
industry, commerce, agriculture, fisheries/maritime, have been significantly
upgraded though the provision of specialized equipment,
(b) Unit costs for training students were reasonable between US$1500 to
US$2300 per student year for the level/quality of training offered; and
(c) Decentralization of responsibility from MOE to local OEs is providing more
local-level authority for schools to determine their own equipment needs and to
participate in the related procurement.
7.    All project objectives have been successfully achieved, especially by increasing the
overall provision rate of modern specialized equipment that is required to meet the training
needs of selected VHSs and though enhancing the capability of the local OEs to better
manage and implement projects at the local school level.
C.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS
AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Implementation Record
8.    The implementation progress was excellent at all times. An Advisory Committee
to the Educational Facilities Bureau (EFB) of the MOE (para. 2.7 of SAR) advised the
EFB first, on the allocation of the loan proceeds by fields of study and, second, on its
allocation to the participating OEs based on these priority fields. The OEs, in turn,
selected the participating VHSs following criteria laid out by MOE and agreed to between



3
the Borrower and the Bank (para. 2.6 of SAR). Each OE organized coordination sub-
committees in each field (technical, agriculture, commercial and fisheries/maritime) to
assist in the selection of the VHSs, and in reviewing selection of equipment items and
specifications. Within the amounts allocated by the EFB, each OE could reallocate its
amount to the VHSs giving weight to the most disadvantaged in the current overall
equipment provision rate, obsoleteness of equipment, number of schools and classrooms,
operation ofjoint practice centers, and reform of departments. The selected schools were
divided into two groups, with the first half (about 347 schools) benefiting from the IBRD
loan. The three National Technical High schools were directly selected by the MOE. The
original allocation of Loan proceeds prepared in October 1991 was modified in 1993 to
accommodate a slightly increased requirement for equipment provision in the
fisheries/maritime schools. Annex 1 to this report shows the final allocation of the Loan
proceeds to the 15 participating OEs and 3 national technical high schools.
9.    With the reorganization of MOE in 1994, the EFB and the Education Loan
Projects Division (ELPD) was abolished. In the new organization, the Local Education
Support Bureau (LESB), through its Local Education Facilities Division (LEFD), has
taken over the responsibility for the coordination/ implementation of Bank-funded
components for secondary education. This change did not affect the pace of project
implementation.
10.   The OEs sent their equipment procurement request (types of equipment and units
of equipment) directly to the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea (OSROK), the
Government's Central Procurement Agency.  Equipment procurement was largely
implemented by OSROK with technical support from the coordinating sub-committees at
each OE and advisory support from ELPD of MOE. OSROK sought permits from the
appropriate authorities for the importation of the various equipment items. Following this,
the procurement process was launched. Procurement procedures were in full compliance
with Bank procurement Guidelines. Almost all equipment procurement was procured
through ICB.
11.   Revised curricula for VHSs were finalized only in March 1992 and the attendant
new standard equipment lists had to be prepared to match the revised VHS curricula.
Consequently, the scheduled delivery of equipment procurement requests from the OEs to
OSROK was postponed to June 1992, delaying the start of procurement by about one
year.
12.   There was no time overrun in this project and no extension to the project's closing
date of June 30,1996. The excellent project management ensured no cost overruns
(project actually had about 1% cost underrun).
13.   The disbursement lag was considerable from the start of the project until 1994.
This lag was the result of:  (a) optimistic estimates of cumulative disbursements at
appraisal, based as these were on the past experience in dealing with MOE's ELPD and
EFB in implementing education projects; and (b) initial delays in preparation of curricula,



4
which in turn, forced a delay in the preparation of equipment lists (para. 11). Also, (c)
with decentralization, the OEs needed a learning period for handling equipment
procurement directly through OSROK and arranging for adequate counterpart funds in
their local budgets. Once the delays in curriculum preparation were corrected and the
learning period passed, disbursements rose swiftly after 1994, with actual cumulative
disbursement reaching US$29.573 million (about 99% complete) by October 31, 1996.
14.   Audit reports were submitted in time throughout the implementation period
starting with FY 93, as the first expenditures occurred only in CY 92. A separate opinion
from the auditors on the Statements of Expenditure (SOE) did not accompany the first
audit report. After the Bank reminded the Borrower that there was a requirement for the
audit of SOEs which had been highlighted in the minutes of Loan Negotiations of March
16,1991, all subsequent audit reports contained a separate opinion on SOEs.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
15.   The structural change in MOE (para. 9 above ) was a major change. However,
although the Education Facilities Bureau (EFB) and Education Loan Projects Division
(ELPD, a division of ELB) has been eliminated, the Local Education Facilities Division
(LEFD) within the Local Education Support Bureau (LESB) has been successful in
advising and assisting the OEs to implement the project in a satisfactory manner. One
procedural change was made in 1995 which will likely affect future projects: i.e., in that
change, the requirement for MOE's prior review of the OEs' equipment selection was
dropped.
16.   Although there may have been several factors that affected the speed at which the
OEs could implement their procurement activities, one of the most significant was the
strict limitations put on their allocation of necessary counterpart funds for each project
year. While one must be supportive of Government's strong emphasis on the use of
advance planning and annual procurement plans, it should be noted that MOE's rigid
allocation of counterpart funds on a yearly basis was a factor that limited the acceleration
of procurement by some of the OEs.  Fortunately, during the earlier stages of
implementation, MOE agreed with the Bank's suggestion to allow more flexibility in the
yearly allocation of counterpart funds thereby enabling all goods for the VHSs to be
delivered at least 6 months prior to the closing date of the loan.
17.   There were no consulting services provided in this project.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
18.   The Government is vitally concerned with the need for more and better skilled
persons to support Korea's strategy to compete in the technology/information intensive
global economy. Thus, the Government remains focused and attentive not only to the
sustainability of this project but also to the overall development needs of the VHS system.



5
19.   Equipment has been well maintained in the past in the VHSs and it is reasonable to
believe it will be well maintained in the future. The availability of the National Equipment
Maintenance and Repair Centers contributes to this assumption. The decentralization of
secondary school administration to well-managed OEs also contributes to more
sustainability. There is already significant interaction between schools and employers at
the local level, thereby improving the relevance of vocational training to labor market
needs.
20.   There has been a recognized need to develop a more effective planning and
allocation system for consumables and O&M in the VHS system. To this end, under the
project, the Government has been committed to cover recurrent costs for consumables and
O&M, estimated at about US$8,000 per annum per school l/. Nevertheless, economies
are being explored under this project. For instance, depreciation costs(wear and tear) of
expensive CNC turning and milling machines are reduced through the use of acrylic plastic
consumable machining materials instead of metals. An in-depth study of a resource
allocation mechanism for consumables and O&M, for future operations, is included in the
follow-up project, Loan 3469-KO.
E. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
21.   The work on identification, preparation and pre-appraisal, appraisal, negotiations
and Board presentation did not encounter major difficulties. The total staff-week input
was low (see Table 10).
22.   During implementation, the Bank staff input in terms of staff-weeks remained low,
for nine supervision missions and headquarter's desk work. The high quality work on
equipment procurement by the borrower and the waiver of prior Bank review of
equipment contracts before making contract awards contributed towards efficient
performance as equipment procurement constituted 100% of the use of loan proceeds.
23.   Bank supervision missions visited all the 15 OEs, with sample visits to VHSs in the
provinces and the cities. The importance of field visits cannot be underestimated. The
inflexibility of annual budget allocations by MOE to OEs for equipment procurement was
detected on such a visit, as the unavailability of adequate local counterpart funds put a
brake on OEs accelerating their equipment procurement.   Fortunately, this was
successfully resolved with MOE support, thereby ensuring the delivery of all goods
procured by OEs well before the closing date of the loan.
/  The basis for estimate is on unit cost per student per year, which varies considerably by field of study. The
school size by total enrollment is another important factor. A third factor is the regional and geographical cost
differentials (local costs) between schools. Thus, the quoted figure should be understood as an average national
estimate for a particular year.

F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
24.   The vocational education project was mainly prepared by the Borrower after
identification, since the Borrower's concerned ministries/agencies had earlier experience in
preparing similar projects. The project was approved by the country's National Assembly,
making all the subsequent processing operations successful and less time consuming.
25.   After loan signing, MOE was quick to establish the Advisory Committee to EFB
and, by October 1991, it proceeded to propose allocations of the loan proceeds among the
specialized skill fields and among the participating OEs. The OEs were then in a position
to apply the agreed criteria for the selection of the 347 VHSs under this project. The
establishment of appropriate coordination sub-committees in each of the skill areas at each
OE promoted the preparation of the required equipment lists, while simultaneously
building up local expertise at the OEs.
26.   After an initial lag, because of the newness to Bank-funded projects, the OEs
were able to master the equipment procurement process and equipment lists started
flowing regularly to OSROK, which did an excellent job in undertaking the requisite
bidding, mostly on ICB, and ensuring that contracts were awarded to the lowest evaluated
bidders. There were some instances of bids for single items being rejected on technical
grounds where specifications were not met. These were rebid with revised specifications.
As many as 3000 types of equipment were procured under this project. Random sampling
showed OSROK was complying with Bank Procurement Guidelines.
27.   The Borrower was timely in its submission of the nine progress reports during the
entire period of June 1991 and March 1996, providing the necessary data base for
effective Bank supervision missions.
28.   The loan proceeds was almost fully disbursed (97.3%) by the Closing Date of the
Loan on June 30,1996. At the request of the Borrower, the Bank recommended approval
of a grace period of 4 months after the Closing Date, until October 31,1996, for
disbursements of miscellaneous eligible expenditures. The amount of equipment contracts
awarded by October 31, 1996 reached $29.57 million (99% of the Loan amount). About
US$429,454.18 was then canceled from the loan amount on October 31, 1996, thus
closing out the loan account.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
29.   With the exceptions noted below (para. 30), the project development objectives
were successfully achieved.  The ratings on Project Development Objectives and
Implementation Progress were ranked highly sali#saclory in the last five supervision
reports. The factors that have contributed to this are: (a) the strong commitment of the
Government to the project, approved as it was by the National Assembly as part of the
annual Foreign Borrowing Program, (b) the high quality of management by MOE project



7
implementation staff, (c) the major component of the project, procurement of specialized
equipment, was primarily implemented by OSROK, an agency with a long and successful
history in equipment procurement under Bank-funded projects; and (d) the inputs gained
from the Bank's semi-annual progress review missions.
30.   Project selection criteria did provide for equal participation of private sector
training organizations along with public training institutions (para. 2.6 of SAR), however,
the project was not fully successful in gaining an active participation of these
organizations. Also, to a small extent financial performance was less than fully met (1%
cost underrun). Upon review, it was found that these two drawbacks did not materially
detract from the success of the project. Indeed, a careful review of the project shows that
the government has a significant and growing commitment to the participation of the
private sector and is offering various incentives to encourage more participation. This
commitment must be considered an important output of the project.
H. RELEVANCE OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
31.   The Government's long-term  commitment to the development of vocational
training has been recognized as an important factor in the capacity of the country to meet
the rapidly expanding demand for trained employees in industry and commerce. Over the
years, the Government has had a lot of experience with various types of vocational
training schemes. Backed by research on the success of these schemes, the Government
has made a strong commitment to maintain and expand institutional and non-institutional
vocational training as it is needed.  In addition, the Government has successfully
developed some of the best trained vocational educators in the world, many with Ph.D.s
from Western countries. These key managers took an active part in the preparation of this
project and their inputs were important in the preparation of the project objectives, design
and its ultimate success. The project was also designed to fit into an overall program of
investments to support the economic development of the country and to provide the basis
on an ongoing interaction with private sector industrial and commercial organizations
(paras. 4 and 5).
I. FUTURE OPERATION
32.   The follow  up to this project is Ln. 3469-KO, the Vocational Schools
Development Project. This project continues to extend the objectives of Loan 33 14-KO
to upgrade skill training in additional selected VHSs and to strengthen the VHS system
through five studies in five agreed areas. These areas are: (a) improve operation of Joint
Practice Centers; (b) improve supply and quality of vocational course teachers; (c)
improve links between employers and VHSs; (d) develop effective mechanism for
planning future expansion and structural change in the VHS system; and, (e) develop
effective planning resource allocation mechanisms for consumables and O&M. All of
these studies have been completed and their recommendations are now being



8
implemented. The approaches required to establish a new national vocational education
system are also being examined by the Presidential Commission for the Reform of the
Education System.
J. LESSONS LEARNED
33.   In implementing this project, the following lessons have been learned:
(a)   The progress of a Bank-funded project that has criteria for the allocation of
proceeds to different institutions is advanced when the Borrower receives approval
for its project proposal from the National Assembly prior to the time of project
pre-appraisal.
(b)   Much of Bank experience has been with national Governments. With more
democratic governments now emphasizing the decentralization of education to the
provinces, technical assistance should be provided during project identification and
preparation to local implementing offices/agencies. These technical assistance
activities should focus on project management and implementation. Field visits
during implementation to the local offices are also considered important.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Project Completion Mission under Loan 3314-KO
Aide Memoire 2/
1.    The IBRD Mission 3/ visited Korea from October 28, 1996 to November 16, 1996,
to review the implementation progress of five World Bank financed projects. Associated
with this visit, the mission also collected the necessary information to complete the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for Loan 3314-KO. During this process, the
MOE provided a significant amount of tabular data to support the preparation the ICR and
on November 2, 1996, submitted its own evaluation report of the project to the mission.
This evaluation report will be attached as an annex to the ICR.
2.    During the mission, it was agreed that the Bank would complete the draft ICR and
send it to the Government for review and comment, no later than December 1, 1996. The
mission encourages the Government to quickly review the document as the ICR must be
converted to a final draft ready for submission to the Bank's Board of Directors by
December 31, 1996.
3.    The mission would also note that the Bank has sent a fax, dated November 20,
1996, to the Ministry of Finance to inform them that as of October 31, 1996, all
applications for withdrawal were complete, therefore, the balance of the loan
(US$429,454.18) was canceled as of that date (October 31, 1996).
4.    We look forward to receiving your comments after you have had the opportunity
to review the draft ICR. The mission would like to take this opportunity to express its
appreciation to the MOE staff involved in the ICR process and the hospitality extended to
the mission.
November 27, 1996
2/ This draft Aide Memoire is subject to review and modification by IBRD Management.
3/  The mission was comprised of Robert L. McGough (EAIHR), Sing-Zak Sung, Ian Irvine and Irene Travis
(Consultants).

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
GOVERNMENT'S EVALUATION REPORT OF LOAN No. 3314-KO
Submitted as an Input to the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Project 4/
1. Summary of the Project
The general purpose of the project was to upgrade technical training of the selected
vocational high school in the technical, commercial, agricultural, and fisheries/maritime
fields so that their graduates, when employed, can meet skills required in work sites of the
above industries, and to help better adapt themselves to their productive and changing
technical jobs.
The Loan Agreement for the Vocational Education Project was signed on June 3rd, 1991
and the project was completed on June 30th, 1996. To review achieved purposes of the
project, IBRD missions and the related staff of the Ministry of Education, Republic of
Korea, visited the project schools and checked project papers, finding no particular
problem in completing the project and the relevant Loan No. 3314-KO.
There were limitations in presenting objective figures on how much the technical
education of the vocational high schools was upgraded during the project period, which
would be an evidence of the development of technical education in vocational high schools
from the project. We tried, however, to review achievement of the project by presenting
numerical data to the possible extent.
2. Introduction of the Loan
In 1960s when the labor-incentive light industries such as spinning, shoemaking, etc. was
the economic base for industrial development, demand for higher skilled workers was
rather weak, and the main need at that time was the basic training of the labor force and
development of skills. But, coming into the 1970s, the heavy-industries began to develop,
and the general industries changed and oriented toward export-expanding ones. Along
this trends, demand for skilled workers increased and much concern was paid toward
vocational education.
4 / Annex C is presented as it was received from the Government, without any modification or editing, with the
single exception that some spelling errors were corrected when the ICR was auto-spell checked using the
computer.



28
In 1980s, as industries developed into increasingly technology-incentive production and
large-quantity export ones, technical factors of them changed more and more complicated,
their development faster, and upgrading the technical education more emphasized.
For leveling up the quality of training facilities in the selected vocational schools by
providing specialized equipment and complementary investment for their graduates to
cope with the increasingly-complicated functional demand in the manufacturing,
commercial, agricultural, and fisheries/maritime fields in the industry, the Korean
Government got appropriate agreement from the National Assembly in December 1989,
and signed on the relevant agreement with the World Bank for the loan of USD 30 million
on June 3, 1991 for the expansion cost of experimental and practice equipment in the
selected vocational high schools.
3. Allocation of the Loan Proceeds
The Ministry of Education organized ad hoc deliberative groups of the related experts for
the selection of participating schools and equipment items, and made overall allocation of
the loan fund among the Offices of Education in the related municipal cities and provinces.
The participating schools and equipment items for investment were finally decided by the
Supervisor of each Office of Education. The allocations of the loan proceed are given by
field in the following Table 3.1.

4. Provision Status of the Experimental and Practice Equipment
The participating organizations of the project under loan No. 3314-KO for the expansion
of experimental and practice equipment in vocational high schools are 15 Offices of
Education in municipal cities and provinces, and three national technical schools. Their
objective for participation in the project was to upgrade quality of their graduates.
The provision rate of the equipment in the particular schools as of June 1, '91 was only
54.7% on the average, but their rates improved very much to 88.8% in cost through
implementation of this project. The provision rate of the equipment supplied under the
loan covered 9.0% of the total cost of equipment in the project schools (Table 4.1).



30
The project has contributed very much to upgrading the technical education by providing
high-cost and advanced equipment under this loan, and it also performed a part in
providing large quantity of computers, etc. for education.

5. Experimental and Practice Training
5-1. Operation of joint practice centers
Joint practice centers were visited to review in detail the joint using status of the
equipment items procured from the loan in this project. The operative days and
trainees of the 27 joint training centers for the 1st half of 1996 as of June 30, '96
are in the following Table 5. 1.

5-2. Hours for experiments and practice training
It would take quite a long time for observation to estimate quality of technical
education upgraded after provision of the equipment in the participating vocational
high schools, and it would also be very difficult.
But, the equipment imported from the loan was being utilized very well for
experimental and practice training in the vocational high schools of the project.
Hours for experimental and practice training in the project schools from 1991 to
1995 is in the following Table 5.2.

6. Placement of Graduates
The status of graduates from the participating schools of the project is in the Table 6. 1.
Their rate of employment for 1993 to 1995 was more than 87.6%. Such a high rate might
have come from the effective technical training in the project schools. Such training is
prerogative for students to adapt themselves to the productive and changing technical
jobs, and the good results are judged to have come from the good use of the experimental
and practice training items of equipment supplied and installed during the project.

7. Benefits of the Project
In 1980s, industries required more and more technology-incentive production, increased
exportation, and their technical factors demanded more complicated and fast changes.
To upgrade quality of technical education for students of vocational high schools, the
Korean Government has introduced the IBRD loan of USD 30 million for financing
expansion of experimental and practice training equipment in vocational high schools.
The Government financed domestic fund of USD 31.7 million equivalent in addition to the
loan amount, and provided 365,480 items of equipment in total for five years from 1991 to
1995 to 18 institutions such as municipal and provincial Offices of Education and national
technical high schools for their utilization. The provision of equipment by the project has
raised provision rates of educational equipment and contributed very much to upgrading
the quality of experimental and practice education in Korea.
The Vocational Education Project and the relevant loan have contributed very much to the
technical education in vocational high schools in Korea. It could be summarized as
follows:
1) The provision rate of experimental and practice equipment in the vocational high
schools was raised from 54.7% to 88.8% as of June 30, '96 from January 1, '96.
2) Operation of joint practice centers has improved, and the number of trainees increased
from 10,312 to 15,348 in 1995 from 1991, showing annual increase.
3) Hours of experimental and practice training also increased from 1,954,235 hours to
2,290,061 hours in 1995 from 1991, contributing to raising quality of technical
education.
4) Operational trainings were provided to teacher trainees along importation of the high-
cost and advanced equipment and computer-related equipment.  The number of
trainees, for 1993 to 1995, was 3,800 including 3,040 trainees for programs of 60
hours or less.
The Vocational Education Project and the relevant IBRD loan No. 3314-KO for
vocational training are recognized to have contributed much to development of science
and technology in Korea in addition to the benefits cited above.
