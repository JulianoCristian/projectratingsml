 ensure that their graduates continue to meet the\n            increasingly complex skill requirements in industry,\n            commerce, agriculture and fisheries.  The project will\n            assist in making vocational school graduates more productive\n            upon entering employment and better able to adjust to\n            changing technological processes.  The project will include\n            specialized equipment to be financed by the Bank for\n            technical, commercial, agricultural and fisheries/marine\n            vocational high schools.  The government will finance\n            complementary inputs related to making the equipment\n            operational and maintaining it thereafter."}, "docdt": "1991-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
