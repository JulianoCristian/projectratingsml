       continued availability of irrigation water in a 167,000 ha\n            command area currently serviced by two 110-year-old weirs.\n            The two weirs are in danger of collapsing and continued\n            supply of irrigation water would avert the danger of a sharp\n            decline in agricultural production in the area. It would\n            safeguard farm incomes and employment for the area's\n            agricultural labor force. The project consists of the\n            construction of two new barrages, which would replace the\n            old weirs across the Mahanadi River and its branch, the\n            Birupa River. The head regulators for the three irrigation\n            canals taking off from the barrages would be replaced by new\n            structures. The project would also include the development\n            of a Drainage Master Plan for the entire Mahanadi delta,\n            including the implementation of selected works identified\n            under the Master Plan, a program of water management pilot\n            operations and the construction of staff accommodation and\n            other buildings required for the supervision and management\n            of the project. The risk associated with the project, apart\n            from those normally inherent in irrigation projects in\n            India, is that one or both of the old weirs might collapse\n            while the new barrages are being constructed."}, "docdt": "1980-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
