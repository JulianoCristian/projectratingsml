This Report concerns only the\n            Parej East mine, owned and operated by Central Coal India\n            Ltd. (CCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. (GIL), where two\n            villages, Parej and Durukasmar, are affected by mine\n            expansion operations. The Request for Inspection was\n            submitted on June 21, 2001 by a representative of\n            Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS), a local\n            nongovernmental organization (NGO) representing residents of\n            Parej East. The Requesters claimed that they had suffered\n            harm as a result of failures and omissions of IDA in the\n            design and implementation of the CSESMP in Parej East\n            Project area. They claim that their rights to participation\n            and consultation were effectively denied them. The\n            Requesters believe they have been deprived of fair and\n            adequate compensation for their lands and villages. They\n            have focused their key complaint on the failure to restore\n            their income levels. Although previously landowners, they\n            now claim to be living in colonies without legal possession\n            of any land, where their former skills are no longer\n            applicable, their productive sources dismantled, and their\n            supporting networks and kin groups dispersed. This harm is\n            alleged to be the result of the Management violating various\n            provisions of the following Bank policies and procedures:\n            Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30), Indigenous Peoples (OD\n            4.20), Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), Project\n            Supervision (OD 13.05), Disclosure of Information (BP\n            17.50), and Management of Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). In\n            its Response of July 2001, Management maintained that the\n            Bank had complied, and intended to continue complying, with\n            the relevant policies and procedures related to the design\n            and implementation of the CSESMP. After reviewing\n            Management's Response and visiting the Project area,\n            the Panel recommended an investigation to the Board of\n            Executive Directors. The Board approved the Panel's\n            recommendation on September 7,200l. The Requesters made\n            subsequent submissions, which were received and reviewed by\n            Management. This report finds that Management has failed to\n            comply with OD 4.30 with regard to certain aspects of\n            involuntary resettlement, among them, land and housing\n            compensation, and resettlement sites, compensation for loss\n            of access to forest products, income restoration; jobs in\n            the mine, non-farm-based self-employment, income restoration\n            through self-employment, and the feasibility of changing\n            project-affected persons (PAPs) into entrepreneurs and\n            generating income before displacement as well as supporting\n            them during the transition  period in the resettlement site.\n            Other findings concerned alternative income generating\n            schemes, land reclamation and water quality management, the\n            indigenous peoples development plan, stakeholder\n            consultation and information disclosure, and project supervision."}, "docdt": "2002-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
