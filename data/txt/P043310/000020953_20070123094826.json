These include follow-up\n            missions, technical assistance, continued engagement with\n            all stakeholders, follow-up by the Country Director with\n            relevant officials at the federal and state levels, and\n            support for external assessments. The Bank has worked with\n            all key stakeholders to support resolution, and has\n            endeavored to create an environment which encourages direct\n            communication and multi-stakeholders problem solving.\n            Overall, the key issues raised by the Inspection Panel have\n            been substantially resolved. However, despite the\n            Bank's active and sustained engagement, constraints in\n            the existing legal context have prevented the achievement of\n            full resolution on limited aspects of the Management Action\n            Plan. On these aspects, Management concludes that the\n            process has been taken forward to its fullest extent, and\n            that further developments are restricted by broader policy\n            issues, which extend beyond the coal sector. In light of the\n            above, Management has decided to bring to closure its\n            involvement in the Coal Sector Environmental and Social\n            Mitigation Project, and expects that this will be the last\n            Progress Report submitted in reference to this Inspection\n            Panel case."}, "docdt": "2007-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
