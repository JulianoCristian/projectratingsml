As noted by the Panel in its\n            Report, Management acknowledges that with hindsight, there\n            were deficiencies in the project appraisal process, even\n            though the World Bank complied with most of its formal\n            obligations at appraisal. Management also endorses the\n            Panel's observation that concerted efforts were made\n            with the help of thorough and extensive supervision of\n            project implementation to address those deficiencies in a\n            prompt and timely manner. While the success of resettlement\n            -implementation depends on a range of factors including\n            borrower commitment, the macroeconomic environment, the\n            continuing feasibility of rehabilitation measures considered\n            appropriate at the time of project appraisal and the efforts\n            of the affected people themselves, Management agrees that\n            the World Bank team made every effort to promote successful\n            resettlement throughout project implementation. The fact\n            that this may not have resulted in fully successful\n            resettlement for every project-affected person (PAP) does\n            not necessarily represent a failure of World Bank\n            supervision. Experience under the project, the objectives of\n            which included testing the effectiveness of government\n            policies, highlights the complexity of the resettlement\n            process and some important lessons that can be learned to\n            inform future resettlement programs. In this report,\n            Management asserts that the World Bank made every effort to\n            apply its policies and procedures and to pursue its mission\n            statement in the context of the project; that it remains\n            committed to a process of consultation and disclosure to\n            support the achievement of the project's environmental\n            and social objectives; that it intends to continue to\n            utilize its dialogue with the Government (GOI) and its\n            public sector enterprise, Coal India Ltd., to: (1) monitor\n            provision of support to communities, in particular tribal\n            living in coal mining areas, including the issuance of land\n            titles/long-term leases to PAPs; (2) encourage establishment\n            of an Independent Monitoring Panel to support resolution of\n            issues related to subsistence allowances and land titling;\n            and (3) advise GOI on apparent entitlements for subsistence\n            allowances for 121 eligible families in Parej East.\n            Management also proposes to continue post-project\n            supervision until June 30, 2004, when all of the outstanding\n            actions are expected to be completed. The Report identifies\n            several lessons learned from this project experience: 1)\n            Assumptions about organizational change should be realistic.\n            2) Efforts should be made to strengthen national and state\n            level legislation. 3) Mechanisms for institutional\n            coordination should be carefully assessed during\n            preparation. 4) Critical issues should be resolved prior to\n            initiation of implementation. 5) Obligations of implementing\n            agencies should be clear and specific. 6)  Innovative\n            approaches should be explored for restoration of livelihoods\n            in mine-related resettlement. 7) Thorough analysis of the\n            feasibility and risks of proposed resettlement options\n            should be conducted during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2003-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
