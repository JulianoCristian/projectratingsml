This report\n            therefore states that although Coal India Ltd. (CIL) and the\n            Government of India (GOI) have expressed their willingness\n            to act on a number of the outstanding issues, the pace of\n            resolution in some cases has been rather slow due to the\n            complexity of the issue, and the constraints of the existing\n            legal context. This also limits the impacts of the\n            Bank's efforts to facilitate desirable resolutions. As\n            described in the report, there are a number of issues for\n            which Bank supervision has already been terminated (issues 6\n            and 9) or which Management now proposes the Bank should no\n            longer supervise, either because they are substantially\n            resolved (issues 1 and 4) or because there is little\n            prospect that further Bank supervision would impact outcomes\n            (issues 5 and 7). For the remaining issues - settlement of\n            claims for Project affected people (PAP) cultivating land\n            under customary tenure (issue 2), provision of long-term\n            leases for their house plots in the resettlement area (issue\n            3), and mechanisms for consultation and dissemination of\n            project related information to PAPs (issue 8) - Management\n            proposes to monitor development for a further six months,\n            and to intervene if it believes this would help further\n            progress. One further supervision mission would be planned."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
