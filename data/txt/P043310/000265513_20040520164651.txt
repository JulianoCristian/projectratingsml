                                      The Inspection Panel

                               Report and Recommendation
                                                    on
                                     Request for Inspection


INDIA: Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project (Credit No.
                    2862-IN) and Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project
                               (Loan No. 4226; Credit-No. 2986)


1.    On June 21, 2001, the Inspection Panel (the "Panel") received a Request for Inspection
      (the "Request") dated June 14, 2001 related to activities in the Parej East mining area
      under the above-referenced Projects. (Annex 1) On June 22, 2001 the Panel notified the
      Executive Directors and Bank President of receipt of the Request (meaning "Registration"
      under the Panel's Operating Procedures).1

A.     FINANCING

2.    The Board of Executive Directors on May 16, 1996 approved an International
      Development Association (IDA) Credit for an amount equivalent to about US$63 million
      to finance the Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project (CSESMP) with
      the proceeds to be on lent to Coal India Ltd (CIL). The Credit was due to close on June
      30, 2001. With about US$24 million un-disbursed, on June 29, 2001 the closing date of
      the Credit was extended for one year.

3.    On September 9, 1997 the Executive Directors approved an International Bank for
      Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loan for the equivalent of US$530 million and
      an IDA Credit to India for about US$2 million equivalent to help finance the Coal Sector
      Rehabilitation Project (CSRP). Nine months later, on June 17, 1998, the Loan became
      effective. At the Request of the Borrower on July 24, 2000 the original amount of the
      Loan was reduced to US$261,300,000 equivalent as a result of the cancellation of
      US$268,700,000 from the undisbursed amounts of the Loan. The original amount of the
      Credit was reduced to about US$1.41 million equivalent as a result of the cancellation of
      all amounts undisbursed as of that date. The Loan closing date is June 30, 2003.

B.     THE PROJECTS

4.    Parej East mine, an opencast coalfield under development since 1993, is one of the 25
      mines included in the CSESMP and CSRP. Operated by Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), a

        subsidiary of CIL, it is located in the Hazaribagh District of the State of Jharkand,2
        According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) for the CSESMP there were eleven
        settlements within the "area of project influence" with a combined population of 2,913,
        including 2,078 tribals for whom community development actions were planned. There
        were a total of 818 Project Affected People (PAPs) to be resettled under the Project, of
        whom 382 were tribals. Of these, 418 family members were entitled to rehabilitation.              3


5.      The two Projects were initially conceived as one to include both investment in coal mine
        reform and expansion, and the mitigation of the environmental and social impacts this
        would generate.        Due to the scale and complexity of the mitigation measures, the
        Borrower and Bank Management decided instead to have them addressed in advance in a
        free standing project, the CSESMP, that became effective in July 1996, over two years
        earlier than the CSRP became effective.

6.      The objectives of the CSESMP are to assist CIL in making coal production more
        environmentally and socially sustainable through technical assistance to enhance the
        company's capacity to deal with environmental and social issues. The objectives are also
        to assist the CIL in the implementation of the Environmental Action Plans (EAP),
        Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAP), and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDP) in
        the 25 coal mines that were slated to receive financial assistance under the then proposed
        CSRP.4 The Parej East mine has an EAP, RAP and IPDP.

7.      The objectives of the CSRP were to support India's market-oriented reforms in the coal
        sector and to provide financial and technical support for Coal India's efforts to make itself
        commercially viable and self-sustaining. This included expansion of the coal mines.              5


8.      Approval of the CSRP Loan was subject to satisfactory implementation of the CSESMP.
        At the time the Loan was approved, the staff reported that implementation was more
        positive in Orissa than in Bihar but that "proper implementation of [CSESMP] will be
        closely supervised and safeguarded through cross-conditionality between the [CS]ESMP
        credit and the proposed CSRP loan."         6


9.      Before the proposed CSRP could become effective, the Borrower had to be in compliance
        with all obligations under the CSESMP legal agreements and further obligations relating
        to environmental and social mitigation set out in Schedule 9 of the CSRP Loan
        Agreement. The Loan and Credit, approved in September 1997, became effective in June
        1998. After this, under the CSRP Loan Agreement (Article VI, Section 6.01(f)), the Bank
        was entitled to exercise its remedies if the Borrower failed to perform any of the

        obligations set forth in Schedule 9 to the Agreement. The Agreement also contained a
        cross default clause dealing with failure to perform any of the obligations under the
        CSESMP Legal Agreements.

C.       THE REQUEST

10.     The Request was submitted by Ms. Bina Stanis of Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti
        (CASS), a local non-governmental organization representing residents of the Parej East
        coal mining Project area. The Panel received copies of authorization of representation
        signed by the Requesters, who have requested that their names be made available to the
        Panel members, but otherwise remain confidential.

11.     Citing the objectives of the CSESMP, the Request explains that for Project Affected
        People (PAPs "this means that the quality of their lives would improve, that they would
        share in the benefits of the mining project, that their displacement and relocation would
        be undertaken as a development programme, that their former living standards, income
        earning capacity and production levels would be restored, if not improved."7 They assert
        however that: "Now, as the end of this CSESMP project is imminent, it has failed in its
        professional aims and failed in the guarantees that were given to the PAPs, guarantees
        that were used as levers to win consent to give their land and livelihood for the [CSRP]
        project."8

12.     Instead, the Requesters claim that they have suffered harm as a result of failures and
        omissions of IDA in the implementation of the CSESMP in Parej East coal mine Project
        area. In particular, failure to provide income restoration has resulted in significant harm.
        Now without compensatory land, employment or self-employment they subsist as casual
        labourers at mere survival levels with the loss of human dignity and the demoralization at
        being dependent on the coal company that does not employ them. Formerly landowners,
        they now live in a colony without legal possession of any land, where their former
        farming skills are no longer applicable, their former productive sources dismantled and
        their supporting networks and kin groups dispersed. They now suffer increased illness as
        a result of pollution of water sources and wells in the resettlement colonies that are not fit
        for drinking. Although a dispensary has been built, it has never been staffed. In addition,
        although a school has been built it has never been staffed. Furthermore they are unable to
        participate in the growing service economy that goes with the expansion of the mines and
        suffer increased poverty.

13.     In the Requesters' view, the Bank has failed to supervise the CSESMP adequately as it
        had guaranteed to the PAPs when they had agreed to be resettled to allow for the proposed
        expansion of the Parej East mine subsequently financed by the Bank under the CSRP.

14.     The Request asserts that there has been a lack of required consultation and participation,
        especially on changes made during the life of the Project to CIL's Resettlement and

         Rehabilitation (R&R) policy, and it implies that PAPs were not consulted about
         environmental issues.

15.      More specifically, the Request lists many requirements of the Bank's policy on
         Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30) that they believe the Bank has violated. Generally,
         the Requesters assert that they have "a right to fair and adequate compensation for loss of
         their lands and villages."9    They focus their complaint on the "key issue" of failure of
         income restoration. The Request explains that the basis of the PAP's former "non-formal"
         economy was income from (i) common property resources, and (ii) income from their
         own privately owned lands. But the Request asserts that income restoration has not taken
         place because:

              16.1     As a result of mine expansion, common property resources such as water
                       sources, fruit trees, forest sources for fodder, fuel, building material etc,
                       have been greatly depleted, "and for PAPs (in contrast to the company
                       employees) these are NOT being replaced. The income from [common
                       property resources], basic to the PAPs non-formal economy, has radically
                       diminished."  10



              16.2     They maintain that "monetary compensation for private income producing
                       assets (land) has not been adequate to secure replacement by other income
                       producing assets (replacement land, other capital assets). Ultimately [the
                       cash] is mostly spent on consumer items."11

              16.3     They claim that CIL's policy has kept employment by the company to a
                       minimum.

16.      Finally, the Requesters assert that the "much flaunted self-employment projects which the
         Bank guaranteed would fill in for the above shortages, are grossly failing to replace
         livelihood, if they have at all materialized." While conceding that "training has been
         done" they say if is "often short and ineffective, and not linked to explicit employment
         opportunities."  12



17.      The Requesters claim they have been harmed as a result of Bank violations of various
         provisions of the following Bank Policies and Procedures:

         OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment
         OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples
         OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement
         BP 17.50 on Disclosure of Operational Information
         OPN 11.03 on Management of Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Project
         OD 13.05 on Project Supervision

18.      The Requesters call on Bank Management and the Board of Executive Directors to extend
         the CSESMP. At the time the Request was filed the Credit was due to close on June 30,
         2001 with about US$24 million still unspent. The Requesters believe that the remaining
         Credit funds should be "targeted towards the restoration of PAP's livelihoods and
         environmental remediation."13

D.        THE MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

19.      On July 20, 2000 the Panel received the Management's Response to the Request (the
         "Response"). (Annex 2). The Response maintains it is "providing the Panel with written
         evidence that it has complied, and intends to continue to comply, with all the relevant
         policies and procedures related to the design and implementation of the [CSESMP]."14

20.      Where the Bank agrees there are failures or omissions they are attributed to delays,
         unsuitability of planned mitigation measures, and at times, the PAP's lack of co-operation.

21.      Management states that the Borrower began the CSESMP Project implementation late, i.e.
         towards the end of 1997, about 18 months after effectiveness of the Credit. After this,
         during 1998 and 1999, Management admits that progress was both slow and uneven
         across the 25 mine sites. Significant implementation progress throughout all 25 Project
         mines only began in the first half of 2000.15 But economic rehabilitation was still
         unsatisfactory. The Response indicates that because of this, as well as for other reasons
         related solely to the "un-disbursed balance" of the CSRP, the CSRP Loan "was cancelled"
         in July 2000.16 However, the Bank chose not to cancel the CSESMP Credit but rather to
         "continue to actively work with CIL to help develop practical solutions to improve
         environmental and social mitigation at the mine and corporate level, and to achieve
         compliance with Bank policies."17 Since then Management considers that there has been
         noticeable progress on implementation.

22.      The Response maintains the Bank has conducted an intense supervision effort. It also
         asserts that consultations have been adequate but admits that CIL did not consult PAPs
         before it introduced changes on eligibility and entitlements in its Resettlement and
         Rehabilitation policy in the year 2000.

23.      The Response refers to the Requesters' right to adequate and fair compensation for loss of
         villages and land. Explaining that resettlement sites constitute the compensation for loss
         of villages, Management admits there have been a number of problems "deriving from

14 "Management Response" at ¶ 1.
15 Id. at ¶ 92.
16  According to the "Management's Response", however, at the time that the Request was filed an amount
equivalent to about US$24 million remained in the Loan account "which relates to irrevocable letters of credit
issued for equipment ordered but not yet delivered" (Fn. 14); otherwise "the project has been 'de-activated' and is
no longer an active project." (¶ 20.)
17 Id. at ¶ 21.

        initial lack of flexibility and understanding on the part of mine management, and from
        resistance to relocation by the PAPs..." and their changing demands.18                  The Response
        agrees that there are no legal titles or long term leases for house plots in resettlement sites,
        stating that the supervision team has been raising the issue during every mission and will
        continue to seek a resolution to the issue. As far as services go in the resettlement sites,
        the Response maintains that a drinking water problem has been corrected but the school
        and clinics are not yet staffed.

24.     Management is satisfied that compensation paid to entitled PAPs for agricultural land is
        equivalent to replacement costs. It also states that CCL cannot delay the release of
        compensation payments to avoid PAPs spending the cash they receive on consumer items
        rather than on land or houses. The Response recognizes that compensation for customary
        tenure has been slow with the supervision team "repeatedly" requesting CCL to facilitate
        expeditious processing of the claims. The Response maintains that common property
        resources are available for those choosing to shift to the resettlement sites. Management
        is also satisfied that the compensation provided for houses enables the PAPs to construct a
        replacement house at par with their original house as required under the Bank's OD. 4.30.

25.     In general Bank Management believes it is too early to judge whether efforts made will
        result in the intended full income restoration. The Response acknowledges that mine jobs
        are limited to those losing more than two acres. Otherwise compensation consists of
        training and assistance for self employment. Management agrees that this cannot by itself
        bring about full economic rehabilitation or result in an income comparable to working in
        the mines. Availability of replacement land through market purchase is limited and the
        Bank is still discussing the possibility of introducing land based income generation with
        CCL.

26.     Management states that the Environmental Assessment did not identify issues related to
        the Bank's policy on cultural property (OPN 11.03) but claims that when issues have
        arisen, they have been dealt with in a "manner consistent with" the policy.19

27.     The Response asserts that the Bank policy on disclosure (BP 17.50) has been complied
        with in Parej East, but agrees that the Borrower did not permit release of the CSESMP
        mid-term review.

E.       EXTENSION OF THE MITIGATION PROJECT

28.     In the Response, Management announces that the CSESMP closing date has been
        extended for one year until June 30, 2002.20 Management claims that some "key
        activities" related to the extension of the closing date "will also address the issues raised
        in the Request for Inspection."21


18Id. at ¶ 52.
19Id. at ¶¶ 88-89.
20The need for an extension was apparently envisaged as early as February 1999. CIL requested it on March 26,
2001, and the Government formally requested an extension in April.

F.      ELIGIBILITY

29.     For purposes of determining the eligibility of the Request and the Requesters, the Panel
        reviewed the Request and Management's Response.                         Panel Members Jim MacNeill
        (Leader) and Edward S. Ayensu22 also visited New Delhi, where they met with
        Government and World Bank officials. They then visited the Parej East Project area
        where they met with the Requesters and representatives of CASS who represent them as
        well as with others. They also met with officers of the CCL.                   Before the visit, the Panel
        consulted with the Executive Director representing India and his staff.23

30.     Paragraph 9 of the 1999 Clarifications mentions certain "technical eligibility criteria" that
        must be met by a Request for Inspection, and the Panel concludes as follows:

             (a)    The Panel is satisfied that the affected party consists of two or more persons
                    with common interests or concerns and who are in the borrower's territory.
             (b)    The Request does assert in substance that a serious violation by the Bank and
                    IDA of their operational policies and procedures has or is likely to have a
                    material adverse effect on the Requesters.24
             (c)    The Request does assert that its subject matter has been brought to
                    Management's attention and that, in the Requesters' view, Management has
                    failed to respond adequately to it, thus demonstrating that it has followed or is
                    taking steps to follow the Bank's policies and procedures.
             (d)    The matter is not related to procurement.
             (e)    The related Credit/Loan has not been closed or substantially disbursed.
             (f)    The Panel has not previously made a recommendation on the subject matter.

31.     The Panel's visit confirmed that the Requesters' are eligible and that CASS was
        authorized to represent them. Therefore the Panel finds that the Requesters and Request
        are eligible.

G.      CONCLUSION

32.     The Request and Management Response contain conflicting assertions and interpretations
        about the issues, the underlying assumptions, the facts, compliance with Bank policies and
        procedures, and harm and potential harm. The Panel is neither able to address these
        conflicting statements in the 21 day period available to it to prepare and submit this report
        on eligibility, nor is it allowed to do so pursuant to the 1999 Clarifications of the


22 The Panel members were assisted by Assistant Executive Secretary, Ms. Antonia M. Macedo.
23 The Panel wishes to thank the Executive Director and his staff for their assistance. It wishes to thank the Director
(Fund-Bank), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal,
in New Delhi with whom they met. It also wishes to thank CASS and local people who took time to meet with
them. Finally, it would like to thank Bank staff in New Delhi and Washington for their logistical support.
24 According to the "1999 Clarifications" when the Panel makes a field visit to establish eligibility it "will not
report on the Bank's failure to comply with its policies and procedures or its resulting material adverse effect..."

1.   The World Bank is financing the implementation of a project called India Coal Sector
     Environmental and Social Mitigation Project (CSESMP), which covers 24 coal mines in
     India, of which Parej East is one. As far as our knowledge goes, the project is SAR no
     15405-IN, approved on 16.05.97, for a IDA loan of $ 63.m. The Project is complementary
     to the Coal India Rehabilitation Project (CIRP), an IBRD loan for expansion of production
     of the same 24 coalmines. The CSESMP is expected "to improve the lives of some 186,000
     people, most of whom are poor" (World Bank report FY 1996), i.e. those affected by the
     mining expansion under the CIRP. More specifically, the Objectives of the CSESMP for
     the concerned mines are to support the implementation of Environmental Action Plans,
     Rehabilitation Action Plans and Indigenous Peoples Development Plans, and to provide
     technical assistance to Coal India in order to strengthen the institutional capacities for
     dealing with social and environmental issues. (A third component of the project is not
     relevant for East Parej). For the Project Affected People (PAPs), this means that the quality
     of their lives would improve, that they would share in the benefits of the mining project,
     that their displacement and relocation would be undertaken as a development programme,
     that their former living standards, income earning capacity and production levels would be
     restored, if not improved.

2.   We understand that the Bank has the following policies and procedures

               OD 4.30 Involuntary Resettlement
               OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples.
               OD 4.01 Environmental Assessment
               OD 13.05 Project Supervision
               BP 17.50 Disclosure of Information
               OPN 11.03 Management of Cultural Property.

3.   The Claimants claim that their rights under these World Bank Policies be respected. The
     claimants have a right to participation and consultation (which was effectively denied
     because their attempts to raise concerns did not result in improvement of implementation).
     They have a right to fair and adequate compensation for the loss of their lands and villages.
     They have an interest in a full and proper assessment and mitigation of the environmental
     risks associated with this project. The violations of their rights, and especially the failure to



                                                    10

   restore their livelihoods, has resulted in significant harm in that they are now without
   compensatory land, without employment, and without self-employment, all of which could
   restore their livelihoods. Now being casual labour, they live at the mere survival level with
   loss of human dignity. In words of the Bank's own OD 4.30, their former skills (farming)
   are no longer applicable, their former productive sources are dismantled and their
   supporting networks and kin groups are dispersed.

4. The Claimants claim the Bank has violated some of its own policies in the above mentioned
   Operational Directives, and it has failed to adequately supervise the CSESMP project as
   guaranteed when it undertook the project.


     (a)     Some such policy violations are:

             OD 4.20 no 6 "full respect for dignity, human rights...
             OD 4.20 no 8 "informed participation of the people themselves...
             OD 4.20 no 14 (d) "local patterns of social organization in the
             plan's design...
             OD 4.20 no 14 (e) "development activities should support production systems...
             OD 4.20 no 15 b) "baseline data...
             OD 4.20 no 15 c) "land tenure...
             OD 4.20 no 15 d) "local participation ...
             OD 4.30 no 3(e) " who may have usufruct or customary rights to the land or other
             resources...
             OD 4.30 no 3(b) "compensation at full replacement cost prior to...
             OD 4.30 3 (b) "particular attention... poorest groups
             OD 4.30 4 "preference to land-based resettlement strategies...
             OD 4.30 8 "need to be systematically informed and consulted about
             their options and rights...
             OD 4.30 9 "improved education water, health and production services to both
             communities.
             OD 4.30 11 (b) "socio economic surveys information on full resource base
             including income from informal sector...from common property...
             OD 4.30 no 13 "new sites productive potential ... at least equivalent...
             OD 4.30 13 (c) "legal arrangement for titles...
             OD 4.30 no 14(a) "special arrangements concerning land title....
             OD 4.20 no 15 "access to equivalent resources and earning opportunities...
             OD 4.30 no 17) "to treat customary and informal rights as equally as possible...
             OD 4.30 17 "resettlement plan ...including common property and non-title based
             usufruct systems governed by locally recognized land allocation system....
             OD 4.18 "alternative employment strategies...
             OD 4.30 19 "improved social services...
             OD 4.30 19 "take into account population growth...
             OD 4.30 21 "target date...expected benefits would be achieved.




                                              11

(b)     To be more specific:
One key issue of the ESMP is income restoration of the PAPs. It can be argued
that without it, the ESMP has failed in its purpose, that these Bank projects have
only impoverished people.

The basis of the PAPs' former non-formal economy was income from (i) common
property resources (CRP), and (ii) income from their own (privately owned)
lands.

(i) As a result of the expanded mining, common property resources (water
sources, fruit trees, forest sources for fodder, fuel, building material etc) have
been greatly depleted, and for the PAPs (in contrast to the company employees)
these are NOT being replaced. The income from these CRP, basic to the PAPs
non- formal economy, has radically diminished.

(ii) Monetary compensation for private income producing assets (land) has not
been adequate to secure replacement by other income producing assets
(replacement land, other capital assets).        Ultimately it is mostly spent on
consumer items.

Employment by the company has by company policy been kept minimal.

The much flaunted self-employment projects which the Bank guaranteed would
fill in for the above shortages, are grossly failing to replace livelihood, if they
have at all materialized. Training has been done, often short and ineffective, and
not linked to explicit employment opportunities.

Hence income restoration has not taken place. The outcomes are:

        ·   the PAPs now earning as casual labourers,
        ·   their living in a colony, without legal possession of any land, where
            as formerly they were land owners,
        ·   the demoralization by feeling loss of their independent living and
            now being dependent on the coal company which does not even
            employ them.
        ·   The increase of illness (esp. water borne diseases) as a result of the
            pollution of water sources, and the wells in the resettlement colonies
            are not fit for drinking. While dispensary building has been built,
            medical services have not been provided to handle the increased
            illness. Lack of capability of securing other services (e.g. education).
        ·   Inability to participate in the new economy which is growing around
            the mines.
        ·   Increased poverty.

(c)     Further, during the term of the project, CIL's R&R policy underwent
changes. There was no discussion of this with the PAPs at any level, never any



                                   12

             public discussion.    Yet it is not the lives of the Bank and CIL officials
             who decided, but the lives of the PAPs which are being controlled by this policy.
             This example serves to illustrate the reality of claims of "participation".

5. The claimants believe their rights/interests have been adversely affected as a direct result of
   the Bank's violations. The project has destroyed their livelihood, and this has not been
   replaced as explicitly guaranteed to them by the Bank. As a result they are less able to meet
   nutrition and health needs, educational needs, and are unable to adequately participate in
   the growing formal economy.

6. They believe the action/omission is the responsibility of the Bank.

7. There has been constant communication with these problems of the CSESMP to the Bank
   as follows:

   Bank.

8. The claimants received polite and pro-active responses to all their communications, but in
   time came to realize that these were only serving to wall-paper failures on the ground which
   were not being addressed. They find the responses of the Bank to be unsatisfactory. Now,
   as the end of this CSESMP project is imminent, it has failed in its professed aims
   and failed in the guarantees that were given to the PAPs, guarantees that were used
   as levers to win consent to give their land and livelihood for the project.

9. They therefore believe that the above actions and omissions which are contrary to the above
   policies or procedures have materially and adversely affected their rights/interests
   and request the Panel to recommend to the Bank's Executive Directors that an investigation
   of   these    matters    be   carried     out   in    order   to   resolve   the    problems.

   Hence we :

         a) call on the Inspection Panel to investigate the Bank's compliance with its policies
         identified above,

         b) call on the Board of Executive Directors to permit this investigation to go forward,

         c) we further call on Bank Management and the Board of Executive Directors to
         prolong the term of the Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project
         until such time as the Board can review the Inspection Panel's research and
         investigation findings.    We believe that the objectives of this project, and the
         necessary compliance with Bank policies, has not been accomplished, and that is



                                               14

          would therefore be an abrogation of the Bank's responsibilities to local people to now
          close the CSESMP with a large percentage of the money remaining unutilized.
          We believe that the money remaining under the CSESMP should be targeted towards
          the restoration of PAPs livelihoods and environmental remediation.

          As advised in your Operating Procedures, this Request for Inspection is brief. We
          can provide you with more particulars. We request you to keep the identity of the
          claimants confidential for their own well being.

Project Fact Sheet

                            Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 4226-IN)

Project Development Objectives: The main project objectives are to support the market-oriented
reforms India is undertaking in the coal sector and, specifically, to provide financial and technical support
to Coal India's efforts to make itself commercially viable and self-sustaining. Underpinning India's
broad drive to achieve economic growth, the project also aims to increase domestic supplies of coal, by
financing investment in the most profitable 24 opencast mines of Coal India, for the power sector and
other industries until imports and production from private investments can fill the emerging supply gap.

Applicable Operational Directives:            All environmental and social mitigation activities are handled
under the free-standing Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project.

Credit amount of US$2 million, US$1.41 million had been disbursed. Disbursements made under the JBIC co-
financing totaled US$235.7 million. As a result of the fluctuation in the exchange rate, the amount cancelled from
the Loan will be US$273.7 million. JBIC will also cancel the same amount. While the loan account is still open to
allow for disbursements under the special commitments given by the Bank, about US$24 million which relates to
irrevocable letters of credit issued for equipment ordered but not yet delivered, the project has been "de-activated"
and is no longer listed as an active project.

1.      SUMMARY

4.      The Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project (CSESMP) was designed
as a free-standing project to mitigate impacts deriving from the investment component of the
Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project (CSRP). The CSESMP was classified as a category A project
for purposes of OD 4.01, and accordingly Coal India Ltd. (CIL) prepared an Environmental
Impact Assessment which identified adverse impacts and the measures to mitigate these through




                                                 24

Environmental Management Plans for the 25 mines under the project26 At the time of the
CSESMP Board presentation all applicable safeguard policies were complied with. The
CSESMP became effective in July 1996, nearly two years earlier than the CSRP, in order to
provide time for CIL to establish the required capacity for environmental and social mitigation,
and enable the Bank to assess the implementation progress prior to the negotiations for the
CSRP. However, after CSRP effectiveness, overall progress on both environmental and social
mitigation did not improve as expected, and CIL's commitment was for some time questionable.

5.      Although the un-disbursed balance of the CSRP was cancelled on July 24, 2000, at the
request of the Government of India, the CSESMP has continued in order to assist CIL to develop
practical solutions to improve environmental and social mitigation at the mine and corporate
level. On April 20, 2001, the Government of India requested that the Bank extend the project
closing date for one year, until June 30, 2002. In view of the improvements in CIL's
performance and commitment over the past year, the Bank approved this request. The purpose
of the extension is to enable Coal India Ltd. to enhance its social and environmental management
capability and to advance towards completion of its social and environmental mitigation
obligations.

6.      Over the life of the CSESMP, Management has devoted full attention to the intense
supervision effort required by the scale and complexity of the project's physical, mitigation, and
institutional activities. The resources allocated for project supervision have considerably
exceeded the average for the South Asia Region. Since CSESMP effectiveness, a total of 21
supervision missions have been undertaken. The Parej East mine under the CIL subsidiary of
Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) located in Jharkand (formerly Bihar), was visited during 18 of
these missions. The Bank supervision team has exercised due diligence in highlighting the
problems and issues in project implementation that required CIL's attention and improved
performance, including those pertaining to the Parej East mine (Annexes 2 and 3).

7.      Consultation and participation on both social and environmental mitigation activities has
been a continuous process, involving a wide variety of stakeholders from preparation through
implementation. At Parej East, project officials have held a total of 54 consultations from April
1995 to the end of May 2001, in which both affected communities and individuals, as well as
NGO representatives participated (Annex 5). Although it has often taken some time to resolve
the issues raised by project affected persons (PAPs) or other stakeholders during these
consultations, the end result has in many cases led to improvements in the areas desired.
Moreover, the annual Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples Development
Plans (IPDPs) are developed in consultation with the target population (Annex 6).

8.      Throughout the project period, resettlement in Parej East has encountered a number of
problems deriving from an initial lack of flexibility and understanding on the part of mine
management, and from resistance by the PAPs to resettlement. While these problems have not
been entirely overcome, there has nevertheless been progress. To date, in Parej East, 52% of the


26      As required by OD 4.01, public consultations were held with project affected people and NGOs (see
Section 3.2.1), an independent advisory panel with Indian and international experts was retained (see Section 3.1),
and the Environmental Assessment report was made available at Coal India Ltd. headquarters and at the
headquarters of subsidiary coal companies (see Section 3.9).


                                                        25

project affected families (PAFs) scheduled for relocation by the end of 2002 have shifted from
their habitations. Only 27% of these have shifted to one of the two resettlement sites, although
these were selected in consultation with the PAFs, while another 4% are in temporary
accommodations provided by the mine. In contrast, 69% have opted to relocate to sites of their
own choosing after receiving the cash site development grant that CIL has introduced into its
corporate Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Policy as an alternative to a plot in a
resettlement site. This recent development provides some grounds for optimism that the
resettlement process will encounter less resistance in future.

9.      Although income restoration activities for PAPs were slow to begin due to a combination
of the difficult circumstances existing in the coal mining areas, CIL's weak capacity, and uneven
commitment, application of lessons learned has led to gradual improvements in performance.
Based on an electronic database maintained by CIL of the PAPs in Parej East, analysis of a
sample of 337 of those entitled to economic rehabilitation assistance shows that 79% have been
able to maintain or increase their incomes (in real terms) during the project period.27 The EPAPs
who have not been able to restore their incomes will be offered renewed opportunities to engage
in income restoration activities involving training combined with investment assistance. The
ongoing improvements to existing monitoring arrangements will enable a more targeted
approach to income restoration, as well as a more complete assessment of the outcomes.

10.     Management is satisfied that compensation for agricultural land and houses under the
Coal Bearing Areas Act has been sufficient to replace lost assets. However, compensation for
land held under customary tenure is more difficult in terms of identification of entitled persons.
This is partly due to the complex nature of the issue itself, complex government procedures, and
the current transition from the State of Bihar to the new state apparatus of Jharkand. Claims to
compensation for land held under customary tenure are being resolved on a case by case basis by
the District authorities (para 68). With regard to replacement of customary access, the location
of the resettlement sites have been selected so that access to common property resources such as
grazing and minor forest produce will not further deteriorate as a result of the relocation.

11.     The Environmental Assessment undertaken as part of appraisal did not identify any issues
related to cultural property, and OPN 11.03 on Management of Cultural Property in Bank-
Financed Projects was therefore found not to apply. Nevertheless, when issues have been raised
during project implementation by PAPs regarding sites of religious importance, including the
Muslim graveyard and the holy groves (sarna) in Parej East, they have been dealt with in a
manner consistent with OPN 11.03.

12.     In accordance with the Bank's BP 17.50 on Disclosure of Operational Information, public
information centers have been established at all 25 CSESMP mines to effectively disseminate
project related information. These centers have been visited by the team during supervision
missions. In Parej East, the public information center is located in the office of the Community
Development/R&R Officer, the mine level CIL officer responsible for social mitigation
activities.



27      Income levels were analyzed for 337 of the 625 EPAPs where income data were available from both the
1997 census, and either the June 2000 census or the April 2001 census.

claimants' Request for Inspection.


2.       BACKGROUND

2.1      Coal Sector Investment and Mitigation Projects

14.      India has made a rational decision to continue its reliance on the country's abundant coal
reserves, at least over the next 15-20 years. 28 The World Bank has therefore been supporting
India's coal based energy strategy to meet the needs of its growing economy and improve its
management of environmental and social mitigation. A study carried out between 1995 and
1998 on Environmental Issues in the Power Sector (EIPS) concluded that utilization of domestic
coal as the main source of primary fuel for power generation would remain the only feasible
option for India in the medium term.

15.      The CSRP was intended to support market-oriented reforms in the coal sector in India
and the commercialization of the operations by CIL through financial restructuring,
corporatization and productivity improvement. The investment component of the CSRP, which
provided support for the modernization and expansion of already existing open cast coal mines,
was going to generate substantial environmental and social impacts which required mitigation
measures.29 Due to the scale and complexity of these mitigation measures, Management decided
that the best way to address these fully was through a free-standing CSESMP.30 By the time
CSESMP was presented to the Board on May 16, 1996, it was determined that the project was in
compliance with all applicable safeguard policies.31

16.      The objectives of the CSESMP are (i) enhancing Coal India's capacity to deal more
effectively with environmental and social issues; (ii) implementing appropriate policies for
environmental mitigation and resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected by coal projects
and providing support to communities, in particular tribals, living in coal mining areas; and (iii)
testing the effectiveness of these policies in the 25 coal mines that have been slated to receive


28       With a population almost 4 times that of the United States, India consumes only about one third as much
coal as the U.S. India's reliance on coal (298 million metric tons consumed in 1995) is smaller than that of Russia
(321 million metric tons), the United States (853 million metric tons), or China (1,330 million metric tons).
Germany, with 269 million metric tons consumed in 1995, is only slightly behind India.
29       The CSRP (Ln.4226-IN & Cr.2986-IN) was supported by an IBRD loan of US$530 million and an IDA
Credit of US$2 million. In addition, US$530 million in co-financing was provided by the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC), formerly the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM).
30       The CSESMP is a IDA Credit of US$63 million and covers 25 mines belonging to five subsidiaries located
in originally five and now six different states (Orissa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkand, and
Uttar Pradesh). The project's objectives are the strengthening of CIL's institutional capacity to deal with social and
environmental mitigation, implementation of appropriate policies for social and environmental mitigation, and the
testing of the appropriateness of these policies in the 25 project mines through EAPs, RAPs and IPDPs. All the 25
mines have EMPs, 24 have IPDPs, and 14 have RAPs.
31       Memo of April 24, 1996 from H. Vergin, Director, SA2 to D.J. Wood, Vice President, South Asia Region.
Clearance was issued by ASTEN on April 19, 1996 regarding OD 4.01, OD 4.20 and OD 4.30. The clearance with
regard to the social safeguard policies was made with reference to clearance by ASTHR dated April 22, 1996. The
environmental classification of the project was A. Clearance by LEGSA was issued on April 19, 1996.

financial support under the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. CIL has in place two corporate
policies, namely an Environmental Policy, and a Resettlement & Rehabilitation Policy, plus a
Community Development Plan for management of activities relating to indigenous peoples.

17.      Under the CSESMP, environmental mitigation is undertaken through Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs), and social mitigation activities through either Resettlement Action
Plans (RAPs), or Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs) which deal with two different
target groups. While the RAPs are instruments to mitigate individual property and income losses
caused by land acquisition, the purpose of the IPDPs is to enable communities not affected by
land acquisition in the vicinity of the mines to share in development benefits. The RAPs and
IPDPs are implemented by designated staff from CIL supported by ten locally recruited NGOs.
Based on the original RAPs and IPDPs, annual action plans are developed through consultation
with the target groups.32

18.      At the level of the CSESMP, there are 14 mines with land acquisition for which RAPs
were developed in 1994 during project preparation. The total number of families (PAFs) to be
resettled are 2,584, and the number of PAPs entitled to assistance for income restoration is
10,003.33 IPDPs involving community development assistance are being undertaken in 24
mines, and comprise villages not affected by land acquisition and located within a one kilometer
radius around the mines. The target group under the IPDPs comprise around 186,000 people
belonging to 186 villages. About a third of the IPDP target group belong to scheduled tribes who
are generally settled in mixed villages among caste Hindus and scheduled caste Hindus.34 In this
context, development activities focusing exclusively on tribals would be socially divisive, and
the IPDPs are therefore aimed at the community as a whole with particular emphasis on the poor
and women.

19.      The CSESMP became effective in July 1996, nearly two years earlier than the CSRP, in
order to provide time for CIL to establish the required capacity for environmental and social
mitigation, and to enable the Bank to assess the implementation progress prior to the negotiations
for the CSRP. To reinforce CIL's performance on environmental and social mitigation, the
progress on mitigation activities was linked to the CSRP through a series of covenants in the
CSRP Loan Agreement (See Annex 1 for Schedule 9 of the Loan Agreement). When the CSRP
became effective in June 1998, CIL was substantially in compliance with the applicable
Schedule 9 covenants, and the exceptions were caused by circumstances beyond the control of
the CIL.35

32       Both the annual RAP and IPDP action plans are submitted to the Bank for clearance, and often go through
a process of revision and improvement before they are approved.
33       Figures from the PAP census undertaken in late 1997 to update the original census from 1994.
34       The official classification of social and/or ethnic groups and the land they live on rests on principles
established in 1890, which have not been changed substantially since then. As a result, what is classified as forest
area may long since have been converted into farm land, and originally migratory groups may have become
sedentary farmers. Most of the tribal population in the vicinity of the mines have been exposed to mining operations
for the past 20 to 35 years. The Parej East mine began operating in 1993. Their contact with industrial and mining
operations is therefore nothing new, and their livelihood is often closely related to the mining operations in different
ways (direct employment in mines, work for contractors, or pilferage of coal).
35       Schedule 9, para 3(a) requires CIL to issue Photo ID cards to all entitled PAPs. Due to ongoing court cases
filed by PAPs contesting compensation for lost assets in MCL in Orissa, 22% of the PAPs in the six MCL mines
refused to receive the ID cards as they believed that this would be tantamount to acceptance of the contested


                                                           28

20.      Due to unsatisfactory performance on coal sector reform, financial covenants under the
CSRP, and economic rehabilitation under the CSESMP, Management informed the Ministry of
Coal and CIL on January 20, 2000, that it was considering applying its legal remedies and move
towards suspension.36 Following CSRP and CSESMP supervision missions in March 2000,
subsequent meetings were held between the Energy Sector Director and both GOI and CIL. As
the issues remained unresolved, the India Country Director met with the Secretary, DEA on June
1, 2000, and outlined two options open to the government: (i) if GOI could achieve compliance
with the covenanted actions under the two projects in the near term, the Bank would suspend the
CSRP Loan, reinstating it when compliance was achieved, or (ii) if GOI assessed that
compliance could not be achieved within a reasonable time span, they should request
cancellation of the balance of the CSRP loan. On July 24, 2000, CIL and Department of
Economic Affairs requested cancellation of the un-disbursed balance of the loan and credit. On
July 25, 2000, Management cancelled the un-disbursed balance of the CSRP loan, and on
January 21, 2001 the un-disbursed balance of the CSRP Credit was cancelled.37 While the loan
account is still open to allow for disbursements under the special commitments given by the
Bank (about US$24 million)38, the project has been "de-activated" and is no longer listed as an
active project.

21.      After CSRP effectiveness in June 1998, the overall progress on both environmental and
social mitigation did not improve as expected, and CIL's commitment was for some time
questionable. The performance on economic rehabilitation was also unsatisfactory. However,
despite the less than satisfactory performance, particularly with regard to economic
rehabilitation, of the CSESMP, Management did not consider suspension or cancellation of the
CSESMP to be a constructive option. As the purpose of the CSESMP was to mitigate impacts
deriving from the CSRP and to strengthen CIL's capacity to manage such mitigation issues,
Bank withdrawal from the CSESMP would not have provided the context for a continued
dialogue. On the contrary, withdrawal by the Bank might have adversely affected the
considerable task that still remained regarding improvement of mitigation efforts. Therefore,
Management decided to continue to actively work with CIL to help develop practical solutions to
improve environmental and social mitigation at the mine and corporate level, and to achieve
compliance with Bank policies.

2.2      CIL's commitment and capacity


compensation. Moreover, in the village of Hensmul under the Ananta mine in MCL, some of the villagers prevented
both the original 1994 baseline survey and its 1997 updating, since some PAPs who had received jobs as
compensation for land loss feared that their jobs would be reallocated to others as a result of the survey. To provide
time for CIL to achieve compliance with the Schedule 9 covenants without undertaking any resettlement,
contingency mine plans were agreed with the Bank which would enable mining to continue over a five to seven year
period without any relocation (see aide memoire from May-June 1998, and memo of June 17, 1998 from Mr. Suzuki
to Mr. Lim).
36       Letter of January 20, 2000 from the Country Director, India to the Secretary Coal, Government of India,
with copy to Chairman, CIL.
37       Of the IBRD Loan amount of US$530 million, US$235.7 million had been disbursed, and of the IDA
Credit amount of US$2 million, US$1.41 million had been disbursed. Disbursements made under the JBIC co-
financing totaled US$235.7 million. As a result of the fluctuation in the exchange rate, the amount cancelled from
the Loan will be US$273.7 million. JBIC will also cancel the same amount.
38       This amount relates to irrevocable letters of credit issued for equipment ordered, but not yet delivered.


                                                          29

22.     Enhancement of CIL's capacity to deal more effectively with environmental and social
issues on a company-wide level is one of the development objectives of the CSESMP, and
achievement of this objective is possibly the most important legacy that the CSESMP can leave
behind. Capacity building has been pursued at two levels, namely that of implementation of
mitigation measures in the 25 project mines, and that of institutional reform at the company level
to strengthen CIL's capacity to manage environmental and social mitigation throughout the
company.

23.       At the Bank's recommendation and with Bank support, CIL introduced from 1997 a four
module training course for its social mitigation staff and for the staff of the facilitating NGOs.
The four training modules are (i) CIL's R&R and Community Development policies and
implementation issues, (ii) income generation for PAPs, (iii) information management, and (iv)
participation.39 A second round of training was conducted during 1999 for new mine level staff
as well as for participants at the subsidiary level, and special courses have been conducted to
enable staff to manage the computerized PAP database. Training courses for environmental
officers have been developed and conducted by the Indian School of Mines in Dhanbad, Bihar.
At the recommendation of the Bank supervision team, CIL has conducted workshops for both
social and environmental staff to enable an exchange of lessons learned between project mines.
The training together with the actual implementation experience have been found to strengthen
the capacity of both social and environmental mitigation staff.

24.     Although terms of reference for a study on the Strengthening of CIL Social and
Environmental Management Capability was agreed in July 1997, the selection of a consultant
only took place in February 1999, and the study was only initiated in March 2000. The study was
completed by October 2000, and its major outputs are policy guidelines and recommendations,
technical managerial and operational guidelines on social, environmental, and safety guidelines,
and an institutional strengthening action plan. Based on the recommendations of the study, CIL
has adopted an Institutional Strengthening Action Plan to enhance its environmental and social
mitigation capacity beyond the 25 Bank supported mines and beyond the life of the CSESMP. 40
The action plan will mainstream the lessons learned during the CSESMP and introduce improved
practices regarding environmental management, social impact assessments, and resettlement and
rehabilitation in mine planning. One innovative aspect of the plan involves the introduction of
the concept of mine closure planning, which incorporates both environmental rehabilitation of
the mined area and measures to minimize social costs.

25.     It is worth noting that the overall performance and commitment by CIL has improved
after the closure of CSRP. Indicators of this are:

    · The Institutional Strengthening Action Plan is currently under implementation, and CIL
        has formed high level strategy groups both at headquarters and in all subsidiaries, drafted



39      The first training on CIL's social mitigation policies was conducted in September 1997, that on income
generation in November 1997, on information management in February 1998, and on participation in August 1998.
40      CIL is currently negotiating a follow-up contract with the consultant that undertook the study regarding
technical assistance to implement the institutional strengthening action plan.

         subsidiary action plans, and authorized staff as responsible for the handling of
         environmental and social mitigation throughout the company;
     · Economic rehabilitation measures involving self-employment assistance have been
         strengthened through the provision of assistance regarding the investments or market
         linkages required to enable the EPAP to earn an income on the basis of the training
         received.41 This assistance is also being provided to those EPAPs, who have been trained
         previously, but who have not been able to utilize the training because they did not have
         access to credit or lacked market linkages.
     · As most of the displaced persons are villagers familiar with agriculture, CIL has for the
         first time introduced land based income generation on unused or reclaimed mine land as a
         means of economic rehabilitation. Pilot projects on unused or reclaimed mine land have
         been started in SECL and are about to start in MCL;
     · Lessons learned from the CSESMP regarding resettlement and rehabilitation, the
         participatory aspects of community development, and environmental mitigation are now
         being applied in non-project mines;42
     · On April 20, 2001 GOI, MoC and CIL requested a one year extension of the project
         closing date.


           3.       RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY THE REQUESTER

         3.1      Project supervision: The Bank ...has failed to adequately supervise the CSESMP
                  project as guaranteed when it undertook the project (p. 2 of the Request).

                  26.       Over the life of the CSESMP, Management has devoted full attention to
                  the intense supervision effort required by the scale and complexity of the project's
                  physical and institutional activities. To ensure the autonomy of CSESMP
                  supervision in relation to the CSRP, Management decided that the responsibility of
                  managing the project should be with the Social Development Unit with a
                  supervision budget independent of CSRP, which is managed by the Energy Unit.
                  The resources allocated for project supervision have been considerably above the
                  average for the South Asia Region. To date, a total of 21 supervision missions
                  have been undertaken since CSESMP effectiveness in June 1996, including a
                  midterm review in February/March 1999 (for details on missions, team
                  composition and issues raised in Management Letters, see Annex 3. Regarding
                  visits to Parej East and issues raised with CCL, see Annex 4).

42       Both NCL and WCL have decided to extend the IPDP approach to all mines under the subsidiaries. SECL
is also applying the IPDP approach to participatory planning of community development activities outside the
project mines, as is MCL in the Kalinga Area. WCL has developed RAPs for two non-project mines with land
acquisition, and engaged facilitating NGOs. Environmental mitigation is also replicated in WCL where workshop
effluent treatment plants will be established in 5 non-project mines every year. Construction of domestic effluent
treatment plants is also being considered.

27.      Eighteen out of twenty one supervision missions has involved extensive field visits to
project mines.43 Each mine visit has included visits to villages targeted for assistance under the
IPDPs and RAPs, interactions with PAPs regarding relocation and economic rehabilitation, and
meetings with different stakeholders. Project supervision has also involved technical assistance
by the project team, including ongoing support to establish and improve monitoring
arrangements, as well as the development and participation in staff training courses and
workshops.44 In addition to the supervision missions, there has been continuous written and
electronic communication with the CIL, and when required with other stakeholders such as
advocacy NGOs and individuals who have raised issues regarding the project.45 Moreover, the
Country Director visited Calcutta in late 1997 and early 1998, and met with the Board of
Directors of CIL and its subsidiaries to convey Management's concerns regarding the slow
progress of CSESMP.

28.      As required under the CSESMP Development Credit Agreement (Schedule 2, para 5), a
Project Implementation Supervision and Monitoring Consultant has, since April 1997, been
undertaking supervision of all project mines on a quarterly basis as a supplement to that by the
Bank supervision team. The team deployed by the consulting firm comprises two
environmentalists and two social scientists, who conduct field visits as part of the preparation for
their quarterly reporting. To date, 16 quarterly reports have been submitted, each with one
volume covering the environmental and social issues relating to a particular subsidiary. Over
time, as the consultant developed its capacity, the reporting has become a useful tool for Bank
missions. Additionally, as required under the CSESMP Development Credit Agreement
(Schedule 2, para 4), a Social and Environmental Review Panel comprised of two Indian and two
international experts has since April 1997 been providing an independent assessment of CIL's
policies and performance regarding environmental and social mitigation. The staff of Review
Panel has conducted a total of seven field visits to CCL (field visit schedule in Annex 5). The
findings of the Panel as recorded in its four reports have confirmed those of Bank supervision
missions. 46

29.      As reflected in mission aide memoires and Management Letters, the project supervision
has strived for a realistic assessment of the problems faced by the project, and has tried to
facilitate solutions that promoted improved implementation and compliance with Bank policies.
Particular emphasis has been given to economic rehabilitation of PAPs as is described below.




43       The exceptions are the missions in June 1997, February 1998, and June 2000.
44       The Bank conducted a workshop on institutional change and capacity building for CIL management and
project staff from November 2-7, 1997, and another workshop on the same issue was held on October 13, 2000 on
the findings and recommendations of a study on `Strengthening of CIL Social and Environmental Management
Capability'. The Bank team provided technical assistance during1997 to CIL regarding the development of a four
module training course for the staff involved in activities related to social mitigation comprising both RAPs and
IPDPs.
45       Files related to these communications are available.
46       The Review Panel has submitted four reports as follows: (1) October/November 1997; (2) June/July 1998;
(3) May and August 1999, and (4) May 2000


                                                           32

3.2     Consultation and Participation: The claimants have the right to participation and
        consultation (which was effectively denied because their attempts to raise concerns did
        not result in improvement of implementation). (p. 1 of Request)

30.     CIL has held consultations with both PAPs and NGOs during the course of project
preparation and implementation. In addition, Management and the supervision team has had
extensive interaction with a number of local and international NGOs interested in the coal
projects during the course of project preparation and implementation as described below See
Annex 5 for consultations with PAPs in Parej East).

3.2.1 Consultation on environmental mitigation: The PAPs "have an interest in a full and
        proper assessment and mitigation of the environmental risks associated with this project"
        (p. 1 of the Request)

31.     In accordance with the requirements of OD 4.01, consultations were held on the draft
Sectoral Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Action Plans for the 25 mines.
In May 1995, a workshop on the Environmental Assessment was held in Calcutta, which also
included PAPs, local NGO representatives, and environmental organizations.47 The opinions
voiced by the PAPs and NGOs were included in a report prepared after the workshop, and the
findings of the workshop were discussed with the PAPs of Parej East in July 1995. The
finalization of the Environmental Action Plans was made after considering the suggestions and
recommendations made during these consultations.

3.2.2 Consultation during project preparation

32.     Consultation and participation under the CSESMP for both social and environmental
mitigation activities has been a continuous process, involving a wide variety of stakeholders. In
March 1995, a two day workshop was held in Calcutta, on Income Restoration and Self
Employment Alternatives which included representatives from the project affected people. In
addition, a number of State Government officials and a total of 41 NGOs participated, eight of
whom were from Bihar. Subsequent workshops were organized at the subsidiary level involving
representatives from both the PAPs and NGOs.

33.     At the mine level, project officials in Parej East have held a total of 54 consultations with
the affected communities from April 1995 to the end of May 2001, in which both affected
persons and NGO representatives participated (see Annex 5 for details of consultations). During
project preparation, 13 consultations were held in Parej East to discuss issues raised by the PAPs,
including: (i) increase in plot size and allotment of sites by caste group; (ii) damage of homes
due to blasting; (iii) Environmental Assessment; (iv) land compensation; (v) mine jobs; and (vi)
income generation. In addition, these consultations were used as a forum by CCL to disseminate
project related information such as CIL's R&R Policy, infrastructure development of the
resettlement site, and the commencement of a survey to determine appropriate income generation
options.



47      NGOs represented from the Parej East area were Jagriti Vihar and INTACH. The names of the PAPs are
known, but are not given here in order to protect their anonymity.


                                                          33

34.    One of the outcomes of these consultations was that PAPs were able to choose their plot
       in the resettlement site and the self-employment training option which appealed to them.
       Additionally, a committee was constituted to assess the claims of damage due to blasting.
       Continued dialogue between project officials and affected persons brought about an
       increase in the resettlement plot size from the 100 sq. meters provided for under CIL's
       R&R Policy to 200 sq. meters. Other consultations led to the selection of the Prem Nagar
       resettlement site at the request of the PAFs from Turi Tola (see also para 43, and Annex
       5).

3.2.3 Consultations on Annual RAPs and IPDPs

35.     Throughout project implementation there have been a series of consultations regarding
the planning of the annual RAPs and IPDPs. During project preparation, CIL engaged nine
NGOs as consultants to carry out Baseline Socio-Economic Surveys of the affected populations
in the 14 mines with land acquisition. On the basis of these surveys, the original Resettlement
Action Plans were prepared in 1994. The NGOs conducted an extensive house to house census
with a structured questionnaire to elicit the current socio-economic status of the affected people
and receive input on each individual's preferred means of economic rehabilitation if jobs in the
coal mines were not available.

36.     Prior to the preparation of the annual RAP action plan, including measures for income
restoration activities, the mine authorities post notices in the RAP villages, the Public
Information Center, and other prominent places to inform the entitled project affected persons
(EPAPs) about the income restoration planning and to invite them to select a self-employment
training option. Following these announcements, EPAPs are contacted individually and the
different training opportunities are discussed with them. Once an EPAP has chosen a training
option an application form is filed which indicates their willingness to participate in the training
and the type of training selected. The number of EPAPs consulted annually, is given in the
Table below:

37.     For preparation of the original Indigenous Peoples Development Plans in 1995, bids from
24 NGOs (including CASS) were solicited, and five were eventually selected from the six NGOs
who responded. The NGOs utilized focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal, and
in-depth interviews with the villagers to elicit information about community needs and get a
general sense of the community's willingness to participate in the construction of assets and
other activities such as training.

38.     In each of the villages implementing IPDPs in CCL, Village Working Groups (VWGs)
have been constituted and individuals from all sections of the community are represented (see
Table below for details). In the case of the VWGs in Parej East, nearly 25% of all
representatives are women, while two-thirds are from scheduled tribes.

39.     The VWGs have played an integral role in the development of the IPDPs by assessing the
needs in their communities and determining the types of infrastructure, training, and community
activities required to meet those needs. Moreover, in the implementation phase, the VWGs have
served as contractors for civil works constructed under the plans, and as a result of this
experience have been awarded a number of small civil works contracts by the mines and in some
cases also by the Block Development Office or Panchayat (see Annex 6 on IPDP activities in
Parej East).

3.2.4 Grievance Committee in Parej East

40.     On May 27, 1996 a Coordination and Monitoring Committee (CMC) was established in
Parej East to approve and oversee the implementation of the annual RAPs and to serve as the
first point of entry in dealing with grievances. The Committee is comprised of the Project
Officer, CD/R&R Officer, facilitating NGO representative, PAP representatives and the District
Development Officer. Although the CMC held monthly meetings, Bank supervision missions
observed that the Committee was not carrying out its grievance redress function and
recommended that a Grievance Committee be established. The CMC was reconstituted as a
Grievance Committee on July 3, 1999 and has held two meetings thus far. In addition, at the
request of the villagers, another Committee was formed in January 2001 to include greater
participation from the EPAPs of the Parej and Duru villages and has held two meetings. The
Grievance Committee is comprised of 11 EPAP representatives and 5 representatives from CCL
management.

41.     A grievance register is maintained in the Parej East Public Information Center, and since
June, 1997 a total of 30 grievances have been recorded. The reason given by CCL for this low
number of recorded grievances is that in many cases the grievances represented are handled by
mine authorities immediately, and are therefore not entered. Furthermore, the facilitating NGO,
the Xavier Institute for Social Service (XISS) and the Community Development/ Resettlement &
Rehabilitation officer (CD/R&R) visit the villages regularly and deal with the issues raised by
the PAPs (see Section 3.6.1 on the Tribunal that deals with complaints regarding land
compensation).

3.2.5 Consultations with CASS: "The claimants received polite and pro-active responses to
all their communications, but in time came to realize that these were only serving to wall-paper


                                                 35

failures on the ground which were not being addressed. They find the responses of the Bank to be
unsatisfactory" (p. 4 of the Request)

42.     The supervision team has had significant interaction with a number of local and
international NGOs interested in the coal projects during the course of project preparation and
implementation. From early 1996, frequent communication began between the supervision team
and CASS. In addition to regular correspondence, the supervision team met with CASS in Parej
East to discuss their concerns in April 1997, December 1998, February 1999 (in conjunction with
the Midterm Review), November 1999, January 2000, and March 2000. The supervision team
has communicated all of the concerns raised by CASS to CIL and CCL, and has repeatedly
facilitated a dialogue between CASS and CCL as well as between the PAPs and CCL. In
response to concerns raised by CASS, the supervision team has discussed the issues with CCL,
and the issues on which CCL has taken action include (see Annex 4 and 5 for further details):

        · Increase in the size of plots in the resettlement sites from 100 sq.m. to 200 sq.m per
            PAF;
        · Consultation with the Turi Tola villagers resulting in selection of a resettlement site
            of their own choice;
        · Contracting of a reputed community development consultant to assist the Turi Tola
            PAFs regarding income generation through the manufacture of cane baskets for
            underground mining;
        · An increase in the minimum distance for controlled blasting from the legally
            permissible distance of 100 m to 150 m from the nearest habitation;
        · Consultation and agreement with PAPs regarding the shifting of two sacred groves
            (sarna) to the Pindra resettlement site;
        · Establishment of improved grievance redress arrangements;
        · Relocation of the school in Parej village to Lower Barison village following request
            by CASS;
        · Follow-up on the suggestion made by CASS that CCL should involve a cooperative
            of female EPAPs in plantation works implemented under contract by the Forest
            Department. A meeting with CASS was held on December 15, 1999 with mine
            authorities, PAPs, and XISS the facilitating NGO in the area. As requested by CASS,
            CCL changed the contract with the Forest Department to provide for weekly
            payments to daily labor instead of the existing monthly payments. Moreover, CCL
            asked CASS to facilitate the involvement of the women's cooperative in the
            plantation works, but did not receive assistance from CASS.


3.3     PAPs and revisions to CIL's R&R Policy: Further, during the term of the project,
        CIL's R&R policy underwent changes. There was no discussion of this with the PAPs at
        any level, never any public discussion (p. 3 of Request)

43.     During the February/March 1999 Midterm Review, CIL and the supervision team agreed
to undertake a joint review of the R&R Policy to identify possible areas of improvement based
on lessons learned during implementation. In April 1999, CIL constituted a committee
consisting of the Chairman cum Managing Directors from three of its subsidiaries. The findings


                                                 36

and recommendations of this committee were to be discussed in a joint CIL/Bank workshop
planned for November 1999. However, the report of the committee was not yet available during
the November 1999 supervision mission, and the workshop was rescheduled for February 2000.

44.      The workshop did not take place during the February/March 2000 supervision mission, as
the committee was not available. However, in the meantime CIL introduced changes into its
policy regarding eligibility and entitlements recommended by the committee.

45.      While CIL did not hold direct consultations with the PAPs on the revision of its R&R
Policy, the revisions themselves were a response to issues raised by affected persons in previous
consultations during implementation of the existing policy. The concerns of PAPs resulted,
significantly, in two additional compensation options being introduced in early 2000.48 The first
revision offers displaced PAFs the choice of receiving a lump sum payment of Rs. 50,000 in lieu
of a house plot in the resettlement site as a site development grant. This payment is the
equivalent of the average infrastructure investment per plot in a resettlement site, and is given to
the PAF in addition to the compensation provided for the loss of house and homestead land. The
primary benefit of this additional compensation option is that it provides the PAPs with greater
freedom in deciding where to resettle, as well as providing them with the means to do so. The
second revision provides the option to PAPs of monetary compensation in lieu of a mine job for
land losers whose loss of land entitles them to mine employment.49 A copy of the original Policy
has been translated into the local language and is available in the Public Information Center, and
brochures in the local language highlighting important provisions have been distributed to the
PAPs.

46.      While the above strengthening of CIL's R&R Policy, which introduces additional options
of the EPAPs, is consistent with OD 4.30, the supervision team recommended further
enhancements to the policy during the October/November 2000 supervision mission.
Discussions during the May/June 2001 mission resulted in CIL's acceptance of the team's
recommendation that land losers and their dependents above 18 years who are not entitled to a
mine job, or the newly introduced cash compensation in lieu of a mine job, will be entitled to
income restoration assistance. The supervision team also recommended that unmarried sons
aged 18 years and above should be entitled to additional plots in resettlement sites, or that the
minimum plot size per family should be increased above the 100 sq.m provided for in the `old'
policy. CIL did not agree to incorporate this recommendation into their revised policy.
However, Coal India's practice for all but one resettlement sites in the 13 mines with
resettlement has been to provide plots from 250 to 400 sq.m.50 In view of this, the supervision
team has requested CIL to reconsider its position on this issue and reflect this practice in the
revised policy.



48       Aide memoire for supervision mission from February 28 to March 15, 2000, para 39.
49       The payment will be Rs. 100,000 for the first acre of land, or pro-rata payment subject to a minimum of Rs.
25,000. For the 2nd and 3rd acre, the compensation will be 75,000, and Rs. 50,000 on pro-rata basis for land above 3
acres. This payment is in addition to land compensation.
50       The exception is the Birsanagar resettlement site in Jharkand where the plot size is 100 sq.m. In response
to PAP requests, successive Bank missions have recommended to CCL that additional land be made available to the
PAPs for kitchen gardening. However, despite CCL's initial acceptance of the recommendation, it was later claimed
that no land in the vicinity of the site could be made available.

3.4     The target groups for social mitigation in Parej East: The CSESMP is expected "to
        improve the lives of some 186,000 people, most of whom are poor", i.e. those affected by
        the mining expansion under the CSRP......For the Project Affected People (PAPs), this
        means ...(p. 1 of the Request).

47.     The population of 186,000 referred to in the Request for Inspection is the aggregate
number of persons targeted under the IPDPs under the CSESMP, not those affected by land
acquisition, and they are therefore not entitled to compensation for lost assets or economic
rehabilitation.51 Under the CSESMP, the total number of persons affected by land acquisition
and entitled to economic rehabilitation assistance is 10,003, while the number of PAFs to be
resettled is 2,584.

48.     The original RAP for Parej East, was developed by the Central Mine Planning and
Design Institute Ltd., in August 1994, and was reviewed and cleared by the Bank The census
undertaken as part of RAP preparation identified 257 PAFs who would have to be resettled.
However, due to delays in mine expansion, the number of PAFs to be resettled has been reduced
to 227. The original census also identified 418 PAPs as entitled for income restoration
assistance. In early 1998 the census was updated and the number of EPAPs was found to be 625.
From that point onwards, resettlement and rehabilitation activities have been implemented on the
basis of annual RAPs approved by the local RAP Coordination Committee, which includes
representatives from the PAPs and the `host' community.

49.     For Parej East, an overall IPDP was developed in November 1995 by the consulting firm
Operations Research Group. Eleven villages with a total population of 2,913 persons were
identified for IPDP implementation.52 The original IPDP was primarily intended to be indicative
of the scale and range of activities. Beginning in 1998, community development activities have
been implemented under annual village specific IPDPs. These village specific IPDPs are
developed through a participatory planning process involving a Village Working Group (VWG)
that represents different segments of the village population and contains both women and men.
Civil works activities are whenever technically feasible implemented through community
contracting by the VWG (see Annex 6 for IPDP activities).

50.     Both the population affected by land acquisition, and those in the villages targeted for
community development activities under the IPDPs comprise different social groups. Of the
population in the 11 villages targeted for IPDP activities, 71% belong to Scheduled Tribes, and
the rest to different Scheduled Castes. Eight villages are exclusively or predominantly inhabited
by Scheduled Tribes, while two villages comprise only Scheduled Castes, and one has a
predominantly Scheduled Caste population. Of the population affected by land acquisition, 38%
belong to Scheduled Tribes.53 The distribution of social groups in the villages affected by land
acquisition and resettlement is as follows:



51      However, in villages targeted for assistance under the IPDPs, income generation activities have been
implemented where beneficiaries have chosen such activities during the participatory annual planning exercise.
52      The villages are Jharnatungari, Borwa Tola, Kasmar Khas, Bihor Tola, Barison Upper, Barison Lower, Turi
Tang Tola, Facodith (Ageria), Ulhara Tola, Ulhara Basti, Ulhara Zamunia.
53      The population classified as Scheduled Tribes is mainly Santhals.

51.     The religious identity of the PAPs vary, with 36 % identifying themselves as Hindu, 31%
as Sarna (combination of tribal and Hindu religious elements), 30% as Muslim, and the
remaining 3% as Christian.

3.5     Resettlement in Parej East: The Requester's complaint regarding OD 4.30 is that the
        people have not received "fair and adequate compensation for the loss of their lands and
        villages"(p.1 of the Request)

3.5.1 Fair and adequate compensation for villages

52.     Resettlement sites constitute the compensation for loss of villages (compensation for loss
of land and other assets is discussed under Section 3.6). In the course of RAP implementation,
resettlement in Parej East has encountered a number of problems deriving from initial lack of
flexibility and understanding on the part of mine management, and from resistance to relocation
by the PAPs. In addition to the general resistance to relocation that exists in every situation
involving involuntary resettlement, difficulties also arose when changing demands from PAPs
undermined previous agreements that had been reached between the mine management and the
PAPs.

53.     Selection of the resettlement sites to compensate loss of villages has been made in
consultation with the PAPs. The location of the main resettlement site - Pindra - is right next to
the main road through the area, on the slope of a valley with access to both grazing and
collection of forest produce.54 The Prem Nagar site for the 8 PAFs from Turi Tola was selected
in direct consultation and with the consent of the PAFs, and is located next to the Parej East mine
colony and with immediate access to a forest area.

54.     Relocation in Parej East has been a contentious issue where claims and counter-claims
have been made by PAPs and those speaking on their behalf on the one hand, and CCL on the
other.55 At the same time, this has served to highlight issues that then became the subject of a



54      The Pindra resettlement site has a capacity to accommodate 282 PAFs.
55      Allegations of police violence against Turi Tola PAPs were made by The Berne Declaration in a letter of
November 5, 1996 to CIL, and refuted by CIL in their communication to the Bank of November 7, 1996. In a letter
of January 4, 2000 to the Bank, the Requester (CASS) alleged that CCL's handling of the relocation in late
December 1999 of PAFs from the hamlet of Borwa Tola had been in violation of CIL's R&R Policy and the Bank's
OD 4.30. In response, a member of the CSESMP team from the Bank's New Delhi Office investigated the
circumstances of the relocation in Parej east on January 20-21, 2000, met with CASS and PAPs, and found that
while the allegations were unfounded, there was nevertheless scope for improvements in the way CCL did handle
resettlement. The findings of the visit were communicated to CASS on February 8, 2000, and recommendations


                                                         39

more fruitful consultation process leading to decisions that benefited the PAPs. Examples of this
are CCL's acceptance of the request for a separate resettlement site by the PAFs from Turi Tola,
and the effort to provide these PAFs with viable income restoration through manufacture of cane
baskets for carrying coal in underground mines.56 Other examples related to the supervision
team's discussion with CCL of the Borwa Tola relocation are improved information
dissemination on relocation from CCL, renewed efforts by CCL to get the State authorities to
expedite the settlement of claims regarding land under customary tenure, transparency regarding
the basis for calculation of house compensation, improved handling of PAP grievances, and an
increase of the minimum distance from a habitation at which controlled blasting can take place
from 100 to 150 meters.

55.      At present, 118 or 52% of the PAFs scheduled for relocation by the end of 2002 have
shifted from their habitations as follows (see Map 1):

56.      Of the families who have resettled, 23 PAFs have settled in the Pindra resettlement site,
and 8 PAFs have opted for the Prem Nagar site. Of the 9 families, who are all from the Turi
Tola hamlet, only 3 have so far built houses on the site in Premnagar and 1 in Pindra, while 5
continue to stay in the mine staff quarters that were originally provided by the mine as a
temporary arrangement when they relocated in May 1997. Another 5 PAFs are also living in
temporary accommodation provided by the mine. Instead of moving to the resettlement sites, 82
of the PAFs (69%) have chosen to relocate elsewhere, after receiving the additional cash site
development grant, that CIL has introduced as an alternative to a plot in a resettlement site under
its revised R&R Policy. The response both in Parej East and in other mines to the introduction
of this alternative to relocation to a resettlement site, provides grounds for optimism that the
resettlement process will encounter less resistance in future.

3.5.2 Legal title to plots in resettlement sites: "they are living in a colony without legal
         possession of any land whereas formerly they were landowners" (p. 3 of the Request).



were made to CIL regarding improved practices regarding relocation which were reiterated in the mission aide
memoire for the supervision mission from February 28 to March 15, 2000 (para 46-48).
56       According to CIL, the PAFs in the Turi Tola hamlet are encroachers on government forest land that had
been acquired by CCL for mining in 1993. The Turi Tola PAFs were displaced by the neighboring TISCO mine in
the early 1990s, and moved to settle on the land acquired for mining by Parej East.

57.     The supervision team has raised the issue of land titles or long term leases for house plots
in resettlement sites acquired under the CBA Act with CIL and MoC during every supervision
mission. A patta format proposed by CIL to provide long term leases for PAPs to resettlement
plots was forwarded to MoC on March 30, 1999. The Law Ministry has communicated to CIL
that the issuing of pattas could be considered on a case-by-case basis for particular resettlement
sites. A specific patta format for Pindra resettlement site was submitted to MoC on April 1,
2000. MoC required that CCL submit additional information. This was done on December 5,
2000, and, although the matter is still unresolved, CIL are following up with MoC. Meanwhile,
CCL has issued "temporary pattas" allotting specific house plots to the PAFs who opted for
relocation to the resettlement sites. The supervision team will continue to seek a resolution to
this issue.

3.5.3 Services in resettlement sites ­ drinking water: "increase of illness (esp. waterborne
        diseases) as a result of the pollution of water sources and the wells in the resettlement
        colonies are not fit for drinking" (p. 3 of Request).

58.     The Pindra resettlement site is furnished with internal roads lined by drains
accommodating 130 house plots, electricity, and water supply from three open wells and one
hand pump. CCL tested for Coliform at three different sites in the Parej East villages. Tests in
April, May, June, and July 1999 revealed a low level presence of Coliform. CCL has taken
corrective measures, and testing done on a monthly basis in 2000 and 2001 has resulted in the
absence of Coliform in the water supply. CCL also tested for Coliform in the 3 open wells at the
Pindra resettlement site on February 1 and 8, 2000. As the tests did not indicate the presence of
Coliform, further testing was not done. The alleged increase in water borne diseases has not
previously been brought to the attention of the Bank supervision team, and upon inquiry, CCL
has reported that its medical staff have no evidence of such an increase.

3.5.4 Services in resettlement sites ­ education and health: "lack of capability of securing
        other services (e.g. education)" (p. 3 of Request).

59.     At Pindra, a school building with five class rooms has been constructed, but there has
been considerable delay in getting the Bihar (now Jharkand) state government to allocate
teachers. CIL has the position that while they should furnish the buildings for services such as
schools and clinics in the resettlement sites, it is the responsibility of the concerned state
authorities to manage and fund the operation. CCL has previously requested the state authorities
to provide teachers, but without result. More recently, CCL has taken action to arrange that the
school in Parej village be continued in the Pindra resettlement site, but at the insistence of CASS,
the school was instead shifted to Lower Barisom village. From July 2000, CCL has sought the
state's concurrence to allow the organization operating the private Dayanand Anglo Vedic
(DAV) schools to take over the building for a primary school. This matter has not yet been
resolved, and in the meantime, children from the PAFs residing in Pindra are attending a DAV
school about 0.5 km away as well as another school about 2.5 km from the resettlement site.57
The supervision team will continue to follow up on this issue with CCL.

60.     Access to health services for PAPs in the Pindra and Prem Nagar resettlement sites is on
par with that before the resettlement. Prior to displacement, the PAPs had access to a hospital
run by TISCO about 4 km from Parej Village. Medical facilities are also available at the Mine
Colony at Tapin about 0.5 km from the Pindra resettlement site, and at the Government Public
health center at Chhari about 9 km away.

61.     At the Prem Nagar resettlement site, an approach road has been constructed, together
with an open well, and electricity supply.58 In addition, a community building, and facilities for
the manufacture of cane baskets comprising a water tank and shed have been provided.

3.6     Compensation for lost assets: " Monetary compensation for private income producing
        assets (land) has not been adequate to secure replacement by other income producing
        assets (replacement land, other capital assets). Ultimately it is mostly spent on consumer
        items" (p. 2 of the Request).

3.6.1 Compensation for privately held land - tenancy land

                  62.     After comparing recent market purchase prices with the compensation
                  paid to EPAPs, Management is satisfied that the compensation paid for
                  agricultural land is equivalent to replacements costs. Acquisition of land for
                  mining in Parej East takes place under the Coal Bearing Areas (CBA) Act of 1957,
                  which was modified in 1976. Under the CBA Act, notification is issued under
                  Section 4(1) announcing the intention and purpose of the acquisition. A second
                  notification is issued under Section 7 within 2 years from the date of the Section 4
                  (1) notification. Objections to the acquisition of whole or part of the land can be
                  submitted under Section 8 within 30 days of this notification. After these
                  objections are settled, a `declaration of acquisition' is published in the Official
                  Gazette under section 9(2) of the CBA Act giving the details of the land to be
                  acquired. Thereafter Section 10 vests the land rights in the Central Government
                  which in turn transfers these rights to the Government Company (i.e., CIL) under
                  section 11. Section 14 of the CBA Act provides for appeal to a Tribunal by PAPs
                  contesting the compensation that has been assessed by the District Administration
                  and CCL. The PAPs can "accept under protest" the compensation assessed by the
                  District Administration, and appeal to the Tribunal for enhancement. The Tribunal
                  will be constituted by the Central Government, and will be headed by a person at
                  the level of a High Court judge.

63.     The land compensation valuation is based on the registered land prices in the area at the
time of Section 4(1) notification. In addition to the basic assessed land value, a solatium of 30%
is added for compulsory acquisition, as well as cost escalation at 12% per annum for the period
between the notification under Section 4(1) and the "declaration of acquisition" under Section 9
(up to 3 years). On this amount is computed interest of 9% for the first year after the
"declaration of acquisition" under Section 9, and 15% for each consecutive year (see Annex 6 for
examples of calculation of land compensation). During the period from notification under

58      The 3 PAFs currently residing in Prem Nagar also have access to water from the neighboring mine colony,
where their relatives comprising 5 PAFs are residing (one is resettled in Premnagar).

Section 4(1) and the "declaration of acquisition" under Section 9, and until the land is taken into
possession for mine expansion, CIL allows the PAPs to remain on and cultivate the land.

64.      As land transactions in rural areas are often not undertaken through open market
mechanisms, prices are not easily verifiable, and a rigorous comparison of actual land
compensation awards and real market prices is difficult. However, recent market purchases are
reported at between Rs 12 to 15,000 per acre for lower quality, and Rs 40 to 45,000 per acre for
better quality land, which corresponds with the average awards made to PAPs. An assessment of
30 awards has been found to average Rs 41 thousand per acre, including trees, solatium,
escalation, and interest. Compensation has been paid within the last two years, providing a
realistic equivalent to actual replacement cost.

65.      A total of 33.89 hectares of tenancy land (privately owned land) has been acquired for
mine expansion up till March 31, 2003. Of this land, compensation has been paid for 28.23
hectares. For the balance of 5.66 hectares, PAPs have exercised their right to have their
compensation awards reviewed by the Tribunal for enhancement. At present, 43 cases have been
filed with the Tribunal, which has settled 16 cases in favor of the PAPs with increase of awards,
while the remaining 27 cases are still under review. Under Section 19 of the CBA Act, CCL has
appealed the decision of the Tribunal to increase compensation amounts to the High Court.
Regardless of the final outcome, a functioning grievance redress mechanism which does not
discriminate against the PAPs is in place.

66.      How the PAPs decide to use their land compensation is ultimately their own decision.
CCL cannot require the State Authorities to withhold the compensation money on the grounds
that it should be released only for purchase of replacement land or other productive investments.
In the case of house compensation, the supervision team has recommended that CCL deposit the
money in an account held jointly with the PAP, and only release the funds in stages if and when
the PAP begins construction of a replacement house.59 This recommendation was not accepted
by CCL on the grounds that this would infringe on the individual rights of the PAPs and be near
impossible to manage.

3.6.2 Compensation for privately held land under customary tenure

67.      Consistent with the Bank's OD 4.30, CIL's R&R Policy states that "tribals cultivating
land under traditional rights" should be recognized as units of entitlement. Before compensation
is paid in this regard, the PAPs must establish that they have a valid claim to the land. Claims to
rights in land cultivated under customary tenure are examined on a case-by-case basis by the
District authorities. During 2000, the District authorities have in Parej East conducted field
camps to authenticate PAP claims to GMK land (Ghair Mazurva Khas) in the Parej and Duru
village areas.60 During its visits to Parej East, the supervision team has requested that CCL and
XISS assist PAPs in assembling evidence for their claims, and that the decisions are made in a
transparent manner. For Parej village, 8.17 ha out of 59.5 ha of GMK land has been
authenticated in favor of 11 PAPs, while 13 have had their claims rejected regarding 8.89 ha.
Claims regarding the balance of 42.44 ha are yet to be settled. For Duru village, authentication
of claims regarding 107 ha have been completed by the state authorities, but a final settlement is
delayed by the transition to the new state government. The supervision team has repeatedly
requested CCL to facilitate that the processing of these claims is expedited.

3.6.3 Compensation for common property resources: As a result of the expanded mining,
         common property resources (water sources, fruit trees, forest fodder, fuel, building
         material etc) have been greatly depleted, and for the PAPs (in contrast to the company
         employees) these are NOT being replaced (p. 2 of the Request).

68.      The population in the vicinity of the mines has been exposed to mining operations for a
considerable period, in many cases from between 20 to 35 years. When the Parej East mine was
sanctioned by GOI in March 1993, there were 18 other mines in the area, including TISCO's
West Bokaro Colliery.61 The TISCO mine predates Parej East, and is established on a leasehold
bordering that of Parej East. Mining activities together with the expansion of infrastructure and a
growing population had, before the start of the Bank assisted Coal Sector projects, led to both a
reduction and deterioration in the availability of forest resources.62 The communities living in
the vicinity of the mining and other industrial operations had during the same period made more
or less successful adaptations to the shrinking natural resource base and the new opportunities
furnished by the changing economy.

69.      The Request for Inspection states that before the start of the CSESMP, "the basis for the
PAP's former non-formal economy was income from i) common property resources (CRP), and
ii) income from their own (privately owned) lands" (p. 2 in the Request). However, this is not
empirically correct. The socio-economic baseline study undertaken by XISS in 1994 as
preparation for the RAP states that while 52% of the PAFs were landless, "there was not a single
landless tribal family dependent on forest produce".63 The research undertaken by XISS in 1994

60       Ghair Mazurwa Khas (GMK) land was previously held by large landowners (zamindars), but was after
independence either transferred to the cultivators or to the state.
61       Report on Impact of Mining on People: A case Study of West Bokaro Coalfields, XISS, December 1994.
The total coal production at the time of the study was 3.5 million tons per year, of which 2.6 million tons came from
open cast mines.

and by Operations Research Group in 1995 as preparation for the original IPDP shows that there
was already at that time a considerable depletion of forest resources, decreased dependence on
such resources, and instead a significant involvement in an economy based mostly on casual
wage labor. In 9 of the 11 villages targeted for IPDP activities, between 70% and 90% of the
male population were working as daily wage laborers, supplemented by marginal agriculture.64
This also applies to the 71% of the IPDP target population who are tribals.

70.     To the extent that common property resources are applicable, they consist of Forest
Department land utilized by local communities for grazing, fuel wood, and timber for house
construction. As described above, the choice of resettlement sites has attempted to address the
issue of access to common property resources such as forest and grazing land. The Pindra
resettlement site provides access to nearby forest land that can be utilized by the PAFs for
grazing, fuel collection, and collection of minor forest produce. The same applies to the Prem
Nagar site, which was selected with the consent of the PAPs following consultations.65 Since
most PAFs now appear to choose to relocate outside the resettlement sites in surrounding
villages or further away from Parej East, there will be little if any scope for direct facilitation by
CCL of access to common property resources. However, to the extent that PAFs choose to settle
in the villages that are targeted for IPDP activities, they will be able to benefit from the
community development assistance extended by CCL (see Annex 9 for a comparison between
common property resources and access to facilities in the original villages and the resettlement
sites).

3.6.4 House compensation

71.     As required by the RAP, all the 118 PAFs that have relocated have been paid house
compensation. Among these 118 PAFs, there were 81 PAFs who opted for the cash site
development grant in lieu of a plot in a resettlement site, and who have received the payment.
There are 109 PAFs who are yet to relocate. The overall status regarding payment of house
compensation and the cash site development grant in lieu of a plot in a resettlement site is
presented in the table below. The figures show that all the PAFs who have not yet resettled, have
chosen not to shift to a resettlement site, but to a place of their own choice.

                                 House compensation status as of June 2001

          Payment made                               118 PAFs                 81 PAFs

          Total                                      227 PAFs                 227 PAFs




64      The exceptions are Lower Barison, where 40% are stated to be engaged in full time agriculture, and the
hamlet of Kasmer Khas, where 30% are engaged in agriculture (p. 2 of the IPDP for Parej East).
65      According to CCL, the 9 PAFs from Turi Tola were legally encroachers on the land they were occupying in
Parej East. They settled on the Parej East land after being displaced by land acquisition under the neighboring
TISCO mine.


                                                          45

72.     House compensation payment is made when the PAPs are prepared to start demolishing
their house to salvage materials for their new dwelling (se Annex 7 for examples of house
compensation assessments). The PAF receives assistance to transport the salvaged building
materials to the new site. In addition, the PAFs are also provided temporary accommodation by
CCL during the time their new houses are under construction. Based on visits to the resettlement
sites, information from PAPs on the adequacy of compensation received, and from CCL
regarding the assessment of house compensation, the supervision team is satisfied that the
compensation provided for houses enables the PAPs to construct a replacement house at par with
their original house, as required under the Bank's OD 4.30 (see Annex 8 for assessment of house
compensation).

3.7     Income restoration: "One key issue is income restoration of the PAPs. It can be argued that
        without it, the ESMP has failed in its purpose, that these Bank projects have only impoverished
        people" (p. 2 of the Request).

3.7.1 Overall status of income restoration

73.     The supervision team has been supporting CIL's efforts to enhance economic
rehabilitation through intensive supervision and by recommending full use of the provisions in
CIL's R&R Policy. While it is still too early to judge whether these efforts will result in the
intended outcome of full economic rehabilitation, it is worth noting that progress has been
achieved. At the level of the CSESMP, the proportion of those earning as a result of all types of
assistance from CIL is 40.0% of the total number of EPAPs (10,003). For Parej East, analysis of
a sample comprising half of the EPAPs show that 79% of these have either maintained or
increased their incomes, during the project period, after adjusting for inflation.

74.     CIL's practice of providing mine jobs in addition to the monetary compensation for land
loss is regarded by almost all PAPs as the most attractive rehabilitation option due to the
associated increase in income and income stability. Between 1973 and 1993 CIL provided jobs
to a total of 33,470 PAPs as compensation for loss of land. However, with the phase out of
Government support in the early nineties, Coal India was unable to continue to absorb the heavy
financial consequences of employing more labor than necessary. As a result, CIL has had to
impose severe hiring restrictions and adopt parallel manpower reduction programs. These
circumstances also required CIL, during preparation of the CSESMP, to review its approach to
economic rehabilitation during preparation of the CSESMP and to devise new ways to restore the
incomes of those adversely affected by land acquisition. Under the R&R Policy approved for
CSESMP, CIL continues to provide a mine job as compensation if two or more acres of irrigated
land (or three or mores acres of non-irrigated land) are acquired from a family. However, for
those who lose less than two acres, compensation involves training and assistance for self-
employment. Although the options for such self-employment are identified in consultation with
the PAPs, many PAPs insist that CIL should continue its previous practice of more liberal
provision of mine jobs for land.

75.     Of the total number of EPAPs (10,003)66, 47% of whom are women, the proportion of
those earning as a result of all types of assistance from CIL is 40.0%. This figure includes those

66      Does not include the number of EPAPs (211) who have died sine the 1997 census.


                                                     46

earning from mine jobs provided as compensation for land loss (25.9%), jobs with contractors
(4.3%), and income restoration through self-employment assistance (9.0%).

76.     After excluding those EPAPs who have mine jobs and those who have migrated, there are
a total of 6,532 EPAPs entitled to self-employment assistance under the CSESMP. During 1998,
1999, and 2000, a total of 1,395 EPAPs completed self-employment training. Of these, more
than half (65.7%) have been able to establish an income based on the assistance received under
the project. During a census of the EPAPs conducted in June 2000 to find out their interest in
making use of the assistance offered by CIL for self-employment 24% responded positively.
Those who did not exhibit interest in training included EPAPs employed by CIL (33%), female
EPAPs who preferred housework (24%), EPAPs who were elderly or disabled (15%), EPAPs
who felt the options offered were unattractive (7%), EPAPs who stated that the required credit
was unavailable (2%).

77.     The annual RAPs for 2001 (and 2002) will continue to provide enhanced income
restoration assistance. This assistance includes follow-up assistance regarding investments
and/or supplementary training together with assistance to establish market linkages for those
EPAPs that were trained during 1998, 1999, and 2000, but who were not able to establish an
income based on the training received. As a result, the percentage of EPAPs able to earn from
the income generation training under the previous RAPs is expected to increase.

                                                                  Date


                                                               Trained      Earning

                           78.    One of the lessons from the income restoration effort to date is that self
                           employment training cannot by itself bring about the full economic rehabilitation
                           of people displaced by coal mining in India. It needs to be supplemented with
                           other measures such as land based income generation.

79.     CIL's R&R Policy states that wherever possible and if desired by the PAP who has lost
land, replacement land should be purchased with assistance from its subsidiary companies.
However, as the availability of replacement land through market purchase is limited, the
supervision team began discussions with CIL in December 1997, regarding the introduction of
land based income generation on unused and reclaimed mine land as a supplement to the
measures provided for in CIL's R&R Policy. At the project midterm review, it was agreed that
five land based income generation pilot projects would be implemented in the subsidiaries with
land acquisition (one in Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL), South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL), and
Northern Coalfields Ltd (NCL), and two in Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL)). Later CIL

informed the supervision team that no land was available in CCL and NCL, and that land based
income generation pilots would only be started in SECL and MCL.67 The supervision team has
continued to request CIL to further explore the availability of land in CCL and NCL. So far, this
has not yielded any results. The pilot project in SECL started, and the one in NCL is about to
start.68

3.7.2     Income restoration in Parej East: "Training has been done, often short and ineffective, and not
          linked to explicit employment opportunities." (p. 3 of the Request)

80.       In preparation of the Parej East Resettlement Action Plan, XISS carried out a baseline
socioeconomic survey in 1994. Data relating to the level of employment in Parej East indicate
that 66.2% of the population were identified as non-working.69 Of the 33.8% of the population
who were main or marginal workers, 68% stated that their employment was of a seasonal nature.
In Parej village, 62.8% of the main working population was employed in mining and quarrying
activities, 22.9% were agricultural laborers, and only 1.5% were full-time cultivators.70 The
remaining 12.8% were engaged in other activities such as transport, construction, commerce, and
household industries.

81.       In order to monitor implementation of the Resettlement Action Plans, the supervision
team assisted Coal India in establishing the EPAP database, required under Schedule 9 paragraph
3(b) of the CSRP Loan Agreement, at its headquarters in Calcutta, and in the 14 mines with land
acquisition containing information gathered during the 1997 census.71 As agreed with the
supervision team, CIL and the facilitating NGOs conducted a follow-up census in June 2000, in
order to more effectively target income restoration assistance to the most vulnerable EPAPs, and
to those who were trained in previous years but have not yet succeeded in establishing an income
after training. 72 These data were entered into the EPAP database, as were the data gathered by
the facilitating NGOs and CIL in the April 2001 census, in preparation for the 2002 annual
RAPs.




67        Agreement on the five land based income generation pilot projects is recorded in the aide memoire for the
mission from February 12 to March 5, 1999, para 47. In a letter from CIL dated December 10, 1999, it was stated
that pilot projects would only be started in SECL and MCL. However land based income generation on unused or
reclaimed mine land did begin before the pilot projects when one subsidiary, namely SECL during 1999 took the
initiative to start small-scale land based income generation activities for PAPs in two mines (Dipka and Bisrampur).
68        Since the reclaimed or unused mine land has been acquired under either the Land Acquisition Act or the
Coal Bearing Areas Act, legal arrangements need to be worked out to provide security of tenure for PAPs using such
land. CIL is exploring this issue, and has in early April 2001 sent a draft lease agreement that would provide PAPs
security of tenure to MoC for consideration.

71        In order for the database to be fully accessible to CIL staff and utilized as a monitoring, evaluation and
planning tool, further modifications are required. CIL has hired a database consultant who will complete this task
by August 31, 2001.
72        The most vulnerable EPAPs were identified as the elderly without a family to support them, single women,
and the disabled. In previous years, some EPAPs had been trained but not provided with infrastructure, the tools to
pursue the trade for which they were trained, or had received sub-standard training.

82.      The present status of economic rehabilitation in Parej East was analyzed using
information from the EPAP database (see tables below). The data collected during the 1997
census identifies a total of 647 EPAPs in Parej East. Since the 1997 census, 22 EPAPs have died
leaving a caseload of 625. There are currently 82 EPAPs employed with CCL, TISCO, other
public enterprises, or who work as contractors, and as a result of their relatively high level of
income fall outside of the primary target group. In addition, 150 EPAPs have migrated since the
1997 census, many after choosing to receive the cash site development grant in lieu of a plot in a
resettlement site, further reducing the caseload to 393.

83.      One function of the June 2000 census was to identify which EPAPs were interested in
receiving the economic rehabilitation assistance provided under the project. As CIL was also
interested in improving the effectiveness of its assistance, the census also identified the EPAPs
who were not interested, and solicited their reasons for lack of interest. The results of this line of
enquiry are detailed in the table below. Regardless of the reasons stated for current lack of
interest, all EPAPs remain entitled to self-employment assistance under the project.

84.      EPAPs have been consulted on training options and have been able to choose what type
of training they wanted for self-employment. The training period varies depending on the type
of skills to be imparted, and whether those trained have any previous exposure to the activity.
For example, training on activities related to animal husbandry are shorter than for trades like
welder, electrician, and driver. At present, 138 EPAPs have completed training and 51 EPAPs


73       This number excludes those who have died, migrated, or are employed with CCL, as they have already
been counted above.
74       EPAPs in this category have indicated that they have pensions or are supported by other family members.
75       The 3 EPAPs in this category are supported by other family members.
76       The number of individuals in this category corresponds with the number EPAPs who are engaged in the
pilferage and sale of coking coal and have higher incomes than the training is likely to yield. This category also
includes 35 women who were not among the 48 women who stated that they preferred housework.

are earning an income that is directly related to their training. CCL has provided support in
terms of infrastructure and/or productive assets to 78 EPAPs . Even with investment assistance
from CCL, which has been recommended by the Bank supervision team and is provided for
under CIL's R&R Policy, there is no guarantee that the EPAPs will make the necessary effort to
turn this assistance into a viable source of income. In addition to the expected lag between
completion of training and the establishment of income, there are EPAPs who make use of the
training allowances as a temporary source of income without intending to use it as a means of
earning a permanent income. However, the 87 EPAPs who are not earning an income after
completing training, as well as others who have not restored their incomes by means of their own
or with assistance from the project, remain in the target group.77

85.      The current monthly income after completing self-employment training ranges from Rs.
50 to Rs. 2,200 and averages Rs. 585. Of the 138 EPAPs who have completed training, 58 report
additional sources of income. After training, the level of income is likely to fluctuate depending
upon the season, the type of trade, and the amount of time the EPAP has available to practice the
trade. While the average income is not high, many of those at the lower end of the range are
women who had not previously earned any income. Some of these are women of marriageable
age who are using the skill training as a means of enhancing their marriage prospects, and not for
generating income. Others are women with less time to use their newly acquired skills due to
their responsibilities in the home.

86.      Potential incomes derived from most of the self-employment training options cannot
compete with those of mine employees or those who are engaged in the sale of pilfered coal and
the production of coking coal. In Parej East, the incomes of the 87 EPAPs who are engaged in
the pilferage and sale of coking coal range from Rs. 350 to Rs. 2,500 per month and average Rs.
1,200 per month.

87.       Income levels were analyzed for 337 of the 625 EPAPs where income data were
available from both the 1997 census, and either the June 2000 census or the April 2001 census.


77       A portion of the EPAPs are women who are using the skills acquired to meet their household needs and do
not intend to generate outside income.
78       This number includes those EPAPs who did not complete training initially and have re-enrolled.
79       Training for 2001 has not yet been completed.
80       The support provided by CCL includes, tools, sheds, goats, chicks, pigs, etc.

Of those 337 EPAPs, 265 or 79% have reported that they have either maintained or increased
their incomes, during the project period, after adjusting for inflation. Additionally, 11% of the
EPAPs have reported a decrease in income while 10% have reported incomes that have not kept
pace with inflation. With the finalization of the EPAP database as described above, CIL and its
subsidiaries will be in a position to undertake a more comprehensive assessment of the status of
income restoration. On this basis, detailed plans can be made for effectively assisting the
remaining caseload.

3.8     OPN 11.03 Cultural Property

88.     The Environmental Assessment undertaken as part of appraisal did not identify any issues
related to cultural property, and OPN 11.03 on Management of Cultural Property in Bank-
Financed Projects was therefore found not to apply. Nevertheless, when issues have been
raised during project implementation by PAPs regarding sites of religious importance, they have
been dealt with in a manner consistent with OPN 11.03. Thus, during the supervision mission in
November 1999, villagers from Muslim Tola (a section of Parej village) raised the issue of
protecting their graveyard, which is located in the path of mine expansion. An agreement was
later reached between the PAPs and the mine authorities to construct a boundary wall around the
graveyard, and advance mine expansion in a manner that would leave the graveyard intact and
accessible.

89.     Similarly, consultations have been held between tribal PAPs and mine authorities
regarding two sacred groves (sarna) in the hamlets of Ganju Tola and Majhi Tola that are in the
path of mine expansion. The grove in Majhi Tola was moved in 1990 to its present location
from a mine area owned by TISCO. Agreement has been reached with a committee representing
the PAPs on this issue regarding the shifting of both sacred groves to an approved location in the
Pindra resettlement site, and funds have been allocated for this in the annual RAP for 2001.81
The mine authorities have also agreed to fund the construction of a building for performing puja
next to the new sarna.

3.9     BP 17.50 Disclosure of Information

90.     In accordance with the Bank's BP 17.50 on Disclosure of Operational Information, public
information centers have been established at all 25 CSESMP mines to effectively disseminate
project related information. At Parej East, the public information center is located in the same
building as the office of the Community Development/R&R Officer, the mine level CIL officer
responsible for social mitigation activities, and is generally accessible on a daily basis. The
following documents are available in the Center: (i) CIL's R&R Policy82; (ii) a printout of the
database of EPAPs; (iii) a list of PAFs; (iv) the annual RAP and Income Restoration Plan for
2001; (v) the annual IPDP for 2001; (vi) application form for income restoration assistance; (vii)
a specimen of a house compensation assessment; (viii) the EMP, (ix) the grievance register; and
(x) a register of visitors.




81      The committee representing the tribal PAPs regarding the sacred groves is called Bajrang Bali Samiti.
82      CIL's R&R Policy is available in English, Hindi, Marathi, Oriya, and Bengali.


                                                      51

91.      A letter from CASS to the supervision team on December 12, 1998, endorsed by 27 other
NGOs and individuals, inquired about the upcoming CSESMP midterm review and requested
that the Bank's midterm review report be made accessible to the organization, that reports by the
Environmental & Social Review Panel be made accessible, and a consultation be held with
CASS and other NGOs on the findings of the midterm review. The supervision team replied to
CASS on February 5, 1999 that the release of communication between the Bank and CIL, such
as the midterm review report and those by the Review Panel, funded under the IDA Credit could
only be released at the discretion of CIL. The reply also stated that the supervision team was
open to consultations on the midterm review findings, but that such an event would require
specific suggestions from the NGOs regarding the venue and participants. No follow-up on the
issue of consultations was received from either CASS or the other NGOs endorsing their letter.


4.       CURRENT PROJECT STATUS AND SUPERVISION PLAN

92.      Although the project became effective in July 1996, implementation only began towards
the end of 1997. During 1998 and 1999, overall implementation progress was slow and uneven
across project mines, and CIL's commitment remained problematic especially with regard to the
two key areas of economic rehabilitation of PAPs, and institutional reform to enhance CIL's
environmental and social management capabilities. Significant implementation progress
throughout all 25 project mines only began in the first half of 2000. Since then CIL has
demonstrated increasing commitment regarding both environmental and social mitigation, and
there has lately been noticeable implementation progress.

93.      The main achievements relating to the implementation of the Environmental Action Plans
are: (i) standardization of environmental monitoring; (ii) completion of studies on disposal of
oil/grease and water from mine workshops, bio-contamination of subsoil water from domestic
effluent, safety of overburden dumps, and ash disposal from power plants; (iii) construction of
effluent treatment facilities for mines, mine workshops, and mine colonies; (iv) plantation
activities; and (v) training of environmental personnel.

94.      Significant progress has also been achieved with regard to dust suppression measures and
reclamation of overburden dumps. However, despite installation of dust extractors on drills,
water sprinkling, and black-topping of roads, dust suppression measures require further
enhancement to achieve full compliance with existing air quality standards for habitations in and
around the mine areas. Activities that supplement those in the SAR have been agreed with CIL,
and since dust pollution is caused by other actors besides the mines, CIL will take steps to
establish collaboration between the concerned stakeholders.83 Although the start of overburden
dump reclamation was significantly delayed, implementation progress has picked up, and to date
civil works of good quality have been completed on 56% of the dumps, with expected
completion of all dumps by December 31, 2001.



83       A supplementary dust suppression plan was agreed between CIL and the Bank in August 1999, but needs
further enhancement by CIL as recorded in subsequent aide memoires. Stakeholders that need to be engaged in
collaboration regarding dust suppression include thermal power plants and other industries, mines operated by
owners other than CIL, and the state authorities responsible for road maintenance outside the mine leasehold areas.


                                                         52

95.     Social mitigation has achieved satisfactory results with regard to the implementation of
Indigenous Peoples Development Plans (IPDPs), and while the implementation of Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) has improved, both resettlement and economic rehabilitation continue to
demand a high level of attention from CIL. Resettlement is progressing, albeit slowly, and at
present, 72% of the 2,584 Project Affected Families (PAFs) whose houses have been acquired,
have relocated. Economic rehabilitation activities have also shown some progress. Of the
10,00384 Project Affected Persons entitled to economic rehabilitation assistance (EPAPs), the
proportion of those earning as a result of all types of assistance from CIL, including mine jobs, is
40.0%.85


4.1     Project extension and supervision plan

96.     The likely need for an extension of the project closing date was recognized during the
project midterm review.86 During the mission from October 10 to November 1, 2000,
discussions were held with CIL and MoC regarding a possible extension, provided the
momentum of improved implementation performance was maintained.87 The continuation of
this momentum was established during a mission from February 26 to March 9, 2001. Following
CIL's request of March 26, 2001 to MoC, a request for extension was submitted by DEA,
Ministry of Finance, to the Bank on April 20, 2001. On June 29, 2001, Bank Management
approved extension of the CSESMP closing date by one year until June 30, 2002. The extension
will enable CIL to better achieve the project objectives. The key activities related to these which
will also address the issues raised in the Request for Inspection, include:

    ·        Implementation of the first phase of the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan to
        enhance CIL's environmental and social mitigation capabilities beyond the scope and life
        of the project;
    ·        Income restoration activities for project affected persons (PAPs) including
        implementation of innovative land based income restoration pilot projects;
    ·        Continued relocation of PAPs from land acquired for mine expansion, accompanied
        by fair and adequate compensation for lost assets;
    ·        Environmental mitigation including completion of overburden dump reclamation and
        enhancement of dust suppression to improve air quality standards in and around the
        mines.

97.     In addition, the extension will provide scope for strengthening the progress already
achieved with regard to IPDP implementation, by further supporting community based
organizations (the village working groups involved in IPDP implementation and women's self-
help groups) to become sustainable and to enhance arrangements to maintain the community
assets created under the IPDPs.


84      This figure represents the total number of EPAPs, minus the number of EPAPs who have died since the
1997 census.
85      This figure includes those earning from mine jobs provided as compensation for land loss (25.9%), jobs
with contractors (4.3%), and income restoration assistance (9.0%).

98.    During the project extension period, Management will maintain the same level of
supervision as it has throughout project implementation. Currently, two full missions comprising
both headquarters and New Delhi based staff are planned during FY02. New Delhi based staff
will conduct additional visits as required to support progress on CIL's implementation of the
action plan, and ensure full compliance with the Bank's safeguard policies.
