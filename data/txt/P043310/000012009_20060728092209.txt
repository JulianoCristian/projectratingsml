INTRODUCTIONAND BACKGROUND

 1.     An informal BoardmeetingheldonMarch 1,2005 discussed aManagementReport on
progress inresolving outstandingissues relatedto the InspectionPanel's InvestigationReport o f
the India Coal Sector Environmental and Social MitigationProject (CSESMP). The March 1,
2005 Board discussion was reflected inthe reviseddocument entitled "India: Coal Sector Envi-
ronmental and Social MitigationProject (Credit No. 286-IN) -Management Report on Status o f
Outstanding Issues following the InspectionPanelInvestigation Report and Management's Re-
sponse" that was distributedto the Boardon April 5,2005. The April 2005 ManagementReport
set September 2005 as a target date for reviewingprogress, allowing for two further Bank imple-
mentationreview missions (whichhave now takenplace), withthe understanding that, on issues
where the level o f stakeholder cooperationi s not contributingto progress towards resolution,
Bank involvement would either be terminated or modified to providing advice andtechnical as-
sistance as needed and/or requested. The purpose o f this memorandum (which shouldbe read in
conjunction with the April 2005 report to the Board) is to comply with the Board's request to be
periodically updated on the status of issues, briefthe Board on recent developments on out-
standing issues and, inline with ManagementReport o f April 5,2005, present the Management's
views on the extent andnature o f the Bank's further involvement inlight o fprogress made.

STATUSOFISSUES

Issue 1: Economic rehabilitation of 73 project affected persons (PAPs) who experienced a
decrease inincome duringthe project period

2.      Followingthe March 1,2005 briefingto the Board, the Bank reviewedthe interimreport
withXavier Institute of Social Sciences (XISS), and discussed the draft actionplanwithXISS,
Coal India Limited (CIL) and Central Coalfields Limited (CCL). XISS submitted its final survey
report with a proposedaction plan on September 30,2005. According to the final report, o f the 73
PAPs:

    0
        employment with Rs. 130 - Rs4,462 over their pre-project income level;
        20 PAPs have increased their annual income from daily wage work and some self-

    0  4 PAPsholdregular companyjobs earning at least Rs. 6,000 per month, which is above
        any other source of income among the 73 PAPs.;
    0   10PAPs are sicwaged and supported bytheir relatives;
    0   9 PAPshave died;
    0   12 PAPs have moved out o f the area and settled elsewhere and are thus not coveredby
       the report;
    0   1personwas anon-PAP; and
    0  8 o f the 73 PAPs are not yet project affected and continue to enjoy the benefits fi-om their
       lands which are expected to come under miningover the next 5 years as part o f the nor-
       mal mine expansion. Assistance to these PAPs, accordingto their eligibilities, will be
       provided by CIL as and when they are dispossessedo f their lands.


CSESMP                                           1                              December 21,2005

 3.       The remaining 9 PAPs (out o f the 73 PAPs who in2002 reportedreducedincome) con-
 tinueto have reducedannual incomes (reductions ranging from Rs3 to Rs2,402) and arepres-
 ently inneed o f further assistanceto improve their economic conditions.

 4.       CCL informed the Bank mission (August 1-4,2005) that on the basis o f the findings o f
 the XISS survey actions had beeninitiated to help PAPs improve their economic conditions. The
 actions included:


      0  PAPs were informed by letter about the employment opportunities available to them;

      0  PAPs havebeenlisted into two `labor pools' andthe lists were suppliedto the two con-
         struction contractors for recruitment. The PAPs were informed accordingly but so far no
         PAPshave indicatedinterest inthis work;

      0  The Forest Department has also been giventhe list o f these PAPs and advisedto engage
         theminplantation activities under the project, but, so far, noneo fthe PAPsonthe list
         have expressed interest inthis work;

      0  The 9 PAPs (reporting reduced income) are presentlyworkmg inthe coal dump, and the
         Coal Dump Supervisor has been instructedto employ themon a preferentialbasis. A reg-
         ister i s beingmaintainedby the Dump Supervisor which i s checked by the Project Officer
         o f the Parej East on a monthly basis; and

     0   CCL's Project Office has identified unusedmineland that may be offered to PAPs for
         cultivation, although so far CCL has not developed an operational approach to put this
         into action.

5.       Inview ofthe information onthe current economic statusofthe 73 PAPswho earlierre-
ported decreasedincome and o f the ongoing efforts to provide them support, as outlined above,
and despite the lack o f progress on allocating unusedmine land for agricultural purposes, this
issue appears to be substantially resolved.

6.       Managementproposes to discontinue Bank supervision of this issue.

Issue2: Settlement ofclaims for PAPscultivatinglandunder customary tenure

7.       Intotal, 41claims for landbeingcultivated under customarytenure were filedwith the
District and State authorities by families from the two villages affected by the Parej East mine. Of
the 26 claims from Parej village, 13 claims havebeensettled infavor ofproject affected families
(PAFs) and the requisite compensationpaid to 12 PAFs (compared to 10 inApril). Inthe case o f
1deceasedPAF, the dependents are yet to come forward to claim the compensation. The remain-
ingclaims by 13 families were rejected due to ineligibilityAack o fevidence that the families have
been affectedby the project and o fthese, as reported inApril 2005,8 PAFs have filed an appeal
withthe StateTribunal inwhich the Union o fIndiaKCL andthe State o fJharkand are also par-
ties. Evidence on behalf o fthe claimants was already reportedcompleted inApril, while the evi-
dence on behalf o f Government o f IndiaKCL i s still inprogress. CCL informs that the next date
o f hearing i s January 9,2006.

8.       Ofthe 15 claims from Durukasmarvillage, 3 claims are not applicable as the landin
question will not be required for mining, and 6 claims have beenrejected. The remaining 6 claims



CSESMP                                           2                                December 21,2005

 have been authenticated and compensation assessed. However, compensation has not yet been
 issueddue to disagreement betweenthe DistrictRevenueDepartment and the ForestDepartment,
 whichmaintains that the landinquestion is forest land and that claims for compensation thus
 shouldbe settled infavor o f the Forest Departmentrather than o fthe affectedpeople.

 9.      Inan effort to expedite theprocess ofdisbursement ofcompensation to the above 6
 claimants, the Bank team along with project authoritiesmet with the Additional District Collec-
 tor, Hazaribagh, who assured the team of his cooperation and promised to complete the authenti-
 cationprocess o f the Ghair Mauzurva Khas (GMK) land within a fortnight, but this has not hap-
pened. The project officials are pursuingthe case with the Additional District Collector (ADC).
 The Country Directorhas written to the Government of Jharkand requestingurgent resolution of
 the issue andpayment o f compensationto the six PAPs.

 10.      Managementproposes to monitor this issuefor afurther six months.

 Issue3: Provisionoflong-termleases to PAPsfor their houseplots inthe resettlementarea

 11.     The Bank first raisedthis issue with Government o fIndia (GOI) in 1992, duringthe early
 stages o fproject preparation. However, by 1994the CCL had acquired the Pindra resettlement
 site under the Coal BearingAreas Act, which does not allow for the provision o f landtitle to the
PAFs. The issue hasbeendiscussed with GO1duringevery subsequent supervision mission, and,
as reportedinApril, d&ng a meetingbetween the Country Director and GOI, the Department o f
Economic Affairs (DEA) informedthe Bank that Ministry of Coal (MOC) had finalized amend-
ments to the Coal BearingAreas Act to provide long-term leasesto PAPs. DEA also stated that
these amendments were proposedto be introducedto parliament. However, this has not yet hap-
pened. The Country Director has written to the Ministryo f Coal to request clarification regarding
the status ofthese amendments.

 12.     Managementproposes to monitor this issuefor afurther six months.

Issue4: Disbursementof subsistenceallowancefunds by GO1
                                    5


 13.     A letter receivedinSeptember 2004 fromGO1concludedthat the additional subsistence
allowance for PAFsinParej East was included inthe 1994 Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) by
oversight and was notrequired under the Bank's policy for income restoration(which is indeed
the case). BothCIL andGO1stated that providingthe additional subsistence allowance would set
an unacceptable and unsustainable precedent. However, CCL indicated its willingness to explore
alternative options for additional income generation support for concerned families, following the
completion o fthe income survey and consultation exercise undertakenby XISS which focused on
121PAFs, ineligible to getjobs by CCL inlieu o f land as they owned less than 3.00 acres of land.

14.      The data collectedby XISS among the 121PAFs indicate that 73 PAFshave not yet lost
their land and will only do so inthe next five to ten years; thus, for these PAFs, the issue o f a sub-
sistence allowance does not yet arise. Of the 48 PAFs who have lost possession o f their land (and
have received compensation), 42 have also either been given a minejob or havebeen compen-
satedinlieu o f ajob, while the remaining 6 PAFs were found ineligible for minejobs becausethe
landlost was less than 2.00 acres irrigated or 3.00 acres non-irrigated land, as per the CIL Reset-
tlement&Rehabilitation (R&R) policy of2000.

15.     Management is of the view that this issue has been substantially resolved, andproposes
to discontinueBank supervision of this issue.

Issue 5: Delivery of compensation and relocation entitlements

 16.      As reportedto the BoardinMarch, byFebruary 2005, atotal of27 PAFshadfiled cases
withthe StateTribunal for increased compensation. Higher paymentswere awarded to 9 PAFs,
butthisjudgment was appealedto the HighCourt by CCL. The hearinghasbeen completed, but
 the HighCourt has not yet given itsjudgment.

 17.     Managementproposes to discontinueBank supervision of this issue.

Issue 6: Water quality at the resettlement sites

 18.      TheBank concluded its supervisory responsibility of this issue in April 2005, since water
 quality monitoring was assessed as being satisfactorily addressed by the Central Mine Planning
and Design Institute (CMPDI).The CMPDIcontinues to monitor the water quality on a monthly
basis.

Issue 7: Reclamation of mine land for agricultural use

 19.      Since the March 2005 Boarddiscussion, on request from the Bank team, the project au-
thorities have preparedamap to identifyunused mine land that potentially couldbe used for land-
based income generation activities. The map shows three locations' inthe vicinity o f the mine
where afforestation work has been done or i s ongoing. The map also identifies areas where group-
based agriculture could be promoted. However, CCL has not yet decided on the possibility o f
leasing out these lands to PAPs for agncultural purposes, and appearsreluctant to do so.

20.      The transfer ofunusedmine land(acquired under the Coal BearingAreas Act) for pur-
poses other than miningraises considerable legal difficulties, especially givenCCL's obligation
to return the landto the State government once miningoperations have been completed. This
could complicate a final decision on this matter, thus makingit an unlikely option. Furtherdevel-
opment on this issue will depend on the progress inamending the Coal BearingAreas Act (see
para 11above).

21.       Management believes there is littleprospect of further progress on this issue, andpro-
poses to discontinue Bank supervision of this issue.

Issue 8: Mechanisms for consultation and dissemination of project related information to
PAPS

22.      As reportedpreviously, the existence o fincomplete information as well as misinforma-
tion inParej East has had a significant impact on the Bank's ability to facilitate a resolution o f
various issues. Hence, ensuringaccess to accurate information was considered a top priority.
With assistancefromthe Bankteam, CCL has now developedan information and communication
strategy to ensure public access to project-related information, particularly for the affected com-
munity,andto improve the relationshipbetweenthe project authorities andstakeholders (includ-
ingPAPs and Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS)).

23.      CCL-PAP relations. OnFebruary 18,2005 CCL conducteda meetingwithrepresenta-
tives of the affected community, duringwhich concise information was provided to the PAPs
about the potential benefits andrisks of various options for economic rehabilitation. Most o f the


  Mainly over-burden dump areas


CSESMP                                           4                                 December 21,2005

 discussions centered on the eligibility for subsistence allowance and for economic assistance, au-
thentication o f GMK land, andprovisiono f more work inthe coal dump. The meeting also pro-
videda platformfor the stakeholders to seekresolution to their gnevances.

24.      InAugust2005, the Bankteamnotedthe goodrapport establishedbytheProjectOfficer
with the PAPs, and that timelyremedial measures inresponseto grievances have helpedingain-
ingthe confidence ofthe PAPs. The measures include improvement inthe condition ofthe school
building,makingthe school operationalby facilitating recruitment ofa localteacher (under Sarva
 Shiksha Abhiyan2) providing electricity (tube-light) connections to individualhouses at Pindra
resettlement site, andpermitting regular health check ups for PAPs at Pindra site. Duringthe Au-
gust field visit, PAPs fiom Pindra demanded construction of a temple, provision o f another hand
pumpinthe schoolandrepairsto the school gate. The Project Officer agreedto theserequests
and instructed the concerned officials to do what was necessary.

25.      Itwas agreedwith CCL that it will continue its efforts to communicate withthe stake-
holders, includingconducting a monthly meetingwith the affected community (chaired by the
Area General Manager o f CCL), which will be informed inadvance o f the date andplace o f the
meeting. The Bank team urgedthe project officials to maintain arecord o f the meetings held with
PAPsand other stakeholders, includinga summary o f discussions, the nature o f any complaints,
agreements reached or any action issued following a complaint.

26.      CCL-CASS relations.The communication strategy also involveddevelopment o fan
ongoing dialogue betweenCCL and Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS). The CCL's Area
General Manager (AGM) for the project initiated this with a one-to-one meetingwith CASS on
December 17,2004, but attempts to continue these discussions duringthe first six months o f 2005
didnot materialize. Meanwhile, the AGM and some other project staffhavebeentransferredto
other projects. Duringthe August field visit, it was agreed that the new AGM would discuss with
CASS how to resolveoutstanding issuesand would holdat least two meetings with CASSbefore
end o f October, 2005. The first CCL-CASS meetingwas held on September 22,2005. CCL in-
formed the meetingthat employment hadbeenprovided to those affected among the 121PAFs
(eligible for subsistence allowance under RAP) andthat ifthe project management i s notifiedthat
any eligible PAFhas been excluded, this benefit would be extended. The AGM also agreed to
share with CASS the final XISS income survey report.

27.      TheBank will monitor the continuation of the CCL-PAP and CCL-CASS dialogue over
the next six months, and will be informed about the outcomes of the meetings by copy of the meet-
ing records.

Issue9: ConstitutionofanIndependent MonitoringPanel(IMP)

 CONCLUSION

29.      Although the CIL and GO1have expressedtheir willingness to act on a numbero f the
outstandingissues, the pace o fresolutioninsome cases has been rather slow due to the cornplex-
ity of the issue andthe constraints of the existinglegal context. This also limitsthe impacts of the
Bank's efforts to facilitate desirable resolutions.

30.      As described above, there are anumber ofissues for which Bank supervisionhas already
beenterminated (issues 6 and 9)' or which Management now proposes the Bank should no longer
supervise, either because they are substantially resolved (issues 1and 4) or becausethere is little
prospect that further Bank supervision would impact outcomes (issues 5 and 7). For the remain-
ingissues - settlement ofclaims for PAPscultivatinglandunder customarytenure (issue 2), pro-

mechanisms for consultation and disseminationofproject related information to PAPs (issue 8) -
vision o f long-term leasesto PAFs for their house plots inthe resettlement area (issue 3), and

Managementproposes to monitor development for a further six months, and to intervene ifitbe-
lieves this would help further progress. One further supervision mission would be planned.
