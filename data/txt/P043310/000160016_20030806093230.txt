                                                I. INTRODUCTION

 1.       The Coal Sector Environmental          and Social Mitigation    Project (CSESMP)      was designed as
a free-standing     project  to mitigate   impacts deriving    from the major     investment   component    of the
Coal Sector Rehabilitation        Project (CSRP). The CSESMP          was classified    as a Category  A project
for purposes of OD 4.01, and, accordingly,           Coal India Ltd. (CIL)     prepared   an Environmental    Im-
pact Assessment       (EIA).   The EIA identified     the adverse impacts      and measures    to mitigate   them
through    the implementation        of Environmental      Management     Plans (EMPs)      for the twenty-five
mines under the project.'

2.        The objectives     of the CSESMP were to: (i) enhance GIL's capacity to deal more effectively
with environmental       and social issues; (ii) implement    appropriate   policies for environmental    mitiga-
tion and resettlement      and rehabilitation    of people affected  by coal projects,   and provide   support to
communities,      in particular   tribals, living  in coal mining    areas; and (iii) test the effectiveness    of
these policies    in the twenty-five     coal mines slated to receive financial      support under CSRP.2 The
CSESMP became effective           in July 1996 and the CSRP in June 1998.

3.       A Request      for Inspection    (Request)   was submitted    to the Inspection   Panel (the Panel) on
June 21, 2001 by Ms. Bina Stanis of Chotanagpur               Adivasi  Sewa Samiti (CASS),      a local nongov-
ernmental   organization     (NGO) representing      residents of the Parej East coal mining    project area (the
Requesters)     in India.  According    to the Requesters,   the CSESMP      was supposed to mitigate     the ad-
verse effects    of the expansion     and rehabilitation   of the coal mines assisted under the CSRP, co-
financed by the World        Bank and the Japanese Bank for International        Cooperation   (JBIC).3 The Re-
questers contended       that execution    of the projects resulted in adverse impacts on the local popula-
tion, their living   standards, income earning capacity, and on the environment           of the Parej East mine
project  area, and that lack of consultation       and participation   resulted  in inadequate   implementation
of the Environmental         Action   Plans (EAP),    Resettlement    Action   Plans (RAPS),     and Indigenous
Peoples Development        Plans (IPDPs) under the CSESMP.          The Request was registered by the Panel
on June 22,200l      (IPN Request RQO1/2).

4.       Management        was notified   by the Panel of receipt of the Request,       and responded   to the is-
sues raised in the Request on July 20, 200 1. The Management               Response discussed the issues and
constraints   that were encountered       during implementation    of the CSESMP,       and noted that while not
all of these problems     could be fully resolved, progress had been made. Management             also noted that
in its view, the World       Bank had complied,      and intended   to continue    to comply,  with the relevant
policies and procedures      related to the design and implementation        of the CSESMP, and provided       the
Panel with written     evidence in this regard.




1   As required by OD 4.01, public consultations were held with PAPS and NGOs, an independent advisory
panel composed of Indian and international experts was retained, and the Environmental Assessment report
was made available at CIL headquarters and at the headquarters of subsidiary coal companies, as well as at
the Public Information    Center (PIC) of the World Bank in Washington, DC. This facility is now known as
the InfoShop.
2   These twenty-five     mines were distributed among five different subsidiary companies, namely Northern
Coalfields Ltd. (NCL) in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL) in Orissa,
Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL) in Maharashtra, Southeastern Coalfields Ltd. (SECL) in Chhattisgarh, and
Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) in Jharkhand (formerly Bihar).

 5.       Despite   the difficulties     that arose during project       implementation,     Management         maintained
 that World Bank withdrawal          from the CSESMP was not a viable option.               Since the purposes of the
 CSESMP      were to mitigate      the impacts      of the CSRP, strengthen          GIL's  capacity     to manage      such
mitigation   issues, and test the effectiveness           of mitigation,  resettlement     and rehabilitation       policies,
World    Bank withdrawal      would      have seriously undermined         its ability to continue     dialogue     with the
 client on improving     mitigation      efforts.  More    importantly,   World     Bank withdrawal        might    have re-
 sulted in cessation of social mitigation          activities, particularly   those involving      economic     rehabilita-
tion assistance for Project-Affected          Persons (PAPS).

 6.       The Panel, in its Report to the Board, found the Request eligible                  and recommended           an in-
vestigation   into the matters alleged in the Request. The Executive               Directors  recorded their approval
of the Panel's recommendation           for investigation     on September     7, 2001.

7.        Four months    after the Executive        Directors    authorized   an investigation    into the issues raised
in the Request,    the Requesters        submitted     two additional     documents     to the Panel. The first docu-
ment elaborated     on Paragraph 4(a) of the original          Request, and introduced        additional    allegations     of
harm. The second document            was a table prepared        by CASS which         provided    information      on indi-
viduals   (both  PAPS and non-PAPS)             from   Parej East who had already          resettled.   Management         re-
ceived these two documents          from the Panel on January 11,2002.

 8.       All issues raised by the Requesters            in these communications         were investigated      by the su-
pervision   team during     a mission to CIL headquarters            and the Parej East mine from February               4 to
 14, 2002.   Management       provided       its comments      on the two      communications        in a supplemental
document     to the Panel on April        4, 2002. After      examining     Management's      comments,        on July 25,
2002 the Panel requested       further    clarification    regarding   two of the issues raised by the Requesters,
The supervision     team further       investigated    these two issues during        a mission    to CIL    headquarters
and its subsidiaries   from September          16 to October 2,2002.      Management       submitted     its clarifications
to the Panel on October 2, 2002.

9.        On November       25, 2002 the Panel issued its Investigation                Report   (Report)     outlining     the
findings  of its investigation.

 10.     Management       would      like to acknowledge         the Panel members        for the thorough        nature of
their review    and the level of analysis applied           to the compliance       issues raised with      regard to this
project.  In addition,  Management          wishes to express its appreciation         to the members       of the Inspec-
tion Panel Secretariat    for their contributions         to the investigation   process. Finally,     Management         ap-
preciates and shares the Panel's recognition             of the dedication,    quality,  and significant     efforts of the
supervision   team.

 11.     As noted by the Panel, Management                  acknowledges     that with    hindsight,    there were defi-
ciencies in the project appraisal process, even though most of the World                   Bank's formal       obligations
at appraisal were complied        with. Management          also endorses the Panel's observation          that concerted
efforts were made with the help of thorough              and extensive supervision       of project implementation          to
address those deficiencies        in a prompt      and timely    manner.    While    the success of resettlement          im-
plementation     depends on a range of factors including              borrower   commitment,        the macroeconomic
environment,     the continuing       feasibility   of rehabilitation     measures     considered     appropriate     at the
time of project appraisal and the efforts of the affected people themselves,                 Management         agrees that
the World    Bank team made every effort            to promote    successful resettlement      throughout      project    im-
plementation.    The fact that this may not have resulted               in fully  successful resettlement         for every
PAP does not necessarily represent a failure of World Bank supervision.                    Experience      under the pro-
ject, the objectives   of which      included     testing the effectiveness     of government        policies,  highlights

                                                                     Management Report and Recommendation


the complexity     of the resettlement     process and some important       lessons that can be learned to in-
form future resettlement     programs.


                                      II. STATUSOFTHEPROJECTS

 12.      India has made a decision to continue        its reliance on the country's     abundant    coal reserves,
at least over the next 15-20 years.4 The World            Bank has therefore       been supporting     India's   coal
based energy strategy to meet the needs of its growing             economy    and improve     its management       of
environmental    and social mitigation,     A study carried out between      1995 and 1998 on Environmental
Issues in the Power Sector (EIPS) concluded          that utilization   of domestic    coal as the main source of
primary   fuel for power    generation    would  remain the only feasible option        for India in the medium
term.

 13.      When preparation     of the projects   for India's   coal sector began in 1991, the design of pro-
ject environmental    mitigation   activities was targeted to meet Indian       and World    Bank environmental
requirements.    While  GIL's Resettlement       & Rehabilitation     (R&R)   Policy was considered        adequate
at the time it was developed,       with hindsight,    it is acknowledged      that the Policy should have in-
cluded more specific provisions       related to detailed    economic    rehabilitation  measures, and that this
important   issue should not have been left to be resolved during project implementation.

14.       The CSESMP       became effective     in July 1996, nearly two years earlier than the CSRP, in
order to provide    time for CIL to establish the necessary institutional         and human resources capacity
for environmental     and social mitigation,    and enable the World      Bank to assess implementation         pro-
gress prior   to negotiations   for the CSRP. To reinforce          GIL's  performance     in environmental      and
social mitigation,    progress   on mitigation    activities   was linked   to the CSRP through          a series of
covenants    in Schedule 9 of the CSRP Loan Agreement.             When the CSRP became effective            in June
1998, CIL was substantially      in compliance    with the applicable     Schedule 9 covenants and the devia-
tions were caused by circumstances          beyond  GIL's    control5   The World      Bank had anticipated      that
GIL's   performance     on environmental       and social mitigation      activities   would  improve     once the
CSRP became effective.       However,     overall progress in both areas did not improve         to the extent ex-
pected. Due to unsatisfactory     performance     under the CSRP regarding         coal sector reform    and finan-
cial covenants,   as well as unsatisfactory     performance     in the area of economic      rehabilitation    under
the CSESMP,      Management     informed    the Ministry    of Coal and CIL on January 20,2000,          that it was
considering    applying its legal remedies and moving        towards   suspension.6



4   With a population almost four times that of the United States, India consumes only about one third as
much coal as the U.S. India's reliance on coal (298 million metric tons consumed in 1995) is smaller than
that of Russia (321 million metric tons), the United States (853 million metric tons), or China (1,330 million
metric tons). Germany, with 269 million metric tons consumed in 1995, is only slightly behind India.
5   Schedule 9, para. 3(a) requires CIL to issue Photo ID cards to all entitled PAPS. Due to ongoing court
casestiled by PAPS contesting compensation for lost assets in MCL in Orissa, 22 percent of the PAPS in the
six MCL mines refused to receive the ID cards as they believed that this would be tantamount to acceptance
of the contested compensation. Moreover, in the village of Hensmul under the Ananta mine in MCL, some of
the villagers prevented both the original 1994 baseline survey and its 1997 updating, since some PAPS who
had received jobs as compensation for land loss feared that their jobs would be reallocated to others as a re-
sult of the survey. To provide time for CIL to achieve compliance with the Schedule 9 covenants without
undertaking any resettlement, contingency mine plans were agreed with the World Bank which would enable
mining to continue over a five to seven year period without any relocation.

15.       Despite   CSRP and CSESMP           supervision     missions    in March    2000,   subsequent     meetings
between    the Energy Sector Director     and both the Government           of India (GOI) and CIL, and a meet-
ing between     the India Country    Director    and the Secretary of the Department           of Economic     Affairs
(DEA),    the outstanding   issues remained     unresolved.     On July 24, 2000, CIL and the DEA requested
cancellation.    On July 25, 2000, Management          cancelled the undisbursed       balance of the CSRP Loan,
and on January 2 1, 2001 the undisbursed         balance of the CSRP Credit was cancelled.

16.       Although    the undisbursed    balance of the CSRP Credit           was cancelled,     implementation      of
the CSESMP continued,        and on April 20, 2001, the GO1 requested that the World                Bank extend the
project   closing  date for one year, until      June 30, 2002.'       The World     Bank approved       this request
based on evidence of GIL's increased          commitment        over the previous    year, and to enable it to ad-
vance towards     completion   of its social and environmental        mitigation   obligations.

17.       Throughout     implementation     of the CSESMP,           Management     has allocated     significant   re-
sources in order to provide     for the level of supervision        required  by the scale and complexity       of the
project's  physical, mitigation,    and institutional    activities.  The resources allocated      for project super-
vision have considerably      exceeded the average for the South Asia Region.             Cumulative    World    Bank
inputs for the entire CSESMP         project   cycle included      465 staff weeks and a budget         in excess of
US$1.6    million. World    Bank inputs for supervision         alone amounted     to more than 400 staff weeks
and a budget in excess of US$l.4       million.

18.       Since August    1996, 23 supervision       missions have been undertaken,          21 of which     included
field visits to Parej East. In addition     to the 20 supervision      missions to Parej East, 4 more informal
site visits were undertaken     by the supervision      team member       based in the New Delhi Office,         in or-
der to more closely monitor      contentious   issues.

19.       The CSESMP       closed on June 30, 2002. Cumulative             disbursements     totaled  approximately
SDR30.5     million  (US$40.1   million  equivalent),    or 79.5 percent of the revised Credit amount.

20.       The Requesters'    initial request and the supplementary          requests include     a great deal of de-
tailed information    on a number    of complex     issues. A summary       of the issues and the findings      of the
Panel are presented     in Table 1 below.    Management's         comments    on the issues raised in the Investi-

7   As of December 15, 2002, US$241.7 million of the IBRD Loan had been disbursed, with US$12.7 mil-
lion in commitments and US$O.2 in the pipeline remaining. US$1.4 million of the IDA Credit amount had
been disbursed. As a result of the fluctuation in the exchange rate, disbursements made under the JBIC co-
financing totaled US$24 1.5 million.
8   The original Credit amount of SDR 43.30 million was reduced by SDR4.89 million to SDR38.41 million.

 21.         This section attempts         to provide   a wider context to the detailed responses Management                          has
 provided      regarding     some of the issues discussed in the findings            of the Inspection          Panel, including:
 (i) the changing       political   context in which the project was implemented,                 (ii) resettlement,         (iii) com-
 pensation      for land under customary          tenure, (iv) income restoration,         (v) subsistence allowance,                and
 (vi) water quality and land reclamation.

 22.        The     political    context.    The Parej East Mine       site is located        in what      is now the State of
 Jharkhand.      The creation of the State of Jharkhand           (formerly   the southern part of Bihar) was a long-
 standing     demand of its indigenous          people, and took place on November                 15, 2000, some four years
 after project      implementation        began. Economically,       Jharkand     has faced tremendous                obstacles,      de-
 spite its wealth        of mineral      resources.   In   1999-2000,   the state had a net per capita income                          of
 Rs.9,223      (US$213)      against the national     average of Rs.15,626       (US$361).        Its poverty       ratio is roughly
 double the national         average, and it is home to five of the ten least developed                   districts in India. The
 staffing    of new government          offices has been hindered      by the lack of appropriately               qualified       candi-
 dates. In the area of education             in particular,  the absence of the necessary administrative                       arrange-
 ments and management             skills has been a particular      constraint.   Despite the Government's                    intention
 to recruit 4,189       primary    education     teachers, there have been long delays in filling                   these posts be-
 cause there were no rules or processes to begin hiring.               As a result, the teacher-student                 ratio for pri-
 mary school students has been as high as 1:60 in some areas. In addition,                              the non-availability           of
 funds has left large numbers              of rural primary    schools functioning         without       a building,       and urban
 school buildings        in a state of disrepair.

 23.        Resettlement.        As outlined     in the Staff Appraisal    Report     (SAR), the resettlement                and reha-
 bilitation    obligations      of CIL    were related     to PAFs affected     by actual land acquisition                 for antici-
 pated mine expansion            during    the CSESMP projeci period.         However,        the progress of mine expan-
 sion plans at the time of project closure on June 30,2002,                 and the amount            of land actually        acquired
 for this expansion         turned    out to be considerably       lower   than projected          during     preparation         of the
 CSESMP.         By the project      closing date, only 173 PAFs needed to relocate,                    compared        with the ap-
 praisal estimate of 290 PAFs. All of these were successfully relocated.

 24.        Compensation          for land cultivated        under  customary      tenure.       Consistent        with the World
 Bank's     OD 4.30, GIL's         R&R      Policy states that "tribals    cultivating      land under traditional               rights"



                                                                6

                                                                    Management       Report and Recommendation



should be recognized       as entitled  to compensation.   Under Indian law, PAPS must establish that they
have a valid claim to the land before compensation          can be paid. Claims for rights to land cultivated
under customary      tenure-referred     to as Ghair Mazurva     Khas (GMK)       land in the Hazaribagh       area-
are examined      on a case-by-case basis by the District       authorities.  For recognized      claims, the com-
pensation   amount     is calculated  in the same manner     as for tenancy land.' In Parej East, the District
authorities   conducted     a number     of land settlement   camps to resolve       outstanding     land claims to
GMK     land. The cases of ten PAPS from Duru Kasmar             are still being processed by the district au-
thorities.

25.       Income    restoration.    Although   Management     has acknowledged        that income restoration      for
all PAPS has not yet been achieved,         it may be too early to draw final conclusions         regarding   the im-
pacts of the income restoration       measures. The latest evidence seems to suggest that the incomes of
PAPS have actually        increased   significantly   since implementation      of the RAP.       The objective     of
GIL's   R&R    Policy    is to improve    or at least restore the livelihoods     and incomes      of PAPS. As of
March-April     2002,   87.1 percent of all PAPS entitled      to income restoration      assistance had met this
objective."    Of the remaining      12.9 percent who reported     a decline in individual      incomes, 29 out of
73 reported    increased    household    incomes    during  the project    period.   In addition,   the number      of
PAPS with incomes above the GOI's poverty line has nearly doubled                during the project period."

26.       GIL's   earlier policy of providing     mine jobs to PAPS resulted in a substantial         surplus of un-
skilled labor and contributed       to heavy economic     losses for the company.12 As a result, GIL's           1994
R&R     Policy aimed     at providing    alternative  economic   rehabilitation    measures.     In addition   to the
provision   of mine jobs only to those PAPS that lose two acres of irrigated               land or three acres of
non-irrigated    land, the policy     contains   two  other instruments     to support    income     restoration   for
PAPS, namely:      (i) assistance in obtaining     work with contractors;     and (ii) assistance with non-land
based self-employment.        In Parej East, there are 564 PAPS entitled            to income     restoration  assis-
tance.13 As of March-April       2002,442     out of the 564 had access to means of income restoration.14

27.       The figures    also show that during the period of RAP implementation              (from    1997 to 2002)
incomes    of a large proportion     of the 564 PAPS increased significantly.         The percentage       of women
PAPS earning      an income     increased   dramatically  during  this period,    from 4.1 percent      to 57.8 per-
cent. Among     the 270 female PAPS, 97.8 percent have maintained            or increased their incomes during
the project period, while only 2.2 percent reported        a decrease in income.

10 This includes the elderly, the disabled, and women-less        than 5 percent of whom reported earning any
income in 1997.
11 The poverty line established by the GO1 is Rs.1,500 per month.
12 SAR, Annex 2.4: Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy of CIL, p 59, para. 2.
13 Of the 564, 294 are men and 270 are women. This excludes those PAPS who have died or migrated since
1997, and the five PAPSwho did not provide income information in either 1997 or 2002.
14 Of these, 32 earn an income from mine jobs with CCL, 105 from work with contractors, 87 have an in-
come derived from the self-employment training, 82 are employed by other public enterprises, including the
Tata Iron and Steel Corporation (TISCO), and 136 have an income from some other source. There are ap-
proximately 90 PAPS in Parej East who can earn as much as Rs.2,500 per month through pilferage and sale
of coking coal. As the potential incomes derived from most of the self-employment           training options cannot
compete with this, the majority of the PAPSexplicitly stated during the June 2000 census that they were not
interested in the training provided under the project.

28.         The affected          tribal population            witnessed       similar improvements.                  In Parej East, there were
194 PAPS belonging               to one of the Scheduled Tribes who provided                                income information       for both the
1997 and 2002 censuses. Of these, 88.7 percent maintained                                         or increased        their incomes during       the
project period.         In addition,       the number of tribal PAPS with above-poverty-line                                incomes more than
doubled     during the project period.

a.  The   acronym      SC   refers  to Scheduled    Castes,    and   OBC    to Other   Backward      Castes.   Both  categories    are at the bottom   of
the caste    hierarchy,     and   along   with  Scheduled     Tribes   (STs),   are  usually among         the poorer   sections    of the  community.
"General"   castes     refer to the  rest of the caste   groups    (Brahmins,    Kshatriyas,    etc.).


29.         Among          the 73 PAPS who reported                 a decrease in income,               only 30 had completed              one of the
skills training         programs        offered    annually       under the project for income restoration                        assistance. As a
number       of the training          programs       were as long as six to twelve                     months,     many of the PAPS would
not yet have completed                training    at the time the Panel made its assessment of compliance,                                 nor would
they have had time to establish themselves                          after completing          training.

30.         The follow-up             assistance planned             in the 2002          annual       RAP, which          included       investment
support and/or supplementary                    skills training,       plus support in establishing                market linkages for PAPS
who were not earning                  after completing           training,     has attracted          little  interest from        the PAPS. This
lack of interest indicates that the vast majority                         of PAPS have been able to restore their incomes ei-
ther independently,              or with the assistance previously                 provided       under the project.

31.         Subsistence           allowance.       In one of the two additional                   documents         submitted        by CASS, and
provided       to Management             by the Panel on January                 11, 2002, CASS states that GIL's                       R&R    Policy
 "mentions       a subsistence allowance                BUT it is not known that any such subsistence allowance                                   is be-
ing given to PAPS eligible for                  it; at a rate of Rs. 300 per month                      (below the poverty           line) it fails   to
achieve an [sic] purpose                 ofproviding        subsistence assistance:               the people       don `t seem to know about
claiming      it. "

32.         GIL's R&R Policy does not mention                          the type of subsistence allowance                     described by CASS.
Paragraph         14 of GIL's          R&R      Policy     refers to rehabilitation             in the form          of a "subsistence         allow-
ante'-a         lump       sum grant for the purpose                 of productive          investment         (Package D). The following
conditions        must be met in order to be eligible                       for Package D: (i) the PAP must be an individual
from whom            land is acquired          (this includes tribals cultivating                   authenticated        land under customary
rights);   (ii) the amount             of land acquired must be less than two acres; (iii) the PAP must not have
income      from       other sources that exceeds Rs. 12,000 per year; and (iv) none of the other options
should be available              to the PAP. GIL's           R&R Policy does not prescribe any specific amount                                 for the
subsistence allowance.                According        to CIL, no PAP has received                     this subsistence         allowance     to date
because the eligibility             criteria were not met by any PAP.

33.       Although    GIL's   R&R    Policy does not mention        the type of subsistence     allowance    referred
to by CASS, the 1994 Parej East RAP, prepared by GIL's Central Mine Planning                      and Design Insti-
tute (CMPDI),      does mention     a subsistence allowance      similar to that referred     to by CASS. Of the
fourteen   RAPS for mines under the CSESMP, the Parej East RAP is the only document                       that refers
to this type of subsistence allowance,        since this allowance     is not based on GIL's R&R Policy. The
Parej East RAP was cleared by the World            Bank along with the other thirteen        RAPS, and is referred
to in the legal documents.      Management      acknowledges     that the 1994 Parej East RAP is the applica-
ble project   document     and accepts that it was an oversight       that the additional    subsistence allowance
was referred    to neither during Bank review       and clearance of the RAP, nor during         supervision   of the
project.  Thus, the concerned PAFs appear to be entitled to this additional            subsistence allowance.

34.       Within   CIL,  standards and approaches        to resettlement    and rehabilitation    have varied from
subsidiary   to subsidiary    due to the nature of the projects        and regional   variations   in policy  or im-
plementation.    When    project   preparation   began in the early 199Os, most of the R&R              programs    of
CIL and its subsidiaries      were based on the provisions        of the 1990 Gulla Report,        prepared   by Mr.
O.P. Gulla, Joint Secretary to the Government            of India,   Department    of Coal, Ministry      of Energy.
This document      was the first attempt    to formulate   a corporate   policy for resettlement     and rehabilita-
tion in CIL,    and provided     the basis for resettlement    and rehabilitation    activities  up to April    1994.
The Gulla Report       was not a policy     document,    but a set of guidelines     developed     in an attempt    to
implement     resettlement   programs     on an equitable   basis and minimize       disputes and delays in land
acquisition.

35.       The reference    to subsistence allowance       in the 1994 Parej East RAP appears to be a hold
over from the 1990 Gulla Report         and is not in conformity      with the subsistence allowance        provided
for under GIL's      R&R Policy. Although        a reference to the type of subsistence allowance          described
by CASS does exist in the original         1994 RAP for Parej East, it does not exist in the 1994 Baseline
Socio-Economic       Survey on which the 1994 Parej East RAP is based, nor is there a reference to it in
the 1994 RAPS in any other subsidiary,            in GIL's   R&R     Policy,   in any of the subsequent       annual
RAPS for Parej East, or in the R&R           policy   framework     agreed between     CIL    and the World     Bank
and included    in the SAR.

36.       The unit of entitlement      for this subsistence allowance,      as specified    in the 1994 Parej East
RAP, is not the individual,      but the family.   For families    losing up to one acre of land, a subsistence
allowance    "at the rate of Rs.300 per month        + an ex-gratia    amount   of Rs.100 per month"       would be
provided    for twenty  years. For families     losing more than one acre of land, a subsistence          allowance
of "Rs.300    per month    per acre subject to a maximum        of Rs.l,OOO per month       + an ex-gratia   amount
of Rs.100 per month"       would   be provided    for 20 years. The 1994 Parej East RAP also indicates that
54 percent of the PAFs there were landless (while            another 40 percent owned less than 2.5 acres of
land).


               IV. MANAGEMENT'S            ACTION     PLAN IN RESPONSE TO THE FINDINGS

37.       Resettlement     of all PAFs who were affected        by land acquisition/possession         for mine ex-
pansion   during   the CSESMP       project  period has been completed         and income     restoration   has been
achieved with respect to 87.1 percent of PAPS (as of March-April                2002).  Since some implementa-
tion issues, such as payment       of subsistence allowance,    and settlement     of claims of PAPS cultivating
land under customary       tenure are still outstanding,   Management       intends to continue     supervising    the
CSESMP       project  until  all outstanding    issues have been resolved.       Management       also proposes to
report progress on outstanding       issues to the Board of Executive       Directors  by July 3 1,2004.

          The activities which the World Bank would            continue   to supervise/monitor   are as follows:

          Economic    rehabilitation  of PAFs who have suffered a decrease in income.

          Settlement   of claims for PAPS cultivating       land under customary      tenure.

          Provision   of long-term   leases to PAPS for their house plots in the resettlement         site.

          Disbursement     of subsistence allowance      funds by GOI.

          Mechanisms     to access grievances redress systems related to payment            of compensation.

          Water quality at the resettlement      sites.

          Reclamation    of mine land for agricultural      use.

          Procedures for consultations     in project design and implementation.

          Mechanisms     for dissemination    of project related information      to PAPS in Parej East.

These issues are discussed in further detail in Annex          1.

39.       Independent     Monitoring      Panel. Management        has reviewed     the Panel's suggestion     to es-
tablish an Independent      Monitoring    Panel (IMP)     for the CSESMP modeled          on the IMP for the Na-
tional Thermal    Power Corporation       project   and agrees that the use of such a panel could be appro-
priate for monitoring     the implementation      of outstanding     actions related to provision     of the subsis-
tence allowance    and outstanding      land titling   cases. The World      Bank has therefore     written   to Go1
suggesting   this arrangement,     and has provided      a draft Terms of Reference       for its consideration.    If
agreed by GoI, the IMP for the CSESMP               could be established      by September,     2003 to independ-
ently support resolution     of these administrative    issues.

40.       Subsistence    Allowance     Payments.     Regarding     the issue of the subsistence     allowance    dis-
cussed in Section III,     Management      recommends        that funds totaling    about US$300,000       be made
available   by the GO1 to administer       a lump sum payment         to the 121 eligible     PAFs. Management
also recommends       that the GO1 submit      its request and implementation         arrangements    to the World
Bank by August     3 1,2003,    and disburse all funds to the PAFs by March          3 1,2004.


                               VI.  CONCLUSION         AND LESSONS LEARNED

41.       Management      believes that the World      Bank has made every effort        to apply its policies and
procedures    and to pursue its mission       statement   in the context     of the CSESMP.      Management       re-
mains committed      to a process of consultation      and disclosure to support the achievement          of the en-
vironmental    and social objectives     of the CSESMP.        Management      intends to continue     to utilize  its
dialogue   with the GO1 and CIL        to: (i) monitor   provision    of support to communities,       in particular
tribals living  in coal mining     areas, including    the issuance of land titles/long-term      leases to PAPS;
(ii) encourage    establishment     of an Independent     Monitoring      Panel to support    resolution   of issues
related to subsistence allowances       and land titling;   and (iii) advise GO1 on apparent       entitlements   for
subsistence allowances      for 121 eligible    families   in Parej East. Management        also proposes to con-
tinue post-project    supervision   of the CSESMP until June 30, 2004, when all of the outstanding                ac-
tions are expected to be completed.

42.     Lessons     Learned.    Implementation        of the CSESMP provides           important   lessons that would
be useful in guiding    preparation    and implementation        of future projects:

     .  Assumptions        about   organizational      change     should    be realistic.   The achievement      of sus-
        tainable   change in the organizational         set-up and attitudes      in an organization    of the size and
        complexity     of CIL is difficult     to accomplish      within    the duration   of a standard project im-
        plementation      period.  Appraisal     of resettlement    components       should, therefore,   be informed
        by a careful     assessment of the institutional        capability    of the agencies responsible      for envi-
        ronmental     and social mitigation.        Such assessment should take into account              the decision
        making     process related to environmental          issues as well as the incentives        in place to bring
        about change.

     .  Efforts    should   be made to strengthen         national    and state level legislation.      Mitigation    ac-
        tivities that are implemented        to establish compliance          with national   laws, which    are moni-
        tored by state agencies (such as those relating            to environmental       mitigation)   have a higher
        likelihood    of success than mitigation         activities  that are not subject to similar        compliance
        requirements.      While   there have been previous          efforts    at the state and national     level, the
        World    Bank should look for further         opportunities     to provide    support for strengthening       na-
        tional/state   level environmental        and social policies      and regulations     as well as the institu-
        tions responsible     for implementing       them.

     .  Mechanisms        for institutional     coordination      should    be carefully    assessed during      prepa-
        ration.   In operations    that involve     coordination    among a large number         of agencies, it is es-
        sential to carefully     review    the adequacy      of institutional     coordination   mechanisms      during
        project   preparation.   In CSESMP,        establishment     of an appropriate      coordination    mechanism
        between     GOI, the state government,        CIL, and the subsidiary        companies,     could have helped
        address issues related       to land acquisition,       provision     of land titles, access to government
        schemes, involvement        of Panchayats,      etc.


    n   Critical    issues should      be resolved     prior    to initiation     of implementation.       Critical  im-
        plementation      issues that require     decisions     by ministries     other than those responsible        for
        project   implementation       (e.g., the Law     Ministry    regarding     decisions  on security of tenure
        for plots in resettlement       sites and mine lands allotted           for land based income       generation)
        should be addressed prior to project            appraisal,   and not left to be resolved        during   project
        implementation.

    .   Obligations      of implementing         agencies   should     be clear and specific.        Safeguard   policy
        frameworks      agreed with the Borrower         need to be clear and specific as to the obligations           of
        the Borrower      regarding    provision    of resettlement     entitlements    and other assistance. Deter-
        mination     of specific   Borrower      obligations    cannot   be left to decisions      during   project  im-
        plementation.      Thus,    GIL's    R&R     Policy    would     have benefited      from    a more     detailed
        description    of the entitlements        of PAPS in relation          to self-employment       (for  example,
        effective    self-employment        assistance    needs to include,         in addition    to  skills training,
        investment     assistance, infrastructure     support, market analysis and assistance in establishing
        the necessary market linkages).

    .   Innovative      approaches      should     be explored       for   restoration     of livelihoods     in mine-
        related    resettlement.    Effective    income    restoration     for PAPS whose livelihoods         are based
        on small-scale     agriculture   is difficult  to achieve through       provision   of non-land-based      assis-
        tance measures. In the case of the CSESMP,               other measures (besides the provision          of mine
        jobs to those who lose land above a certain threshold)                  were required.    The success of the

  "land  based income     generation    pilot"   on unused    and reclaimed     mine land provides      one
  model for an alternative    approach to income restoration        in resettlement    associated with de-
  velopment  of mines.


n Thorough    analysis    of the feasibility   and risks of proposed      resettlement    options   should
  be conducted     during    project   preparation.     Project resettlement     entitlements   should  in-
  clude a range of options       for PAPS to choose from.         Resettlement    preparation   should be
  based on a thorough     analysis of the feasibility      of various options proposed     to the affected
  people. Feasibility   studies should include a detailed analysis of the technical,        economic   and
  financial aspects of the proposed      options as well as an assessment of the capacity of the af-
  fected people to undertake      the proposed     activities. Resettlement     planning   should also in-
  clude an analysis of the "implementation          risks" associated with     the proposed    options  and
  assess the feasibility  of introducing    fall-back  options in case the options selected by the af-
  fected people do not adequately      materialize.

     the original      Parej   East IPDP.                                      tion in project    design   and implementation       for the Parej   East Plan for

     In light of Managements               failure   to
     ensure      meaningful       consultation       in
     the preparation         of the original
     Parej    East IPDP, the Panel             finds
     that Management            was not in com-
     pliance     with paragraphs          14(a) and
     18 of OD 4.20.         [.. .] In the Panel's
     view, recent       efforts    by Manage-
     ment have        resulted     in some      pro-
     gress     in addressing        an enormous
     challenge.      Not only does the chal-
     lenge     presume      a massive        shift in
     the institutional      culture     of the key
     implementing         agents,     who have
     other    overriding     priorities,     it also
     requires      processes       of participation
     and involvement          that are new and
     strange      to those    who must relate
     to the project      affected      peoples      and
     elements       of civil society      who rep-
     resent     them.   In Chapter        5 of the
     original    IPDPs     prepared       by ORG,
     including     that for Parej       East, the
     community        development          strategy
     for all three     mines     in the two dif-
     ferent    States    is described        in the
     exact same terms. Although                 the
     strategy      has evolved,       it is not loca-
     tion specific,     nor is it sensitive        to
     the composition,         structure      and
     needs      of the community.          In light of
     this, the Panel       finds that Manage-
     ment is not in compliance              with
     paragraph       15(d)    of OD 4.20.

                                SUGGESTED DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE


Background

The implementation     phase of the World     Bank-assisted    India Coal Sector Environmental        and Social
Mitigation   Project has recently been completed.      While most of the measures described in the Envi-
ronmental   Management      Plan (EMP), the Resettlement       Action   Plan (RAP) and the Indigenous        Peo-
ples Development     Plan (IPDP) pertaining    to the Parej East Resettlement       Site have been completed,
a few actions are still outstanding.   Some of these actions were also identified        in the investigation  of
the project recently  conducted    by the World     Bank's Inspection     Panel. Responding     to a recommen-
dation made in the final report of the Inspection       Panel, Coal India Ltd. proposes to establish an In-
dependent   Monitoring   Panel to follow   up on the implementation       of the key outstanding    issues.

Mandate    of the IMP

The overall mandate     of the proposed    Independent     Monitoring    Panel will be to monitor     the imple-
mentation   of the specific resettlement-related     actions that are still outstanding    at the Parej East re-
settlement  site. More specifically,  the IMP will monitor      the following   actions:

     .   Economic    rehabilitation of PAFs who have suffered a decrease in income.

     .    Settlement  of claims for PAPS cultivating      land under customary     tenure.

     .   Provision  of long-term   leases to PAPS for their house plots at the resettlement        site.

     .   Disbursement    of subsistence allowance      fnnds by GOI.

     9   Mechanisms     to access grievances redress systems related to payment          of compensation.


     n   Water quality at the resettlement    sites.

     .   Reclamation    of mine land for agricultural     use.

     .   Procedures for consultations     in project design and implementation.

     .   Mechanisms     for dissemination   of project related information     to PAPS in Parej East.

Modalities

The IMP will carry out its work in coordination          with Coal India Ltd. In carrying      out its work, the
IMP will refer to the provisions     of the RAP agreed between          the World   Bank and Coal India Ltd.
for Parej East. Before   starting its field activities,  the IMP will discuss with Coal India Ltd. its pro-
posed plan of action to address the above issues and periodically            monitor  its implementation.    The
IMP would     be expected to make quarterly      field visits to the resettlement   sites and interview    a sam-

ple of PAPS as part of the process of reviewing      implementation.   Outstanding    issues and problems
will be discussed with the concerned    officials  of Coal India Ltd. at the end of each field visit. The
IMP will submit its quarterly  progress report to Coal India Ltd. and the World       Bank. The reports of
the IMP will be made public within      one month    of their receipt by Coal India Ltd. and the World
Bank.

Composition    of the IMP

The IMP will be composed      of three appropriately  qualified  professionals in development    and envi-
ronmental   management,    with at least 15 years experience.   At least one member     of the IMP should
have a background    in Law. A long list of the members      of the IMP would   be prepared   by the Gov-
ernment  of India and finalized  with the concurrence   of the World   Bank.

Duration

The Panel will carry out its task from September       1, 2003 - September    30, 2004, and its mandate
may be extended    in writing  prior  to the completion   of above proposed     duration,  as necessary to
complete  its mandate  as described above.
