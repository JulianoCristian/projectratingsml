capacity of public and private sector decisionmakers and\n            improving the levels of policy dialogue; and 2) support the\n            establishment of a \"cyberpark.\" The project\n            comprises three components: 1) retrofitting and equipping\n            the Distance Learning Center in INAP (the National Institute\n            of Public Administration); 2) support for establishing and\n            administering the Distance Learning Center as a fully\n            operational training facility; and 3) support for\n            establishing and introducing opportunities to acquire new\n            skills at the Cyberpark, and to integrate the latter with\n            the Distance Learning Center and the Global Distance\n            Learning Network."}, "docdt":
