Following\n            are some of the lessons learned from the project: The\n            assumptions that the major business case for the Global\n            Development Learning Network (GDLN) was: (i) to provide\n            training for the public sector and (ii) to provide\n            proprietary connectivity to a global network with central\n            services provided by the Bank. These initial drivers retain\n            relevance for many lower-income countries but are more\n            questionable in a middle-income environment where viable\n            alternatives exist. Major drivers and value-added of the\n            GDLN in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) would be in\n            policy dialogue and typically that of a South-South nature,\n            where the countries of LAC exchange knowledge with each\n            other and learn from successes and failures experienced in\n            the Region. In terms of the connectivity issue, INAP was\n            quick to suggest that the Bank look beyond the use of fixed\n            cost satellite solution to the use of Integrated Services\n            Digital Network and IP solutions. The initial generic\n            template utilized for GDLN projects focused on the\n            implementation of a cost recovery model to offset the high\n            operating costs of a GDLN facility. While it is true that\n            the long-term sustainability of Bank projects argues for\n            less use of project implementation units and increased\n            capacity-building for the core staff of implementing\n            agencies, this requires that suitable safeguards be put in\n            place, particularly among smaller, less well-endowed\n            agencies, to ensure that core fiduciary responsibilities are\n            undertaken in accordance with Bank rules."}, "docdt": "2006-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
