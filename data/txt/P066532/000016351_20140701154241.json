change,Infrastructure services for private sector development", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall outcome rating of the\n            Electric Cooperative System Loss Reduction Project for the\n            Philippines was judged to be moderately satisfactory.  The\n            Bank and borrower performance ratings were moderately\n            satisfactory. The risk to development outcome was rated\n            moderate.  Several lessons were learned.  A good\n            understanding of local politics is essential in the design\n            stage to ensure a successful project. When preparing the\n            program, the Bank should be keenly aware of the local\n            politics and be realistic when preparing the pipeline of\n            projects. In the Electric Cooperative System Loss Reduction\n            Project (ECSLRP), the failure to recognize the vast\n            influence of  the National Electrification Administration\n            (NEA) over Electric Cooperative (EC) was a key stumbling\n            block. It was only after the team recognized this design\n            flaw and engaged NEA as a key stakeholder did the project\n            take off.  Bank financed projects should, at project start,\n            require participants in the program to conform to a uniform\n            methodology and procedures/guidelines. The impact of time\n            lags on outcomes needs to be considered for selected\n            infrastructure projects. System losses are realized with\n            investments in infrastructure, most of which will occur over\n            time. In this project, Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n            avoided would have far exceeded the target if the savings at\n            the realization of the investments were taken into account.\n            In light of this, there may be a need to review how outcomes\n            could be computed, taking into consideration duration of\n            project implementation. Distribution projects are not ideal\n            for projects that focus on the reduction of GHG emissions.\n            Project Development Objectives (PDOs) could be more relevant\n            to the development context, rather than focus on Trust Fund\n            objectives. While the reduction of system losses was a clear\n            area of focus, the Bank could have considered PDOs which\n            would be more impactful to the needs of the clients. In\n            ECSLRP's design, other economic benefits were not\n            considered, which would better reflect the impact of\n            programs on the clients and their relevance to\n            Governments' priorities."}, "docdt": "2014-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
