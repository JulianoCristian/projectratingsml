                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The global environmental objective (GEO) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency investments in the rural power
                         distribution sub-sector. The project is now making good, sustained progress toward its development objective. 8 guarantees have been booked, as of July 13, 2011, utilizing about
                         $18-million of the $60-million capacity of the guarantee fund. Another six deals are likely to close by the end of the calendar year; the 14 deals in aggregate would use about $34-
                         million in guarantee fund capacity. Another 13 deals are already in the pipeline, and it is estimated that at least another dozen credit-worthy electric cooperatives would come into the
                         program if resources to back loans are available. More importantly, a mechanism has now been demonstrated that is leveraging private commercial finance to meet electric
                         cooperative investment requirements, bringing not just money but also commercial and regulatory discipline to the EC sector. Mechanisms to extend the guarantee capacity of the
