                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) support will be to reduce GHG emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency investments
                         in the rural power distribution sub-sector. This will be achieved through the pilot use of innovative contractual mechanisms and GEF-funded Partial Credit Guarantee
                         Program to promote private investment and financing.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is now making good, sustained progress toward its development objective. 11 guarantees have been booked, as of February 8, 2012, utilizing about $26-million of the
                         $60-million capacity of the guarantee fund. Another three deals are imminent; the 14 deals in aggregate would use about $34-million in guarantee fund capacity. Another 9 deals are
                         already in the pipeline, and 9 more are at the pipeline entry stage. If all of those deals were to happen, $77-million in guarantee fund capacity would be needed, far exceeding the
                         current capacity of about $60-million. A mechanism has now been demonstrated that is leveraging private commercial finance to meet electric cooperative investment requirements,

                         under preparation). While these financings should enable the project to meet its GEO, because the program has only ramped up recently, there are as yet no GHG reductions to
                         record. However, some assets are just now coming into service, and over the balance of this calendar year and next, the loss reduction impact of the investments in various EC's will
