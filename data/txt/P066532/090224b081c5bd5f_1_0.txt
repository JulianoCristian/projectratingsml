                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) support will be to reduce GHG emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency investments
                         in the rural power distribution sub-sector. This will be achieved through the pilot use of innovative contractual mechanisms and GEF-funded Partial Credit Guarantee
                         Program to promote private investment and financing.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make good progress toward its development objective. The facility, the Electric Cooperative Partial Credit Guaranteer (EC-PCG) program, which with
                         present capital resources can support about $70-million in lending to electric cooperatives (EC's), will be wholly or almost fully committed by the end of 2013. Now that a significant
                         range of assets are coming into operation, some initial calculations can be made about the project's impact on technical loss reduction and avoided greenhouse gas emissions. On a

                         preliminary basis, the project could exceed the targets by about 50%. Much of the additional impact arises from the fact that a greater volume of lending has been supported that was
                         originally projected, an indication of the strong demand for guarantees to support commercial lending to the EC sector.
