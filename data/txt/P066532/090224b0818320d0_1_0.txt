                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) support will be to reduce GHG emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency investments
                         in the rural power distribution sub-sector. This will be achieved through the pilot use of innovative contractual mechanisms and GEF-funded Partial Credit Guarantee
                         Program to promote private investment and financing.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make good progress toward its development objective. Committed and approved guarantees account for $58-million of the $70-million capacity of the
                         Electric Cooperative Partial Credit Guarantee (EC-PCG) fund, signaling the need to increase the capital resources of the program at some point in 2013. This expansion of the
                         guaranteeing capacity of EC-PCG is proposed to be done via a Clean Technology Fund guarantee, which is under preparation as part of the Philippines Renewable Energy
                         Development (PHRED) project. Four loans backed by EC-PCG are now fully drawn, and the assets financed by those loans will be coming into full operational service in 2013. The

                         impact of these assets on system losses and financial performance will be assessed in future implementation review missions. EC-PCG has already broadened access to finance, as
                         increasingly lower rated (according to the classification system of the National Electrification Administration, or NEA) EC's come into the system; and it has also broadened
                         participation by the financial community, as mid-market banks are chasing after deals. EC-PCG is now, with NEA, one of the two most important providers of debt to the EC sector.
