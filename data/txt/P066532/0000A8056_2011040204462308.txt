                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) support will be to reduce GHG emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency
                         investments in the rural power distribution sub-sector. This will be achieved through the pilot use of innovative contractual mechanisms and GEF-funded
                         Partial Credit Guarantee Program to promote private investment and financing.
