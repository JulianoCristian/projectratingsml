                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) support will be to reduce GHG emissions through the removal of barriers to energy efficiency investments
                         in the rural power distribution sub-sector. This will be achieved through the pilot use of innovative contractual mechanisms and GEF-funded Partial Credit Guarantee
                         Program to promote private investment and financing.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make very good progress; by early 2014, it is expected that the Government's Electric Cooperative Partial Credit Guarantee (ECPCG) facility will be fully
                         committed; new resources are intended to be provided by a project to be funded by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF): the Philippines Renewable Energy Development (PHRED)
                         project. Because processing of this project is delayed, interim steps will be taken by the Department of Energy to ensure continuity of ECPCG until PHRED can be made effective.
                         29 loans, with 27 different electricity cooperatives (EC's) as the borrowers, are expected to be committed by early 2014. One loan has already disbursed to an EC, LEYECO-5 (Leyte

                         ECPCG is on track to exceed its performance targets. The project will have supported 150% more investment than originally foreseen ($100-million versus the projection of $40-
                         million); carbon avoidance should be at least 50% higher than estimated; 7 commercial banks have made loans, compared to a target of 4; and there have been no defaults by any of
                         the borrowers. The project has demonstrated a viable commercial financing path for the EC sector and Government intends to scale up the ECPCG program using CTF resources.
