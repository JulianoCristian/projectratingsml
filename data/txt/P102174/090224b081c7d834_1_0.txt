                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Available data on key outcome indicators are showing that the project is on track to meet its development objective: out of the five indicators, four have been met, and one is on track
                         to be met before the Project closing date. In addition, most of the intermediate indicators have been met or on track. While most of the areas are progressing well, the model school
                         construction is experiencing delays and will not be completed on time. The original plan was for the school to be completed by the end of April, to allow for furnishing and equipment
