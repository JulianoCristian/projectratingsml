Some lessons learned included: close\n            supervision of day-to-day project management makes a\n            difference in contexts of limited capacity. A balance\n            between the levels of complexity and ambitiousness of\n            project design and institutional and administrative\n            capacities is essential. Building in flexibility in project\n            design may help address challenges of projects prepared for\n            countries in conflict-affected contexts. An accurate\n            assessment of both enabling conditions and implementation\n            readiness is paramount."}, "docdt": "2014-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
