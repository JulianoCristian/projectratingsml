I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. The recent history of Kosovo’s education system is highly unusual and important for
understanding the challenges faced by the Government of Kosovo (GoK). After the break out of
Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, a series of measures against the Kosovo Albanian population took
place, including a ban on teaching in the Albanian language and the introduction of Serbian as the
only official language for formal education. Due to ethnic segregation in schools, changes to the
school curriculum developed in Belgrade, and the dismissal of Kosovo Albanian teaching staff,
the Albanian population decided to establish an unofficial education system at all levels, known
as the “parallel system.” Financing came from remittances from abroad, community money, and
in kind contributions. Symbolic stipends were paid to teachers. During the period of intensified
conflict between 1997 and 1999, education provision was severely curtailed in war-affected areas.
During the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) campaign in 1999, education services
were largely suspended.

2. Following the end of the war in June 1999, the international community, namely the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was left to rebuild the public sector,
including the education system. At this point, the parallel system was transferred into the official
system, and the foundations of the system were set by UNMIK, which was entrusted with the
mandate to govern Kosovo. The decisions of the UNMIK included creating an inventory of all
teaching and non-teaching staff, setting the basic parameters of teaching hours, and setting
teachers’ salaries. In 2001, elections were held in Kosovo, which resulted in the creation of the
Parliament, and the establishment of new Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) of
Kosovo. The PISG had a mandate, with oversight from the international community, to establish
the public administration and run public services. In its effort to rebuild education, the newly
established provisional government in Kosovo faced a number of challenges. After an initial post-
conflict acceleration in 2000, economic growth had weakened in line with declining donor
resources. Unemployment was pervasive and particularly problematic among young people.
About 45 percent of the population in Kosovo was poor, with another 18 percent vulnerable to
poverty. Building human capital and attracting foreign investments were key priorities for future
economic growth and poverty reduction.

3. By the time of the preparation of the Institutional Development for Education Project (IDEP),
Kosovo was entering a new phase in its history as its final political status was being negotiated. In
February 2008, following several United Nations’ facilitated attempts to negotiate a final status,
Kosovo’s Government declared independence and agreed to adhere to the principles of the
Ahtisaari Status Settlement. 1 This marked a change in the sense that Kosovo institutions were


1
  In early February 2007, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), Martti
Ahtisaari, presented a draft Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement intended to lead the
way to independence. The proposal envisaged Kosovo’s future as a multi-ethnic society, governing itself
democratically and with full respect for the rule of law, the highest level of internationally recognized
human rights and fundamental freedoms, and which promotes the peaceful and prosperous existence of all
its inhabitants. While this proposal was accepted by the local government in Kosovo and backed by
the international community, it was strongly opposed by Serbia and Russia. Various UN-facilitated
attempts to negotiate an agreement left Kosovo's status unresolved. Supported by the international
community, Kosovo's government declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.


                                                                                                       1
fully responsible for most domains, with some exceptions. Following independence, the Ministry
of Education, Science and Technology of Kosovo (MEST) was solely responsible for education
reform and policy. The municipalities became the units of local self-government, as proposed by
the Ahtisaari package, with full and exclusive power in various areas, as follows: provision of
education services (pre-primary, primary, and secondary education); registration and licensing of
educational institutions; and recruitment, payment of salaries, and training of teachers and
educational administrators. Within this context, the MEST had to quickly adapt to the shift in
system governance. The IDEP support was geared towards strengthening and mainstreaming
these efforts.

4. The government had identified education as one of the three key sectors for Kosovo’s growth
prospects in its strategy and in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Additionally,
the government recognized the importance of education in preventing future conflicts and
facilitating social reconstruction. Despite the lack of quality information on educational outcomes,
it was assumed that Kosovo’s performance was low compared to other countries in Southeast
Europe, considering the lack of a teacher licensing mechanism, the practice of multiple shifts in
schools, and the limited availability and quality of teaching and learning materials. The sector
was characterized by low enrollment in secondary and higher education (88 percent and 18
percent in 2005 respectively), despite the young and growing population. The high population
growth rate had increased the demand for school places and had led many schools to operate in
multiple shifts. The capacity of the government to manage the education system was low, as well
as its ability to coordinate efforts and institutionalize improvements promoted after the conflict.
To face these challenges, the MEST developed two educational strategies as follows: the Strategy
for the Development of Pre-University Education in Kosovo 2007-2017, and the Strategy for
Development of Higher Education in Kosovo 2005-2015. Education was one of the few sectors in
Kosovo where the Government’s ambitions were articulated into detailed and credible sectoral
development plans.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5. The PDO as stated in the Financing Agreement is as follows: the objective of the Project is to
strengthen systems, institutions and management capacities needed for education quality
improvements. The original key outcome indicators are:
     • MEST establishes baseline of the student learning outcomes at Grades 5 and 9 by 2010.
     • MEST/Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) monitors, analyzes and publishes
        capital and recurrent expenditures (by level of education, by municipality, per student,
        by spending composition) each year.
     • 80 percent of municipalities supported under the project are able to report on the status
        of dropout and retention disaggregated by gender and community by 2011.
     • 60 percent of schools supported under the project produce annual school improvement
        plans and monitoring reports by 2011.
     • 70 percent of teachers are licensed as regular teachers by 2011.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6. Although the PDO remained unchanged throughout the project lifetime, the key outcome
indicators were revised in 2011 (see matrix below). The IDEP was restructured after the Mid-
term Review (MTR) of April 2011 inter alia to improve the clarity, measurability and relevance
of project indicators, and to reflect modifications to some component activities. The definition of



                                                                                                  2
the indicator on students’ assessment changed, as the assessment of grade 9 was already being
carried out by the MEST when the project was launched. Additionally, the target of the indicator
on reports on retention and drop-outs was revised from 80 percent to 60 percent, but it turned out
that this change was not necessary, as the final value of this indicator was exactly 80 percent.

indicator: MEST/MFE monitors, analysis and publishes capital and recurrent expenditures (by level of
education, by municipality, per student, by spending composition) each year.
(**) The 3rd Amendment to the Financing Agreement establishes the following slightly different title for
this indicator: Sixty percent (60%) of schools receiving School Grants produce school improvement plans
and monitoring reports by the Project Closing Date.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7. No specific groups of target beneficiaries were clearly identified in the PAD, although it does
mention that schools with a high proportion of students from poor families and minorities would
be targeted to benefit from the school development grants. Since the IDEP supported the
implementation of key elements of the MEST’s Pre-University and Higher Education Strategies
and had nationwide coverage, all students, teachers and managers of these sub-sectors were
expected to benefit from the Project.

1.5 Original Components

8. The IDEP contained four components, each representing a key element of the Government’s
two education strategies:

(i)     Strengthening the organization and financing of the education system, with
particular attention to the legal framework and funding formula. This component focused on
decentralizing the education system delivery including:
    • developing an appropriate legal framework and management structures and processes for
        primary, secondary, and tertiary education which clarify the roles and responsibilities of
        each level and the accountability mechanisms of the education system;
    • strengthening the leadership, decision making and resource management at the
        municipality and school levels through training and municipal development grants;


                                                                                                          3
    •   piloting of formula-based funding from the municipality to schools and enhancement of
        school financial autonomy; and
    •   providing school development grants which would promote activities to improve the
        quality of teaching-learning conditions and enhance inclusive education at school level.

(ii)    Building institutions and management capacities to promote quality improvements
in primary and secondary education. This component would build on activities that had been
carried out in Kosovo since 2000, which aimed at improving the quality of education including:
     • implementing teachers' professional development, including in-service training, and
        licensing system as developed by MEST in 2004 and 2007;
     • implementing the assessment of students' learning outcomes, and establishing the
        baselines to monitor learning outcomes in the long-term, and the review of the pilot
        matura (high school leaving exam) and its full implementation;
     • strengthening the institutional capacities and management processes of the key
        department in MEST concerning the quality of education, including teacher training,
        curriculum development, and assessment; and
     • providing training and an enabling operational environment for the use of the EMIS for
        analysis of key policy issues and decision making by MEST and municipalities.

(iii)   Creating conditions to introduce efficient and appropriate designs and reduce
multiple shifts in Kosovo's schools to address the current and future constraints in learning
spaces. This component focused on addressing the constraints in learning space, including:
      • school mapping, as well as preparing the school facility investment and maintenance
        plans;
      • developing standard designs for classrooms and school facilities, which are fiscally
        sustainable, appropriate for new teaching methods, and energy efficient; and
      • constructing two model schools (one primary and one secondary) based on the new
        design standards and school mapping.

(iv)    Strengthening management capacity in higher education, at system and institutional
levels to support the implementation of Higher Education Strategy 2005-2015. This
component was designed to support the implementation of the Strategy for Development of
Higher Education 2005-2015, including:
     • supporting MEST to develop amendments to the Law on Higher Education and to draft a
        new law on financing higher education;
     • building the capacity of MEST departments and staff responsible for the functions
        defined in the amended Law on Higher Education; and
     • conducting feasibility studies of: (a) a cost-effective expansion strategy for the Kosovo
        higher education system (size and configuration, institutional diversification); and (b) the
        financial sustainability of the Kosovo higher education system (financing needs, cost-
        sharing, scholarships and student loans, budget allocation mechanisms).

9. Causal linkages between project components and outcome indicators. All four
components as originally planned financed activities that would strengthen systems, institutions
and management capacities needed for education quality improvements. Components 1, 2, and 3
focused on pre-university education while Component 4 focused on higher education. However,
the five outcome indicators relate only to Components 1 and 2, as shown in the table below. No
outcome indicators were included to measure the contributions of Components 3 and 4 to the
PDO.

1.6 Revised Components

10. The basic structure of the four components did not change throughout the operational cycle.
However, as a result of the MTR of April 2011, two activities originally planned were modified
as described in the table below. Because these modifications did not alter the PDO, they were
approved as part of a Level Two restructuring. The other components and activities remained
unchanged.

Components and Activities                                     Modifications
Component 2 – Building institutions and management            Curriculum development was dropped from this
capacities to promote quality improvements in primary         activity, given the availability of financial
and secondary education.                                      resources outside the project.
Activity - Strengthening the institutional capacities and
management processes of the key department in MEST
concerning the quality of education, including teacher
training, curriculum development and assessment.
Component 3 - Creating conditions to introduce efficient      The MEST decided to construct only one urban
and appropriate designs and reduce multiple shifts in         basic education school (grades 0 to 9), rather than
Kosovo's schools.                                             the rural primary school (grades 1-5) and the
Activity – Constructing two model schools based on the        urban secondary school (grades 10-12) that were
new design standards and school mapping.                      originally planned. As the cost of the basic school
                                                              was higher than the total amount originally
                                                              allocated to the civil works, it was agreed that the
                                                              construction of the secondary school would be
                                                              financed by the government (see Section 1.7
                                                              below).

1.7 Other significant changes

11. The Project was approved on December 13, 2007 became effective on December 14, 2007. It
was originally expected to close on June 30, 2012. The Project underwent four restructurings
throughout the six years it was active, all of which were Level Two processes. These
restructurings reflected changes in the project schedule, implementation arrangements and
financing, as stated in the next paragraphs.




                                                                                                              5
12.     1st Restructuring (Corrective). On March 4, 2009, the first amendment to the financing
agreement 2 was approved to reflect the arrangements for the implementation of municipal grants,
which were anticipated in the PAD but not mentioned in the original financing agreement. The
appendix to the financing agreement on definitions was updated accordingly. Additionally, the
disbursement table was updated to include the provisions for municipal grants under the first
disbursement category, without changing any funding allocations of this table.

13.     2nd Restructuring (Corrective). On August 16, 2010, the second amendment to the
financing agreement 3 was approved to reflect a revised composition of the Project Steering
Committee (PSC) and the responsibility for the role of Secretary of this committee. The schedule
of meetings of the PSC and the date of adoption of the Project Operations Manual (POM) by this
committee were also adjusted.

14.     3rd Restructuring (Corrective). On November 18, 2011, the closing date was extended
by one year, from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013, to allow for the construction of the model basic
education school to be completed. Also, the disbursement categories, funding allocations and
percentages of expenditures to be financed were revised, as indicated below. These changes were
agreed to accommodate the revision of project activities as well as to reflect the government’s
commitment to co-finance the construction of the model basic school (grades 0-9).

15.    4th Restructuring (Corrective). On June 11, 2013, the closing date was extended by six
months, from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013, to allow for the finalization of the conclusion

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strengths

16. Continuity of support. There was a strong rationale for Bank involvement in Kosovo’s
education sector. Despite the uncertain nature of the future status of Kosovo 5, which posed high
risks to any Bank-supported operation, the engagement of the Bank with the UNMIK was critical.
The Bank was one of the few development partners that had sustained its support in education,
since the conflict of 1999. At preparation, the Bank had supported the first Education and Health
Project (2000-2003) and the Education Participation and Improvement Project (EPIP) (2003-
2006), which respectively aimed to improve efficiency and equity in public resource allocation
for education, and to improve educational attainment and enhance the access of vulnerable groups
to education.

17. Strategic alignment with country and Bank priorities. The PDO was strategically relevant for
Kosovo’s context at preparation, in which institutions and capacities needed to be built right after
the conflict (see Section 1.1). The Project’s objectives were aligned with the Interim Strategy
Note for Kosovo 2007-2008, which had identified education as the main area of Bank’s support at
that time. The IDEP also aimed to support the government in the implementation of the Strategy
for the Development of Pre-University Education in Kosovo 2007-2017, and the Strategy for
Development of Higher Education in Kosovo 2005-2015

18. Incorporation of lessons learned. The IDEP incorporated lessons learned from the EPIP’s
implementation, specifically concerning community participation and school board involvement
in interventions carried out at the local level in a post-conflict environment.



5
 Kosovo was declared a new state in 2007 and was in the early stages of building its institutions at project
preparation.


                                                                                                           7
Weaknesses

19. Complexity and ambitiousness of design. The project design was overly complex and
ambitious considering the capacity at the central, regional and local levels observed in 2007. The
project components included activities like teachers’ licensing and performance assessment, the
implementation of which required politically sensitive initiatives and strong institutional capacity.
However, it is important to highlight that task teams usually face difficulties while preparing
projects in conflict-affected contexts like the one in Kososo, in which it is hard to identify the full
set of factors that could potentially affect the implementation, and key stakeholder would likely to
survive transitions. In addition to this, the enabling conditions for the implementation of
education financing reforms were not fully assessed at preparation, which added challenges to the
subsequent implementation of the Project. In fact, when the IDEP closed, about 50 percent of
municipalities were still hesitating to delegate autonomy to schools for undertaking procurement
activities due to legal constraints, which were not identified at preparation. The PAD mentions
neither this constraint, nor any related mitigating measure.

20. Preparation of civil works subcomponent. The project design failed to properly assess the
issues surrounding civil works at preparation, including site selection and accurate cost estimates
for both schools. The contract for the design and supervision of the basic education school was
signed only on April 2, 2011 – 15 months before the original closing date – which shows a
weakness of the preparation of the civil works component. In addition to that, at the time of the
MTR, the site for the construction of the upper secondary school had not been identified yet.

21. Assessment of legal framework and risks. Legal constraints restricted regional authorities
from implementing education financing reforms. The Bank failed to assess this legal risk at
appraisal, but the GoK also failed to identify the existing procurement law as a constraint. In
addition to this shortcoming, the procurement risks were assessed as modest at appraisal, but the
low capacity at the school level for undertaking procurement activities under the school
development grants subcomponent delayed its implementation substantially.

2.2 Implementation

Factors outside the Control of Government or Implementing Agencies

22. At early stages of the implementation cycle, the Project was affected by the political process
of independence declaration, which contributed to divert the focus of the Government. Over the
project’s lifetime, other political factors delayed implementation, like the collapse of the
government in October 2010 and the subsequent leadership vacuum. The new government was
established only at the end of February 2011, which led to the high turnover of MEST’s staff,
including the Permanent Secretary, who played the role of Project Director, the Head of the
Higher Education Department, the Head of the Donor Coordination Unit, and a few political
advisers that supervised project activities.

23. At the project closing date, political instability was still affecting the implementation. The
Northern part of the country was suffering from politically motivated attacks, including the use of
explosives. Seven municipalities (18 percent of the total) with a majority of Serbian population
had not allocated recurrent budget to schools according to the funding formula or participated in
other reforms supported by the Project due to limited or non-existent cooperation with the GoK.




                                                                                                     8
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

24. The GoK and particularly the MEST remained highly committed to the objectives and
implementation of the IDEP throughout the operational cycle. However, the Government’s
inability to identify the school site and lack of funds delayed the launching of the construction of
the upper secondary education school to such an extent that it made this activity untenable given
the project’s duration.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control

25. Although the MEST remained committed to the IDEP, changes in its leadership contributed
to implementation delays. A high turnover of key staff involved in project management was
observed, as follows: Project Director (five changes), Project Coordinator (two changes),
Procurement Specialist (three changes) and Financial Management Specialist (two changes).
These changes translated into loss of project-related knowledge.

26. The limited capacity within the MEST, the delayed establishment of the Project Coordination
Team (PCT), and the lack of the POM at project launching resulted in implementation constraints
and delays. For example, roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders were not clarified to
individuals involved in project management and implementation until September 2010, when the
POM was adopted.

27. Additionally, the first Project Procurement Plan was concluded one year after project
effectiveness. The Financial Management Specialist and the Procurement Specialist were hired
only in late 2008. The first Project Coordinator was not adequately skilled to manage the Project
in the challenging early stages of implementation. These factors also explain significant
implementation delays.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28. M&E Design. The revised outcome indicators are adequate for measuring progress towards
the achievement of the PDO. However, there are some disconnects between project components
and outcome indicators, as described in Section 1.5, given that there are no PDO indicators
related to Components 3 or 4. In other words, the results framework does not account for the
interventions supported under Components 3 and 4 and the PDO. Nonetheless, the results
framework does present intermediate level indicators for all project components

29. M&E Implementation. Although the M&E capacity has grown throughout the
implementation period, the MEST has not fully implemented M&E activities as expected. The
MEST did not begin to monitor project indicators until November 2009, almost two years after
project effectiveness. Delays in finalizing and adopting the POM also affected M&E activities,
given that the POM laid out the foundations for implementation, including the monitoring
arrangements. Furthermore, the strengthened capacity of the MEST and Municipal Education
Departments (MED) was expected to allow for the monitoring of education indicators beyond the
project scope, as described in the PAD. However, the MEST has not been monitoring long-term
education sector objectives.

30. M&E Utilization. The MEST has built some capacity towards utilizing data collected
through M&E efforts. For example, the Education Management Information System (EMIS) is
now feeding the new pre-university education financing mechanism introduced by the IDEP with
data. The budgets of municipalities are allocated by the Ministry of Finance based on a per-pupil


                                                                                                  9
formula calculated with inter alia EMIS data. In addition to that, in May 2013, a report on
education statistics was prepared jointly by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the
MEST using data produced by the EMIS. However, the EMIS only became operational in June
2011, one year before the original closing date. Additionally, the PAD describes provisions for
conducting annual review meetings with key stakeholders to analyze and discuss progress
towards project objectives and the implementation of the education strategies. These review
meetings were intended to be the main forum for education sector planning and monitoring,
although they never took place during the implementation of the IDEP. However, it bears
mentioning that the MEST has been organizing joint annual review meetings with other line
Ministries, municipalities and all education sector development, since 2012.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31. Safeguards. The IDEP was classified as Category B because of the plan of building two
model schools with project funds. The Project triggered the Environmental Assessment Policy
(OP/BP 4.01) and an Environmental Management Plan was prepared and disclosed in October
2007. The Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard Policy (OP/BP 4.12) was not triggered as the
Project was not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement for the construction of these
schools.

32. The IDEP remained compliant with the sole safeguard policy triggered throughout its
implementation lifecycle—the Environmental Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4.01). Nevertheless, the
MEST failed to have the Municipality of Prishtina adopt measures to secure the abandoned brick
building adjacent to the model school, like fencing the building off and boarding the broken
windows to prevent glass falling in the schoolyard until the project closing date.

33. Financial Management. The financial management arrangements for the Project were found
acceptable to the World Bank at preparation but the overall financial management risk was rated
substantial. The Financial Management Specialist of the PCT was hired almost one year after
project effectiveness, which did not contribute to speeding up the implementation at the earliest
stage nor increasing disbursement—as of October 2010, only 18 percent of the grant had been
disbursed. At early phases of implementation, the financial management and procurement
arrangements for the implementation of the school development grants were made unnecessarily
cumbersome, which significantly slowed down this process. The Task Team required that every
purchase had written offers from at least three suppliers regardless of amount, and schools could
not purchase goods because local providers were not willing to comply with those procedures for
small purchases. Nonetheless, the financial management capacity within the MEST improved
throughout the project implementation. The Task Team conducted regular assessment of financial
management issues during project supervision and found generally satisfactory controls.

34. Procurement. The procurement risk was rated high at preparation and mitigating measures
were adequately identified and stated in the PAD. The main procuring unit of the IDEP was the
MEST, but MED and schools were also entitled to carry out procurement activities related to the
implementation of municipal and school development grants respectively. Training activities on
procurement according to the World Bank’s guidelines were provided to representatives of MEST,
MED and schools. Additionally, full-time local and international Procurement Specialists were
made available to support procurement activities at the central level. The full-time Procurement
Specialist was hired almost one year after project effectiveness, like the Financial Management




                                                                                               10
Specialist. At the regional and local level, a Non-Governmental Organization 6 (NGO) was
contracted to provide technical assistance to MED and schools throughout all phases of the grants
programs. All these initiatives helped increase the procurement capacity at these three levels, but
did not avoid slowing down the initial phase of project implementation, which was also caused by
the financial management constraints. The procurement capacity at regional and local level was
uneven, given the existence of staff familiar with procurement either according to the National
Procurement Law or Bank’s guidelines in some but not all MED and schools. Issues related to
procurement observed during project preparation and implementation include: (i) shortcomings in
maintaining contract administration records; (ii) late preparation of Procurement Plans; (iii)
MEST’s attempts to interfere with the selection of consultants at very early stages of
implementation; (iv) lack of contract management capacity, which was a clear weakness noticed
in the construction of the model school; and (v) inadequate assessment of the existing legal
framework at preparation, given the limitations materialized during the implementation of the
education financing reform.

35. Legal Covenants. The MEST complied with the two legal covenants in the second year of
project implementation. The PSC was established and operational in June 2010, and the POM
was adopted by this Committee only in September 2010.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36. A follow-up operation is currently being prepared and expected to be submitted to the
Board’s consideration in December 2014. The new education Project proposes to build on
selected interventions financed by the IDEP, so as to continue strengthening the capacity and
accountability mechanisms of institutions responsible for delivering pre-university education. The
new Project would support activities on: (i) strengthening strategic and financial planning and
monitoring capacity for the decentralized education system; (ii) implementing the teachers’
certification system; (iii) strengthening the student assessment and examination system; and (iv)
creating mechanisms and capacities for evidence-based policymaking and system monitoring.
Building on the success of the school development grants, the MEST has requested to include this
as one of the priority activities, with a renewed and stronger focus on quality improvement and
support to education reform implementation. These interventions are based on the Government’s
priorities, as identified in the sector strategy.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37. As explained below, the objective relevance rating is high, whereas the design relevance
rating is modest. A combined assessment of these two dimensions leads to an overall relevance
rating of substantial.

38. Relevance of Objectives - rating: high. Improving the quality of education continues to be a
major priority for Kosovo. Kosovo’s Strategy for the Development of Pre-University Education
2007-2017 remains the central policy document for setting strategic directions in the sector. This
strategy acknowledges that strengthening systems, institutions, and capacities are fundamental to
improving education quality. The IDEP PDO directly addresses several strategic objectives laid

                                                                                                11
out explicitly in this strategy, including: (i) quality and efficient governance, leadership, and
management of the education system, and (ii) a functional system of providing quality learning
based on standards comparable with those of the developed countries. Continued investment in
education and skills is also one of six action areas specifically mentioned in Kosovo’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-FY15 to support its strategic objective on accelerating
broad-based economic growth and employment generation. The PDO on strengthening systems,
institutions and management capacities needed for education quality improvements is still highly
relevant given the country’s priorities and objectives, articulated in both the Pre-University
Education Strategy and the CPS.

39. A new education project 7 is being prepared for Kosovo, which aims to strengthen the
capacity and accountability mechanisms of institutions responsible for pre-university education. It
would build on selected activities that were financed by the IDEP, like (i) strengthening the
strategic and financial planning capacities at central, municipal and school level, (ii) supporting
school development grants, (iii) teacher certification and career advancement, (iv) strengthening
capacities of key institutions for monitoring educational outcomes and assessment of student
learning, and (v) enhancing education monitoring and evaluation capacity. This follow-up
operation would roll-out some IDEP-supported activities, which shows how relevant the IDEP
development objective remains.

40. Relevance of Design - rating: modest. Within the context of an unclear future status of
Kosovo, the IDEP was prepared to help the government develop the legal framework, funding
arrangements and administrative procedures clarifying roles and responsibilities at the central,
regional and local levels of the education system. The project design included three components
supporting activities in pre-university education and one, in tertiary education. While the current
CPS has one strategic objective that involves investments in tertiary education, the 4th component
of the IDEP limitedly financed technical support to amending the Law on Higher Education and
one study on the size and shape of higher education in Kosovo. These facts reveal that the IDEP
design remained modestly relevant. The implementation arrangements also remain at least
modestly relevant, given that a decentralized implementation approach to strengthen capacity not
only at the MEST level is still one of the needs to be addressed, as shown in the concept note of
the new education project proposed for Kosovo.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41. As explained in the next paragraphs, the project’s efficacy rating is substantial. The targets of
all five PDO level indicators were achieved. Additionally, of the 13 targets of intermediate results
indicators, eight were fully met, and five were not achieved (see Annex 2).

42. Improvements were observed in some education indicators throughout the implementation of
the Project. Transition rates between grades remained at almost universal levels in basic
education, and improved significantly in upper secondary. Additionally the student-teacher ratios
decreased, especially in basic education, putting Kosovo more in line with comparator countries
(see Annex 3). However, it is important to highlight that several determinants are known to
contribute to achieving improvements in education quality, which include but are not limited to
those supported under the Project (i.e. strengthened systems, institutions and management
capacity). Factors such as parental education, socioeconomic background, skills and experience
of principals, and the quality and availability of teaching materials are also contributors to

    Education System Improvement Project (P149005).


                                                                                                  12
education quality. Thus, while project interventions were likely to have played an important role
in the attainment of the PDO, this ICR acknowledges that there were other likely factors at play.

43. The assessment of the project’s efficacy is undertaken in this ICR considering that the three
core aspects of the PDO (strengthened systems, institutions and management capacities) are
intertwined so these elements of the objective are considered jointly rather than separately. The
PAD does not define these aspects of the PDO as three separate sub-PDOs, and they are clearly
interrelated and interdependent. Capacity building is a necessary step towards improved systems
and institutions. Additionally, improved systems are frequently needed for developing new or
changing existing institutions. For these reasons, this ICR assesses the PDO as one objective,
rather than a composition of three separate sub-objectives.

44. While there are linkages between the outcome indicators and the PDO, some disconnects are
observed between the project components and the development objective. As already stated, all
five outcome indicators relate to the first two components (on financing reforms and quality
improvement respectively). The results framework does not allow measuring the aggregated
contributions of the component 3 (on school designs) nor the component 4 (on tertiary education)
to the PDO. The outcomes of the interventions in each project component, i.e. contributions of
each component to achieving the PDO, are presented below.

Outcomes of Interventions in Education Financing (Component 1)

45. Component 1 activities directly contributed to the achievement of the PDO. The targets of the
two PDO level indicators associated to this component were achieved. In addition to this, the
targets of two out of four intermediate results indicators of this component were also met (see
Annex 2). The Law on Pre-University Education and respective by-laws were developed,
approved and are in place. This legal framework, which was adopted by the Parliament in June
2011, provides clear roles and responsibilities for delivering educational services as well as
accountability. It lays out the foundation for reforms in relevant areas, including: school
autonomy, financial decentralization, teachers’ qualifications and career development, selection
of teachers and school managers, assessment and examination.

46. The per-capita financing formula developed before the project launching, in 2002, was
revised and has been in use for four years, since 2010. This formula is now part of the regular
budgeting exercise carried out by the MEST and the MFE, for all levels of pre-university
education. The improvements to the budget allocation process include, inter alia, the use of
update students-teacher ratios per level of education, a fairer allocation of budget of schools
located in remote areas, and an allocation of non-teaching staff on a per-pupil basis. At present,
EMIS data are used for the budget allocation. Out of 38 municipalities, 31 (82% of the total) are
applying this formula; the other 7 are those with a majority of Serbian population, which do not
cooperate with the Kosovar authorities for political reasons. School managers are now involved in
their school budget preparation, which was not observed prior IDEP. As a result, in 2013 all
schools were provided with a treasury account and had their recurrent budget allocated, which
reduce their reliance on support from municipalities. It is important to note that prior to project
interventions, the pre-university education budget preparation process was almost entirely led by
the MFE. Now, MEST plays a leading role in this process, which is more reflective of education
sector priorities. Additionally, the Project played a critical role in strengthening the capacities of
regional authorities to administer the formula across their municipality. However, despite the
successful rollout of the per-capita financing formula, about 50 percent of municipalities did not
fully devolve financial autonomy to schools, specifically the authority for undertaking
procurement activities, due to thresholds set in the existing National Procurement Law. Thus, the


                                                                                                   13
schools of these municipalities had their budget allocated according to the revised formula, but
were not always able to procure themselves the needed goods and services.

47. Concerning the school development grants, 207 schools benefited from this activity, which
contributed to building the capacity of managers and teachers in planning, financial management,
procurement and monitoring and evaluation. Principals of schools located in Gjakova, Klina,
Prizren, Rahovec and Suhareka informed that they are now able to prepare proposals to raise
funds for their schools from different donors, as a result of IDEP’s capacity building activities.
School-based management activities like this one supported by IDEP allow schools to identify
and address their own needs more effectively than centralized approaches, as evidenced in several
experiences across the world. School managers and teachers know the challenges of their schools
better than other actors of the education system, and are capable to make effective decisions on
using scarce funds provided by central and regional authorities to address the needs of their
schools, when adequate technical assistance is provided, like this case in Kosovo.

Outcomes of Interventions in Pre-University Education Quality (Component 2)

48. Component 2 activities also contributed directly to the achievement of the PDO. The targets
of the three PDO level indicators associated with this component were achieved. Additionally, the
targets of three out of five intermediate results indicators of this component were met (see Annex
2). The State Council for Teacher Licensing (SCTL) was established and is operational with
support from the IDEP. This council led the preparation of the legal framework for teachers’
licensing, professional development and performance assessment. The teacher salary structure has
been revised and implemented so that salaries are differentiated by qualifications, compared to
the same salary paid to teachers, in the previous system. Teachers’ licensing is the only one of
these three activities that was implemented with IDEP support. The challenges for the
implementation of teachers’ professional development and performance assessment have to do
with the lack of human and financial resources within the MEST and municipalities. At the
project closing date, 75 percent of teachers were licensed according to the newly established
mechanism. Additionally, an information system with data on licensing of teachers is running and
representatives of regional inspectorates were trained to operate this software. The future
implementation of all three dimensions of the teachers’ development mechanism would help the
MEST motivate, reward and retain good teachers. Improvements for the education system are
expected and would derive from requirements for new teachers, as well as the in-service
requirements that all teachers need to meet to stay and be promoted.

49. The EMIS is deployed and running in all schools of Kosovo, except those located in the 7
municipalities with a Serbian majority. This information system was improved and became
operational with support from the IDEP. As a result, school management staff can enter the data
into the EMIS database, and analyze information of their schools. Additionally, authorities at the
central and regional levels now have access to quality information, and are using use this
information to make decisions and better support school managers. Some improvements would
strengthen the EMIS and its operational environment, like the need of avoiding repetitive data
collection exercises, which are undertaken four times a year, and the integration with other
important systems including the school mapping and the one on teachers’ licensing and career
development. The data collection for the EMIS has replaced the multiplicity of previous
processes based on electronic sheets, which was not totally accurate. In this regard, the Ministry
of Finance has suspended its own school data collection process, and now uses EMIS’s data for
budget allocation. In addition to this, a report on educational statistics was produced based on
EMIS’s data, which was done in close collaboration with UNICEF. This show how the IDEP has



                                                                                               14
contributed to the use of quality educational information for decision-making in Kosovo, which is
remarkable.

50. The IDEP also supported the development of a learning assessment system for grade 5, the
first round of tests in 2010 (baseline), as well as the preparation of an assessment policy and
reporting standards. The IDEP also supported the application of Kosovo for the Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD’s) Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA) in 2015, as well as the improvements in administration of the Matura exam.
The latter outcome was not anticipated in the PAD.

Outcomes of Interventions in Developing Standard Designs for Schools (Component 3)

51. Although the results framework lacks outcome indicators for this IDEP component, it is
reasonable to say that its activities also contributed to achieving the development objective. The
targets of the two intermediate results indicators of this component were met (see Annex 2). The
IDEP supported the development of the school mapping, which stores information on the physical
conditions of all Kosovo’s schools, including needs for infrastructure improvements. This system
has been used by the MEST to develop investment and maintenance plans. In addition, the
Project financed the development of standards for schools design (the Manual for School
Standards and Design for Pre-University School Facilities), which are now being used by the
MEST as binding documents when making infrastructure investments. Under the Project, the
MEST approved by-laws on ensuring that all new schools constructions are aligned with both
investment plans and standards. The rationale for the construction of schools with project funds
relates to the intention of building capacity within the MEST’s Infrastructure Unit on the use of
school standards for future investments. In fact, the construction of the model basic education
school financed by the Project was undertaken in accordance with the newly developed standards.
The combination of the school mapping software and the new school design standards ensures
that future infrastructure investments are both efficient and high-impact. Furthermore,
professional certification for architects in Kosovo now requires a knowledge of these school
standards, which further demonstrates how the IDEP has helped to institutionalize this initiative.

Outcomes of Interventions in Capacity Building for Tertiary Education (Component 4)

52. As mentioned, the results framework does not contain outcome indicators for Component 4.
Nonetheless, the implementation of its activities did contribute to achieving the PDO. The target
of one of the two intermediate results indicators of this component was met (see Annex 2). The
Law on Higher Education was revised, amended and approved by the Parliament. The amended
law lays the foundation for some key initiatives required for quality improvement in higher
education, including the accreditation of public and private providers of tertiary education.
Additionally, the IDEP supported a study on the size and shape of tertiary education, which was
used by the MEST for the development of its strategy on higher education. As a result, the Project
helped to raise awareness on the importance of the accreditation process for tertiary education
institutions, which can lead to an improved quality of higher education in Kosovo.

3.3 Efficiency

53. The project’s efficiency rating is modest. The economic and financial section of the PAD
lacks any customary analysis carried out for Bank-supported projects, such as net present value
(NPV), economic rate of return (ERR) and financial rate of return (FRR). It barely shows the
increase in the education budget allocation over the previous seven years and some information
on the grants and school design standards supported by the IDEP. Thus, this ICR does not


                                                                                               15
recalculate the NPV, ERR nor FRR, as there is no baseline for comparisons. Instead, this report
assesses the project’s efficiency through aspects of the project design and implementation that
either contributed to or reduced efficiency. See Annex 3 for more details.

54. The Project supported the revision of the per capita financing mechanisms, in order to better
respond to school and municipal needs. Data collection exercises promoted by the Project have
been crucial for informing policy makers (both at the municipal and at the central level) on
teachers and student flows. School principals consulted for the preparation of this ICR
highlighted the improvements in the budget allocation as well as the use of EMIS data for
planning purposes. However, as the World Bank’s Public Finance Review of 2014 informed, the
Project contributed to increased school autonomy and transparency, but the efficiency gains are
still not visible enough, probably because of the complex design of the financing formula.

55. The school standards and school mapping have been used by the MEST to help ensure an
efficient utilization of state budget and contributions of donor for schools infrastructure
improvements and constructions. Nowadays, investments on infrastructure are informed by
quality data on school needs, as well as are done based on standards developed for an efficient
utilization of financial resources.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

56. The project’s overall relevance rating is substantial, the project’s efficacy rating is
substantial, and the project’s efficiency rating is modest. The combined assessment of these
dimensions yields an overall satisfactory rating for the achievement of the project’s outcome.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

57. Gender Aspects. Enrollment rates for girls in upper secondary increased from 80 percent in
2010 to 88 percent in 2012, while for boys the rate only increased from 92 percent in 2010 to 95
percent in 2012. The gender gap in enrollment has decreased in both primary and secondary
education: full gender parity in basic education was achieved in 2013 (48.5 percent of girls in
school, with girls comprising 48 percent of the school-age population). Substantial improvements
in the gender gap were also achieved in upper secondary education (girls’ percentage in upper
secondary went from 44.5 percent in 2007 to 46 percent in 2013). While these improvements
were observed during project implementation, they cannot be directly attributed to the IDEP.

58. Social Development. The Pre-University Education and the Higher Education Laws
developed or revised under the Project include requirements for protecting vulnerable groups of
students, and for strengthening social inclusion by attending to the needs of special education
students. The IDEP also contributed to increased participation of communities in school-based
management activities through the implementation of school grants.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

59. The PDO is directly related to institutional development and all outcomes in this regard are
mentioned in Section 3.2 above.




                                                                                              16
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

60. The risk that the IDEP development objective will not be maintained is moderate, despite the
high relevance of this PDO to Kosovo’s current development priorities (see Section 3.1). Some
systems strengthened throughout the project implementation may face challenges in the near
future, such as the systems on teachers’ licensing, performance assessment and career
development. While the legal framework of this system is in place, the challenges for the MEST
rest on the needed provision of teachers’ training, which is required by the licensing mechanism,
as well as on the availability of human and financial resources for rolling-out the activities.

61. The maintenance of other systems also poses some challenges for the MEST, such as the
adequate administrative capacity of its assessment unit to keep the student assessment system
operational. The assessment unit might lack human and financial resources to continue the
progress observed so far. On the other hand, operation of the EMIS will require further
improvements on integrating its database with others (e.g. school mapping and teachers’
licensing), and developing the students’ management module.

62. In terms of school autonomy, the risks rest on the limited financial autonomy currently
devolved to schools, which can put this initiative in jeopardy in the short-term. Experiences in
other countries show that stakeholders tend to claim higher levels of autonomy over the process,
and if this does not happen, they usually avoid continued participation in school-based
management activities.

63. The national elections foreseen for 2014 may also bring about leadership changes, which
might not be favorable to the continued implementation of sensitive reforms like teachers’
performance assessment and per-pupil financing.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry – rating: moderately unsatisfactory

64. The PDO was aligned with the Interim Strategy Note for Kosovo 2007-2008, which had
identified education as the main area of Bank’s support at that time. The IDEP was also designed
to support the government in the implementation of its two strategies on pre-university and
tertiary education. Additionally, lessons from the EPIP’s implementation were considered by the
Bank at preparation, such as community participation and school board involvement in school-
level interventions. The task team carefully considered the challenges of Kosovo’s post-conflict
context at preparation, which was remarkable. However, there were significant shortcomings in
the identification, preparation and appraisal of the IDEP, which lead the Bank’s performance in
ensuring quality at entry to be rated as moderately unsatisfactory. These shortcomings include:
     • inadequate assessment of implementation readiness, as evidenced by the absence of the
         POM, Project Implementation Plan and Project Procurement Plans at project launching;
     • poor support to the counterparts for estimating project costs;
     • incomplete assessment of the existing legal framework at appraisal, which limited the
         level of autonomy devolved to schools during implementation;
     • disconnects in the results framework, which do not include any outcome indicators to
         measure the aggregated contributions of two out of four project components;




                                                                                              17
       •   ambitiousness of the PAD on monitoring long-term education sector objectives in a
           context of limited capacity;
       •   complexity of project design vis-à-vis the existing capacity for project implementation;
       •   failure to identify risks associated with planned civil works and respective mitigating
           measures, which contributed to delays in the identification of the model school site;
       •   weaknesses of the economic and financial analysis, which did not include any customary
           analysis such as NPV, ERR and FRR.

(b) Quality of Supervision – rating: moderately satisfactory

65. Bank supervision benefited from close collaboration with the PCT and implementing units,
especially after the MTR, when a local Bank manager began to lead the IDEP. Having a local
staff leading the project supervision from the Bank side helped the counterparts solve day-to-day
technical and fiduciary problems, which contributed to increased disbursement (from the
incredibly low level of 24 percent of the grant, basically 3.5 years after the effectiveness date) and
achieve the PDO. In general, the Bank carried out two to three supervision missions per year,
which never left the counterparts without technical support for long periods. Additionally, the
Bank supported four project restructurings to correct for design weaknesses and implementation
challenges (see Section 1.7), which indicates a strong effort to address constraints and remain
focused on achieving the PDO.

66. There were moderate shortcomings in the Bank’s proactive identification of opportunities
and resolution of threats which contribute to rating the quality of Bank’s supervision as
moderately satisfactory. Several factors support this assessment including the high turnover of
Bank staff. Four different Bank managers had led project supervision throughout the operational
cycle, three of them in the first 20 months of implementation. At the end of the third month of
implementation, the team leader who prepared the IDEP had already been replaced by the second
of those four managers. Bank supervision failed to quickly fix one the biggest weaknesses of the
preparation process: the lack of a POM, Project Implementation Plan and Project Procurement
Plan in place by the project effectiveness date. The POM was not adopted until 33 months after
this milestone. Although the Bank restructured the IDEP four times over its lifecycle, but the first
substantial restructuring (the third of the four processes) took place very late, only seven months
before the original closing date. The small changes promoted under the second restructuring
could have been done later, together with other potential changes envisioned to address other
problems related to the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance – rating: moderately satisfactory

67. Overall Bank performance is considered to be moderately satisfactory. Despite significant
shortcomings in ensuring quality at project entry, this rating is justified given the moderately
satisfactory quality of Bank supervision and that substantial results were achieved under the
Project, as reflected in the moderately satisfactory overall outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance 8

(a) Government Performance – rating: moderately satisfactory




8
    In this ICR, the word Recipient is replaced by Borrower to remain consistent with the ICR Guidelines.


                                                                                                            18
68. Although the GoK remained committed to achieving the IDEP’s objective throughout
implementation, there were moderate shortcomings in government performance over the project
lifecycle such as: (i) inability to identify the site and lack of funds to finance the construction of
the upper secondary education school, leading this activity to be dropped from the Project; (ii)
weak coordination efforts with the Municipality of Prishtina to identify the site for the
construction of the basic education school, the primary reason for the 18-month project extension;
and (iii) a leadership vacuum between October 2010 and February 2011, which resulted in a high
turnover of MEST staff.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance – rating: moderately satisfactory

69. The MEST exhibited a high level of ownership and active participation during project
preparation, and remained committed to the Project throughout the implementation period.
Capacity to manage, implement and monitor donor-funded operations has also improved in the
MEST, MED and schools under the IDEP. Capacity building processes were facilitated by the
Ministry’s decision to pair international consultants with local staff. Furthermore, there is
evidence that the stronger capacity in the MEST has led the Ministry to proactively pursue quality
improvements and reforms that were not envisioned at project preparation. For example, the
IDEP supported the establishment of the MEST assessment unit, which has cultivated a greater
appreciation and commitment to student assessment, demonstrated by the Ministry’s decision to
prepare for and participate in PISA in 2015. The capacity to effectively plan and make informed
decisions has also been built within the municipalities, which have begun using EMIS data on a
regular basis for such purposes.

70. Despite these factors, there were moderate shortcomings in the performance of implementing
agencies. Protracted delays in completing the POM, Implementation Plan, Procurement Plan, as
well as delays in recruiting PCT staff, mainly fiduciary specialists, resulted in persistent
implementation constraints and periods of non-compliance with the legal covenants. Costs of
civil works were inaccurately estimated at preparation. Central and regional implementing
agencies neglected to identify some aspects of the national procurement law as a constraint to the
devolution of financial autonomy to schools, and this law was not changed throughout the
implementation of the IDEP. Finally, monitoring of project indicators was delayed by almost two
years following project effectiveness, and the MEST still does not monitor long-term education
sector objectives, as expected in the PAD.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance - rating: moderately
satisfactory

71. Overall, the Borrower’s performance is deemed moderately satisfactory, given that both the
government and implementing agencies performances are rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

72. Close supervision of day-to-day project management makes a difference in contexts of limited
capacity. Bank supervision positively impacted the implementation of IDEP and the achievement
of its objective, especially after a local Bank Task Team Leader took over the project. This
change allowed for a closer supervision of several aspects that had delayed project
implementation and disbursement, which had reached only 24 percent of the grant after 3.5 years
of implementation. The lesson learned from this experience is that in contexts of limited capacity,
especially post-conflict environments like Kosovo, local staff should be closely involved in
project implementation.


                                                                                                   19
73. A balance between the levels of complexity and ambitiousness of project design and
institutional and administrative capacities is essential. Early in the project’s lifecycle,
implementation was affected by several factors, including the political process of independence
declaration, changes in leadership within the MEST, high turnover of key staff involved in project
management, and the lack of core project documents. On the other hand, the project design was
overly complex and ambitious, considering the number of different and politically sensitive
activities in areas like education financing, school autonomy, students’ assessment, teacher
licensing and performance assessment, and regulation of tertiary education. Although institutional
and administrative capacities have grown throughout the project, implementation was slow in the
early years because of the mismatch between existing capacities and the complexity and
ambitiousness of project design.

74. Building in flexibility in project design may help address challenges of projects prepared for
countries in conflict-affected contexts. As mentioned above, the early stage of the implementation
of the IDEP was affected by factors like those related to Kosovo’s post-conflict situation. The
overly complex and ambitious design led to four restructurings, some of them very small in scope,
to address problems observed during the project lifecycle. The lesson learned from this
experience is that building some flexibility in designs of projects prepared for contexts like the
one observed in Kosovo may help address problems throughout implementation.

75. An accurate assessment of both enabling conditions and implementation readiness is
paramount. The relatively fast preparation of the IDEP (seven months between concept note
preparation and appraisal) was justifiable, given the critical phase of Kosovo before the
discussion of its status, under the administration of the UNMIK. However, the Bank did not carry
out a comprehensive assessment of the necessary enabling conditions and implementation
readiness, including an analysis of the existing legal framework and MEST capacity to prepare
the required core project documents. As a result, legal constraints not correctly assessed at
preparation limited the implementation of the education financing reform, and the lack of relevant
documentation caused critical delays in the first several years of implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Although the PAD does not explicitly state the rationale for public investment, Kosovo’s
Constitution states that "every person enjoys the right to free basic education”. Education in
Kosovo is mostly provided by the public sector, with more than 95% of students attending public
schools. Moreover, the provision of social services is generally accepted as a government
obligation and private financing for it is mostly non-existent in Kosovo. Project interventions
have therefore targeted public sector organizations. The World Bank’s involvement was based on
its expertise in policy design and implementation following international best practices. This was
clearly the fundamental added value from the institution.

2. Based on the PAD’s Economic and Financial Analysis and the broad definition of the PDO
(strengthening systems, institutions and management capacities needed for education quality
improvements), it is important to note that a quantitative assessment of the cost-effectiveness of
project investments cannot be undertaken. The PAD discussed the alignment of the project with
education sector needs and objectives, and focused on how effectively the project would support
the implementation of the strategies within the overall assistance of development partners. It did
not, however, calculate expected net present value or economic rates of return. Therefore, the
remaining alternatives for economic and financial analysis include: (i) an analysis of the expected
improvements in the quality of the system through teacher development and assessment systems;
(ii) an analysis of the efficiency gains derived from the development of the new financing scheme,
the EMIS progress, the new school standards, potential efficiency gains in the use of the
financing formula, the derived allocation of resources, and the school development grants.

3. Education Indicators. During the lifespan of the Project, there were improvements in some
education indicators. Transition rates between grades remained at almost universal levels in basic
education, and improved significantly in upper secondary, especially for girls (see Figure 1).
Enrollment rates for girls in upper secondary increased from 80 percent in 2010 to 88 percent in
2012, while for boys the rate only increased from 92 percent in 2010 to 95 percent in 2012. The
gender gap in enrollment has decreased in both primary and secondary education: full gender
parity in basic education was achieved in 2013 (48.5 percent of girls in school, with girls
comprising 48 percent of the school-age population). There was also a moderate decrease in
student-teacher ratios, especially in basic education, putting Kosovo more in line with comparator
countries (see Figure 1).

4. Donor Contributions. During project implementation, a number of international donor
agencies increased their contributions to the education sector in Kosovo. Several international
agencies increased their participation in education activities, especially Austrian Development
Agency, European Union, GIZ, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USAID.
Disbursements from donors increased from €2 million in 2007 to over €20 million in 2011,
excluding the World Bank’s support. Through the IDEP, the education system increased its
capacity to absorb committed and planned disbursements, as the rate of disbursed/committed
amounts increased, even more that what could have been planned by each donor per year (see
next figure). This reflects an increased capacity of systems, institutions, and management to
improve education in Kosovo, exceeding the initial expectations of other donors. In this sense,
IDEP funds were efficiently leveraged to secure additional resources for the education sector.

Efficiency Gains Attributed to the IDEP

5. Teacher Policies and Assessment. There is strong consensus in the education literature and
research around the central role of teachers in the learning process. Evidence has shown that the
impact of having a good teacher, as opposed to an average teacher, can be substantial. 12 The
IDEP improved the average qualifications of the existing teacher workforce (which by 2007 was
rather low) through: (i) the teacher licensing process, which completed the minimum in-service
training; and (ii) the higher qualifications of young graduates entering the profession (see next
figure). Strengthening the skills of the teacher workforce is a key factor for quality improvements
of the system. In order to be effective, teacher quality improvements need to be tightly coupled

with assessment and curriculum policies. 13 The IDEP contributed substantially to this by
developing the 5th grade assessment in 2010, which is paramount for monitoring quality
improvements and will serve as a first step for rolling out PISA in 2015 for the first time in
Kosovo.

6. Financing and EMIS: Achievements and Challenges. The Project supported the
development of the per capita financing mechanisms, in order to better respond to school and
municipal needs. Due to the new municipal-to-school formula supported by the IDEP,
municipalities have started to allocate recurrent budget. Data development at the central level has
been crucial for this process, as it has informed policy makers (at both the municipal and central
levels) on teachers and student flows. This has led to a more active approach, where funding
follows needs, rather than the alternative. Informal conversations with school principals indicated
large improvements in school allocation of resources and also the use of EMIS data for planning
purposes. However, as noted in the World Bank’s 2014 Public Finance Review, the IDEP
contributed to increased school autonomy and transparency, but the efficiency gains are still not
very visible, perhaps due to a rather complex design of the formula, which may add rigidity and
complexity for low capacity implementing agencies (MEST/MED). 14 The report proposed better
monitoring by MEST, stronger implementation support for municipalities, and the facilitation of
exchanges of experiences between the better performing municipalities.

7. School Development Grants (SDG). The PAD projected a US$4.0 million investment for
the component of SDG, which would benefit around 92,000 students, implying an average of
US$43 per student. Project reports show that: (i) 207 schools received grants, with 78 percent of
them located in rural areas; (ii) 86 percent of the grants were provided to basic education
institutions; and (iii) 124,154 students benefited from the school grants, with around $2.2 million
spent in total, which leads to an average of $18 per student. These figures show that more

students benefited from the SDG than what was expected, with a lower amount per student,
which reflects a more efficient implementation of this subcomponent. The assessment report of
the SDG program conducted in 2013 showed that the “quality of the SDGs program was
consistently high, and efficiency within the SDGs program was primarily achieved by having the
IDEP staff, MEST, KEC and the ROSOs accomplish so much”. 15 Moreover, “the work of the
IDEP employees was mostly legal and fiduciary, and this kept the schools on schedule to progress
through to the final procurement of equipment and resources”.

8. School Map, School Standards, Shift Changes and Investments. The Infrastructure Unit
of the MEST has reported extensive use of the school map, complemented with the construction
standards (both supported by the IDEP), for subsequent investments both from MEST but also
international donors willing to contribute to capital investments. The Project therefore has been
fundamental in ensuring that public and donor funds are used efficiently by addressing the needs
of overcrowded and deteriorated schools.

Cost-Effectiveness of the IDEP

9. In the PAD, the following project alternatives were considered: (i) supporting school
development grants only; (ii) conditional cash transfers to girls, poor, and ethnic minorities, to
improve enrollment; (iii) school construction; and (iv) adaptable program financing. The
alternatives are discussed below according to the project’s objectives, education sector
developments during the project, and the project achievements:

(i) Supporting School Development Grants only: although the SDG could provide schools and
    school boards with opportunities to start building their management capacities and mobilizing
    communities in school activities, the previous round of school grants under EPIP showed low
    capacity at the school and system level in terms of management and information systems.
    Therefore, the proposed Project supported an investment in school grants with capacity
    building at all levels of education management. The decision has proven to be effective as
    reported by school principals, which have stated that capacity building activities were crucial
    for making better use of SDG.

(ii) Conditional Cash Transfers Targeted to Vulnerable Populations: these programs have been
     successful in many other countries. However, the education sector in Kosovo has witnessed a
     significant increase in upper secondary enrollment rates, which was the most problematic
     level in terms of dropouts and attendance for vulnerable populations. Enrollment rates for
     girls in upper secondary increased from 80 percent in 2009 to 88 percent to 2010, while for
     boys it only increased from 92 percent in 2010 to 95 percent in 2012. Therefore, a project
     aiming exclusively at improving access in upper secondary (and focusing on vulnerable
     groups) would not have added significant value to the system.

(iii) School Construction: this intervention would not have addressed the quality or capacity and
      management constraints in the sector. Moreover, due to procurement issues, efficiency in
      spending would have faced several difficulties.

(iv) Adaptable Program Financing: the unexpected events surrounding the Status of Kosovo, with
     well-founded doubts given the declared independence in 2008, were a major constraint to this
     approach.

Project objective, design, and implementation

1.     The Kosovo Institutional Development for Education Project (IDEP) aimed to support the
government’s Strategy for the Development of Pre-University Education in Kosovo and the
Strategy for the Development of Higher Education. The specific objective of the project was to
“strengthen systems, institutions and management capacities needed for education quality
improvements”. The Project supported four key elements of the government's Pre-University
and Higher Education Strategies, which became the Project’s four key components: (i)
strengthening the organization and financing of the education system in Kosovo, (ii) building
institutions and management capacity to promote quality improvements, (iii) creating conditions
to introduce efficient and appropriate designs and reduce multiple shifts in Kosovo's schools, and
(iv) strengthening the management capacity at system and institutional levels for higher education.
Each of these components included a number of subcomponent activities as described below. The
project PDO was not revised. However, during the February 2011 mid-term review, some
indicators were modified to reflect and address changes and new developments that emerged
during implementation. A description of the four main components and subcomponents follows
below:

Component 1: Strengthening the organization and financing in the education system in
Kosovo, including:
          •       1.1. Developing an appropriate legal framework and the management structures
          and processes for pre-university education which clarifies the roles and responsibilities
          of each level and the accountability mechanisms of the education system.
          •        1.2. Strengthening the leadership, decision making and resource management
          at the municipality and school levels through creating funding mechanism which
          provide transparent, formula based and predictable transfers from municipalities to
          schools.
          •       1.3. Providing school development grants which would strengthen the capacity
          of schools to plan and manage resources toward realizing their vision for developing
          effective learning environments and improve the quality of teaching-learning
          conditions and enhance inclusive education at school level.

Component 2: Building institutions and management capacity to promote quality
improvements in primary and secondary education, including:
          •       2.1. Strengthening the institutional capacities and management processes of the
          key department in the MEST concerning the quality of education, including teacher
          licensing, teachers’ professional development, and teacher’s performance assessment.
          •       2.2. Improve the quality and relevance of curriculum provision and processes
          so that it would positively impact on the quality of teaching and learning in Kosovo
          pre-university education.
          •        2.3. Implementing the assessment of students’ learning outcomes, and
          establishing the baselines to monitor learning outcomes in the long-term, and the
          review of the matura (high school leaving exam) and its full implementation.




                                                                                                34
          •        2.4. Developing the Educational Management Information System (EMIS),
          providing training for key staff and enabling the use of the system for analysis of key
          policy issues and decision making by MEST.
          •       2.5. Providing project implementation support (PCT operational expenditures).

Component 3: Creating conditions to introduce efficient and appropriate designs and reduce
multiple shifts in Kosovo’s schools to address the current and future constraints in learning
space , including:
          •      3.1. School mapping, as well as preparing the school facility investment and
          maintenance plans.
          •        3.2. Developing standard designs for classrooms and school facilities, which
          are fiscally sustainable, appropriate for new teaching methods, and energy efficient.
          •       3.3. Constructing two model schools based on the new design standards and
          school mapping.

Component 4: Strengthening management capacity in higher education, at system and
institutional levels to support the implementation of Higher Education Strategy 2005-2015,
including:
          •       4.1. Providing technical support to amend and adopt the law on higher
          education and revising the existing by-laws and developing new ones.
          •        4.2. Feasibility study of the financial sustainability of the Kosovo higher
          education system (financing needs, cost-sharing, scholarships and student loans, budget
          allocation mechanisms).
2.     The overall project objective was consistent with the sector issues identified and MEST
policy reforms. Kosovo had just been declared a new state in 2008 and was in the early stages of
building its own institutions. The project objectives reflected a wide range of challenges the
Ministry was confronted with in reforming the education system. While the design was
technically sound and well tailored to the needs of Kosovo, the interventions entailed politically
sensitive processes that required more time and effort in preparing the various constituents and
stakeholders. This risk was not discussed in the Risks Section of the Project Appraisal Document
(Section E). In retrospect, the Project suffered from three fundamental weaknesses: (a) it was
ambitious for the given circumstances of time and existing institutional capacity, (b) the funding
was limited and (c) the four-year implementation period was too short.

3.    Although many changes were introduced in the approach aiming to improve the final
outcome, the Project was not subjected to major revision in its components, and most of the
original activities have been successfully completed with two exceptions: (i) withdrawal of
subcomponent 2.2 (curriculum) because of interest of many other donors to support this
component (the UNICEF and EC are providing support towards this objective); and (ii) partial
achievement of subcomponent 3.3 in which the design and construction of the second model pilot
school (upper secondary) was also withdrawn because of the lack of funding on Government side.

4.    During the life of the Project, there have been several personnel changes. The project dealt
with five different Permanent Secretaries during its six-year implementation period. In addition
there have been changes in the positions of key staff working on IDEP, namely, the Project
Coordinator, the Procurement Specialist and later the Financial Manager, which resulted in



                                                                                               35
significant loss of institutional memory. Loss of momentum in project implementation resulted
from delays in appointing replacements for these staff.

Outcome of the Project against the agreed objectives (in terms of relevance, efficacy, and
efficiency)

 5. The project development objective (PDO). The Project substantially achieved the PDO
 and met or exceeded all seven expected outcomes:

 •   The legal framework for education is amended in accordance with the resolution of the
     Status issues.

 •   The Municipal Education Directorates (MEDs) are able to administer transparent and
     predictable funding formula for schools.

 •   Schools are better equipped with the resources and capacities to improve the quality of
     education.

 •   An adequate institutional framework is developed to address the quality of education issues.

 •   MEST and the Municipal Education Directorates are able to monitor the implementation of
     strategies and to make informed decisions.

 •   Improved planning and implementation capacities for the construction of school facilities
     which are cost efficient and appropriate for new curriculum.

 •   The management procedures and capacities of the Higher Education Department of the
     MEST are improved.


 6. Project achievements with respect to each subcomponent were as follows:

Sub-1.1. Legal framework for pre-university education
       (i) The Law on primary and secondary education clarifying the roles and responsibility of
       each level of the education system (MEST, municipality, school) has been completed; (ii)
       Administrative Instructions (AIs) guiding the implementation of the Law have been
       finalized and approved; The Law on Pre-University Education also establishes the
       foundation for important reforms, such as the school autonomy, financial decentralization,
       teacher qualifications and career development, teacher and school management selections,
       role of assessment and examination, and role of school boards and parents in teaching
       process.

Sub-1.2. School financial autonomy
       (i) The revised and complemented state formula for education-specific grants to
       municipalities has been in use for four years now, and is part of the regular budget
       allocation from central to municipal level for all levels of pre-university education; (ii)
       the municipal-to-school formula has been rolled out at a national level last year and was
       used by the municipal authorities for the school budget allocation for 2014. MEST has
       made several revisions to the formula on the basis of municipality responses to improve



                                                                                               36
       its adequacy; to ensure transparency of the specific education grant formula, MEST and
       MoF have published the criteria on their websites to enable all interested parties to
       understand how each municipality’s specific education grant formula is determined; (iii)
       allocation of budget to the school level has meant an extended financial autonomy at
       school level. Schools, for the first time, received an allocation for recurrent expenditures
       which they could plan and prioritize according to their needs. However, the full
       delegation of financial autonomy for recurrent expenditures has faced considerable
       challenges with municipalities being hesitant to grant financial autonomy to schools and
       allow them to undertake procurement activities due to legislative constraints. The issue
       has been addressed and MEST has got assurance by the Kosovo Procurement Agency
       that the revisions of the public procurement law will enable schools to undertake
       minimum value procurement (EURO 1,000) which will ensure that the legal basis for the
       reform is there and can enable schools and municipalities which may be more advanced
       to take on full autonomy of their budgets when ready.

Sub-1.3. School development grants
       (i) Development grants were awarded to 207 schools; (ii) all schools have received
       training on school development plan and monitoring implementation which was highly
       valued by school management and staff.

       Sub-2.1. Teacher Carrier System
       (i) Pre-service qualification verification and licensing of teachers has been implemented
       and the regional inspectorate departments have been trained and equipped with the skills,
       processes and tools to maintain and update the database; (ii) teacher licensing,
       professional development tools that are linked with career advancement and rewards have
       been developed; (iii) the instruments for teacher assessment have been piloted and
       approved; (iv) the final teacher assessment policy instruments and the AI on teacher
       performance assessment are by-legal documents; and (v) the Teachers Licensing
       Database has been completed 100 % of teachers who have applied. However, there is still
       about 20 percent of teachers missing, because unqualified teachers were excluded from
       the database.

Sub-2.2. Curriculum
       (i) The revision of the existing curriculum has been initiated with the help of technical
       assistance by the project (ii) The plan and the supporting documents for the establishment
       of the Agency for Assessment and Evaluation have been drafted. Because the interest of
       many donors was great on this component the project has withdrawn by letting UNICEF
       and EC take over.
       This subcomponent was dropped from IDEP funding because it is supported by the EC
       and UNICEF.

Sub-2.3. Assessment and Examination
       (i) The Assessment Policy and Assessment Reporting Standards have been developed;
       (ii) the Item Bank has been developed and accepted by MEST; (iii) the instruments and
       the baseline for grade 5 assessment have been developed; (iv) the Matura administration
       criteria and process have been improved; (v) overall capacities of the assessment unit
       have been strengthened, and (vi) support to application in the Program for International
       Student Assessment (PISA) has been provided.



                                                                                                37
Sub-2.4. Educational Management Information System (EMIS)
       (i) EMIS was developed, is operational and continues to help schools enter the required
       data for each academic year; (ii) data collected by EMIS is used for planning specific
       grants for municipalities, statistical analysis which will help in decision-making for
       effective budget planning, strategic planning and analysis of the current situation in
       education; (iii) MoF is using this data to determine the amount of the education-specific
       grant (per capita financing); and (v) a report of Kosovo Education statistics based on the
       2012/2013 school data was produced in May 2013 with the support of UNICEF.

Sub-2.5. Providing project implementation support (PCT operational expenditures)
       (i) Provide financial support for project management operations—salaries of PCT staff,
       procurement and FM training, equipment, consumable materials, etc. There was no such
       subcomponent mentioned in the PAD or the FA. However, the project drafted an
       Activities Plan and the sub-component 2.5 was introduced and renamed “Project
       Management Support” to reflect the activities and expenditures of the PCT. The 2.5 code
       was systematically used in the Procurement Plan and the FM database.

Sub-3.1. School mapping
       (i) The school mapping system is fully operational, providing a complete database of all
       existing schools, including their physical condition and future improvement needs; (ii) all
       schools have been surveyed in accordance with inventory sheets designed by specialist
       consultants; (iii) the information collected is being integrated with EMIS; and (iv) a five-
       year Investment and Maintenance Plan (IMP) has been completed in 2012 covering
       MEST priorities for years 2013-2017.

Sub-3.2. School building standards and norms
       (i) Developed guidelines for school standards and norms, which are being used. These
       guidelines comprised two volumes: General:—dealing with design concepts and general
       principles, facilities and inventory are designed based on the education levels and using
       anthropometrics of school-age children; and Specific:—dealing with interior and exterior
       spaces; (ii) MEST has approved AIs, making these guidelines legally binding to anyone
       designing schools in Kosovo. These guidelines have been applied to the model school
       built under subcomponent 3.3; and (iii) school designs conforming to these guidelines are
       expected to result in more efficient use of space, improved operation due to functional
       design, and reduced maintenance costs in the long term due to the use of durable
       materials and components.

Sub-3.3. Construction of two pilot model schools
       (i) Construction of a basic education school (grades 0-9) with capacity for 720 students
       has been completed and is now fully furnished, equipped and ready operational. MEST is
       pleased with the special features of the building—quality of workmanship and building
       components, functionality, durability, aesthetics, efficient energy consumption, and low
       maintenance.
       The design and construction of an upper secondary school (grades 10-12) was dropped
       because the Government could not secure funds needed for this school and the project
       had limited funding for this component.




                                                                                                38
Sub-4.1. Supporting MEST in developing amendments to the Law on Higher Education
        (i) The new law on Higher Education and necessary by-laws have been amended and
        approved, following a broad consultative process with relevant stakeholders; (ii) key AIs
        required to guide the implementation of the law and ensure its harmonization with other
        education sector legislation have been finalized and approved; and (iii) key reforms,
        including the accreditation of public and private providers of higher education.

Sub-4.2. Strengthening management capacities at MEST level
        (i) Completion of a study on the size and shape of higher education which MEST
        reflected in their higher education strategy.

Efficacy
7.     Despite its funding, IDEP has served as a strong catalyst in addressing a wide range of
education policies with greater efficacy, positioning the project well in ensuring the coordination
of efforts within the various sub-sectors that maximized the results, impact and project efficiency.
The PDO remained highly relevant for Kosovo’s education sector and the Government’s
development priorities for the sector. IDEP played an important role in sustaining the Kosovo
Education Strategy Plan (KESP) 2011-2016. All the IDEP activities were in line with the initial
KESP, including the revised one that developed during the life of the project. Many positive
outcomes resulted from joint efforts to address many of KESP’s strategic objectives by launching
the reforms in a number of sub-sectors. Direct connection of the IDEP activities with KESP
include work carried out through the Project, namely: (a) the new law on pre-university education
and higher education which created a mechanism to ensure the overall sector reform
coordination; (b) school financial autonomy and its implementation; (c) building institutions and
management capacities to promote quality improvements in primary and secondary education
through the establishment of the Teachers’ Licensing mechanism and standards and supporting
quality improvement at school level through the implementation of School Development Grants;
(d) improvement of the educational management information system (EMIS); (e) reducing the
shifts in schools and improving the quality of education; (f) developing school design standards
and norms to promote appropriate design to minimize waste in facilities and enhance the
“learning environment”; (g) demonstrating the new standards and norms by constructing a
“model school” of improved design expected to result in more efficient operation and reduced
school maintenance costs of schools; and (h) and supporting the creation of a better financing
system in higher education.

8.    While the overall relevance of this Project remains high, some of the interventions require
considerable attention and efforts in order to insure sustainability. Many of these interventions
encountered considerable challenges as described below.

Recipient’s own performance during preparation and implementation, with special
emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future

9.     Project ownership. During preparation and later during implementation, the Project enjoyed
strong commitment and support from the Minister of Education, Mr. Enver Hoxhaj, and the
government in general. With the change of the government in 2011, the new Minister, Mr. Ramë
Buja, also continued to provide his strong support. This strong relationship continued with the
visits of the Bank’s high level officials, who expressed strong commitment to the reforms in
education. The Project also contributed to the capacity building of the MEST staff involved in the



                                                                                                 39
activities and helped them to become familiar with new developments in the field of education
and to learn how to implement the reforms under the Project.

10. Administrative changes. During the project life, there were Government reshufflings with
the change of Minister, Deputy Ministers and up to five changes of Permanent Secretaries who
had the role of Project Director. However, as high level officials could not devote the time and
energy needed to act in that capacity because of many reform activities happening at the same
time, the Project suffered delays. The Project complexity compounded to the problem. Given that
project implementation relied heavily on MEST programming and administration, the PCT staff
introduced coordination meetings every two weeks with relevant MEST Departments aiming to
track progress and address issues. Implementation Schedules and the Procurement Plan were
regularly revised addressing necessary repackaging of contracts and often added new activities as
the Project was being implemented.

11. Project Operational Manual (POM): The POM providing a detailed description of
components, criteria and arrangements for the award and implementation of SDGs was not
developed until the third year of implementation. Once in place, the POM served as an effective
implementation tool as well as a management tool tracking project activities.

12. TA Consultancies. The Project relied on a large number of consultancies, foreign and local,
requiring considerable effort in hiring them and managing their contracts, including the logistics
of their activities during their visits. The PCT tried to use existing local technical expertise to the
extent possible and used many local consultancies (about 25) and almost every subcomponent
involved some foreign consultancy (about 20).

13. Disbursements. The disbursement rate was very low until late in the project implementation
due to delays in two major components: SDGs and construction of the model schools to which
about 50% of the total project funds were allocated. The Project leadership took measures to
expedite the implementation of these components aiming to boost expenditures and
disbursements. This proved difficult because original expenditure/disbursement estimates were
based on unrealistic timelines. Implementation plans and disbursement schedules were revised to
reflect an implementation pace in line with available resources.

14. Procurement. Since the start of the Project and throughout the project life, procurement
experienced serious challenges, mainly due to lack of the procurement expertise and lack of
understanding of the Bank’s procedures and requirements. The project has had three procurement
officers, each of which have required significant external support in order to carry on the
procurement processes. Over time, a close collaboration between the PCT and the Procurement
Department of MEST developed, benefiting both parties and the Project. The project faced final
challenge when the procurement specialist left at the final phase of the project when the efforts
were being put in finalizing the construction works on school building and furnishing the school.

15. Financial Management. The task was particularly challenging with initial estimates in US
Dollars converted in SDRs for the purpose of the Grant, but subsequently contracting was in
Euros. The SDR balance was regularly checked to ensure that adequate funds were available to
cover expenditures. The performance of the PCT in financial management was satisfactory in
most respects.

Performance of the Bank during preparation and implementation, including the
effectiveness of their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned

Preparation
16. The project development objectives were clear and focused on outputs and short-term
outcomes. The PAD was well structured with clear information on implementation arrangements
and relationships between various groups. However, the information was provided in the
condensed format of the PAD. The usual Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and package of
working papers (project costs, implementation schedules, and a procurement plan) were not
provided to the counterparts during or immediately after appraisal, and Annex 12 (Documents in
the Project File) does not list such documents.

17. Project Implementation Plan (PIP). In June 2008, with participation from MEST and other
stakeholders, the workshop was organized by the Bank team with support from PCT and Kosovo
Education Center. This workshop formed the basis of a PIP identifying all activities under each
subcomponent, together with their cost estimate, timing, and procurement implications. Similar
efforts were directed towards setting up the procurement activities of the PCT and the
Implementation Schedule for the key Project activities.

18. Support for Project Management. The PAD did not explicitly include a subcomponent in
support of project management—salaries of the PCT staff and other operational expenditures for
core management functions of the PCT. The Project prepared an Activity Plan and proposed a
useful solution by substituting this subcomponent with another titled “Project Support”—
essentially listing the PCT staffing, operational expenditures for the management of the Project
and consultancies for core functions (coordination, procurement, financial management). The 2.5
subcomponent code was used in Financial Management (FM) as well as the Procurement Plan
(PP) for any expenditures relating to project management.

Implementation
19. As a donor and supervisor, the Bank team has always provided its close and intensive
support to the PCT through monitoring, supervision missions, training courses, and on the job
training. The Bank team has demonstrated strong commitment and involvement during the
preparation of the Project and its implementation. The task team leader (TTL) for the Bank was
supported by a local staff and consultants over the period of preparation. The Bank’s team was
successful in gaining the trust of the Government and the Project was critical and extremely
timely in addressing the need for educational reforms in Kosovo.

20. There were four Bank TTLs over the implementation period, all of whom were very
supportive of the Project and made it a priority, whenever needed, to resolve problems and meet
various challenges experienced during implementation.

21. The Bank has worked well with the PCT and the relevant government institutions to
support this Project and find creative ways to improve implementation. The World Bank Country
Office carried out regular project supervision and was involved and dedicated to this Project. The
Bank management supported two extensions of the time period for this project to ensure that all
activities would be completed by the project closing date. MEST worked closely with the MoF on
school autonomy reform, and coordination with Municipality of Prishtina on the Model School
construction to ensure provision of services agreed under an MOU with MEST.

Lessons learned and proposed arrangements for future projects

(a)   The Project was too complex with many subcomponents requiring specific knowledge of
      the subject matter and complex dialogue with MEST and other stakeholders. Simpler
      project design for new states like Kosovo is recommended.
(b)   Significant reprocessing of activities and recalculation of costs was necessary during
      project implementation because of the paucity of background material and working papers
      on the Project. Complete working papers on project costs, implementation schedules,
      activity breakdown, should be part of project preparation.
(c)   The proposed reforms were ambitious with complex political and financial implications in
      a constantly changing political environment that made implementation difficult,
      challenging, and time-consuming. Implementation of policy reforms should be
      programmed in a more comfortable timeframe.
(d)   The Steering Committee, requested in PAD to monitor the project success, although
      established did not proved to be effective and functioning. Instead the project organized
      by-weekly monitoring meetings with relevant MEST Departments involved in the project
      which proved to be much more functional and providing results.
(e)   Implementation that involves the local government to implement the certain project
      activities such as securing land in urban areas where large schools are needed is very
      difficult as well as time-consuming, especially if educational and other social aspects are to
      be met in the process of selection. The issue of site selection should have been addressed
      at the very start of the project and covered with appropriate covenants in the FA.
(f)   Reduce the scope of TA consultancies with more realistic outputs while providing adequate
      support and local counterparts to assist and also benefit from the consultancy. Management
      of as many TA consultancy contracts as demanded under this Project was a great burden
      for the PCT.
