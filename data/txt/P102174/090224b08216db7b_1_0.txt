                         This is the final implementation supervision report for this project.

                         The Institutional Development for Education Project (IDEP) has been under implementation for about six years. The Project was approved by the Board on December 13, 2007, and

                         declared effective on December 14, 2007. The Project start up activities proceeded very slowly, partially due to the change in the Government soon after effectiveness, and political
                         process of independence declaration which diverted the attention of the Government. During the implementation period, the Project has sought to strengthen systems, institutions and
                         management capacities needed for education quality improvements. The achievement of these objectives is measured against five outcome indicators, all of which have been
                         achieved: (i) the reporting of recurrent expenditures by MEST/MFE was improved and is being published yearly; (ii) the teacher licensing system has been established and over 70%

                         of teachers have been licensed; (iii) the baseline of assessment and examination instruments to measure the student learning outcomes at grade 5 is in place; (iv) about 80 % of
                         municipalities are able to report using the EMIS data on the status of dropout and retention, disaggregated by gender and community; and (v) over 60% of school development grant
                         (SDG) recipient schools have produced school improvement plans and monitoring reports.

                         In addition to the achievement of all of its outcome indicators, the following intermediate indicators also point to the Project's contribution to strengthening systems, institutions and
                         management capacities needed for quality improvements:

                         •         In the area of strengthening the organization and financing of the education system: (i) key framework legislation for pre-university and higher education were introduced
                         clarifying the roles and responsibilities for education delivery and accountability; (ii) the revised per-capita funding formula which improves adequacy of funding for pre-university
                         education has been used in the last four years and in 2014 all schools will receive their recurrent budget according to the formula; and (iii) the schools’ capacity and financial
                         autonomy was increased by devolving financial responsibility to schools.

                         •        In in the area of building institutions and management capacity to promote quality improvements: (i) the student assessment mechanism has been established and
                         baselines to monitor learning outcomes are in place; (ii) a system for teacher licensing and career development has also been put in place; and (iii) the EMIS data availability and
                         quality has been improved and data collection is happening four times per year.

                         •        In the areas of creating conditions to introduce efficient and appropriate designs and reduce multiple shifts in Kosovo's schools, the school mapping database and the
                         standards for classroom and school facilities was established, providing critical tools for planning and costing future infrastructure needs and maintenance investments. In addition,
                         the design and construction of the pilot model school is expected to lead more efficient, accessible and student-friendly school environment.

                         In summary, all evidence confirms that the Project strengthened systems, institutions and management capacities at central, municipal and school level needed for education quality
                         improvements. Given the above, the Project is rated as Satisfactory.
