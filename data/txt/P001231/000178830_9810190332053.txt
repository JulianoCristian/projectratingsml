AflODATOAT OF' A rpUTHID K3TfHIUWAV flDATI'
SUMMARY
i.        Most of the road netwcDrk in Kenya was developed essentially Ln a sub-
sidiary role to the railway, particularly to the main railway line from Mombasa
to Lake Victoria and Uganda. The importance or roads, not simply as a means _,
access to the railway, but as trunk routes themselves, was not accepted until
quite recently; the MomDasa-NairoDi road, for example, was not fully paved
until last year, and a paved Tanzania-Kenya-Uganda link is only now being com-
pleted.
ii.       The first major effort to improve the road system began as late as
1959. Since then the Government has followed a generally sound policy of stage
construction, designing roads which were adequate for traffic needs in the first
instance, but which called for successive strengthening and improvement as these
requirements increased.
iii.      Recently, however, the traffic demands on some trunk roads, especially
in terms of vehicle sizes and axle loadings, have outstripped the rate at which
road improvements have been made, with the result that there is now concern at
the extent to which some sections are failing. At the same time, the Roads
Branch of the Ministry of Works (MOW) is finding difficulty in meeting the in-
creased work-load on its organization, and particularly in providing adequate
standards of maintenance for the roads. While finding solutions to these pro-
blems, it is important that the continuing program for improving secondary and
minor roads, particularly agricultural feeder and access roads, should also be
maintained; development of the road system is an essential ingredient in the
expansion of the economy as a whole.
iv.       The proposed project is designed to help the Government to achieve
these multiple objectives: of continued improvement to the secondary road
system, of consolidating and preventing further deterioration of the existing
system, particularly of the trunk roads, and of reorganizing the highway admin-
istration. The individual items included are.
(a)  reconstruction of 288 miles of feeder roads;
(b)  reconstruction and pavement strengthening on 85 miles of
trunk roads;
(c)  construction of 268 miles of roads for the sugar-cane
scheme to the east of Kisumu;
(d)  improvement of 366 miles of access roads in agricultural
settlement areas; and
(e)  consultant services includina supervision of construction.
a study of the MOW by management consultants and some
rdpt.alpe PnoinpPrina.

APPRAISAL OF A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1 . I'Li"RODUCs^I'ON
1.01      The Government of Kenya has requested a loan from the Bank to fimance
a project comprising:
(i) the reconstruction of feeder roads;
(ii)  the reconstruction and strengthening of trunk roads;
(liii) the construction of roads for a sugar-cane scheme;
(iv)  the improvement of farm-access roads in settlement areas;
and
(v) engineering services, including a study of the MOW by
management consultants.
The cost of the project is estimated at US$36.3 million; the Government is re-
questing that an unused balance of Credit 104-KE (Agricultural Roads Project)
estimated at US$800,000 and a new loan from the Bank of US$23.5 million be
granted to meet the foreign exchange component, estimated at US$24.3 million.
1.02      The project is consonant with the aims of Kenya's national develop-
ment plan, its primary purpose being to provide the infrastructure required
for agricultural development generally and for high priority agricultural
projects speciLfically. Its varied content reflects the broad nature of road
development which the plan requires. The project was initiated by the Govern-
ment of Kenya in cooperation with the Bank's Permanent Mission in Eastern
Africa (PMEA).
1.03      This; would be the sixth loan/credit to finance road development in
Kenya, and wouxld be almost as large as the previous five combined. In 1960,
the Bank made a loan (256-KE) of US$5.6 million for agricultural development,
including reconstruction of some roads in the areas in question. In 1964, an
IDA credit (70-KE) of US$4.5 million financed the engineering, construction
and improvement of about 200 miles of highways. In 1965, another credit
(77-KE) of US$3.0 million was made for improvement of about 900 miles of roads
in tea-growing areas, and in 1967, a further credit (104-KE) of US$5.3 million
covered the design, engineering, and construction of about 270 miles of main,
feeder, and f:ield-access roads in suger-growing areas of western Kenya, as
well as the engineering of a further 250 miles of these roads. Most recently,
in June 1968, a credit (120-KE) of US$10.7 million financed the reconstruction
of 285 miles of trunk roads and detailed engineering of a further 266 miles
of feeder roadls. Execution of work under these projects and the performance
of the MOW as executing agency have been, on the whole, satisfactory, though
maintenance of the roads, and indeed of all roads in Kenya, has recently been
a cause for etoneern.



2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Tne Republic of Kenya covers an area of 225,000 square miles, which
is about the same size as France. It lies on the equator, but variations
in altitude provide a wide range of climatic conditions.   More than half the
country, in the north and east, is arid and sparsely populated. The most
attractive areas for settlement are along the coast and in the highlands in
the southwest between Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria, where over half the
total population of ten million lives in one-fifth of the country's total area.
2.02      The economy is largely based on agriculture, which provides about;
38% of total GDP, with subsistence farming still contributing nearly 60% of'
agricultural value added. Even so, coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, meat and
other agricultural products provide about three-quarters of total exports
to countries outside the East African Community which comprises Kenya, Tan-
zania and Uganda. Manufacturing industry has been expanding rapidly in recent
years; industrial exports to countries outside the Community are still quite
small, but they account for three-quarters of total sales to Uganda and Tan-
zania, and are responsible for the large trade surplus earned by Kenya withir
the Community. Another important industry is tourism, which will soon become
the largest single source of foreign exchange. The number of visitors on
holiday has been increasing by some 20% p.a. since independence in 1963.
2.03      Kenya's GNP has recently been growing by about 6% p.a.   With a popu-
lation growth of 3% p.a., per capita income has been rising at a relatively
fast rate, but is still less than US$120 p.a.
B. Transportation
2.04      The heaviest concentration of inland transport facilities and traffiC
is on the 600-mile line from the port of Mombasa to Kenya's western border with
Uganda, passing through Nairobi and the populous southwestern area of the coun-
try (see map). The route is served by road, rail and air services; but for
imports and exports through Mombasa, and indeed for other long-distance bulk
movements, the railway is still the most important carrier. It provides the
principal outlet to the sea for Kenya, Uganda, and even Rwanda and the north-
eastern part of the Congo. The main railway line through Kenya, together with
subsidiary lines feeding into it, accounts for some 1,000 miles of the totEL
3,700 mile system of East African Railways. The joint ownership and operation
of this undertaking as a common service by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda has riot
been affected by the recent creation of separate corporations for railways and
harbors, as institutions of the East African Community.
2.05      The East African Airways Corporation, also owned Aointly by the
three countries, operates international services to Western Europe, West
Africa, the Middle and Far East, and to neighboring countries, as well as
internal services. A number of international airlines call at Nairobi Air-
port, which serves as the ma.tor long-distance air terminal for East Africa.



result, it now appears that virtually all movements of petroleum and aviation
fuels between these cities may soon have transferred to road, and that the
railway will consequently lose more than b 1 million of revenues.
2.10      The consultants believe that the transfer to road of long-distance
bulk traffic such as petroleum and coffee, for which the railway inherently
has a clear competitive advantage, can only result in a substantial waste of
economic resources, which they think could be as high as L 10 million p.a. The
Bank shares this view, and also supports the proposal that, while working to-
wards complete abolition of restrictive road freight vehicle licensing, the
essential corollary is thbat the railway should be allowed to abandon its in-
flexible and out-of-date differential tariff, and should be free to compete
for traffic on equal terms with road.
2.11      Expenditures on road construction and maintenance are financed by'
the Government from general funds. Although specific taxes paid by road vehi-
cle operators are not earmarked for road expenditure, receipts from fuel taxes
and vehicle license fees alone have substantially exceeded expenditures on road
construction and maintenance over the last decade and are expected to continue
to do so. The report of the East Africa Transport Study does not recommend. any
changes that would affect the overall contribution by road users, or propose the
introduction of new types of tax. It does, however, suggest that there would
be less economic distortion if the level of certain specific taxes were alter-
ed. In particular, it is thought that a much higher proportion of revenue
should come from vehicle license fees, especially those levied on heavy trucks,
with offsetting reductions in the tax on diesel fuel. Here again, the Bank's
view is subject to further detailed study of the implications; but the general
objective of reducing any artificial deterrent to the optimum use of vehicles,
and at the same time ensuring that che costs of providing and maintaining the
road system are properly charged to road users and other beneficiaries, is one
that the Bank can firmly support. Implementation of the Study recommendations
will be discussed in connection with the proposed railway project now under
consideration for a Bank loan. (See para. 1.04)

Ithe Borruwe;r tihe BJL,.
C. Planning and Financing
3.06      The Ministry of Economic Development and Planning is responsible for
deciding the overall size of the highway program; in exercising that responsi-
bility, it works closely with the MOW. Tne Roads Branch is responsible for
decisions on individual projects, taking into account views of other Ministries
and of provincial and local bodies. Projects finally agreed upon by the Minis-
try of Economic Development and the MOW are then incorporated in the national
development plan. A variant of this procedure is adopted in the case of "cap-
tive" roads, such as tea roads, sugar roads, and tourism roads, associated with
specific development programs of the Ministries. Such roads are sponsored
directly by the Ministry concerned and the MOW is involved only with technical
aspects of design and construction.
3.07      FLnancial and executive responsibility for trunk road construction
is vested in the central Government and that for secondary roads in local au-
thorities (County Councils), although in practice these authorities receive
some financLal assistance from Government; responsibility for construction on
all other roads is vested in local authorities and the whole cost of construc-
tion is met by them from local revenues. Trunk road maintenance is financed
by Government but is usually carried out by local authorities. Maintenance of
all other roads is financed and executed by local authorities. Central Govern-
ment expendLture on the highway system over the past 10 years is shown in Table 3.
3.08      In recent years Government has looked to external sources for financ-
ing new construction. In the past decade, external assistance for this purpose
has totaled about US$67 million equivalent; of this total, US$26 million (40%)
was made available by the Bank Group, US$14.5 million by 'contractor-finance,
US$9 million by the British Government, US$5.3 million by USAID/African Develop-
ment Bank, a like amount by the Government of Italy, US$4.5 million by the Govern-
ment of the Federal Republic of Germany, and US$2.7 million by the'Government of
Norway. Funds for Kenya's contribution to capital cost are provided from bud-
getary sources.
D. Road Development Plan 1968-73
3.09      The road development plan for the period 1968-73 of which the proposed
project forns an integral part reflects the increasing tempo of development in
Kenya. The program includes the improvement of 1,000 miles of trunk roads and
3,000 miles of secondary and other roads, at a total estimated cost of about US$90
million.  This road program, for the most part, was reviewed in the report of
the recent Bank Economic Mission to East Africa (AF58a, August 31, 1967), and



ON'
F. Highway Construction
3.15      Hig1hwVy construction is carried out, for the most part, by contract.
Major works in recent years have been awarded both to large local fI'rms xnd to
foreign firnms with branches in Kenya;  smaller works, notably isolated bridge
construction, have generally been awarded *:o small local contractors. Contract
work is on El unit price basis. contracts being awarded after international com-
petitive bidding.  Qualification and bidding procedtres of the mlOW. its hanc.ing
of contracts and its dealings with contractors, are considered satisfactory.
3.16      Non-contract work is carried out by the National Youth Service., by
local councils and by the MOW;s construction units.   These units have carried
out a considerable amount o- work and have recZntly completed the paving of
the Nairobi-Mombasa Road; however, they appear to suffer from many of the
defects frequently met in departmental working, such as a lack of realistic
costing and a standard of workmanship lower than that normally required of
contractors.  The proposed projec' includes departmental work only on the im-
provement of settlement roads, and there are safeguards to ensure that this
work will be adequately supervised and properly costed.
G.  Highway Maintenance and Traffic
3.17      The Government is obligated under previous Bank/IDA projects to main-
tain the public road system adequately. Maintenance in earlier years was satis-
factory but in the past year or so the standard, particularly on paved roads,
has deteriorated. Lack of staff at senior levels and of expertise at foreman
and lower levels has undoubtedly been a contributing factor. The Roads Branch,
while acknowledging the personnel difficulties, contends also that maintenance
budgetary allocations are insufficient; this cannot be proved until the allocat-
ed funds are used effectively.   Road maintenance practices, their financing,
accounting, and organization are currently being studied by the management con-
sultants. During negotiations assurances with respect to maintenance of the
road system were renewed and assurances were also obtained that the Government
will implement agreed improvements in the maintenance organization and practices
of the MOW arising from review and discussion of the findings of the current
study.
3.18      The deterioration of paved roads has been &ccelerated by allowing
vehicles to operate outside the Traffic Rules relating to weights and dimen-
sions. In November 1967, a legal notice was published which specifically
exempted 176 heavy vehicles from these Rules.   The vehicles were already licens-
ed and operasting in Kenya; apparently the intention was to recognize that mis-
takes had been made in inrterpreting the law, and to legalize the position as
far as these vehicles were concerned, while allowing no more vehicles of similar
specification to enter the country.   Others were subsequently authorized, however,
to operate with a reduced load, but this condition is ignored in practice; it
is Drobable that there are now some 400 vehicles in the country with design ca-
pacities in excess of the loads permitted by the Traffic Rules. It has been
found fo-r examnle that petroleum tankers in this group have been operating with
a loading of 26,000 lbs on a single axle, well outside the legal maximum of
17 ,60 1h.



4. THE PRf)JECT
A.   General- Descriptign
4.0l      The pro'ec+ comprise4 :
()reconstzructior. of 18 -e+ion   of- feeder roads, totalling
about 288 miles; 131 miles to be constructed to a paved
sotD6an.dad-, theC remaind.a er er avell,ed;
(ii)  reconsruc'-'on and pavement strengthering of five sectons
of trunk roads, totalling 85 miles;
(iii) construction of roads in Phase II of the sugar road program,
totalling 23 Mles of main roads an,d 245 m"iles of .eeder!
field-access roads;
(iv) improvement to gravel standard of about 366 miles of roads
in settLemenb6 areas;
(v)  detailed engineering of two sections in (i), one section
in (ii), a consultants' report and investigation on (iv),
and the supervision oI all construction by consultants; auid
(vi)  a study of the MOW by management consultants and the imple-
mentation of recommendations.
B.   The Feeder Roads (Annex 1, Table 4 and Map)
4.02      Feeder road reconstruction, which represents about one-half of the
proposed prcject, is the logical complemerit to the trunk road reconstruction
which formedt the basis of the most recent highway project, (Credit 120-KE).
That project, included the detailed engineering of 14 sections of feeder
roads; the proposed project includes the reconstruction of those sections,
and of four more. All are essential to the agricultural development of
specific areas.
4.03      Of the 18 roads selected, one (Ngombeni-Kwale) is at the coast,
two (Maiyani-Nunguni, and Mwingi Bridge and approaches) are in the rather
arid areas between Nairobi and the coast, and the remainder are in the fer-
tile area between Nairobi, Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria. One (Jamji-Sotik)
is already paved, but only to a single width and on a bad alignment; the
remaining roads are gravel standard of varying geometric quality and riding
surface.
4.04      Tvo of the roads (Uplands-Longonot Turnoff and Kerugoya-Kagumo)
were reconstructed to a fully-engineered gravel standard under Loan 256-1CE,
and under the proposed project will be paved. The remaining roads have gene-
rally low-standard geometry, are frequently below ground level and thus dif-
ficult for vehicles in the rains; all will be improved to a fully-engineered
standard, and gravelled or paved, according to the traffic volume.



- 13 -
(iv) Mau Summit-Eldoret ("E" - 16 miles)
4.12      The section proposed for reconstruction is that between Burnt Forest
and Eldoret. on which traffic is currently about 450 vpd. Reconstruction will
be similar to that in (iii) above.   The Mau Suvmit-Eldoret road, while pro-
viding access to the productive Eldoret and Ki ale areas of northwest Kenya,
is also part of the trunk road to Uganda, the reconstruction of which, from
Eldoret to the Ugandan border, is currently being financed by US AID/African
Development Bank.
D.   The Sugar Roads (Table 7 and Map)
4.13      SugELr road construction included in the project represents Phase II
(the second and final phase) of the development of road infrastructure for the
sugar-cane scheme, located east of Kisumu.   The first phase is currently under
construction aLs part of the Agricultural Roads ProJect (Credit 104-KE) and is
scheduled to be completed by late 1969.
4.14      PhaEse II consists essentially of construction of additional roads,
engineering of which was carried out under Phase I, totalling 23 miles of iain
roads and 245 miles of feeder/field-access roads. The sugar-cane area is cha-
racteritpd by hiahlv plastic clays, which are verv susceptible to moisture
changes, and by almost-daily rainfall; because of-this the main roads in Phase
II will be paved=  The geometry selected for the main roads. for example a
pavement width of 20-22 ft, reflects the need to accommodate heavy traffic,
particularly multi-trailer units carrving cane. The feeder/field-access roads
will be unpaved and to lower geometric standards.   These standards for Phase II
construction ee similar ton those adopted in Phase T.
r4rr&v.e Justification for%v further istment in these roads presuDDoses
effective management of the entire scheme. The Miwani and Chemelil operatLons
appear to have adequate m.anagement, but the M1_horoni scheme has encountered
serious managerial problems both at the factory and in the field. Sugar pro-
duction on the whole is s4till inefficient and maJor efforts are being made to
improve harvesting, transportation and processing of cane. The monthly ton-
nages harvested -nd transported from the Mulhoroni area doubled between October
1968 and Marchl 1969. Also, many improvements at the factory in power supply
ad l ayout havre   --cre^ed processing c-pacity _nA Affinieney.  The nresent evi-
dence points toward resolution of the problems at Muhoroni in the foreseeabDle
fut-ae .  (e e A-- .re  2.
4.16      Phase II roads are proposed for four separate sugar zones:   the
Chemelil, Miwtni and Muhoroni Cooperative zones, and the Settlement Scheme
area.  In the Chemelil zone, Phase I roads are presently under construction
and the second phase is necessary to complete the network; in the settlement
area, 3,400 acres of cane have been Planted on the understandinz that roads
would be constructed or improved; in the Miwani and Muhoroni Cooperative zones,
the Government-sponsored planting program has not yet begun, although aboul;
1,000 acres have in fact been planted by the farmers themselves.   The Kenya
Agriculture Department and the factory managers agree that development of
these latter two zones, totalling about 10,000 acres, is essential if the
Miwani and Muhoroni factories are to onerate at their nlanned capacity



4.23      Certain aspects of thr consultants' draft final report were di3--
.usqed'l durixig 'th'e negotiations buut the fi;;all report was not wvaillable- in time-
for discussion. However, the Government agreed to take all necessary action
to implemen-t the organizational recommendations rade by the consultants nd
agreed by the Borrower and the Bank. The Kenya Delegation indicated that the
Government wo-uld submit a se-arate loan application ifn respect of highway
maintenance equipment in the near future.
G.   Cost Estimate and Foreign Exchange Component
4.24      The cost of the project, including allowances for contingencies, is
estimated a=t US$36.3 million with a foreign exchuage comuponent estimated at
approximately US$24.3 million.   The cost estimate is shown in broad terms
below, and in greater detaLl in Table 9.

4.25      Costs for the proposed works on feeder and trunk roads have been
estimated by applying unit rates, based on 1968 contract prices for similar
work (mainly as part of the Second Highway ProJect, Credit 120-KE), to sched-
ules of quantities derived from detailed engineering, allowance being made for
price escalation between 1968 and the estimated time of bidding. Costs for
the proposed Phase II Sugar Road program have been similarly estimated but using
prices based on the more relevant contract for Phase I work, awarded in mid-
1Q67. The cost of settlement road improvement has been talken as the net cost
to Government of imported equipment plus the estimated site cost of running
the special MOW units (para. 4.32).
4.26      E)gineering and supervision of works on feeder ancl trunk roads have
been estimated at 4.5% and 6% of works cost, respectively. These rates are based
on current experience in Kenya for this tvpe of work.    Supervision of Phase IT of
the Sugar Road program has been assessed at 4.25% of construction cost; this

4.34      Detailed engineering of feeder roads Nos. 3 and 6 and one trunk
road is included in the project; this hlas been carrIed out by East AiricaIn
Engineering Consultants (Kenya) and Edwards and Burrow (Kenya) respectively.
Supervision of all the auove work will be carried out by the two consu1.iLng
firms mentioned above and by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (UK).
4.35      The total cost of the project, including allowances for contin-
gencies, is estimated to be about US$36.3 million, out of which the Gove:rn-
ment has asked the Bank to finance the foreign exchange component, estimated
at US$24.3 mnillion, or about 67%.  It is proposed that the project be financed
in part by reallocation of the balance of Credit 104-KE (Agricultural Roads
Project) estimated at about US$800,000 and in part by a new loan of US$23.5
million.
4.36      Retroactive financing by the Bank of approximately US$300,000 (slightly
more than 15 or tne proposed loan) is recommended; this amount is shared, approxi-
mately eoually, between (i) the consultants' report on settlement roads, (ii)
the preliminary engineering for Phase I settlement road improvement, (ii1)
the engineering of feeder roads Nos. 3 and 6 and (iv) the study of MOW by
management consultants.
4.37      The project is scheduled to be completed by late 1973.    Local cur-
rency costs will be financed from the national budget. Annual requirements of
foreign currency, based on the MOW's schedule of construction, will be as
follows:

5.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Oener 1
50        The purpose of the prc_ect is as follows:
(I.) Uo continue a. prl.gram OI ieeder roaa improvement essentiai.
for agricultural development;
(ii)  to reconstruct and strengthen specific trunk roads built
initially with lightly-designed pavements, but now, with
increasing traffic, showing signs of failure;
(iii)  to comolete the road system essential to individual sugar--
cane and settlement schemes; and
(iv) to define and imr,lement measures necessary for effective
highway administration.
The benefits to be expected from the items included in the project are best con-
sidered in terms of the four broad groups of trunk, feeder, settlement, e,nd
sugar roads.
5.02      The proposed reconstruction of trunk road sections is required essen-
tially to stop further deterioration which would soon disrupt the country's
main road network and have serious and unacceptable consequences for the econo-
my as a whole.  The question here is not that this should be avoided, but whe-
ther the best means for doing so is by reconstructing these sections, or by con-
tinuing with piecemeal maintenance and patching of the failures as they occur.
Comparison with this alternative suggests that the overall cost advantages of
reconstructing them at this time would yield an incremental return of the order
of 16%.
5.03      For the feeder roads, a major consideration is the reduction in
vehicle operating costs allowed by the improvements, and the value of increases
in general traffic they are expected to encourage. These benefits are al.so im-
portant in the case of the settlement roads, but for these another important
and more specific benefit will be the additional value of milk and other perish-
able products which cannot now be marketed. in the absence of reliable all.-weather
road access.
5.04      For the sugar roads, the erohasis is on new roads that are necessary
before cane in some areas can be moved from the field to the factory, and. the
benefits are in terms of the net additional value attributed to the cane. The
total benefits from all these sources are estimated to offer a return of about
20% from the overall works proposed for feeder, settlement and sugar road.s.



would only be strengthened. It is also true that the benefits from preserving
the roads, in terms of preventing the serious disruption to Kenya's economy
that would otherwise result, are such as to offer an extremely high return in
relation to the sums involved in the proposed reconstructiorn.
D. The Sugar Roads
5.09      Phase I of the sugar roads is now largely complete.   The roads pro-
posed under Phase II would serve the Miwani Cooperative zone (4,500 acres),
Muhoroni Cooperative zone (5,000 acres), Chemelil Cooperative zone (a total of
11,000 acres, of which production from about 5,000 acres can be attributed to
Phase II roads), and The Fort Ternan and Koru settlement schemes (4,200 acres).
Over half the total area has already been planted with cane. Construction of
Phase II roads is considered necessary if the three factories in the area are
to operate at their planned capacityr of 6.000 tons of cane per day.
5.10      Appraisal Report No. TO-575a, dated April 26, 1967, contained an ana-
lysis of the economic Justification for both the phases planned for road con-
struction as part of the total lnvestment proposed for developing the sugar
areas and providing the new factories and necessary transportation facilities.
The conclusion was that the net value of sugar production, after deducting the
real economic costs of the operation, was sufficient to yield a return of 11%
on the overall investment. The position now is that, with nearly all the other
investment inputs now committed, some 45% of the feeder and access roads, and
35% of the main roads, remain to be constructed under Phase II.
5.11      The cane growing area which would be served by Phase II roads totals
about 18,700 acres, yielding apnroximately 330 thousand tons of cane per year,
or 31,500 tons of made sugar. At the present price of sugar (L46 per ton),
the gross value of the sugar attributable to Phase II roads is .1.45 million.
Deducting production costs associated with this additional output (See details
in Table 15), the net value of sugar is L388,000. Capital costs including
roads and land preparation would total about L2.3 million. Over a period of
15 years, the return on investment would be about 15%. This rate of return
is relatively high due to the fact that Phase II roads represent only a small
addition to the large investment already sunk in sugar projects overall (Table 14).
E. The Settlement Roads
5.12      The settlement schemes were developed between 1962 and 1966 after
Government purchase of large-scale E.uropean farms, principally in the revion
between the Rift Valley and the Aberdares, to the west of Nairobi, and in the
Sotik area. The land was converted into plots of between 10 and 70 acres and
offered to indigenous farmers with the aid of thirty-year loans.
5.13      The road networks qriginally conceived for the settlement schemes
were fairly adequate, but lack of finance curtailed their actual construction,
and the almost total lack of subsequent maintenance has led to serious deterior-
ation in those that were completed.   Virtuallv all the access roads -re now sub
tandard even during the dry season; most of them are impassable in wet weather,

6. REC0MMENDATI0NS
6.01      The project is well conceived, technically and economically
sound, and no major problems are anticipated during execution. The fol-
lowing principal points were agreed with the Government during negotiations.
The Government agreed -
(i) to take the necessary action to implement the recommendations
made by the management consultants and agreed by the Borrower
eLnd the Bank (para. 3.05);
(ii)  to provide the funds, facilities, services and resources
required for the execution of the Road Development Plan
and consult with the Bank with respect to any major
additions thereto (para. 3.09);
(iii) to take all necessary action to implement and enforce
its traffic rules and regulations designed to restrict
operation of vehicles to the geometric and structural
sctandards of the Borrower's road system (paras. 3.12 and
3.19). 
(iv) t;o submit to the Bank for agreement proposals for the
expansion of research in road design and construction
(para. 3.13);
(v) to prepare a detailed road register and record relevant
statistical material (p-ra. 3.14!i and,
(vi)   o estali    a.nd ma4ntain separate accotnts for costing
of settlement road construction by MOW units (para. 4.33).
6.02      The project provides an acceptable basis for Bank Group finan*-
cing In the amount of tt&hV*   3 million, i.cluding a loan of US$23.5 million
to the Government of Kenya, repayable over 25 years, with a ten year period
of grace.  Thne proposed amortIzation and grace periods are recommended for
national economic reasons. The remaining $800,000 would be provided by a
balance of the same amount in Development Credit NO'--KV,

KENYAl - THIRD HIGHITAY PROJECT
Description of Individual Feeder noads
(Mileages cuoted refer to existing alignments)
(i) Ngombeni-Kwale (No. 1-14 miles)
This road leaves the coastal route five miles south of Mombasa anrd
runs -nland to Kwale, an -ainlstrative center in the fertile Shimba Hills.
It forms part of the main route to Tanzania and currently carries about
250eo     u+ ;n+v o tiol       trff  hA 1 e diverted to a new coastal route
C.JOw Vrped  fA -f , b1   £Ser ltioa  traffi %ri             -- 
after construction of the Msambweni-Lunga section under Credit 120-KE. The
local traffic onhe        sect-_or is c '+rrenty+ abou,t 170 vpd=
'zle e, sstir.g roadI crosses flat terra-4n r.ear the coast and then
rises 1,50() feet to Kwale across three escarpments.  The alignment is fre-
quently steep, winding ard sunk-en below groundd level; the heavy red soil
produces tlhick dust in the dry season and heavy mud in the rains.
The project provides for improvement to a fully-engineered gravel
standard. The proposed aligiMent -will be 2.. i-,les shorter t'han at present,
but the new junction with the paved coast road will be some four miles fur-
ther from Mombasa. An economic returnl of 19% is estimated for thAe improvement.
(ii)  iVInwyi Bridge and Approaches (No. 2-7 Imiles)
This is a difficult section of the Nairobi-Garissa road (the main
road to the north-east of the country and Somalia) some 90 miles east of'
Nairobi, whlere the Mwingi River cuts through the Yatta Pliateau. The road
crosses the river on a causeway which is overtopped and impassable for months
at a time during the rains, and which frequently s-uffers structur-al damage
from flood waters.
To eliminate closures during the flood season, the project includes
construction of a four-span steel girder bridge, the best site for whichl is
upstreamIfrom the causeway. The precipitous approaches will be improved,
and a six-mile section of the road realigned to provide a better route to
the proposed crossing down the escarpment on the western side. The new
alignment, which will be one mile shorter, will be constructed to a fuliy--
engineered gravel standard. A return of about 11% is estimated.
(iii) nLaiNuW          (o.31.5mls
Nunguni, a focal point for the productive farming areas in the
"(ilungu HiLUs some 50 miles south-east of Nairobi, is linked to the recently-
;a ci c airobi-Mombasa road near Mai:yani by e traok which i- difficult elven in



ANNEX 1
Page 2
dry weather due to steep grades and hair-pin curves. As a result most Df
the Nunguni-Nairobi traffic follows an alternative route, through Machakos,
which includes a 30-mile low-standard section between Machakos and Nunguni.
The proposal is to construct a new link from Nunguni to the Mombasa
road which, in view of the steep grades that will still be encountered in the
hilly terrain, will be paved. The cost of engineering will be included in
the project. Improved running conditions and, in particular, the better
routina of traffic are estimated to offer a return as high as 26% on the
construction outlay.
(iv)  Ena-Thuchi (No. 4-11 miles); Meru-Nkubu (No. 5-14 miles)
These are the end sections of the former Ena-Meru trunk route across
the 91 opes onf Mount Kenya. This is a difficult road, characterized by num-
erous sharp re-entrants where the alignment crosses watercourses, but it
proirdes access to a rich and highly-populated agricultural area.  The new
Ena-Meru trunk road, financed to a gravel standard under Loan 256-KE, is
further east on the plain, and serves a different area locally.
The project pro.vides for both sections to be imnroved to a fully-
engineered standard; in view of current traffic volumes, they will both be
paved.  The new alignments will result in considerable route shortenings,
three miles on the Ena-Thuchi section, and five and a half miles on the
Meru-Nkzubu section. The high economic returns expected, 27% and 30% res-
pectively, reflect these route shortenings.
The Ena-Thuchi section is a continuation of the Embu-Ena road which
is being   ed wnder Credi 1O(eVI.' T.h s+-w lstter, nn i   is a nontinuation
-LSwengi:ve( A uJ.rU der CreditL U10KE.  b- S  n- t~ te I- .-_ - ---
of the Sagana-Embu section, reconstructed and paved under Credit 70-KE. After
the proposed improvement, the section between Thuchi and Nkubu will be the
only unpaved length in a 200-mile road development encircling Mount Kenya,
wuh-illn w       eenve ieerua-cedu 1argelyby the Ba  Group.
(v) Nyeri-Inururu (No. 6-5 mLiles)
The road fromr lNyeri to Ibururu is the first section of a route
crossing the Aberdare Range. It leads to the Aberdare National Park, an
area witn considerable attractions for tourists, but most of the traffic on
the first section is either local to Nyeri or generated by the prosperous
farming and timber activities in this area. The exist-ing road is sunken. and
difficult for vehicles during the rains, and the project provides for recon-
struction to a fully-engineered paved standard on a new alignment that will
be one mile shorter. A return of 20% is estimated.
(vi)  Fort Hall-Kiriaini (No. 7-19 miles)
I'his section forms part of the original road between Nairobi and
Nyeri, following the top of a "spine"l leading from the east flank of the
!,berdare Range; but after being replaced by the more direct Nairobi-Nyeri
rlunk route through flatter country between the Aberdares and Mount Ker,ya,



ANNEX 1
Page T
it has served as a local road for the agricultural communities which were
already established in the area. The "spine" alignment reduces drainage
problems, but is winding, while the running surface is generally below ground.
level and difficult for vehicles in the rains.
The project provides for improvement to a fully-engineered gravel
sta-ndard, with a route shortening c'f onre mile.  The estimated return is 13%.
(si)  1lnds=-Lon.onot DTuroff (.t.8-18- miles)
The road fT r om, NIairobi alorg the top of eaist wal of th   ft Valley
is paved as far as Uplands, some 20 miles northwest of the capital. From
Up'ands the road leads northwards to Longonot Tr.off, poviding an outlet
for the agriculture in that area and access to major settlement schemes in
the Kirnagop area. Most of tle section -was constructed to gravel sandard
under Loan 256-KE, and the geometry of the alignment is generally satisfactory,
but its construction has encouraged rapid develop,,en't locally, particularly
of market gardening, which is stimulated by the proximity of Nairobi. Its
traffic has now grown to a level which makes driving difficult over- the uuutj
volcanic ash surface, and increases maintenance problems. A return of about
14% is estimated for the proposed bitumen paving on the existing alignm3nt.
(viii) Gilgil-Ol Joro Orok (No. 9-24 miles)
This section is part of the road from Thomsonis Falls wnich feeds
into the nain Nairobi-Nakuru-Kisumu road at Gilgil in the Rift Valley, pass-
ing through an area of large-scale farming and through some of the most
successful settlement schemes in Kenya; many of the settlement roads included
in the project are located in this area. The existing road traverses the
difficult Rift Valley escarpment Lmmediately outside Gilgil and then follows
an easier alignment on the plateau to 01 Joro Orok; the continuing section to
Thomson's Falls is already paved.
The proposal is to realign the seven-mile escarpment section, and
to pave thLe road throughout. A return of 18% is estimated.
(ix)  Noro-Mau Summit (No. 10-25.5 miles); Njoro-Enangipiri (No. 11-35 mT1c`
These two roads, which cross the west wall of the Rift Valley a few
miles west of Nakuru, serve some of the best agricultural land in Kenya,
including major wheat-growing and sheep-raising areas. The Enangipiri road
also serves the Masai lands beyond, which offer agricultural potential that
is extensive but so far mostly unexploited. The road alignments, following
those of earlier tracks, are generally sub-standard, especially on the
escarpment; the riding surface is frequently below ground level and drainage
is consequently poor. Soils on both sections are of fine volcanic ash, which
gives rise to thick dust in the dry season and heavy mud in the rains.
The project provides for complete reconstruction, including paving,
of the Njoro-Mau Summit sec-ti nn  ThA Nioro-Enangipiri section will be recon-
;ltructed to two standards according to traffic volume; eight miles from Njoro



ANNEX 1
Page 1W
to Teret, where traffic is heavy, will be paved, but the remaining 27 miles
will be fully-engineered to a gravel standard. Njoro is already connected
to Nakuru by a paved road, thus the lengths now proposed for improvement will
represent two further unbroken extensions of all-weather routes from this
important city. The estimated returns are 13% for Nioro-Mau Summit; 22% for
Njoro-Teret (where traffic is expected to be about 580 vpd in the first year
of benefits), and 1% for Teret-Enangipiri.
(x) Jamji-Sotik (No. 12-25.5 miles)
This section is not strictly a feeder road! it forms part of the
Kericho-Sotik-Kisii trunk route, a major artery in the tea-growing area
around Kericho. (Owing to the heavy rainfall in this region (up to 80 in
per annum), this was the first rural road in Kenya to be paved, but financial
restrictions at the time led to the adontio-n of Sinale-Ine tzXrinn and sub-
standard geometry.  For modern vehicles and current traffic levels, the road
is dangerouns
The nroposed investment is to provide a D_-widtn pavemrnt onV an
alignment which will be four miles shorter. Two dangerous single-width
brirges oni the exi.sting road are already beiing replaced by twolne str-uc-
tures on the new alignment under Credit 120-KE.
The single-lane paving and gravel shoulders have deteriorated to
such an extent that for purposes of econoMic anailysis the eist±ing roac las
been classed as equivalent to a G4 gravel road (see Annex 3). On this basis,
the proposed improvement is expected to ofer a return of 24%.
(xi)  RiLi-Tir.ga Junction and iNIanga Spur (No. 13-13 miles)
TLis roau proviLdes access for an intensive farming area in the
Kisii Highlands to the market center of Kisii and, additionally, serve;
tea roads constructed under Credit 77-&ri. The road, which has developed
from a cart track- crosses an escarpment immediately outside Kisii on EL
diffic-ult alignment and then passes through rolling country on the top of
the highlands. The volcanic rocks provide a ready supply of road-building
materials, but the soils are clay and difficult for traffic in the moderate-
ly heavy rainfall (60 in. per annum).
The project provides for improvement to a fully-engineered gravel
standard. The benefits from this work offer an estimated return of '15 for
the first three-mile section, which also serves another spine road to lNanga,
and of 17% for the remaining nine-mile section.
txii) -ioma Bay - Kendu Bay (No. 14-19.5 miles)
This road developed from a track near the shore of Lake Victoria,
linking the trading centers at Homa and Kendu. These towns are separated by
a large peninsula extending into the Lake, which increases the attraction
of land transport between them compared with that of lake transport. Traffic
from Kendu to the regional center, Kisumu, formerly used the lake, but with

the improvement of the Kendu Bay-Oyugis road (Loan 256-KE) and of the Qylugis-
Ahero roadi (Credits 70-KE and 120-KE) it now passes by road. This in turn
has stimulated the growth of road traffic between Homa and Kendu. The presenrt
road is on a poor, sunken alignment across areas of heavy black soil. It
intercepts a large surface-water flow into Lake Victoria and is subject1 to
frequent and severe flooding.
The project provides for improvement to a fully-engineered grxLVel
standard. The drainage requirement across the road will be rmieti by providing
five smaLL bridges and by setting the embankment crest at a height which wall
allow extensive but shallow Ov .r-topping,   dur-g ex"reme flood fElows. "i.e
improvement is expected to offer a return of 12%.
(xiii) Kakamega-Numias-Mayoni (No. 15-25.5 miles); Mulwanda-Mumias,
MaXoni-Bungom.a (r!o 16-28.5 4 r- les)
The Kakamega=4Iayone and Mul'Wanda-Dungoria roads, which have a common
three-mile Mumias-Mayoni section, form part of the road network in a h:Lghly
producti.ve agricul7tu-l area north-west of Knisum*u  The Kakamega-i4ayon'.
section follows the line of one of the oldest roads in Kenya, developed in
the early years of' the century as part of the route from the coast to ljganda;
the aligmnent is poor, and the running surface is generally below groiud leveL.
The Mullwana.A-Bungoma section serves the same area, running at right angles to
the Kakamega-Mumias section. At Mulwanda it links with the paved road to
Kisumu (reconstructed under Credit 70-KE); at the northern end Bungoma is
situated on the main railway line, and on the trunk road between Nairobi and
Uganda, recently paved under a project financed by the African Developinent
Bank.
The project provides for both roads to be reconstructed to a fully-
engirneered gravel standard. Two bridges (100 ft and 70 ft spans) will be
required on the Kakamega-Mumias section and three on the Mulwanda-Bungoma
road, including a 150 ft structure across the Nzoia River. The estimated
returns are 15% for Kakamega-Nayoni, 25% for Mulwanda-Mumias (where there
-will be a 25% route shortening) and 15% for Mayoni-Bungoma.
(xiv) Kerugoya-Kagumo (No. 17-3 miles)
Tnis section, wMhich is part of the Kutus-Nyeri cross-country link
on the southern slopes of Mount Kenya, was reconstructed to gravel standard
under Loan 256-KE. It is an extension of the Kutus-Kerugoya section, .ur-
rently being paved under Credit 120-KE. At Kagumo a spur road gives azcess
to Kangeita where a large tea factory and an important tea nursery are
located.
The project provides for paving on the existing alignment. With
traffic expected to amount to 400 vpd by the time construction is completed,
a return of 21% is estimated.

T'he improvement of this section was originally conceived as part of
a plan to improve the link between the Kapsabet-Eldoret road (now being paved
under Credit 120-KE) and the naved road connection to Kisumu under construi-
tion throLgh the sugar area south of the Nandi Hills (Credit 104-KE). At
present there is insufficient evide-nce to si nrt. e-Yensif  i.rnryiefmpnt. of
the section traversing the escarpment between Nandi Hills and the sugar area,
Rec.onstruction o-f the 13.-mle northe^rn section from NandA. Hilq to Kapsabnt
is justified, however, in its own right by traffic movements, principally
ton the m.nrket an.d railhead at Eldoret. WiJ.+1,o-A +vk- acourt of an.y 1-lnlr
improvements to the south, a return of 18% is estimated from the proposed

KENYA THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
The Kenya Sugar Industry
Prodiuction of sugar in Kenya is centered mainly round three factories -
liwani. ChemeLil and Muhoroni - near Kisumu to the northeast of Lake Victoria.
The sugar roads to be provided under the project are located in this area.  There.
iS' a fourth fnntorv on thA coast at 1R-nisi. Total annual production of sugar is
a.)out 86,000 1tons of iwhich some 66,000 tons come from Miwani, Chemelil and Muhorcoi
' ee Table 14) agannst- ann1ial eonsel-tion of some 110;000  Tt is estimated that i-r
MO970 consumption will have increased to about 170,000 tons a year and that this w.^:Lu
be met by the planned output of the exist;ng factories.
oiand heTi ani               ha been     operaton fr many yeas, whereas the
.AIhoroni and Chemelil factories have been recently established. Both Muhoroni and
. 1,%Iae..l factories have encaWntered proble.s which ray be partly teething troubles
common to new enterprises but they have also met special difficulties in cane
transportation, partly due to an inadequate road system. and difficulties o' road
eonstruction and cane transport in black cotton soils.  In the Muhoroni area there
nave Ueen diffiCult prOblemis of. settlemient ar.d Lin fLc m  of wle so=cal6e,d
settlers appear to be absentee plot holders.
3.        Apart from problems of establishing and getting into efficient operation
large new processing units and developing new areas of cane, properly provi.ded witJh
transportation facilities to serve the factories, the Kenya sugar industry has basic
tnroblems which stem from the fact that the relations between sugar growers, rnillers
.ad Government have never been put on a proper basis.  The sugar industry i.s in
tact far from efficient in comparison with sugar growing areas such as Australia,
'a.waii, South Africa, the West Indies and Mauritius.  In countries where the sugar
industry is important and well organized, the relationship between growers, millers
wrnd Government is normally defined in agreements and under legislation and it is
often necessary for governments to regulate producer and consumer prices for sugar.
i.epresentatives of millers and of growers are usually organized in associations
mid agreements as to cane prices, milling margins, sugar prices etc. are worked
oult by negotiation and are kept under continuous review, so as to ensure adequate
:1acentives for growers and millers, while protecting the interests of the consumers.
In these respects the arrangements that exist in Kenya are rudimentary and unsatis-
factory. Whether or not the price fixed for sugar in Kenya of QI6 per ton is
;-ppropriate, the net income to settlers after deducting harvesting, factory and
c.;tivation costs, management and establishment levies, and county council cess,
G(Dears to be too low to offer them the incentive that they need.
Because of the haphazard way in which the sugar industry in Kenya has
*..oveloped and the fact that sugar has not been regarded-as a really important crop,
's, industry is relatively inefficient compared with the world's major cane growing
;e~as. *Cane yields are comparatively low, partly due to the fact that insufficient.
it-k on cane varieties has been carried out. Neither Kenya by itself nor East Africa

as a whole have an effective sugar research center and so the continuous breeding
and testing of varieties which is a feature of more efficient areas has not been
carried out.
Some improvements have been made, or are in hand, including the following:
a)  The Government has agreed to provide funds for harvesting and
trnsport at-4ior. equ- Tipment.,

result the factory t-roughput has begun to increase.
c) Arrangements have also been made to increase throughput
at Chemelil factory.
d) As a special measure to improve settler's income,
rephasing of their loan repayments has been proposed
and the local authorities are being pressured to remove
the cesses on sugarcane.
Nevertheless much remains to be done to improve the efficiency
of the sugar industry and the Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
has recently appointed a Commission to review the operation of the industry
and to examine in particular the relationship between sugar prices, milling
.iargins and cane prices. During negotiations it was agreed that the Govern-
ment will consult with the Bank as to the action to be taken on the Commission's
-ommendations.

Notes on the Methodology of Economic Appraisal
A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A.. Feeder Roads
1.      MMultiple traffic counts taken dlrtnng 1967 and 1968 are available
on all the feeder roads in the project. Estimates of future traffic levels,
after the r Ads have been improved, mrust pay regard to the extent to which
the improvements themselves are likely to encourage more vehicles to use the
roads, and the "induced" traffic thus res-1ting in addltion to increases
suggested by the "normal" traffic growth rate. As a guide to the probable
order of -nduced t4Affic le-el    vehicle counts hnhe been exa-mined on five
roads which were improved at different times during the 1960's, and which
had traffic ch-aacteristics broadly similar to the project roads at the time
of reconstruction. The results, shown in Table 10, indicate that on average
traffic on these roads increased by about 9% p.a. before they were improved,
and by 18% p.a. in the three following years, which suggests an induced
growth rate of 9` in each of these years in addition to a normal 9° gro'.th
rate. This conclusion is based on data which are far from satisfactory, but
in the absence of any better information for the individual feeder roads in
the project, it is considered reasonable to assume growth rates of this order
for each of the roads under review.
2.       The benefits from the proposed road improvements have been identi-
fied as resulting, first, from reductions in vehicle operating costs for
normal traffic, second,from the net value of induced traffic (estimated as
the surplus between the lower operating costs and the operating cost level
necessary to induce economic activity), and third, from any reduction in
road maintenance costs. In estimating savings in vehicle operating costs,
it was first necessary to judge the quality of the existing roads from the
users' point of view, and to estimate the present level of vehicle operating
costs accordingly.  To assist in doing so, each road was graded according to
a number cf different characteristics - riding quality, gradients, etc. and
awarded points accordingly, a maximum of 68 points corresponding to exceilent
gravel road standards, and a minimum of nil points to a track that would be
barely motorable even at the most favorable time of year (Table 11). The
total points awarded to each road served to indicate the appropriate level
of vehicle operating costs on the road, between the levels to be expected
for the two extreme conditions. To provide a more general description of
a road condition, ranges of points were grouped into five grade equivalents
as follows:
Total Points          Grade Equivalent
0 - 13                  G 0
14 - 27                   G 1
28 - 41                  G 2
42 - 55                   G 3
56 - 68                  G 4

3.       In estimating subsaquent vehicle operatin-g costs for roads to *be
improved to gravel standards, it was recognized that although these should
qualify for t1e max     poinrts  wediatell,yr af ter reconstructionj their uary-
ing conditions thereafter would justify a somewhat lower grading. A total
o.L u points, representLnig 4he mrd-poit of grad'e G 4was considered
appropriate. The total range of vehicle operating costs assumed, and its
rr-L,atian to the po:,ns classification of the roads, is shown r. T-a 0le l2.
4.       Estimates of benefits, construction costs (including desig
supervision and administration, but excluding taxes), and other data reLat-
ing to the rates of return estimated for the road improvement, are sumzmarized
in Table 13.
B. Failed Trunk Roads
5.      T]-le Roads Branch estimate that where they have remedied failunrs
of a road section by patching as potholes etc. appeared, the costs of doilg
so, per square yard, have been some 50% higher than the costs of ccmpletely
reconstructing the section. The estimate is based on the following analysis:
Cost of Patching    Weighted % IncreaseX
% of Total Cost      as % of Cost of   in Cost of Patching of
Cost Item   of Reconstruction     Reconstruction       Reconstruction

Labor               10                 130                   3
Plant               20                 150                  10

>>D~Z)                                   49 (say 50M)
6.       This increase in costs can be accepted as representing the order
of savings achieved by reconstructing instead of eventually patching the
whole of the failed section. This understates the overall gain from doing
so, because road users will also gain some benefit from the better riding
qualities compared with those of an extensively patched surface.
7.       A proDerly reconstructed and maintained pavement can be expected
to suffice for at least twenty years; on the other hand, extensive patching
only represents an interim measure that can delay the need for reconstruction,
but does not provide a complete substitute over the whole span of twenty years.
It has consequently hben assumed that patching would still have to be follow-
ed by complete reconstruction eight years after 100% of the road has been
-atched.
8.       The Roads Branch est:Lypate that it. typically takes about eight
years for a road to fail completely, the rate of deterioration accelerating
each year un.tl most of the pavement has been patchedj nd giving a di stri-
bution broadly illustrated as follows:

9.       When the costs of patching and reconstructing are cunrpared, tlle
results suggest that, if the cost of capital is taken as 10% p.a. the optimurc
time for the outlay on reconstruction is at approximately hne third year aft?r
failures first become apparent, when about 10% of the total area has a:Lready
been patched. The savings, in terms of eliminating further outlays on patch-
ing, are sufficient to yield a return of about 16% on the investment cos-ts of
reconstructing at that time.
