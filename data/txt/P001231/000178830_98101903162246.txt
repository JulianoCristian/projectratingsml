REPORT AND RECO1'GENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED BANK LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A THIRD HIGHWiAY PROJECT
AND ON PROPOSED A1iENDNENTS TO DEVELOPMENT CREDIT 104 KE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $23.5 million to
the Republic of Kenya, and on proposed amendments to the Development
Credit 104 KE.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The present project has growm out of a preliminary loan appli-
cation largely for feeder roads, received in April 1968, at the time the
last road project in Kenya, Credit 120-KE, was being negotiated. Other
components of the Government's road building program for 1969-1974 have
subsequently been added, at the initiative of the Bank or the Government.
3.        The proposed project has been prepared by the Government, for
certain elements with the assistance of consultants.  The Bank's Permanent
Hiission in East Africa provided general guidance and, for the settlement
roads component, more detailed assistance. Appraisal took place in
January 1969, and negotiations were held in Washington in July. Kenya was
represented by 1Mr. R. J. Ouko, Permanent Secretary of the Miinistry of Works,
Mr. S. Mbugia, Engineer-in-Chief, Mr. G. 14anners, Supernumerary, Chief
Engineer (Roads), Mr. D. Powrie, Senior Superintending Engineer (Road
Planning), and Ir. J. Gatuiria, Senior Finance Officer in the Ministry of
Finance.
4.        The proposed loan would be the first Bank loan to Kenya since
it became an independent republic in December 1963. Two loans were
extended prior to independence, with the guarantee of the United Kingdom,
and subsequently nine IDA credits have been granted. All loans and
credits have been made to the Government. The position as of August 31,
1969 was as follows:

5.        The 1961 loan for land settlement (303-KE), reduced by $3.8
million from the original $8.4 million in June 1967 after a revision of
the project, was reduced further by cancellation of $665,000 in May 1969.
A land settlement project is, by nature, a particularly difficult under-
taking and the difficulties in this case have been enhanced by adminis-
trative problems.  The present closing date is September 30, 1969, and
any balance undisbursed on that date will be cancelled.
6.        The Agricultural Credit Project, 105-KE, has been hampered by
management and staffing problems, which now are being tackled with energy
by the Government, and there has been a sharp increase in loan approvals
since the middle of 1968.
7.        The Smallholder Tea development project, 64-KE, is nearing
complet-on,andthe lag in disbursement is due to the fact that deficits
of the KTDA, against which disbursements are made, have been smaller than
estimated. The Livestock Development project, Credit 129-KE, encount-
ered difficulty in recruiting management officers; this problem has now
been resolved and the Credit was declared effective May 1, 1969.
3.        A forest plantations loan in the amount of $2.6 million has been
negotiated and will be presented to the Executive Directors in the near
iature. A Second Education project has been appraised and should follow
..ater in the year.  In addition a number of other projects are under con-
sideration, including a water supply project for Nairobi, an electric
power project and an airport project.



-3-
S.        During negotiations, the Kenya Delegation informed the Bank
of the Government's intention to file a request for financing purchases
of road maintenance equipment. The role of the Bank Group in developing
Kenya's road system lends importance to such a project, which also would
provide for a thorough overhaul of maintenance administration.
10.       In addition to the above loans and credits, the Bank has made
four loans for cormon services in East Africa, three of them for rail-
ways and/or harbors and one for telecommunications. All four loans are
guaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with the
United Kingdom also being a guarantor for the first loan for railways.
Below is a summary statement of these loans as of August 31, 1969.

11.       TEo more Community projects are being processed, one for rail-
ways and another for teleconmunications in which Sweden may participate.
12.       IFC has invested US $3.1 million in loans and shares in Kenya
Hotel Properties Ltd. for hotels and game park lodges. Currently, the
IFC is considering particip±i.ng writh the Government and other interested
parties, in a pulp and paper mill which eventually would use pulpwood
from plantations included in the forest plantations project proposed for
Bank financing.

PART III - THE PROJECT
14.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway
Project, Kenya,, (PTR-24a) on the proposed project is attached. The
total cost of the project is $36.3 million. For the purpose of finan-
cing it is proposed to divide the project in two parts, Part I costing
$35.1 million against which the proposed loan of $23.5 million would be
made, and Part II costing $1.2 million, described in paragraph 15 below.



Fart I of the proposed project consists of:
A. construction or reconstruction of:
(i)  five sections of trunk roads, totalling about
85 miles
(ii)  eighteen sections of feeder roads, totalling
about 288 miles
(iii) about 218 miles of roads in Phase II of the
agricultural road program in the sugar-growing
area of Miwani-Chemelil-Yuhoroni-Koru
(iv)  about 366 miles of tertiary roads in settle-
ment areas
B. engineering services in respect of:
(i) detailed engineering of one trunk road included
in A(i) and two feeder roads included in A(ii)
(ii)  investigation and engineering of required road
improvements in settlement areas, including
those in A(iv)
(iii) supervision of all works listed under A above
(iv)  a study of the organization of the Ministry of
Works and the implementation of its recommendations.
15.       Part II of the proposed project consists of the portion of
Phase II of the Government's agricultural road program for sugar-growing
areas, which is not included in item A(iii) above. The Government requested
that this portion be separated from the Third Highway Project and added
to the project financed under Credit 10h-KE in order to enable the Govern-
ment to util:ize a balance of $800,000 of Credit 104-KE not needed for
completion of the original project. The Government expects that Part II
would be completed by end May 1970, but that another 12 months would be
needed to allow for the disbursement of the usual retention funds. The
closing date of Credit 104-KE would, accordingly, be postponed from the
present December 31, 1969 until May 31, 1971. Disbursements would be in
respect of foreign expenditures.
16.       The project as a whole will bring major benefits to agriculture
and tourism. The various road sections in the project are widely dispersed,
and in some cases sections constructed under earlier Bank/IDA projects will
'be improved to talce care of subsequent traffic growth; thus the project
'epresents a logical extension to the Bank Group's road financing in
Kenya.



- 6 -
I7.       The Roads Branch of the Ministry of Works would have overall
responsibility for executing the project. The Ministry has the capacity
to undertake this task assuming continued reliance on expatriate engineers
and the planned use of contractors.  With Kenya's existing bilateral aid
agreements, replacement of engineers whose contracts expire should not
be difficult. Tertiary roads in settlement areas ($1.6 million of pro-
posed loan) would be constructed by the Ministry's own forces since the
nature of the work is not suited for execution on contract; two feeder
roads ($0.4 million of proposed loan) would be constructed by extension
of contracts awarded under Credit 120-KE, and the remaining work would
be awarded to contractors on the basis of international competitive
bidding.
18.       The proposed loan would cover the foreign exchange component
of Part I of the project, while the Government would provide the local
currency.  The loan proposed includes about $300,000 for financing of
engineering services contracted to prepare the project and paid for by
the time the loan is expected to be signed.   Part I of the project would
be physically completed by the end of 1972 and the closing date is set
12 months thereafter to provide time for payment of retention money.
PART IV - LEGAL fiSTRUMYENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Kenya, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreemient and a Draft Resolution are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The Draft Loan
Agreement conforms generally to the pattern of existing Bank and IDA Agree-
ments for road development projects.    There is only one exception, the
requirement in Section 5.15 that "the Borrower shall take all necessary
action to improve the operational efficiency of the sugar industry..."
Tnis provision is directed at problems, largely of management, which
fall outside the immediate scope of the proposed project but which could
affect the economic return of the agricultural roads included in it.
20.       In addition to the documents mentioned above, a draft amended
Schedule (Description of Project) to Development Credit Agreement
No. 104-KE, dated May 11, 1967, is distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors of the International Deve].opment Association. The amendment adds
to the project description the roads colstituting Part II of the
project described in paragraph 15 above.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
21.       An Economic Report entitled "Prospects for Economic Development
in Kenya,, (Vol. II of AF-58b, dated August 31, 1967) was distributed to
the Executive Directors early in September, 1967 (R67-148) and updating
memorandum, "Recent Developments in the East African Community, Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda" (AF-74), was distributed to the Executive Directors
in April 1968 (R68-52).
22.       An economic mission visited Kenya in April/May this year to
appraise the new 1969-1974 Development Plan and its report was discussed
with the Kenya Government at the end of August. The report will form
the basic documentation for a meeting of the Consultative Group on East
Africa which will be held in December. It will be distributed to the
Executive Directors before the end of October.
23.       The real growth of the Kenyan economy over the past five years
has been high - just over 6 percent a year. This is a remarkable achieve-
ment in the face of falling export prices for its major export commodi-
ties, unfavorable weather conditions, disease afflicting certain crops,
and restrictions imposed on Kenya's exports by Tanzania and Uganda. Thus,
even when account is taken of Kenya's rapidly rising population (about
3 percent a year), there has been a significant increase in real income
per capita since 1964.
24.       Other indicators of Kenya's recent economic development have
been an increasing investmant rate (rising from 13.7 percent of GDP at
market prices in 1964 to 19.5 percent in 1968) and a savings rate of
around 20 percent. The balance of payments on current account has
moved from surplus to deficit, but there has been an overall surplus
despite losses resulting from the devaluation of sterling in 1967.
Hence, Kenya's foreign exchange reserves have increased and in April 1969
they amounted to the equivalent of five months' imports.
25.       Kenya's successful economic growfth in recent years has been due
in considerable part to a pragmatic and well-directed development policy
and this can be expected to continue.  It has been assisted, however, by
an "early start" in the development of manufacturing and of a range of
services (banking, insurance, etc.) particularly when compared to the
other countries in the East African Common Market. The uncertainty over
the inplementation of the Common Market system has restrained investment
in this sector and is one of the causes of the present high degree of
liquidity in the economy. At the present time Kenya's problem is less
one of finding resources for needed development projects than of following
policies, internally and in relation to its Common Market partner states,
which will encourage the maintenance of a high level of investment, par-
ticularly private investment.



- 8 -
26.       The 1969-74 Development Plan incorporates a public expenditure
program for the financial years 1969/70 through 1973/74 amounting to
KE 180 millions, of which half will be financed from internal sources.
The plan projects a growth rate of 7 percent a year at constant prices,
wrhich is probably a little higher than is likely to be achieved. Gross
fixed capital formation over the period 1970-74 is expected to amount to
about K' 670 million at constant prices, of which about 60 percent would
be generated in the private sector. This implies that investment would
increase at an average rate of some 10 percent a year from 1968, compared
with an annual growth rate of 14 percent between 1964 and 1968.
27.       In its draft report the economic mission estimated that the
total foreign exchange gap over the 1969-74 plan would be slightly over
KL 180 million which, allowing for the undisbursed part of loans already
approved (KL 30 million) would leave some Kb 150 million to be financed.
It is estimated that about Kb 80 million of this could be met by inflows
of private capital, including both equity capital and suppliers' credits.
At the end of 1968 Kenya's external public debt stood at $343.2 million.
If Kenya's notional one-third share of the East African Community's
external debt is included, the total amount is increased to $408 million,
giving a debt service ratio of a little under 7 percent. The net over-
seas borrowing required to meet the foreign exchange gap projected in the
new development plan would mean that the debt service ratio would in-
crease to between 10 and 12 percent by 1974, depending upon the terms of
assistance made available.
28.       The assassination of the Minister of Economic Planning and
Development in July, 1969 constituted a severe challenge to political
stability and tribal balance in Kenya. General elections must be held,
by mid 1970 and as the time draws near political differences can be
expected to become sharper. However, the demonstration of the Govern-
ment's ability to maintain order in recent months provides a basis for
optimism regarding Kenya's political stability. In view of both political
and economic prospects, Kenya can be considered creditworthy for the
proposed loan.
PART VI - COMPLIAiNCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.



PART VII - RECCIvYIENDATION
30.       I recommend
a) that the Executive Directors of the Bank approve the
proposed loan; and
b) that the Executive Directors of the Association approve:
i)  the proposed amendment to the Description of
Project for Development Credit Agreement 104-KE,
and
ii) the postponement of the closing date for this
Credit to May 31, 1971.
