Building on\n            the previous achievements, the overall objective of this\n            second operation is to continue deepening, broadening, and\n            sustaining the reforms underway in the areas of public\n            administration, and fiscal management. This operation\n            complements a series of the International Development\n            Association (IDA) projects, aimed at strengthening public\n            finance management, raising fiduciary standards, and\n            supporting public administration reform, which are\n            preconditions for a growing share of donors' assistance\n            to be channeled through the budget. The operation also\n            supports the implementation of reforms that lead to a more\n            efficient allocation of fiscal resources in the areas of\n            human development (health and education), and private sector\n            development (investment climate, financial sector, and\n            state-owned enterprises). Notwithstanding, the PSIB Grants\n            have significant country (political, security, and\n            macroeconomic), fiduciary, and implementation risks. The\n            mitigation of these country risks is outside the scope of\n            this project. However, the PSIB Grants will allow the\n            Government to deepen the implementation of its program\n            beyond Kabul, which will contribute to the nation-building\n            effort, and will help mitigate political, and security risks."}, "docdt": "2005-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
