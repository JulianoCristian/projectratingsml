It\n            also seeks to develop strategies for modernizing medium-size\n            fertilizer plants. In order to accomplish these objectives,\n            the project consists of: (a) rehabilitation, modernization\n            and energy-saving modifications in the fertilizer plants of\n            the five companies and training of their staff. It also\n            provides for; (b) equipment, data processing facilities and\n            training to strengthen the research and design capability of\n            China fertilizer development center (CFDC) and its member\n            institutes. The project finally includes; (c) a study, to be\n            conducted by Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI), of\n            nitrogenous fertilizer production costs; and (d) technical\n            assistance in international procurement."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
