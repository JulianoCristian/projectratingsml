The project supports\n            ongoing efforts to (a) improve road maintenance efficiency;\n            (b) continue the highway rehabilitation and strengthening\n            program; and (c) upgrade planning and programming of\n            pavement strengthening and resealing.  It also intends to\n            (d) undertake selected road  improvements; and (e) reduce\n            road traffic hazards. To that end, the loan finances\n            components of the Department of Highway's (DOH)\n            1987-1991 road development plan and periodic maintenance\n            program.  Specific subprojects to be financed under the loan\n            will be selected on the basis of agreed-upon criteria and\n            procedures.  Major components of DOH's program, for\n            which most of the loan proceeds will be used are\n            rehabilitation, periodic maintenance and paving programs.\n            Other components include road safety, training, testing and\n            office equipment and  consultant services."}, "docdt": "1987-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
