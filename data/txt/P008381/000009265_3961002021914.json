efficiency; to reduce air pollution in\n            northern Bohemia, and thereby improve the environment and\n            health of the local population; to modernize the\n            transmission system; and to facilitate interconnection of\n            the Czech Power Enterprise (CEZ) and German power grids.\n            These objectives will be accomplished in the context of\n            overall reform of the energy sector.  To this end, the\n            project will:  (a) reduce total consumption of\n            pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency\n            improvements; (b) curtail power plant sulfur dioxide (SO2)\n            emissions by means of flue gas desulfurization; (c) reduce\n            dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants; (d) increase\n            the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ\n            transmission system; and (e) assist in improving investment\n            planning and corporate management and organization.  The\n            project includes:  (a) installation of equipment and\n            operational improvements at the Prunerov II power station\n            and other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite\n            consumption; (b) installation of flue gas desulfurization\n            equipment at Prunerov II; (c) improvements and equipment for\n            dust collection,; (d) modernization of five 400-kV\n            substations and construction of a short 400-kV transmission\n            line; and (e) consulting services and staff training."}, "docdt": "1992-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
