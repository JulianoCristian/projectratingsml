Overall, world Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated satisfactory. Key lessons learned\n            from this project were as follows: Developing the project\n            and setting its objectives within a macroeconomic and policy\n            framework based on a previous structural adjustment loan\n            operation and related sector studies was a positive factor\n            for its success. Obtaining full commitment right from the\n            start of preparation, from both the government and the\n            Borrower proved to be instrumental in efficient project\n            appraisal and implementation. Setting realistic objectives\n            in line with the country's strategy, sector priorities,\n            and consistency with the borrower's managerial capacity\n            was important for satisfactory project outcome. Project\n            appraisal should have been postponed until the power sector\n            was completely reorganized and all project components had\n            been fully defined. Strengthening the Borrower's\n            financial management proved to be valuable in preparing the\n            Borrower to access international capital markets\n            successfully and to obtain added resources for its\n            investment program without the need for further government\n            guarantees. Frequent supervision by the same Bank team,\n            particularly in procurement, contributed to project success."}, "docdt": "2000-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
