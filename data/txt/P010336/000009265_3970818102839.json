The\n            project substantially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was highly satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the design of a sectoral reform program\n            should involve extensive consultations with the Government,\n            as well as potential beneficiaries. Second, the designation\n            of a single agency to coordinate policy-making and\n            implementation activities under the loan facilitated timely\n            decisions, as well as actions by GOP and other entities.\n            Third, a continuous dialogue and monitoring of the program\n            by GOP and the Bank helped in developing a correspondence of\n            views and consistency of policies and strategy. Fourth,\n            there is a need for preparatory and continuous training of\n            staff in the executing agencies to develop and maintain the\n            required procurement skills. Fifth, there is a need for more\n            intensive investigation of issues before any agreement on\n            the scope and phasing of price rationalization programs is\n            reached between GOP and the Bank. Finally, agreements on\n            policy reforms should be limited in number, and more\n            explicit linkages between priority actions and availability\n            of resources should be defined."}, "docdt": "1996-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
