the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible; the Bank's performance was satisfactory;\n            and the Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: The benefits of technical\n            assistance can be enhanced through the conduct of seminars.\n            The well attended seminars, where study objectives and\n            recommendations were presented and discussed by a large\n            number of stakeholders, is likely to have a significant\n            impact; first, by making those responsible for implementing\n            the recommendations get a good understanding of such\n            recommendations; and second, by extending the range of\n            stakeholders, both direct and indirect, who have a clear\n            grasp of the study topics, their importance, and ways to\n            improve performance. Implementation of rural roads\n            components requires close cooperation between provincial and\n            local government authorities. Highway projects can, during\n            implementation, generate important social benefits, through\n            well designed and implemented social policies. Project\n            development objective (PDO) indicators shall be selected\n            carefully to provide meaningful feedback on project\n            performance. In various highway projects, one of the PDO\n            indicators is to reduce number of accidents and fatalities\n            over the monitoring period of the projects."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
