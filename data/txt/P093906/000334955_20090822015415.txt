Introduction

1.       This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Board to introduce the following changes in
the China, Jiangxi I11 Highway Project (the Project) (Loan No. 4843-CHA7 Project ID
P093906'), and accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents. The specific
changes would include: (i)   reduction o f the scope for Local Road Improvement Program (LRIP)
component and related adjustments in intermediate results and their indicators; and (ii)  increase
disbursement rate for the LRIP component from 25% to 41%. The amount o f the loan allocated
to LRIP, US$10 million will remained unchanged due to price escalation and the proposed
increase o f the disbursement rate from 25% to 41%, which was recommended in order to fully
utilize the Bank loan.

Background and Reasons f o r Restructuring

3.     Basic Project Information. The World Bank approved an IBRD loan for US$200
million for the Project on June 27, 2006. The Project was declared effective on February 8,
2007. The project development objective i s to improve east - west passenger and freight flows in
Jiangxi province by investing in the construction o f an expressway, enhancing local roads, and
strengthening highway management. Project components include (a) component A (about
US$627 million): the construction o f an expressway section, 117 kilometers long, linking Ruijin
to Ganzhou in Southern Jiangxi, a section o f the G76 east - west expressway corridor linking
Xiamen in Fujian coastal province to Chengdu, the capital o f Sichuan province; (b) component B
(about US$74 million): upgrading to class 3 or class 4 o f six local roads in Ganzhou prefecture,
and(c) component C (about US$lO million): institutional strengthening. The loan i s expected- to
close by December 3 1, 2010.

4.      Project Progress. Based o n the latest supervision mission conducted in March 2009,
more than 90 YO f construction works o f the expressway are completed and i t s opening to traffic
                  o
i s expected in the fourth quarter o f 2009, several months ahead o f the initial schedule. Phase Io f
the LRIP, Chongyi - Fengzhou local road (39 km), i s substantially completed. Preparation o f the
phase I1program, Chongyi to Longgou section (about 17 kilometers long), i s currently ongoing.
Satisfactory progress i s also being made in the implementation o f the Institutional Strengthening
component: all three studies are progressing well and are expected to be completed in 2009. As
o f March 20, 2009, US$175.7 million o f the Loan has been disbursed (equivalent to
approximately 88 % o f the total Loan). The most recent Implementation Status Report (ISR)
(March 2009 Supervision Mission) rated the achievement o f the Project development objectives
(PDO) as satisfactory, and the Project's implementation progress (IP) as satisfactory (with Rui-
Gan Expressway being highly satisfactory and LRIP being moderately satisfactory), and
considered that all the Project objectives are likely to be achieved by Project completion. The
Table below documents the I'D0 arid overaH IP ratings in the prcvious three ISRs, which
indicates that the project has been constantly performing at a reasonably satisfactory level.
Detailed ISR ratings are provided in Attachment 1.

5.      The main reason for the project restructuring i s the change o f investment focus o f
Ganzhou prefecture to act upon the State Government's directive (2006) in implementing a
significant Rural Roads Pavement Improvement Program (RRPIP), with a total o f 10,000
kilometers rural roads linking almost all villages o f this prefecture by 2010 and serving about
four million villagers, during the same period as Jiangxi I11 Highway Project. The funding
sources o f the RRPIP i s indicated in the table below, and shows that the local government needs
to raise approximately US$ 200 million in five years in order to carry out the W I P program.
This has the result o f greatly restraining the financial capacityof the local government to
                                                      1
implement other projects, including the Jiangxi 1 1 Highway Project. As a result, Ganzhou
Prefecture cannot raise the full amount o f the promised counterpart hnds (US$60 million) to
implement the LRIP component. Although the RRPIP focuses on roads o f lower class than the
LRIP, it has similar objective to the LRTP-reducing poverty by improving access to markets
and services for poorer areas o f Ganzhou City Prefecture.




                                                            255.20                     264.70
      2007       3222       881.88           354.42         23 1.03                    296.42
      2008       3920.3     1029.57          43 1.23        237.66                     360 67
      2009       2039       636.17           224.29         224.29                     187.59
      2010       2850       889.20           313.50         313.50                     262 20
                 14908.5    4273.21          1639.94        1261.69                    1371.58


6.      Another reason for the changes made under the LRIP program i s because four out o f the
six roads planned to be upgraded over two phases o f the Project have been upgraded under
separate road improvement plans. These works are o f different standards which are lower than
the criteria set out under LRIP. Details o f the changes are provided in Attachment 2. In
summary, one road section was canceled from Phase Io f the LRIP, and the originally planned
four road sections under phase I1was reduced to one section.

7.     As the size o f the LRIP component has been significantly reduced, the Ministry o f
Finance has requested an increase on the disbursement rate from 25% to 41 % to h l l y utilize the
US$ 10 million loan allocated for the LRIP component and alleviate the financial stress
encountered by Gandiou Prefecture.

Proposed Changes

8.     Reduction o LRIP Scope. The LRIP component under the Jiangxi I11 project initially
                   f
included two roads identified for Phase I(Chongyi - Fengzhou road, 48.5 km; and Meicun -
Longpu road, 34.8 km), and four roads to be determined for Phase 1 . All the roads had to be
                                                                     1
selected according to their expected positive social impacts, government support, and technical


                                                       2
standards, as agreed at the time o f negotiation. In reality, four out o f the six roads planned to be
upgraded under LRIP have been implemented under separate road improvement plans. For
example, the Meicun - Longpu road was incorporated into the pavement rehabilitation plan for
snow and ice disaster subsidy o f the Ministry o f Transport in 2008. The remaining roads
originally selected for phase 2 were upgraded under the separate RRPIP advanced by Ganzhou
Prefecture. Seeking to alleviate financial stress o f the local government and support their good
efforts in improving lower standard rural roads, it was agreed that the LRIP for the Jiangxi I11
project would include only Congyi-Fengzhou (39 km) and Congyi-Longgou (17 km) roads at an
estimated cost o f about US$30 million, instead o f the US$70 million as originally planned. A
detailed summary o f progression o f the LRIP component i s provided in Attachment 2.

9.         Increase o LRIP Disbursement Rate. During appraisal, the disbursement rate o f the
                     f
LRIP was set at 25%. O n January 8, 2009, the Bank received a letter f i o m Mr. Wu Jinkang,
Deputy Director-General, International Department, Ministry o f Finance (MOF), People's
Republic o f China requesting an increase in the disbursement percentage for category (l)(b)
C i v i l Works from 25% to 41%. With the increased disbursement rate, the loan amount o f U S $ 10
million allocated to this component would (i)  alleviate financial stress o f Ganzhou Prefecture, (ii)
accommodate for price escalation on civil works under the project, and (iii)        fully utilize the
World Bank loan. The increases in disbursement percentages proposed above are made for sound
social-economical and financial reasons and the proposals do not impact the development
objective or the ability o f the Project to achieve said objective. Total loan amount and i t s
allocation will not change.

Analysis

10.    These changes should not have any major effect o n the original economic, financial,
technical, institutional or social aspects o f the project as appraised. There i s no change in the
environmental category o f the project which i s already a category A project. The relevant
environmental and social safeguard documents related to this road addition (Congyi-Longgou
road, 17km) have been reviewed by the Bank and are currently under revision in order to fully
comply with Bank's requirement. There i s no exception to Bank policies.

11.    The L R I P component under Jiangxi I11 project, after project restructuring, will s t i l l
include two roads, the Chongyi - Fengzhou road and the Chongyi - Longgou road. Both roads
will belong to the main arteries o f Chongyi County and benefit rather poor areas-hardly
accessible before Jiangxi I11project-with various activities, tourism spots, factories and mines.
Both these roads will become the east - west backbone o f Chongyi County and various
unclassified paved roads implemented under the parallel RRPIP will connect to it. The Chongyi
- Fengzhou road has been implemented. Lessons have been drawn from this experience and the
various problems that occurred during construction phase due to a challenging topography. The
Bank project provides agood opportunity for local governments to build their capacity in
achieving roads that are more environmental friendly, engineering sound and people oriented.
This experience will be helpful for other local road projects to be built in Jiangxi.

12.    The reduction in the scope o f the LRIP will not exert impact on the current
implementation o f the Project, including achievement o f the PDO, as set in the project appraisal
phase. Rather, it will lggely relieve the financial constraint that Ganzhou Prefecture Government


                                                 3
i s facing with regards to the RRPIP. The W I P will provide basic accessibility to four m i l l i o n
villagers and immediately reduce poverty, which coincides with the PDO o f Jiangxi I11Project.

Expected Outcome

13.      The proposed project restructuring does not require any change o f the PDO. As
aforementioned, both roads under L R I P belong to the main arteries o f Chongyi county and
benefit rather poor areas that are hardly accessible before Jiangxi I11 project, with various
                                                                                           I
activities, tourism spots, factories and mines. The recently identified road under Phase I -
Chongyi to Longgou-links four poor townships totaling 50,000 inhabitants under Chongyi
County with the town o f Chongyi. This directly contributes to the Project's poverty reduction
objective by improving access to markets and services for poorer areas o f Ganzhou City
Prefecture.

14.     Outcome targets o f Jiangxi I11project have to be revised in accordance with the proposed
restructuring. Initially, for each o f the six roads to be upgraded, the outcome indicators included
(a) increased average daily traffic, (b) reduced number o f days closed, (c) reduced travel time,
and (d) increased daily bus services. The same outcome indicators will be kept after project
restructuring, but targets will be limited to only two local roads (see the project changes
highlighted in the Results Framework and Monitoring Table, Attachment 3).

Benefits and R i s k s

15.    There are no significant risks associated with the proposed Project restructuring. There
are no additional safeguard and fiduciary impacts associated with this modification. Counterpart
financing for implementing the Chongyi - Longgou road has been secured by a clear
commitment o f Ganzhou prefecture to implement it.
