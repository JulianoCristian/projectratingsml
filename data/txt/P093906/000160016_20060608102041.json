Component B, the Local Roads Improvement Program,\n            aims to improve access in poor areas of the province by\n            upgrading existing roads in poor condition. Component C,\n            Institutional Strengthening, reflects the current needs of\n            the Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department in key\n            areas. The component includes: (a) traffic safety operations\n            for tunnels; (b) traffic safety improvement for expressways;\n            (c) implementation of electronic toll collection; (d)\n            training; and (e) equipment."}, "docdt": "2006-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
