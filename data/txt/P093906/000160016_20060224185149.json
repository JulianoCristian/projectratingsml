To\n            mitigate environmental adversity due to construction\n            activities, this environmental assessment identifies\n            negative impacts, and sets the framework for the\n            environmental management plan, contained in eight volumes.\n            It includes the legal and policy framework and applicable\n            environmental standards, major potential adverse impacts to\n            the physical and socioeconomic environments in the Project\n            area, analysis of alternatives, and public consultations, in\n            particular, for the Ruijin - Ganzhou expressway, Chogyi\n            County - Fengzhou highway, and, Meicun - Longbu highway.\n            Mitigation measures suggest the following. The project\n            design includes engineering detailed works, i.e., concrete\n            and stone pavements on deep slopes to control soil erosion,\n            and stabilize soil surface, and includes as well\n            interception ditches and landscaping. Borrow pits will be\n            rehabilitated through conversion into ponds, or landscaping\n            following construction. Appropriate drainage systems,\n            retaining walls, and settling ponds will be in place for\n            adequate waste disposal. Sewage disposal facilities will be\n            installed along the construction route in compliance with\n            standard discharge regulations, ensuring water quality\n            through water treatment criteria. Soundproofing windows\n            should reduce noise disturbances, while at construction\n            sites, noise will be controlled by restricting time and\n            place of activity, while Workers shall wear protective\n            helmets and ear-plugs. Oil and lubricant spills will be\n            collected, and disposed of in selected landfills. To this\n            end, dump sites quarries, and mixing plants will be located\n            beyond residential areas. Construction material will be\n            transported in covered vehicles, and sites will be sprayed\n            in order to minimize dust emissions."}, "docdt": "2006-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
