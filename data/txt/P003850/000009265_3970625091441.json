estate crops by\n            integrating the various subsectoral extension services into\n            one unified extension service within the Ministry of\n            Agriculture. The proposed project includes: (a) recruitment\n            of 6000 field extension workers, 3000 extension supervisors,\n            1000 subject matter specialists and 200 animal health\n            officers. It further involves (b) construction of 400 new\n            Rural Extension Centers (REC); expansion of about 1,400\n            existing RECs; and construction of 200 animal health posts\n            and 210 staff houses. Finally, it aims to provide (c)\n            procurement of the necessary vehicles, equipment and\n            furniture; (d) overseas and local training of extension\n            personnel; and (e) technical assistance and studies. The\n            unified extension service would help increase production of\n            secondary crops, horticultural crops, estate crops,\n            livestock and fisheries in order to provide the population\n            with a more balanced and nutritious diet, as well as to\n            increase tree crops and fisheries exports."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
