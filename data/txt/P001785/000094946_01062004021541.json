Management and\n            Maintenance Program Project will stimulate economic growth\n            and contribute to poverty reduction through improved road\n            infrastructure, better sector policies, and enhanced roads\n            sector management. The Specific objectives of this project\n            will improve the coverage and condition of roads and\n            bridges; strengthen the country's capacity to manage\n            and administer the road sector effectively and\n            transparently, with efficient and sustainable institutional\n            arrangements; establish finance mechanisms to ensure\n            sufficiently, timely, stable, and secure flow of funds for\n            roads maintenance, affordable at the macroeconomic level and\n            for the road users; and improve road transport safety. The\n            project consists of three components: 1) The civil works\n            component will support roads routine and perodic\n            maintenance, roads rehabilitation, rural roads civil works,\n            emergency works, road safety, and engineering services for\n            road works. 2) The second component will establish an\n            institutional framework for the sector to ensure transparent\n            roads management and administration and support policy\n            reform. 3) The third component will support strategy and\n            preparatory activities for Phase II, which involve revising\n            and updating of the national integrated road sector strategy\n            and preparing environmental impact assessment and social\n            impact assessments for Phase II."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
