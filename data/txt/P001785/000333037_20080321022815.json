"Ratings for first phase of the Roads and\n            Bridges Management and Maintenance Project for Mozambique\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Implementation delays due to\n            underestimated contract durations at the design stage,\n            delays in the decision-making process of the National Road\n            Administration (ANE), inadequate contract management, and\n            poor performance of some contractors and consultants\n            resulted in additional costs, loss of economic benefits that\n            were projected at project appraisal, and ineffective use of\n            national resources. Therefore, it is critical for the ANE to\n            carry out an assessment of institutional capacity and\n            develop work programs that can be delivered successfully\n            using agreed on time schedules. The coastal areas of\n            Mozambique have few naturally available materials suitable\n            for road building. The ANE needs to set up an information\n            system that will allow management to monitor project\n            performance and permit decision makers to take appropriate\n            actions.  For the road sector programs aimed at using the\n            sector wide approach with the concept of pooled funding, it\n            is important to reach a consensus with other Development\n            Partners (DPs) on the implementation arrangements\n            particularly on fiduciary aspects such as procurement and\n            financial management. The monitoring and assessment\n            framework should include a time based action plan to carry\n            out baseline studies, if needed, a well coordinated\n            mechanism for data collection, and the agency staff with\n            clear role and responsibilities for evaluation and reporting\n            of the project performance biannually."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
