Bridges Management and Maintenance Program Project for\n            Mozambique were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Railways and Ports Restructuring Project for Mozambique\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: 1)\n            precise definition and scheduling of works during project\n            preparation; 2) policy and institutional reforms undertaken\n            prior to major investments in works; 3) participatory\n            approach to reflect changing priorities in strategy updates;\n            4) appropriate financial management systems established to\n            guarantee accountability and transparency; 5) strengthened\n            procurement capacity; and 6) the use of local contractors as\n            capacity is built. Of these lessons, perhaps the one\n            embedded the most in the project design was the use of a\n            participatory approach to continuously reflect changing\n            priorities in strategy updates."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
