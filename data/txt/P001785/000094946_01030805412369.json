         activity in the area. During construction, vegetation and\n            fauna habitat losses will be mitigated by clearly marking\n            the work areas with pegs, identifying trees for retention,\n            and stockpiling shrub foliage for later use as brush layer,\n            and seed stock. Soil erosion, and sedimentation will be\n            controlled through the construction of diversion banks,\n            filter structures - fences of windrowed vegetation - and\n            sediment traps, and, in addition, vegetative propagation\n            should minimize the disturbed area. Drainage construction\n            should take place prior to, during, or immediately following\n            road excavation, to minimize scour, and sedimentation, and,\n            ensure that borrow pits, drain into sediment traps before\n            run-off is discharged off the site. Topsoil saving should be\n            the practice, to be re-used on completed road formation\n            batters, or areas approved by the Supervision Consultant.\n            During operations, afforestation practices should be\n            encouraged; sound barriers should be installed to reduce\n            noise disturbances; air pollution regulation should be\n            enforced, particularly regarding vehicle emissions control;\n            and, contingency plans should be in place for clean up of\n            oil spills, fuel, and toxic chemicals."}, "docdt": "2001-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
