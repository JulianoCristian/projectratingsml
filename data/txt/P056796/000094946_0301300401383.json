The lessons\n            learned indicated that a credible threat of\n            foreclosure/bankruptcy is needed to elicit debtor\n            cooperation with court-supervised rehabilitations, or out of\n            the court workouts. An efficient framework for out of the\n            court workouts is necessary in a systemic crisis and can\n            financially stabilize distressed companies. Government must\n            be ready to impose losses on shareholders of domestic\n            financial institutions, and force a resolution of\n            over-valued assets. Barring some overriding public policy\n            purpose, all significant tax, legal, and regulatory\n            impediments to corporate restructuring must be eliminated.\n            Crisis efforts should be made to resolve immediate\n            corporate/financial sector distress and be supplemented by\n            other measures to promote corporate/financial sector reform.\n            Key measures include improvements in financial\n            regulation/supervision, improved financial disclosure,\n            stronger corporate governance, and effective competition policy."}, "docdt": "2003-01-06T00:00:00Z"}
