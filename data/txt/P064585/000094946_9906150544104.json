The first\n            component, Rural Finance, consists of: a) commercial credit\n            line, which will provide a credit line to Kyrgyz\n            Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC) to on-lend for\n            working capital and investment under commercial terms and\n            conditions; and b) special credit line for small-farmers\n            credit outreach program, consisting of group lending based\n            on \"social collateral\", to allow those with\n            inadequate physical collateral but with sound bankable\n            projects to receive loans. The Institutional Development\n            Component will deal with: a) capacity building for KAFC to\n            improve its operating efficiency and ensure that it can\n            survive as a self sustaining financial intermediary; and b)\n            other technical assistance, including training to develop\n            group lending based on social collateral and development of\n            small scale rural business development services."}, "docdt": "1999-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
