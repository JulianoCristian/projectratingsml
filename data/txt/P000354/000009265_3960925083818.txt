PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CAMEROON
FORESTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 2092-CM)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Forestry Project in
Cameroon, for which Loan 2092-CM, in the amount equivalent to US$17 million, was
approved in February 1982. US$10 million were cano,led when the Project was re-
designed in 1985.  The Loan Account was closed on Dec. 31, 1989, about three
years behind schedule.       In total, 39 percent of the loan had been disbursed
and the balance of US$338,000 was canceled on June 5, 19X)O.
The PCR was prepared by the Africa Regional Office (Parts I and III) with
the assistance of an FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme mission which visited
Cameroon in December 1990. The contribution of the Government (Part II) was
requested, but has not been received.
The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and
Project Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and
Borrower, internal Bank memoranda, interviews with Bank staff, discussions with
Government staff, and field visits to selected project sites.

PROJECT COMPI ETION REPORT
CAMERON-
FORESTRY PROJECT
(LN.2092-CM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.   Qbiectives - The Project aimed to expand the contribution of the forestry
subsector to the national economy through the establishment of about 1 1,000 ha
of pine and eucalyptus plantations, and enhance the capabilities of the responsible
Government agencies to improve reforestation and recover revenue from the forest
users.
2.   The total Project cost over the five-yea, irvestment period was estimated at
US$ 35.5 million, which was to be financed by 2 Bank loan (USS 17.0 million), by a
loan from the United Kingdom's Commonwealth r - velopment Corporation for the
cofinancing of the Edea component (US$ 7.4 mil. ao and by the Government (US$
11.1 million). The Bank Loan was made to the Gov- 4nment for a term of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period, at the interest rate of 11.6 percent.
3.   Implementation Exoerience - The Project was plagued with problems
throughout, and particularl,i during the early stages of imp,ermentation. To start
with, the l.oan did not become effective until 22 months after Board approval.
Realizing these delays, the implementing Company - Cellulose Company of
Cameroon (CELLUCAM) succeeded in planting 450 ha of pines and eucalyptus at
Edea in 1981 and 1982 from its own resources to supply a pulp mill. But because
a fire destroyed the bleaching chemical recycling plant in the pulpmill in 1982, and
because external markets of pine and eucalyptus were poor, the company's
financial situation deteriorated. The Bank dropped the pulpwood plantation
component at Edea in October 1984 and US$ 10 million (and the CDC loan) were
canceled. Also the other plantation components made little progress during the first
two years of the Project, because of senior managerial changes in the re-organized
forestry services, a weak technical assistance team, and a shortage of operating
funds which were to be provided by the Government. In view of the Project's poor
performance, by mid-1 985 the option of closing the loan and redefining with
Government a new strategy for the forestry subsector was considered in the Bank.
Instead it was decided, on recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the
supervision mission, to re-design the Project. With Bank approval, the Government
terminated the Tschnical Assistance contract in October 1985.
4.   The Government proposed a re-designed Project, which was accepted by the
Bank in December 1985.



iv
5.    Results - In spite of the apparent will of the project management and of the
Bank to make the Project work, the physical results of the Project since January
1986 are poor. Some 700 ha of woodlovs were planted at Maroua-Maga, but some
of the woodlots either had to be planted twice or had disappeared bscause they
had been planted on poor soils. About 1,500 ha of pines and eucalyptus were
planted and maintained at Ngaounder4, but 900 ha of these plantations suffered
severe damage from fire in 1989. This fire damage could have been avoided by
proper management.
6.   The Mbalmayo stockyard and seed conservation unit were established, - it
the stockyard did not appear to be used for species which are rapid growing and
economically viable such as Ayous. Again the stockyard was recently destroyed by
fire as a result of vandalism.
7.   Operations of the Department of Water, Forestry and Wildlife (DEFC) were
strengthnned and improved through organization and training. The Government
improved tax collection by setting up a special collection brigade and legislation
aimed at enforcing payment of taxes and royalties.
.   Sustainabilitv - The economic and financial analysis confirms that the
national economy cannot continue to sustain public sector parastatals involved in
the types of activities supported by the Project. The only two components for
which an economic rate of return can be calculated, the plantations near
Ngaound6re and the village woodlots near Maroua, will be a continuing drain on
public resources if managed by a Government parastatal, with an estimated minus
2 percent economic rate of return (ERR). However if ownership and responsibility
for management is handed over to the local communities, greatly reducing
maintenance and harvesting costs, a modest positive ERR of around 5 percent is
likely.
9.    Findings and Lessons Learned - In retrospect, it can be said that the project
designers failed to grasp the importance of tree planting by the local populations,
when it concentrated on Government plantations. Itis unfortunate that the
opportunity of supporting or encouraging tree planting by the private people was
missed in a country where this should be shouldered by the private sector if it is to
be sustainable in the longer term.
10.  Other lessons from the Project are:
(a)  the number of agencies involved in a Project needs to be kept to a
minimum and progress should be monitored closely throughout;



v
(b)   '-hen the Edea component was dropped, the Project became
unbalanced; and when also the other Project components made little
progress during the first two years of implementatiun, this might
perhaps have been an opportune time to re-appraise the Project
(instead of only re-design it) or close it altogether;
(c)   a Project should not depend too strongly on technical assistance in
order to be successful and the Government forestry officials need to
be fully involved in Project design and execution;
(d)   the risks of fire ,n the arid zone planwations need to be adequately
dealt with in implementation. The responsibility for planting and
especially for maintenance must be defined at the beginning of a
project.

2. Dackground
2.1.       Cameroon has a wide range of climatic conditions, from tropical rain
forest in the South to Sahelian in the extreme north. This permits a well diversified
agriculture and forestry sector. The country is dominated by forest. The forest area
covers a total 33.1 million ha, which is equivalent to 70% of the total land area, of
which 18.1 million ha are considered dense forests with 7.5 million ha now being
exploited, and 15.0 million ha are savannah. However, forest exploitation has not been
well planned and controlled. In the northern savannah and riverain areas, rapid
population growth has created a considerable demand for building materials and for
fuelwood, particularly in areas of rural population concentration where access to other
energy sources is limited and costly.
2.2.       The completed Project was conceived to establish plantations of exotic
pines and eucalyptus to assure a cheap supply of wood for a local pulpmill
(CELLUCAM). It was also intended to afforest areas in the savannah regions where
wood is in short supply, both in block plantations and in village woodlots. The Project
was the first Bank-assisted project devoted entirely to the forestry subsector in
Cameroon. More recently, the Government has adopted a Tropical Forestry Action Plan
and a strategy for the development of the subsector. A Forestry and Environment
Project is proposed for FY 92.

3. ProlectlQbIectlves and Description
3.1.       The project aimed to expand the contribution of the forescry subsector
to the national economy through the establishment of about 11,000 ha of pine and
eucalyptus plantations, and enhance the capabilities of the responsible Government
agencies to improve reforestation and recover revenue from the forest users.
3.2.       The original project - as appraised - was to:
(a)        plant and maintain about 8,800 ha of pines and
eucalyptus at Edea to supply a pulp mill operated by
CELLUCAM;
(b)        plant and maintain 1,000 ha of timber species, mainly
eucalyptus, and 200 ha of village woodlots in the
Saheli'n zone at Maga in the extreme north and 1,000 ha
of pines and eucalyptus in the savannah area at
Ngaounddr6;
(c)        establish four seed  production  sites for forestry
plantations and a seed conservation unit;
(d)        strengthen the National Office of Forests Regeneration
(ONAREF) and the DEFC to improve their technical
capacities to execute reforestation and recover revenues
from taxes.
3.3.       The total project cost over the five-year investment period was estimated
at US$ 35.5 million, and was to be financed by a Bsnk loan (US$ 17.0 million), by a
loan from the United Kingdom's Commonwealth Development Corporation for the
cofinancing of the Edea component (US$ 7.4 million>, and by the Government (US$
11.1 million). The Bank loan was made to the Government for a term of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period, at the interest rate of 11.6 percent.
4. Prolect Design and Organization
4.1.       T' * esign and success of the Project basically hinged on the 11,000
ha plantation   jpamme to supply a pulp mill, in particular the 8,800 ha CELLUCAM
Edea compnr.- ;. This component accounted for 68% of project cost and was
expected ti generate substantial benefits in the production of uniform-quality
plantation-grown wood which would reduce harvesting costs, decrease the cost of
pulping, and yield higher valued short and long fiber p'Jlp than would have been the
case without the project. But CELLUCAM was in poor financial shape already at
appraisal and, therefore, project design should have paid more attention to this
problem. Technical project design was faulty, in that it was an error to entrust the
major plantation component to a technical assistance team, whose performance turned
out to be poor. Trials and promotion of new technology under the Project were poorly
coordinated with on-going programs of the Centre of Forest Research.

5. PelJIm9hoinuld"
5.1.       Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-up. The original project was
plagued with problems Lhroughout, and particularly during the early stages of
implementation. To start with, -he loan became effective only 22 months after Board
approval (Part Ill, Table 2). Realizing these delays, CELLUCAM succeeded in planting
450 ha of pines and eucalyptus at Edea in 1981 and 1982 from its own resources. But
because a fire destroyed the bleaching chemical recycling plant in the pulpmill in 1982,
and because external markets of pine and eucalyptus were poor, the company's
financial situation deteriorated. The Bank dropped the cdea component in October
1984 and US$ 10 million (and the CDC loan) were cancelad.
5.2.       Also the other plantation com-s.  its nade little progress during the first
two years of the Project, because rf senior mer,dgerial changes in the re-organized
forestry services, a weak technical assistance team, and a shrrtage of operating funds
which were to be provided by the Government.
5.3.       In view of the project's poor performance, by mid-1985 the option of
closing the Loan and redefining with government a new strategy for the forestry
subsector was considered in the Bank. Instead it was decided, on recommendation of
the Minister of Agriculture and the supervision mission, to re-design the Project. With
Bank approval, the Government terminated the Technical Assistance contract in
October 1985.
5.4.       Project Redesian. The Government proposed a re-designed project,
which was accepted by the Bank in December 1985, with the following objectives:
(a)   planting of 900 ha of woodlots at Maroua-Maga and 220 ha of
irrigated lot at Maga;
(b)   establishing 1,500 ha of tree plantations and maintaining 1,600
ha of forest reserve at Ngaound6r6;
(L'   developing a stockyard and building a seed conservation unit at
Mbalmayo;
(d)   strengthening and improving DEFC operations.
5.5.       In spite of the apparent will of the project management and of the Bank
to make the project work, the physical results of the Proiect since January 1986 are
poor. Some 700 ha of woodlots were plantad at Ma. ;a-Maga, but some of the
woodlots either had to be planted twice or had disappeared because they had been
planted on poor soils. It is not clear how much of the area was planted under the Bank-
supported project or from ONAREF's own resources. The irrigated lot at Maga was not
established, because SEMRY and the Ministry of Agriculture could not agree on a
suitable site, and the component was subsequently dropped. About 1,500 ha of pines
and eucalyptus were planted and maintained at Ngaounddr6, but 900 ha of these
plantations suffered severe damage from fire in 1989. This fire damage could have
been avoided by proper management. This incident was a shock both to the project



4
management and to the staff, and this badly affected their morale. The firebreak
network was subsequently upgraded and the local ONAREF unit was provided with
firefighting equipment.
5.6.       The Mbalmayo stockyard and seed conservation unit were established.
These included installation of a sophisticated irrigation system and developing and
protecting the plant material collected to produce cuttings for the reforestation effort
of ONAREF. The stockyard did not appear to be used for hardwood species which are
relatively rapid growing and economically viable such as Avol, rather mostly slow
growing species such as Bibolo were plsnted. Again the stockyard was recently
destroyed by fire due to vandalism.
5.7.        DEFC and ONAREF operations have been strength-ned and improved
through organization and training. In February 1990, the forestry agencies were
reorganized into the National Office of Forest Development (ONADEF) and the
Department of Forests (DF), respectively. DF field services have been provided with
infi astructure and vehicles to enhance their capacity to control forest exploitation. The
project assisted DF in improving tax collection by setting up a special collection brigade
aimed at enforcing payment of taxes and royalties. A systom of tax collection on felled
trees (ae d'abattag) is now being extended nationwide by DF under a Canadian-
supported project.
5.8.        Disbursoments. Loan disbursements are shown in Part Ill, Table 3. The
particularly low levels in the early years are due to the delays in starting. The
strengthening of the US dollar with respect to appraisal estimates also permitted some
savings. Total disbursement was about 39%  of planned.  The balance of
$10,337,767.58 was cancelled, ($10 million in December 1985, and $337,767.58 in
June 1990.). Data on project financing (Part ll, Table 5) highlights the serious
shortfall in domestic funds. The capacity of DEFC and ONAREF to generate funds was
significantly less than expected.
5.9.        Project implementation coincided with the poor economic performance
in the country, which led to shortage of counterpart funds. Especially in the last few
years, funds approved by the Government were considerably less than what had been
requested. The Bank showed flexibility aif,. reacted by increasing its share of funding,
for some categories up to 100%.
5.10.       A fundamental problem affecting operating funds was recognized to be
the personnel. Large numbers of workers were recruited for the plantations, and
turnover and absenteeism were high, and productivity was low. On the other hand, !he
level of performance improved when the Cameroonians took up the challenge of
carrying out the plantations without expatriate technical assistance. As a result
ONAREF was able to plant some 500 ha annually.
5.11.       Procurement.  Equipment procurement was slow due to lengthy
Government procedures and a lack of strong administrative support from the Ministry
of Agriculture. Major purchases of firefighting equipment did not take place until 1989.
Procurement of some equipment did not include essential spais parts which are not
readily available locally. As a result some equipment, for instance some tractors, are
already non-operational for the lack of spares, although they are practically new.



5
6. Prwtoct Results
6.1.       The Project has not achieved its main objectives of expanding the
contribution of the forestry subsector to the national economy and enhancing the
capabilities of the responsible Government agencies to improve reforestation. The
afforestation achievements at Maroua fell far short of appraisal targets in spite of the
prolonged implementation period. Standing pines and eucalyptus planted in hum:d
savannahs, which would be suitable for fuelwood, building poles, transmission and
telephones poles, and utility saw logs, are not being cut for sale and replanting.
6.2.       As the Loan Committee review observed in October 1981, the Project
was not likely to be economically viable without the Edea pulpwood plantation
component. Since the planted areas have been small and not systematically exploited,
there has been little increase in employment opportunities and availability of fuelwood.
Overalb, however, the Project has enabled the country to produce planting stock and
conserve seeds, and to strengthen and improve DF operations to recover revenues
from taxes.
6.3        On the basis of the limited data corcerning physical implementation of
the Project ( Part Ill, Section 4) the benefits of the Project will be limited to some 500
ha of village woodlots near Maroua and 600 ha of remaining plantations near
Ngaoundere. Estimated output of wood from these plantings are estimated at about
16,000 m3 of poles and firewood over a 20 year project life, worth about $3.5 million.
Ironically, the delays in starting the Edea plantations and the decision not to proceed
after the destruction of the mill have resulted in major cost savings for the
Government, in what would have inevitably become a major long term drain on public
funds.
6.4         Economic Analysis. At appraisal, the economic rate of return was
calculated on thc. three productive components only: the Edea plantations, the
Ngaoundere plantations and the northern woodlots. The returns on each of these
components are discussed below:
-          Plantations at Edea. Since this component was abandoned before any
investments had been made to establish plantations using project funds,
a revised rate of return has therefore not been calculated.
-          Plantations at Naaoundere. At the beginning of 1990 the Government
proposed the establishment of ONADEF, a parastatai to replace the two
existing parastals: ONAREF, responsible for establishing the plantations
at Ngaoundere; and CENADEFOR (National Forestry Centre), responsible
for maintaining and harvesting them. If a Government parastatal
continues to maintain the plantations, the discounted present values of
the costs of plantation maintenance and harvesting would exceed the
discounted present value of revenues from timber sales for poles and
fire-wood. Using the figures available, the economic rate of return (ERR)
has been estimated at -2%. However, assuming that parastatal reform
continues under the Bank supported Structural Adjustment Program, the
remaining 600 ha of plantations should be turned over to the local
communities, who would provide maintenance at little economic cost,



6
since the opportunity cost of their labor would be negligible. Even so,
the heavy costs of plantation establishment by ONAREF and the loss by
fire of 900 ha from fire, out of the total 1,500 ha planted would result
in a modest ERR calculAted to be 5 percent, compared with an appraisal
estimate of 19 percent.
Woodlots in Maroua region. A rather similar situation exists for the
village woodlots as for the plantations. They were established at
considetable cost by ONAREF. Assuming that they are handed over to
the villagers, and that the labor required to carry out future maintenance
and harvesting is provided by the villagers, an ERR of 4 percent has
been estimated assuming that half of the wood output is used for poles
and the other half for fuelwood. The appraisal estimate for this
component was estimated at 19 percent.
6.5        Financial Analysis. Assuming that the plantations near Ngaoundere and
the village woodlots near Maroua are handed over to the local village communities at
little or no cost, they will be able to make a reasonable financial return, as well as
generate suffi-ent cash income to be able to purchase seeds and inputs for replanting.
If however t  Government insists on maintaining an expensive parastatal to maintain
the plantations, the costs of maintenance will result in continuing financial losses.
7. Prolect Sustainability
7.1. From a technical standpoint, the project management and staff showed that they
could establish plantations under difficult conditions. The sustainability of production
under the existing system, with ONADEF responsible for maintenance and harvesting,
will hinge on the extent of political support, the availability of continued funds for
operation, the maintenance and replacement of equipment, the retention of high quality
staff, and careful protection of the resource from fire, disease and encroachment. At
present the local forestry staff is continuing maintenance of some of the plantations
at Ngaound6r6. However, the machine park which was established under the project
suffers from poor maintenance and a shortage of spare parts due to the lack of funds
and is rapidly falling into disuse. Suitable standing pines and eucalyptus are not being
cut for sale and replanting. The question of plantation management, including selected
cutting, has not been addressed. Several plantations have needed at least a light
clearing for some time, which has not been done. This leads to a considerable loss of
production and could even result in a loss through fire of the entire investment. The
question needs to be resolved urgently by the responsible forestry authorities.
7.2        However, the economic and financial analysis confirms that the national
economy can not continue to sustain public sector parastatals involved in the types of
activities supported by the project. In retrospect, it can be said that the project
designers failed to grasp the importance of tree planting by the local populations, when
it concentrated on Government plantations. It is unfortunate that the opportunity of
supporting or encouraging tree planting by the private people was missed in a country
where this should be shoukdered by the private sector if it is to be sustainable in the
longer term.



7
7.3        The Project has clearly demonstrated that Cameroon cannot afford to
make further public sector investments in establishing plantations. The Bank should
not be involved further in assisting any such efforts. Moreover, the considerable
expenditures on training" staff of the forestry parastatals have resulted in few
measurable benefits, and the justification for the continuation of ONADEF should be
seriously questioned by the Bank within the context of the Structural Adjustment
Program, irrespective of whether further project finqncing is considered for the forestry
sector.
8. Bank's Performance
8.1        The Bank supervised the Project as the situation warranted. The
supervision missions appeared to be helpful in identifying the main problems facing the
project, in advising Project management on how to solve them, and in continuously
signalling to the Government (and the Bank) the difficulties faced by the Project and
the need to provide political and financial support. It is doubtful wheth3r the Project
would have achieved even its modest present level of results if the supervision
missions had not consistently attempted to identify and address the issues. The
supervision mission's recommendation to extend the Project provided an opportunity
to complete on-going components such as Mbalmayo and Ngaounddrd.
8.2        Spending much time and effort on the recruitment of consultants
wrongly implied that this was the most irnportant element of the project. The early
preparation of a plan for fire Protection would have been more appropriate given the
high forest fire risks in the area.
8.3        In retrospect, the following lessons may be learned from experience with
the Project:
(a)   Project management was the responsibility of numerous agencies
involved in the subsector such as the Ministry of Agriculture, and
its forestry agencies. These had partly overlapping work
programs and were not appropriately supported to be able to deal
with the added responsibilities created under the Project. The
planned periodic external evaluation of progress, as part of the
responsibilities of the strengthened headquarters staff, was never
carried out. The number of agencies involved in a project needs
to be kept to a minimum and progress should be monitored
closely throughout.
(b)   The project design hinged strongly on the Edea plantation
component. Already the Loan Committee review in October 1981
observed that the Project would not be economically viable
should CELLUCAM eventually not purchase the trees planted
under the proposed project. When the Edea component was
dropped, the Project became unbalanced, this might perhaps
have been - with the benefit of hindsight - an opportune time to
re-appraise the Project (instead of only re-design it) or close it
altogether.



8
(c)   The Project depended too strongly on the performance of the
technical assistance team which was responsible for plantation
establishment. Therefore project staff did not identify fully with
the objectives of the Project and its implementation. The
Government forestry officials need to be fully involved in project
design and execution.
(d)   Some of the technical assistance work was inappropriate, for
instance, trials and promotion of new technology was poorly
coordinated with programs of the Centre of Forest Research.
Research should be part of a specific programme and
responsibility for research should remain with the appropriate
agency. In any case the work could not be expected to have any
impact on this particular project because of the long time lag.
(e)   The risks of fire in the humid savannah plantations were not
adequately dealt with in project design and implementation,
although experience of protection of forest plantations was
available already at that time on sites further north in Cameroon.
Responsibility between the participating forestry agencies for
forest management and protection was not clearly defined. Also
the fire fighting equipment for the plantations was inadequate
and some arrived on site only after the forests had already
burned. The responsibility for planting and especially for
maintenance must be defined at the beginning of the project.
(f)  In spite of the problems faced by the Project, the working
relationships between the Borrower and the Bank were generally
good. However, although supervision missions visited Cameroon
twice a year, some senior forestry officials felt that more
frequent opportunities for i dialogue with the Bank staff on
subsectoral and project issues would have been useful.
(g)   The lessons learned from the Project are "expensive" in
comparison with the project cost and the meager results obtained
in the field. However, they might be even more expensive if they
are not taken into account in the design of other future projects
in the subsector. It might be useful to organize a
workshop/seminar of forestry officials, in order to review the
performance of this Project so that the lessons learned may be
incorporated into DF's strategy.
9. The Bonrower's Performance
9.1.       The Government has been favorable to the Project and the shortage of
funds experienced during project implementation should possibly not be construed as
a lack of Government support because of the general economic difficulties of the
country. Nevertheless, although dictated by economic difficulties, the fact remains that
the Government did not fulfill its commitment to provide adequate funds to complete
implementation on time, nor did it review project targets and objectives in line with



available resources. The Borrower made what use it could out of the consultants,
especially at Mbalmayo. DF operations have been strengthened. Full use is being made
of the new tax collection system.
10. Prolect RelationshiD
10.1.      In spite of the problems faced by the Project and despite the exchange
of strong notes, particularly concerning the technical assistance staff and the weak
management of the project in the early years, the working relationships between the
Borrower and the Bank were generally good. There was initially friction between the
Bank and the Government over the selection of the technical assistance firm. However,
this did not spoil the good relationship because both the project management and the
supervision missions recognized the need of making the project successful.
11. Consultna Services
11.1.      Internationally recruited technical assistance in line positions were a
heavy element of the plantation programme. The performance of the initial consultants
was so poor that their contract had to be terminated in October 1985. Their impact
was short-lived. The contribution of the different specialists in organizing the
Mbalmayo stockyard and seed conservation unit is recognized, as is the contribution
of the workshop manager at Garoua. However, the disorganized state of the vehicle
park at Ngaounddr6 and the non-availability of spares (because they were not
purchased) reflects a lack of planning and work discipline.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1.      In the early years, there was a deficiency in accounting procedures,
inaccuracies in withdrawal applications, and delays in reporting of project progress.
Auditing of accounts was consistently delayed. The accounts for 1988/89 are only
now being finalized and audited.
12.2.      Supervision reports were the most valuable resource of information for
the PCR. Several of the supervision missions also provided thorough reviews and
guidelines for use by project management. However, there is no full set of annual
reports available at Bank headquarters. At completion, the Borrower had not produced
a draft PCR. While information on loan disbursements was readily available, this was
not the case for data on total project costs. Part of the problem probably lies in the
fact that since the Project was implemented by different Government agencies it is
difficult to reconcile their individual accounts.
