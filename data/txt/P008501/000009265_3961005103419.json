primary objective of the Petroleum\n            Technical Assistance Project is to assist Kazakhstan to\n            strengthen the capacity of the key petroleum subsector\n            agencies to: 1) attract foreign investments into the\n            subsector; 2) promote the efficiency and long-term financial\n            viability of the petroleum industries; and 3) formulate\n            economically sound investment and organizational strategies\n            for the integration of domestic primary petroleum\n            production, processing, transport, and distribution. The\n            project consists of two components: Institutional\n            Development, and Project Preparation and Implementation\n            Support. The first, has three subcomponents:  1) supporting\n            the creation of an effective framework for promoting foreign\n            investments in the petroleum subsector by assisting in\n            finalizing a petroleum law and formulating a tax code,\n            appraising potential investment projects, and structuring\n            and negotiating transactions with prospective investors, and\n            training local staff;   2) assisting the implementation of a\n            program corporatizing and restructuring the petroleum\n            industry, and preparing the basis for increased private\n            sector participation; and  3) assisting in identifying and\n            addressing priority management training needs, and preparing\n            and administering training in market-oriented petroleum\n            industry operational and commercial practices. The second\n            component also has three subcomponents:  1) planned studies\n            reviewing the economic feasibility of constructing new\n            product pipelines and a crude oil pipeline connecting\n            oilfields in the west with the two refineries in the east;\n            2) assisting the assessment of regional and domestic market\n            potential for natural gas, and the supply and investment\n            options for participating in meeting the demand; and  3)\n            providing advisory and consultant services to manage the\n            day-to-day project's implementation."}, "docdt": "1994-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
