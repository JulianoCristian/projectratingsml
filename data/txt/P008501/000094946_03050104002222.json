and sustainability of the anticipated benefits\n            is likely. The project had a substantial impact on\n            institutional development. World Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, while Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Experience with this project suggests the following lessons:\n            1) Financing the continuing work of contract advisors who\n            are already advising the government is a questionable\n            practice, since it makes it extremely difficult for the Bank\n            to fulfill its quality control function. Bank funding should\n            primarily support activities when the Bank can contribute to\n            the success of these activities, if in no other way than by\n            reviewing the reports and recommendations of the consultant.\n            2) The contracts that were negotiated with legal advice from\n            advisors financed by the Bank remain confidential documents.\n            The Bank should make every effort to get governments to\n            agree to make public the basic financial elements of\n            agreements and contracts that are negotiated with foreign\n            companies. Public review of such contracts is the best way\n            to establish transparency and accountability in dealing with\n            the exploitation of national resources such as oil. In\n            particular, the Bank should only provide technical\n            assistance for the negotiating of contracts that are\n            intended to become part of the public domain (at least in\n            their broad terms)."}, "docdt": "2003-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
