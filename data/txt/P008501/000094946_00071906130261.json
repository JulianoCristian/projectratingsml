sustainability is high, and the institutional\n            development impact is substantial. The lessons address,\n            first, the reasons why the project performed successfully:\n            The degree of staff continuity was critical, not only\n            experience wise, but in that it retained as well, the\n            project's institutional memory. Furthermore, it\n            strengthened the borrower's ownership of project\n            activities, which emphasized the responsibility needed to\n            manage the implementation, and operation of the project.\n            These activities, if conducted under clear sponsorship,\n            minimize the risks of unnecessary, or unsustainable work,\n            easing implementation. Secondly, those areas where\n            improvement could be made: Regardless of how minimal it may\n            appear, administrative efficiency is critical in keeping\n            financial obligations against the state budget in track, and\n            avoiding inefficiencies, which could be later magnified as\n            overall delay factors in the implementation process. In\n            addition, implementation was hindered by poor coordination,\n            which affected its pace, and project deliverables. A\n            proactive, and responsive Bank support is not only needed\n            from Headquarters, but from the field office as well, which\n            require the full capacity of local staff. However, the\n            apparent lack of knowledge, and inexperience of local staff\n            about the Bank, precluded covering the full scope of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
