REHABILITATION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This three-volume report constitutes an\n            environmental assessment of the Transport Rehabilitation\n            Project (TRP) for Sierra Leone to ensure that the project\n            meets World Bank environmental standards.  The possible\n            environmental impacts are assessed in general terms in\n            preparation for incorporation of remedial actions in the\n            further planning and design of project activities. This\n            assessment examines the environmental effects of the\n            transport rehabilitation project in the following areas: (a)\n            land use; (b) atmosphere; (c) socio-economy; (d) utilities;\n            and (e) general.  The following operational approach is\n            recommended for this mission:  (1) that possible\n            environmental impacts be described and assessed in\n            preparation for incorporation of remedial actions in the\n            further planning and design of project activities; (2) that\n            special emphasis be laid on road rehabilitation and\n            maintenance; (3) that significant impacts be compared to the\n            consequences of not implementing the project activities; (4)\n            that special attention be drawn to institutional\n            strengthening aspects as these constitute the fundamental\n            potential to improve upon environmental awareness and\n            concerns within the transport sector in Sierra Leone; and\n            (5) that a plan to mitigate the adverse effects of the TRP\n            be prepared based on the findings.  The mitigation plan is\n            outlined in this report and recommends legal measures\n            including the preparation of: (i) environmental guidelines\n            regarding road rehabilitation and maintenance works; (ii)\n            proper standards for emission factors and noise from\n            vehicles; (iii) fuel quality criteria; (iv) a program for\n            vehicle emission control and fuel quality control; (v)\n            proper operational procedures and occupational health and\n            safety procedures in connection with road works, vehicle\n            examination centers, port and airport operation; (vi)\n            adequate guidelines and emergency response action plans\n            regarding rehabilitation of Freetown Port and the\n            improvement of inland navigation facilities in Sierra Leone.\n            This report also recommends training, technical, and\n            institutional strengthening measures to improve upon the\n            environmental protection capability within the transport\n            sector in Sierra Leone, and emphasizes the importance of an\n            implementation schedule in the success of all proposed measures."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
