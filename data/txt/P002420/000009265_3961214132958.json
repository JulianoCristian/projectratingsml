support the\n            implementation of the new transport sector policy and\n            strategy; 2) expand the successful home-grown process of\n            institutional reform and strengthening; and 3) increase the\n            use of labor-intensive methods in road works and road\n            maintenance. The specific project aims are: 1)\n            sector/investment planning; 2) private participation; 3)\n            regulatory capacity (management of road transport and\n            alleviation of urban traffic congestion); 4) maritime\n            transport; and 5) civil aviation safety. The project will\n            consist of three main components: 1) capacity building; 2)\n            parastatal restructuring and privatization; and 3) investment."}, "docdt": "1996-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
