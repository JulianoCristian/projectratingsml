;irpcr:  runway   1:ave negative and positive  impacts on  the
e-.v,.-rr-=.er.  4ur-Ing  and  after  the  completion  of  construction
activities.    These impacts  have  therefore  been  identified  and
assessed in order to present guidelines for incorporation into the
specifications for construction activities.
The projects overall strategy is geared towards utilisation of the
existing facilities as best as possbile which at the same time
minimise on the environmental costs inherent in it implementation.
A deliberate attempt to harmonise construction activities within
the socio-cultural milieu will be pursued.
A  ccmprehensive  environmental  statement  which  identifies  the
expected crOblems that wilL impact on the environment as a result
of the ProiecL lm-lementation and the proposed actions to alleviate
tn^em are presenced in this ection of the Report.
O-e  can  identify  the  significant  environmental  impacts  as  the

The land available on the northern side of the runway is
mainly bush a srall cart of which  is used b7 local
people Cor fariming.  Extensive farming of grau.ndnuts and
v-egetable  on  the  southern  side  is  also  evident.

constrcc.ticn.
The  specification  for  construction  activities  will
include Clauses to call for flattening of all hills,
grading and landscaping of disturbed areas to eliminate
scars left by excavation and to restore greenery to the
adjacent bushes. All disposal pits will be required to
be filled with a thick layer of top soil and grassed.
7.3       ATMOSPrMRIC
The bituminous overlay work for the fiexible pavement
secticn  will  impact  negatively on  the  environment.
;t _mospheric pollution arising from truck movements,
mixing plant emissions, dust and noise are all likely
contributing  fpctors.    The  effect of  these  wiLl  be
limited to the construction period.
Consequ.ently, guidelines will be provided to keep dust
and  noise  within  tolerable  limits  and  particular
attention will be given to the siting of contractor's
plant far away from the terminal building.  Contractors
will also be encouraged to consider other alternatives
such as. either locating mixing plants outside the
airport boundary in less populated areas adjacent to the
airport,  or hauling  pre-mix biutmi-nous  material  frcm
available  mixing  planzs  in  Freetown  using  specially
-                      heated dump trucks.

Ititis also expected that social and cutlurral traditions
S. lFin: the area wilL sL;fer some.dilution due to increased
interaction between the various- existing ethnic groups,
and the influx of people migrating to the area to take
advantage of the increase inv economic activity.   Life
styles will alter, as fast traffic to and from the
airport  will  impose  constraints  on  the  villagers'
freedom  to  use  adjacent  roadway  areas  for  certain
activities for which they are now accustomed to e.g.
subsistence roadside farming within the right of way of
the road.

7.6.2   .     Safety - Const;uction work on the runway which may
not be completely closed will be an extremely tricky
exercise in terms of safety.  It is proposed that
constant radio communication between the air traffic

ground  must   also   be   requested   to   put  on
reflectorized  jackets  especialLy  if  working -at
