After considering various schemes, the\n            consultants have recommended the proposed project as the\n            least-cost solution to the urgent problem at Lobatse and the\n            longer-term improvement of the water supply system in both\n            towns. A raw water pumping station and treatment plant would\n            be built at Gaborone to serve both Gaborone and Lobatse. A\n            32-mile pipeline would be built from Gaborone to Nuane,\n            where the water will be pumped into the existing\n            transmission line to the Lobatse distribution system. Main\n            extensions and reservoirs would be constructed in Gaborone\n            and Lobatse. The project would include office and laboratory\n            equipment and equipment for pipe laying, metering and\n            testing, vehicles and laborers' housing. Technical\n            assistance would be provided under the project to establish\n            an appropriate accounting and budgeting system."}, "docdt": "1971-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
